AB The Atlantic and Amazon rainforests have a shared but unclear past, with intermittent connections resulting from historical climate change. We investigate these connections by studying the phylogeography and climatic niche of the disjunct distributed frog Lithobates palmipes. We sequenced two fragments of mitochondrial DNA from Atlantic Forest (AtF) and Amazonia (AmF) individuals and evaluated how genetic diversity is distributed in space and whether past demographic changes occurred. Also, we evaluated the existence of past suitable connections between biomes for L. palmipes through ecological niche models (ENM) and tested for niche divergence. The AtF group is nested within the AmF group and closely related to individuals from eastern Amazonia, a pattern recovered in many species that used northeast connection routes. We found evidence of recurrent use of connections in different directions and time during the Pleistocene, resulting in genetic structure between biomes, with no signal of demographic change and evidence of niche divergence across both genetic groups. ENMs indicated suitable areas connecting forests throughout northeastern Brazil during the Pleistocene. Mitochondrial lineages do not match biomes exactly. One lineage is composed of AtF populations and eastern Amazonia individuals. The other is composed of western Amazonia individuals, suggesting an effect of past climatic heterogeneity within the Amazonia forest. This is the first evidence that this route drove genetic and ecological diversity for amphibians recently, a group with habits and ecological requirements different from other vertebrates that have been shown to use this putative corridor.

AB Schizophrenia patients are known to have deficits in contextual vision. However, results are often very mixed. In some paradigms, patients do not take the context into account and, hence, perform more veridically than healthy controls. In other paradigms, context deteriorates performance much more strongly in patients compared to healthy controls. These mixed results may be explained by differences in the paradigms as well as by small or biased samples, given the large heterogeneity of patients' deficits. Here, we show that mixed results may also come from idiosyncrasies of the stimuli used because in variants of the same visual paradigm, tested with the same participants, we found intact and deficient processing.

AB Key message The core populations of the European white elm (Ulmus laevis Pall.) located in Poland maintained slightly higher level of genetic diversity compared to the peripheral populations of this species. Context The most severe threat to elms is the loss of natural habitat under the pressures of agriculture and forestry as well as urbanization. The reductions in European white elm populations as well as populations of other elm species have also been caused by Dutch elm disease (DED). Previous studies have indicated a low level of genetic variation in Ulmus leavis Pall. However, in Poland, the genetic resources and demographic history of U. laevis populations remain poorly documented. Aims The genetic resources of U. laevis in Poland were identified and characterized. Additionally, tests were performed to identify potential bottleneck signatures and effective population sizes of the examined populations. Methods Polymorphism was analyzed using a set of six nuclear microsatellite markers (nSSRs) for 1672 individuals from 41 populations throughout the species range in Poland. Results (1) A moderate level of genetic variation was found. (2) A low genetic differentiation and lack of population structuring were identified. (3) Evidence of reduction in population size was found as a consequence of severe, past bottlenecks. Conclusion The loss of genetic diversity of U. laevis probably occurred in their refugia or shortly after the postglacial recolonization. This loss may have been affected by past DED pandemics similar to those seen at present.

AB World-wide, forests are experiencing drought-induced mortality. However, physiological adaptation to drought is highly variable, which may lead to differential mortality patterns and alter community structure. In this study, saplings of four common tree species (Ormosia pinnata, Dalbergia odorifera, Castanopsis fissa and Michelia macclurei) grown in subtropical plantations in southern China were subjected to average rainfall and three drought treatments, consisting of low (25% rainfall reduction), moderate (50% rainfall reduction) and high (75% rainfall reduction) drought. To investigate their drought response strategies and select tree species with higher drought tolerance, we examined plant traits, including tree growth, stomatal regulation, water relations, carbon dynamics and morphology, that might contribute to drought tolerance. We found that O. pinnata adapted to drought by decreasing turgor loss point (TLP) and increasing leaf dry matter content and leaf mass per area (LMA). D. odorifera exhibited low leaf minimum conductance and high LMA as the key drought traits to reduce water loss. C. fissa was slowest to initiate stomatal closure but completed stomatal closure more rapidly than the other species. Drought reduced light-saturated photosynthetic rates (A(sat)) for O. pinnata, D. odorifera and C. fissa primarily due to declining stomatal conductance (g(s)), with lesser limitations due to the biochemical capacity of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron transport (J(max)). M. macclurei was the first species to close stomata. Drought did not affect A(sat) for M. macclurei due to stable photosynthetic biochemical processes; however, V-cmax regulation of A(sat) increased with drought intensity. There was trait variation in the capacity of study trees to tolerate drought, with M. macclurei exhibiting the highest capacity to tolerate drought due to key stomatal (earlier stomatal closure) and hydraulic (lower TLP) traits reducing plant water loss with progressive drought stress.

AB Information about species diversity, integration of local data, and the dynamics of regional diversity is essential for understanding the mechanisms that maintain diversity in biological communities, especially in aquatic environments, which have extensive connectivity. Here, we used phytoplankton community data from two subtropical reservoirs and evaluated the site contributions to phytoplankton beta diversity. We partitioned beta diversity into two mechanisms, replacement and differences in species richness and abundance, and we related to environmental heterogeneity. We tested whether there is a predominance of replacement or differences in richness and abundance in beta diversity, and whether environmental heterogeneity predicts beta diversity and its components. Our results indicated the temporal and spatial variation of the environmental conditions of the reservoirs. The species replacement was prevalent in lentic sites, while differences in richness and abundance contributed to lotic sites. Dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus, euphotic zone light availability, orthophosphate, water flow, and total dissolved solids were predictors of beta diversity and its components. Thus, studies that consider the local and regional variability of species in the function of environmental heterogeneity are essential in understanding ecological determinants and should be considered for the conservation of aquatic biodiversity and the maintenance of ecosystem services in reservoirs.

AB This research investigated the effects of impermeable pavements, permeable pavers, and permeable concrete on growth, physiology, and ecosystem services provisioning of established Celtis australis and Fraxinus ornus plants over a 5-year-period. In March 2012, 48 trees were planted into 1 m(2) planting pits according to a randomized block design with 6 blocks, and randomly assigned to one of the four treatments: 1) impermeable pavement; 2) permeable pavers; 3) permeable concrete; 4) bare soil as unpaved control. Trees were fully established in December 2015, when this experiment begun. Above-ground tree growth, below-ground growth, tree physiology, soil physical and chemical traits, and root conflicts with pavements were monitored until December 2020. Pavements did not affect soil chemical traits, but impermeable pavements reduced soil moisture, compared to other treatments, with larger differences observed in winter and spring than in summer and fall. No evidence was found that pavements promoted drought stress in established trees, nor pavements depressed above-ground growth, although root morphology was influenced by pavements, likely due to elevated soil CO2 beneath pavements with lower gas diffusivity. CO2 assimilation, carbon storage, and cooling by transpiration 9 years after planting were not affected by pavements, but Celtis provided far more ecosystem services than Fraxinus. Permeable concrete was effective in mitigating the urban heat island effect by promoting higher evaporation than both impermeable and permeable pavers, but their durability should be improved before large-scale use can be recommended.

A previous study using an F2 population (F2OA) derived from a cross between wild moth-bean (Vigna aconitifolia [Jacq.] Mare & PRIME;chal) accession TN67 (resistant) and cultivated moth-bean accession ICPMO056 (susceptible) revealed that resistance to the azuki bean weevil (Callosobruchus chinensis L.) in TN67 was regulated by a single gene located in the major quantitative trait locus-qVacBrc2.1. In this study, qVacBrc2.1 was finely mapped and candidate genes in this locus were identified using F2OA and another large F2 population (F2NB) derived from the cross mentioned previously. In contrast to the previous study, segregation analysis in the F2NB population revealed that resistance against this pest was controlled by two genes. Furthermore, the addition of novel markers to qVacBrc2.1 and reanalysis of the QTL in the F2OA population demonstrated that qVacBrc2.1 constituted two linked QTLs-qVacBrc2.1-A and qVacBrc2.1-B. The presence of qVacBrc2.1-B was verified using the population F2NB. Comparative genomics using three Vigna spp. strongly suggested the presence of two tandemly duplicated genes, VacPGIP1 and VacPGIP2, which encoded polygalacturonase inhibitors (polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins) as the candidates for conferring resistance, but only VacPGIP1 could be successfully cloned and sequenced. The alignment of VacPGIP1 coding sequences of TN67 and ICPMO056 revealed eight single nucleotide poly-morphisms, three of which altered the amino-acid sequence of the predicted domains of polygalacturonase in-hibitors in ICPMO056. Overall, these findings indicate that VacPGIP1 and VacPGIP2 regulated C. chinensis resistance in TN67.

AB Biological invasion is one of the main causes of biodiversity losses throughout the world. Dry areas are particularly prone to such losses due to their highly adapted flora and pronounced difficulty recovering after deforestation. Calotropis procera (Apocynaceae) has been recognized as an invasive alien species (IAS) in South America, forming vast clusters in disturbed areas or coastal sandy areas. The presence of IASs is expected to be influenced by climate changes, in this regard, we aimed to investigate the effects of climate change on the distribution of this species under the present conditions and under two different future scenarios. The presence of C. procera was positively correlated with the dry environments in South America, such as the Seasonal Dry Forests in all scenarios. In turn, high suitabilities were also found for coastal dunes and Restinga vegetation. The area of invasion is reduced for future conditions models, however the suitability clearly increases. The presence of C. procera as an IAS might be considered a threat for conservation in disturbed or deforested areas, with particular attention to open sandy areas, where this species is an efficient competitor.

AB The uncanny valley hypothesis describes how increased human-likeness of artificial entities, ironically, could elicit a surge of negative reactions from people. Much research has studied the uncanny valley hypothesis, but little research has sought to examine people's reactions to a broad range of human-likeness manifested in real-world robots. We focused on examining people's emotional responses to real-world, as opposed to hypothetical, robots because these robots impact real-life human-robot interactions. We measured both positive and negative emotional responses to a large collection of full-body images of robots (N = 251) with various human-like features. We found evidence for the existence of not one, but two uncanny valleys. Mori's uncanny valley emerged for high human-like robots and a second uncanny valley emerged for moderately low human-like robots. We attributed these valleys to unique combinations of perceptual mismatches between human-like features, specified by a match between surface and facial feature dimensions accompanied by a mismatch with the body-manipulator dimension. We also found that patterns of the uncanny valleys differed between positive (shin-wakan) and negative (bukimi) emotional responses. Lastly, the word uncanny appeared to be an unreliable measure of the uncanny valley. Implications for robot design and the uncanny valley research are discussed.

AB Change-level defect prediction is widely referred to as just-in-time (JIT) defect prediction since it identifies a defect-inducing change at the check-in time, and researchers have proposed many approaches based on the language-independent change-level features. These approaches can be divided into two types: supervised approaches and unsupervised approaches, and their effectiveness has been verified on Java or C++ projects. However, whether the language-independent change-level features can effectively identify the defects of JavaScript projects is still unknown. Additionally, many researches have confirmed that supervised approaches outperform unsupervised approaches on Java or C++ projects when considering inspection effort. However, whether supervised JIT defect prediction approaches can still perform best on JavaScript projects is still unknown. Lastly, prior proposed change-level features are programming languageindependent, whether programming language-specific change-level features can further improve the performance of JIT approaches on identifying defect-prone changes is also unknown.
   To address the aforementioned gap in knowledge, in this article, we collect and label the top-20 most starred JavaScript projects on GitHub. JavaScript is an extremely popular and widely used programming language in the industry. We propose five JavaScript-specific change-level features and conduct a large-scale empirical study (i.e., involving a total of 176,902 changes) and find that (1) supervised JIT defect prediction approaches (i.e., CBS+) still statistically significantly outperform unsupervised approaches on JavaScript projects when considering inspection effort; (2) JavaScript-specific change-level features can further improve the performance of approach built with language-independent features on identifying defect-prone changes; (3) the change-level features in the dimension of size (i.e., LT), diffusion (i.e., NF), and JavaScript-specific (i.e., SO and TC) are the most important features for indicating the defect-proneness of a change on JavaScript projects; and (4) project-related features (i.e., Stars, Branches, Def Ratio, Changes, Files, Defective, and Forks) have a high association with the probability of a change to be a defect-prone one on JavaScript projects.

AB Animal communication, including the transmission of risk-related information, has long been recognized as occurring in a network, rather than being limited to signaller-receiver dyadic interactions. However, it is rare for studies on communication to explicitly incorporate a network approach and for network studies to focus on communication interactions and information transmission in nongrouping species. Consequently, the properties of communication networks and the extent to which risk-related infor-mation can spread through populations of territorial animals remain largely unexplored. Here, I exam-ined the structure and spatial extent of eavesdropping networks by studying alarm calls in wood warblers, Phylloscopus sibilatrix, small, territorial songbirds inhabiting temperate European forests. Using a playback experiment, I first established the active space of wood warblers' alarm signals, that is, how the strength of antipredator responses to conspecific alarm calls varies as a function of distance between signallers and receivers. Next, I combined social network analysis and fine-scale, long-term data on wood warblers' territory distribution to delineate spatially explicit alarm call eavesdropping networks and to explore the potential for risk-related information transmission at the population level. Response strength of wood warblers to conspecific calls decreased with increasing distance to callers, suggesting distance -dependent eavesdropping. However, each year the majority of individuals occupied territories within the active space of alarm signals of multiple neighbours and could reach information from even more of them via indirect links. Moreover, the patterns of connections between individuals were generally similar across years, suggesting that basic network properties remain stable over time. This study shows that during the spring breeding season, individual birds are interlinked with conspecifics across territory borders into population-wide information webs, in which risk-related information can readily spread across large spatial scales. In turn, this highlights the social environment as an important dimension of individuals' niches even in otherwise territorial animals.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The relationship between biomass components and carbon retention or loss in biochars is unclear. In this study, four characteristic feedstocks were pyrolyzed into biochar, and the conversion and stability of carbon in biochar were studied in detail. Thirteen kinds of ion fragments were detected by thermogravimetry -mass spectrometry (TG-MS), among which H2O, CO2 and CO were the main gas products. In addition, the presence of lignin slowed that the pyrolysis of biomass and produced more CO, which eventually led to more aromatic biochar. The carbon retention of lignin, cellulose and xylan during pyrolysis was 78.7 %, 41.7 % and 40.2 %, respectively. Carbon retention calculations showed that lignin was a major contributor to the formation of biochar (40.1-53.2 %). In the K2Cr2O7 oxidation experiment, the carbon stability of sunflower and cotton stalk char was relatively poor, which was consistent with the results of thermal stability. Spectral characterization analysis showed that biomass with low lignin content generated more unstable carbon during pyrolysis, which was more likely to be lost or converted in an oxidized environment. These findings are meaningful for guiding in biochars preparation and avoiding their environmental risks.

AB Estimating N2O emissions from the agricultural sector and developing effective reduction strategies are essential to achieving the Paris Agreement 2 degrees C target. Based on 3705 observations from 435 articles, we demonstrated that the response of N2O emissions was more sensitive to N inputs on acidic soils than alkaline soils and that climatic factors influence this difference. Total global N2O emissions from tea plantations in the 2010s were estimated to be 46.5 Gg N yr(-1) using an exponential model developed herein. Tea plantations are a significant contributor to N2O emissions from the agricultural sector in several countries. The intensity of yield-scale GHG emissions from tea was significantly higher than in other upland cereals. Applying climate-smart practices in Chinese tea plantations could reduce emissions equivalent to one-third of the global total. We conclude that accurate identification of N2O emission hotspots and implementation of targeted measures are essential to achieving global temperature control targets.

AB Given the decline of natural fish abundance and diversity, a ban on pen-culture and fishing has been imposed on floodplain lakes along the Yangtze River. In order to examine the recovery efficiency of fish faunas, we compared the changes in multidimensional (alpha and beta) diversity in the Shengjin Lake between pen-culture stage (PS) and recovery stage (RS). Our results demonstrated significant variations in fish community composition, with distinct populational restoration in wild species of high trophic level and river-lake migratory species. The higher abundance of wild and migratory species in RS implied the enhanced dispersal and exchange process of fish individuals with the elimination of net pens. Despite significant variations of community composition, the alpha and beta diversity indices exhibited non-significant change between PS and RS. However, our study still revealed the recovery of natural seasonal community dynamics, since there were significant variations of both alpha and beta di-versity between high-water (HW) and low-water (LW) seasons in RS. The significant higher alpha diversity (S, d, H & PRIME;) in HW indicated flooding induced fish supplements in floodplain lakes, due to the well-developed breeding sites, nurseries and refuges provided by floodplain lakes. Meanwhile, the significant lower beta SOR and beta SIM in HW implied the homogenized communities during flooding seasons, which can be ascribed to better hydrological connec-tivity of various habitats and more even distribution of fish faunas triggered by flood pulses. The reappearance of natural seasonal variations in multidimensional (alpha and beta) diversity indicate the initial recovery of fish faunas. There is a pressing need for prolonged surveillance to explore the recovery mechanism of fish assemblage. Meanwhile, our results also highlight the importance of conserving the lacustrine connectivity and seasonal flooding for the recovery of fishery resources in the floodplain lakes.

AB Gestures play an essential role in primate communication. However, little is known about how complexity of gestural use (in terms of repertoire size, intentional use, flexibility and use of gestural sequences) relates to individual and dyadic measures of sociality and whether more complex gestural use is more effective in eliciting a response. We observed 19 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 16 Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) and 18 siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus) to assess the complexity and effectiveness of their gestural use. We found that, beyond interspecies variation, the number of gesture types used in a dyad was higher when individuals had stronger social bonds; the probability of accounting for others' attention increased with age, especially for visual gestures; and sequences were more likely used by younger or socially less integrated individuals. In terms of effectiveness, older individuals and those using fewer sequences were more likely to be responded to, while across dyads, the probability of obtaining a response was higher when both individuals accounted for the other's attention and when they used fewer sequences. Overall, this confirms the link between sociality and complex gestural use and suggests that more complex forms of communication, at least in terms of intentional use, may be more effective at achieving communicative goals.This article is part of the theme issue 'Cognition, communication and social bonds in primates'.

AB Statistical learning (SL) is assumed to lead to long-term memory representations. However, the way that those representations influence future learning remains largely unknown. We studied how children's existing distributional linguistic knowledge influences their subsequent SL on a serial recall task, in which 49 German-speaking seven- to nine-year-old children repeated a series of six-syllable sequences. These contained either (i) bisyllabic words based on frequently occurring German syllable transitions (naturalistic sequences), (ii) bisyllabic words created from unattested syllable transitions (non-naturalistic sequences), or (iii) random syllable combinations (unstructured foils). Children demonstrated learning from naturalistic sequences from the beginning of the experiment, indicating that their implicit memory traces derived from their input language informed learning from the very early stages onward. Exploratory analyses indicated that children with a higher language proficiency were more accurate in repeating the sequences and improved most throughout the study compared to children with lower proficiency.

AB Diverse geographic, environmental, and ecological factors affect gene flow and adaptive genomic variation within species. With recent advances in landscape ecological modelling and high-throughput DNA sequencing, it is now possible to effectively quantify and partition their relative contributions. Here, we use landscape genomics to identify determinants of genomic differentiation in the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria, a widespread and irruptive pest of numerous deciduous tree species in North America. We collected larvae from multiple populations across Eastern Canada, where the species experiences a diversity of environmental gradients and feeds on a number of different host tree species, including trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red oak (Quercus rubra), and white birch (Betula papyrifera). Using a combination of reciprocal causal modelling (RCM) and distance-based redundancy analyses (dbRDA), we show that differentiation of thousands of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among individuals is best explained by a combination of isolation by distance, isolation by environment (spatial variation in summer temperatures and length of the growing season), and differences in host association. Configuration of suitable habitat inferred from ecological niche models was not significantly related to genomic differentiation, suggesting that M. disstria dispersal is agnostic with respect to habitat quality. Although population structure was not discretely related to host association, our modelling framework provides the first molecular evidence of host-associated differentiation in M. disstria, congruent with previous documentation of reduced growth and survival of larvae moved between natal host species. We conclude that ecologically mediated selection is contributing to variation within M. disstria, and that divergent adaptation related to both environmental conditions and host association should be considered in ongoing research and management of this important forest pest.

AB Size-structured differences in resource use stabilize species coexistence in animal communities, but what behavioral mechanisms underpin these niche differences? Behavior is constrained by morphological and physiological traits that scale allometrically with body size, yet the degree to which behaviors exhibit allometric scaling remains unclear; empirical datasets often encompass broad variation in environmental context and phylogenetic history, which complicates the detection and interpretation of scaling relationships between size and behavior. We studied the movement and foraging behaviors of three sympatric, congeneric spiral-horned antelope species (Tragelaphus spp.) that differ in body mass-bushbuck (26-40 kg), nyala (57-83 kg), and kudu (80-142 kg)-in an African savanna ecosystem where (i) food was patchily distributed due to ecosystem engineering by fungus-farming termites and (ii) predation risk was low due to the extirpation of several large carnivores. Because foraging behavior is directly linked to traits that scale allometrically with size (e.g., metabolic rate, locomotion), we hypothesized that habitat use and diet selection would likewise exhibit nonlinear scaling relationships. All three antelope species selected habitat near termitaria, which are hotspots of abundant, high-quality forage. Experimental removal of forage from termite mounds sharply reduced use of those mounds by bushbuck, confirming that habitat selection was resource driven. Strength of selection for termite mounds scaled negatively and nonlinearly with body mass, as did recursion (frequency with which individuals revisited locations), whereas home-range area and mean step length scaled positively and nonlinearly with body mass. All species disproportionately ate mound-associated plant taxa; nonetheless, forage selectivity and dietary composition, richness, and quality all differed among species, reflecting the partitioning of shared food resources. Dietary protein exhibited the theoretically predicted negative allometric relationship with body mass, whereas digestible-energy content scaled positively. Our results demonstrate cryptic size-based separation along spatial and dietary niche axes-despite superficial similarities among species-consistent with the idea that body-size differentiation is driven by selection for divergent resource-acquisition strategies, which in turn underpin coexistence. Foraging and space-use behaviors were nonlinearly related to body mass, supporting the hypothesis that behavior scales allometrically with size. However, explaining the variable functional forms of these relationships is a challenge for future research.

AB Purpose The multiple climate tipping points potential (MCTP) is a novel metric in life-cycle assessment (LCA). It addresses the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions to disturb those processes in the Earth system, which could pass a tipping point and thereby trigger large, abrupt and potentially irreversible changes. The MCTP, however, does not represent ecosystems damage. Here, we further develop this midpoint metric by linking it to losses of terrestrial species biodiversity at either local or global scales. Method A mathematical framework was developed to translate midpoint impacts to temperature increase, first, and then to potential loss of species resulting from the temperature increase, using available data on the potentially disappeared fraction of species due to a unit change in global average temperature. Results and discussion The resulting damage MCTP expresses the impacts on ecosystems quality in terms of potential loss of terrestrial species resulting from the contribution of GHG emissions to cross climatic tipping points. The MCTP values range from 2.3 center dot 10(-17) to 1.1 center dot 10(-15) PDF (potentially disappeared fraction of species) for the global scale and from 2.7 center dot 10(-17) to 1.1 center dot 10(-15) PDF per 1 kg of CO2 emitted for the local scale. They are time-dependent, and the largest values are found for emissions occurring between 2030 and 2045, generally declining for emissions occurring toward the end of the century. Conclusions The developed metric complements existing damage-level metrics used in LCA, and its application is expected to be especially relevant for products where time-differentiation of emissions is possible. To enable direct comparisons between our damage MCTP and the damage caused by other environmental impacts or other climate-related impact categories, further efforts are needed to harmonize MCTP units with those of the compared damage metrics.

AB The associations of social individuals are normally represented by a social network, which is a static representation of dynamic relationships, generally influenced by spatio-temporal, demographic, environmental and kinship drivers. We examined the social structure of core resident short-finned pilot whales off Madeira, an archipelago in the Northeast Atlantic, delineating their spatial overlapping, temporal evolution, demographic process and site fidelity, between two sub-periods (1997-2013 and 2014-2019). Decades of individual photo-identification work showed that social clusters were formed by preferred companions. The results indicate that this short-finned pilot whale community consists of social clusters, with most individuals showing long-term stability of cluster membership. However, clusters can be also subject to dynamic changes, and sometime split up into two which may be due to an increase in the number of individuals in the original cluster and, consequently, challenges to maintaining associations among individuals in large groups. In general, the probability of associations among core resident individuals within a cluster decreased with time (decreased by half in 18-54 years), which was related to demographic events. All clusters showed highly overlapping distribution areas, suggesting that their social structure is not driven by spatial factors but likely social preferences.

AB Purpose The degree of species' isohydry determined by the stringency degree of stomatal regulation is commonly used to classify species' drought response strategies. The aim of our study is to determine the linkages of plant functional traits and their variations to species' degree of isohydry in subtropical regions with high heterogeneity.
   Methods In subtropical plantations with high heterogeneity, 13 woody species were selected and determined for 23 above- and below-ground functional traits both in the pure soil (rich) and soil-rock mixed (poor) patches.
   Results The less isohydric species tend to allocate more to leaves, stems and roots construction than the more isohydric species to resist droughts, while the more isohydric species were more efficient in accessing resources. Consistently, the less isohydric species adapt to the environmental change by altering the traits relating to nutrient absorption efficiency (e.g. changing their leaf C/N, first-order root diameter, and root branching intensity), while the more isohydric species tend to change their drought resistance ability (e.g. changing their wood density and leaf water potential at the turgor loss point). Moreover, the more isohydric species decreased the relative growth rate (RGR), while the less isohydric species increased the RGR when their growth conditions changing from rich patches to poor patches.
   Conclusions Our results showed that the degree of species' isohydry results from complex coordination and integration of a series of traits at the whole-plant level, and highlighted the importance of intraspecific variation in traits in determining species' degree of isohydry in subtropical regions with high heterogeneity.

AB Pyrolysis is a thermo-chemical decomposition process that converts organic or inorganic materials into solid, liquid and gaseous products. The pyrolysis process involves multiple complex chemical reactions, and the derived products are highly dependent on the pyrolysis operating parameters and type of feedstock. In the present review, progress on the state-of-the-art pyrolysis technology, feedstock and properties of the end products are thoroughly reviewed. The potential application of the pyrolysis products in the industries is discussed: solid leftover can be upgraded and used as a bio-adsorbant, soil amendment, fertilizer or solid fuel; pyrolysis liquid can be used as a bio-chemical source or upgraded into liquid fuel; gaseous products can be used as recirculating gas for the pyrolysis environment or burnt as fuel for heat and power generation. Despite the potential of pyrolysis in processing agricultural or industrial wastes, studies regarding the economic feasibility and environment sustainability of scaled-up pyrolysis plant are scarce. A comprehensive overview on the type of pyrolysis reactor technology, potential feedstock and the properties of the derived products is presented. Further, the sustainability of the technology is assessed from the aspects of energy balance, environment and economics. In spite of the potential benefits to the environment and recovery of valuable products, there are several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the sustainability and commercialibility of the pyrolysis technologies.

AB Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to increase leaf CO(2)assimilation rates, thus promoting plant growth and increasing leaf area. It also decreases stomatal conductance, allowing water savings, which have been hypothesized to drive large-scale greening, in particular in arid and semiarid climates. However, the increase in leaf area could reduce the benefits of elevated CO2 concentration through soil water depletion. The net effect of elevated CO2 on leaf- and canopy-level gas exchange remains uncertain. To address this question, we compare the outcomes of a heuristic model based on the Partitioning of Equilibrium Transpiration and Assimilation (PETA) hypothesis and three model variants based on stomatal optimization theory. Predicted relative changes in leaf- and canopy-level gas exchange rates are used as a metric of plant responses to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Both model approaches predict reductions in leaf-level transpiration rate due to decreased stomatal conductance under elevated CO2, but negligible (PETA) or no (optimization) changes in canopy-level transpiration due to the compensatory effect of increased leaf area. Leaf- and canopy-level CO2 assimilation is predicted to increase, with an amplification of the CO2 fertilization effect at the canopy level due to the enhanced leaf area. The expected increase in vapour pressure deficit (VPD) under warmer conditions is generally predicted to decrease the sensitivity of gas exchange to atmospheric CO2 concentration in both models. The consistent predictions by different models that canopylevel transpiration varies little under elevated CO2 due to combined stomatal conductance reduction and leaf area increase highlight the coordination of physiological and morphological characteristics in vegetation to maximize resource use (here water) under altered climatic conditions.

AB Depressive disorders are the most burdensome psychiatric disorders worldwide. Although huge efforts have been made to advance treatment, outcomes remain unsatisfactory. Many factors contribute to this gridlock including suboptimal animal models. Especially limited study comparability and replicability due to imprecise terminology concerning depressive-like states are major problems. To overcome these issues, new approaches are needed. Here, we introduce a taxonomical concept for modelling depression in laboratory mice, which we call depression-like syndrome (DLS). It hinges on growing evidence suggesting that mice possess advanced socioemotional abilities and can display non-random symptom patterns indicative of an evolutionary conserved disorder-like phenotype. The DLS approach uses a combined heuristic method based on clinical depression criteria and the Research Domain Criteria to provide a biobehavioural reference syndrome for preclinical rodent models of depression. The DLS criteria are based on available, species-specific evidence and are as follows: (I) minimum duration of phenotype, (II) significant sociofunctional impairment, (III) core biological features, (IV) necessary depressive-like symptoms. To assess DLS presence and severity, we have designed an algorithm to ensure statistical and biological relevance of findings. The algorithm uses a minimum combined threshold for statistical significance and effect size (p value <= 0.05 plus moderate effect size) for each DLS criterion. Taken together, the DLS is a novel, biologically founded, and species-specific minimum threshold approach. Its long-term objective is to gradually develop into an inter-model validation standard and microframework to improve phenotyping methodology in translational research.

AB Dendrobium is a valuable traditional Chinese herb that contains active ingredients such as polysaccharides and alkaloids that have anti-aging, antioxidant, and immunomodulating effects. The appropriate distribution range of Dendrobium should be predicted from the perspective of ecological niche theory in order to preserve and utilize medicinal plant resources. In this study, Dendrobium nobile, Dendrobium officinale, and Dendrobium moniliforme were selected to predict the potential suitable distributions and ecological niche shifts. A comparison of 19 environmental variables of the three Dendrobium species revealed three climatic factors that differed significantly when the species were compared two at a time. The principal component analysis was carried out in order to screen seven climatic factors for ecological niche shift analysis. All three Dendrobium species were found to have a very similar ecological niche, but with a relatively small range of variability regarding certain climatic factors. Finally, the current and future suitable areas for these three Dendrobium species in China were predicted using the MaxEnt model and ArcGIS using the two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). Overall, the analysis of the climatic factors' comparisons, niche shift, and current and future suitable areas of these three Dendrobium species provides a basis for medicinal plant resource conservation and utilization, and our methods could be applied to the study of other similar valuable medicinal plants.

AB Negative emissions technologies (NETs) for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) are increasingly important responses to achieve global climate change targets, but to date, there has been insufficient attention to land-based NETs (including afforestation, biochar, and other measures) as an agrarian challenge for the global South. This paper explores the implications of different NETs for land, labor, capital, and politics in rural spaces and contributes to articulating agrarian climate justice by demonstrating the potentially unjust implications of many NETs. The paper concludes with how these measures might be designed to be less negative for rural peoples in future implementation.

AB In recent years, there has been considerable interest in investigating how animal social structure is affected by the loss of individuals. This is often achieved using simulations that generate predictions regarding how the removal of 'key' individuals from a group affects network structure. However, little is known about the effects of such removals in wild and free-ranging populations, particularly the extent to which naturally occurring mortality events and the loss of a large proportion of individuals from a social group affects the overall structure of a social network. Here, we used data from a population of wild Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) that was exposed to an exceptionally harsh winter, culminating in the death of 64% of the adults from two groups. We analysed how social interaction patterns among surviving individuals were affected by the natural loss of group members using social networks based on affiliative (i.e., grooming) and aggressive social interactions. We show that only the structure of the pre-decline grooming networks was conserved in the post-decline networks, suggesting that grooming, but not aggression networks are resilient against the loss of group members. Surviving group members were not significantly different from the non-survivors in terms of their affiliative and agonistic relationships, and did not form assorted communities in the pre-decline networks. Overall, our results suggest that in primates, patterns of affiliative interactions are more resilient to changes in group composition than aggressive interaction patterns, which tend to be used more flexibly in new conditions.

AB Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in estuarine systems are often subjected to natural and anthropogenic risks, which may impact their health and behaviors. Effective management for this species should incorporate continual, updated information on behavioral patterns of the individuals within populations. Currently, the Jacksonville Estuarine System stock assessment report, which includes dolphins in the St. Johns River (SJR) in northeast Florida, is based on data from the 1990s. Since then, dolphins' use of the SJR has shifted, and the community has been impacted by two unusual mortality events (UME). This study analyzed site fidelity, space use and overlap, and social mixing with respect to the epizootic 2013-2015 UME, whose infectious agent was cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV). Examination of residency status determined that most dolphins sighted in the river were year-round residents ((x) over bar =45%, SD = 3.20). Space use and overlap of core areas occurred among residency categories but varied between cold and warm seasons and across time periods. There were key, highly connected individuals in the social network, which may have influenced disease transmission during the UME. Individuals infected by CeMV that stranded during the UME shared overlapping core areas with each other and with individuals from different residency categories. Altogether, this information on site fidelity, spatial overlap, and social mixing will help improve management plans for SJR dolphins, lead to better response efforts to future unusual mortality events, and increase the understanding of disease transmission in social species.

AB Aim The distribution and connectivity of floodplain environments along major Amazonian rivers changed considerably over time following physiographic and climatic events. However, how historical alteration in floodplain habitats affected endemic species' demography and diversification is not fully understood. We tested if historical demographic changes of populations occurring on the floodplains of a major Amazon Basin tributary could be associated with range expansions from upper and middle sections of the river, following the establishment of widespread river-created environments during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Location Solimoes River, Western Amazon, South America. Taxon Myrmoborus lugubris, Thamnophilus cryptoleucus and Myrmotherula assimilis. Methods We explored spatial patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity among 13 sampled localities using thousands of UltraConserved Elements. We used a total of 73 individuals of three species with populations restricted to the Solimoes River. Range expansions were tested with spatial explicit methods designed to capture variations in allele frequency over space. To test whether the occupation of dynamic habitats could predict spatial patterns of genetic diversity, we quantified habitat preference for the three analysed species by creating a metric of habitat dynamicity over time. Results We found considerable variation in the spatial distribution of the genetic diversity between studied taxa rejecting shared population range expansions related to historical regionalized changes in habitat availability. Species with higher levels of specialization to dynamic environments have a more heterogeneous distribution of genetic diversity and reduced levels of gene flow across space. Main conclusions The demographic expansions along the Solimoes River might be linked to spatially homogeneous oscillation in the distribution of floodplain environments, promoting effective population size changes but not range expansion. Habitat specificity might be a good predictor of population connectivity along the Amazonian floodplains.

AB The world's languages draw on different reference frames to encode spatial relationships between people, objects or places. We address how subtle differences in reference frame preferences across Spanish and English affect Spanish-English bilinguals' interpretations of spatial descriptions involving the terms left and right. Bilinguals saw an entity ('object'; e.g., a vase or a human) with a circle on either side, along with a description of the location of a ball relative to the object (e.g., The ball is to the right of the vase or The ball is on the vase's right). Their task was to decide which circle indicated the ball's location. Results showed that syntax and object type contributed differently to bilinguals' responses: Effects of syntax patterned with Spanish preferences, whereas effects of object type patterned with English preferences. English language exposure subtly affected bilinguals' response choices. Results are discussed with respect to experience-based theories of language processing.

SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DT Article; Early Access
DE Unbalanced data classification; genetic programming; fitness function;
   imbalanced classification; class imbalance
ID FRAMEWORK
AB Many real-world problems have an uneven distribution of data over different classes. The imbalanced nature of data impacts the performance of classifiers. The higher counts of majority class samples influence the learning abilities of well-known classifiers. Genetic programming (GP) algorithm based on natural evolution also impacts if the data's nature is imbalanced. The fitness function plays a pivotal role and impacts almost each building block of the GP framework. GP with the standard fitness function produces under-fitted and biased classifiers. Therefore, this paper has proposed a new fitness function in GP to classify the imbalanced data. The proposed method is used to classify nine imbalanced problems: ABL-18, ABL-9-18, BAL, YEAST2, YEAST1, ABL-9, ION, WDBC, and SPECT. The imbalanced factor of benchmark problems varies from 99:1 to 59:41. The proposed method's performance is compared with K-Nearest-Neighbourhood (KNN) and the standard fitness function-based GP methods. The GP with newly proposed fitness function gives average AUC values for ABL-18(99:1), ABL-9-18(94:6), BAL(92:8), YEAST2(89:11), YEAST1(84:16), ABL-9(83:17), ION(64:36), WDBC(63:37), and SPECT(59:41) as 0.714, 0.812, 0.975, 0.916, 0.768, 0.654, 0.872, 0.939, and 0.704, respectively, which are higher than KNN and the standard fitness function-based GP methods. The result outcomes prove the superiority of the proposed method.

AB Bat species commonly comprise at least 50% of tropical mammalian assemblages, but Afrotropical bat faunas have been little studied leading to perceptions that they are depauperate. Here, we compare alpha taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of insectivorous bats belonging to the narrow-space foraging ensemble from a bat diversity hotspot in Nigeria to species-rich sites in Indonesia and Malaysia, using previously published data. The Nigerian site is protected unlogged forests at Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary and Cross River National Park. For comparison, we targeted similar unlogged forest sites in Southeast Asia: Indonesia-Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park Forest in Sumatra; and Kakenauwe Forest Reserve on Buton Island, Sulawesi; and another in Malaysia-Krau Wildlife Reserve. All sites were sampled using comparable methods, with an emphasis on harp traps that effectively capture the forest-interior ensembles. We also compare regional beta diversity of bat assemblages in ecoregions using occurrence data (literature, unpublished records, and online natural history collections) from the Lower Guinean Forest and the Malay Peninsula. We demonstrate comparable alpha taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of narrow-space bats among sites in Nigeria and Indonesia, but greater diversity in Malaysia. Turnover and overall beta diversity of bats among ecoregions was comparable between the Lower Guinean Forest and the Malay Peninsula, but nestedness was higher in the latter. Our results reiterate the value of harp traps in generating bat survey data that allows equatable comparisons of "mist net avoiders" in the Paleotropical forest understory. Our findings have implications for regional and local bat conservation.

AB Despite the popularity of discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) for studying population structure, there has been little discussion of best practice for this method. In this work, I provide guidelines for standardizing the application of DAPC to genotype data sets. An often overlooked fact is that DAPC generates a model describing genetic differences among a set of populations defined by a researcher. Appropriate parameterization of this model is critical for obtaining biologically meaningful results. I show that the number of leading PC axes used as predictors of among-population differences, p(axes), should not exceed the k-1 biologically informative PC axes that are expected for k effective populations in a genotype data set. This k-1 criterion for p(axes) specification is more appropriate compared to the widely used proportional variance criterion, which often results in a choice of p(axes) >> k-1. DAPC parameterized with no more than the leading k-1 PC axes: (i) is more parsimonious; (ii) captures maximal among-population variation on biologically relevant predictors; (iii) is less sensitive to unintended interpretations of population structure; and (iv) is more generally applicable to independent sample sets. Assessing model fit should be routine practice and aids interpretation of population structure. It is imperative that researchers articulate their study goals, that is, testing a priori expectations vs. studying de novo inferred populations, because this has implications on how their DAPC results should be interpreted. The discussion and practical recommendations in this work provide the molecular ecology community with a roadmap for using DAPC in population genetic investigations.

AB Plant and microbial diversity are key to determine ecosystem functioning. Despite the well-known role of local-scale alpha diversity in affecting vegetation biomass, the effects of community heterogeneity (beta diversity) of plants and soil microbes on above- and belowground biomass (AGB and BGB) across contrasting environments still remain unclear. Here, we conducted a dryness-gradient transect survey over 3000 km across grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. We found that plant beta diversity was more dominant than alpha diversity in maintaining higher levels of AGB, while soil fungal beta diversity was the key driver in enhancing BGB. However, these positive effects of plant and microbial beta diversity on AGB and BGB were strongly weakened by increasing climatic dryness, mainly because higher soil available phosphorus caused by increasing dryness reduced both plant and soil fungal beta diversities. Overall, these new findings highlight the critical role of above- and belowground beta diversity in sustaining grassland biomass, raising our awareness to the ecological risks of large-scale biotic homogenization under future climate change.

AB Land use change stemming from human activities, particularly cropland expansion, heavily threatens the survival of crop wild relatives that usually occur nearby or scatter in farming systems. Understanding the impacts of land use change on wild populations is critical in forming the conservation decision-making of wild relatives. Based on the investigations on the population survival of three wild rice species (Oryza rufipogon, O. officinalis, and O. granulata) in China over the past 40 years (1978-2019), the effect of land use change during the past 20 years (2001-2019) on the natural populations of the three species was examined using the land use type data of satellite-based Earth observations (data from GlobCover). From 1978 to 2019, the number of populations (distribution sites) of the three wild rice species had decreased by 65-87%, mainly because of the habitat destruction or disappearance caused by human-induced land use change. The three wild rice species display different habitat preferences, resulting in specific land use types surrounding their populations. In the recent 20 years, although the surrounding community composition of the wild rice population has been relatively stable, the surrounding vegetation cover area of the survived populations was significantly more extensive than that of the extinct ones (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that habitat vegetation plays a "biological barrier" role in the survival of wild populations through resisting or mitigating the disturbing impact of land use change on wild populations. This study provides not only direct guidelines for the conservation of wild rice but also new insights into the mechanisms underlying the influence of land use change on wild populations.

AB Purpose The restoration of degraded ecosystems is an important issue in applied ecology. Understanding community assembly during restoration can help facilitate ecological restoration. Aerial seeding is a widely used method to restore degraded ecosystems threatened by desertification. However, there is limited understanding of how aerial seeding affects community assembly processes and the driving factors of plants, soil bacteria, and fungi during ecosystem restoration.
   Methods This study analyzed the community composition, beta-diversity (community difference degree), community assembly processes, and influencing factors of plants, soil bacteria, and fungi using aerial seeding restoration chronosequences from 1983 to 2017 in Mu Us sandy land, China.
   Results Our results showed that plant biomass and relative abundances of beneficial flora in soil bacterial and fungal communities all increased since restoration commenced. beta-Diversity of plant communities first decreased and then increased with increasing restoration time. Community assembly was dominated by stochastic processes in early stages of restoration, deterministic processes in middle stages, and stochastic processes in later stages. Dispersal limitation and environmental filtering (soil total nitrogen, soil total organic carbon, and mean annual precipitation) influenced stochastic and deterministic processes in plant communities, respectively. The beta-diversity of soil bacteria continuously decreased, and community assembly was almost entirely driven by stochastic processes in the entire chronosequences. Homogenizing dispersal was the key factor driving community assembly. We found no significant changes in soil fungal beta-diversity. Deterministic and stochastic processes simultaneously drove soil fungal community assembly. Both environmental filtering (soil total organic carbon and mean annual precipitation) and dispersal limitation affected the community assembly.
   Conclusion We confirmed the effectiveness of aerial seeding restoration by studying the community composition of plants, soil bacteria, and fungi. Our study highlights that the community assembly processes and driving factors varied for plants, soil bacteria, and fungi during restoration chronosequences. It is necessary to carry out research simultaneously on the community assembly of aboveground plants and underground soil microorganisms.

AB Microlicia cataphracta (DC.) (Versiane & R.Romero) is one of the most widely distributed and polymorphic taxa of Lavoisiereae (Melastomataceae). This species has been described as an ochlospecies with 20 described taxonomic entities. This circumscription includes a wide continuum of morphological variation exhibited by the species throughout its geographic range. This study attempts to verify which environmental variables predict the occurrence of M. cataphracta and its ecophenotypes and determine whether there are morphological variations associated with environmental variables to corroborate the ochlospecies designation for this species. Occurrences of M. cataphracta and its ecophenotypes were extracted from the GBIF and speciesLink databases, together with climatic and edaphic variables from online databases. We assessed the importance of environmental variables in predicting the distribution of M. cataphracta based on non-collinear variables. These variables were rescaled to a geographic grid covering three biomes. Then, environmental variables were associated with occurrence records to predict the geographical distribution area of the species. Morphological data were extracted from original descriptions. Our results show that the most important variables determining the distribution of the species are the minimum temperature and the amount of sand in the soil. Other tested variables showed lower values of statistical importance. However, when analyzed together with morphology, for example, it appears that morphological variations, such as, color of the petals are related to soil pH values, and configurations in the shape and size of leaves, and calyx lobes can be related to precipitation. Based on environmental variables, our analysis also showed that M. cataphracta could potentially grow in the states of Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. However, its environmental optimum remains in the comparatively widespread area where it is currently found. The analyses presented here using climatic and edaphic variables, associated with the morphological data, corroborate the designation of M. cataphracta as an ochlospecies.

AB African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) have undergone severe population reductions and are listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. Small, isolated populations have the potential to suffer from threats to their genetic diversity that may impact species viability and future survival. This study provides the first set of population-wide genomic data to address conservation concerns for this endangered species. Whole genome sequencing data were generated for 71 free-ranging African wild dogs from the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, and used to estimate important population genomic parameters. Genomic diversity metrics revealed that variation levels were low; however, this African wild dog population showed low levels of inbreeding. Very few first- and second-order relationships were observed in this cohort, with most relationships falling into the third-order or distant category. Patterns of homozygosity could have resulted from historical inbreeding or a loss in genome variation due to a population bottleneck. Although the results suggest that this stronghold African wild dog population maintains low levels of inbreeding, likely due to their cooperative breeding system, it may lead to a continuous population decline when a reduced number of suitable mates are available. Consequently, the low genomic variation may influence species viability over time. This study highlights the importance of assessing population genomic parameters to set conservation priorities. Future studies should include the investigation of the potential of this endangered species to adapt to environmental changes considering the low genomic diversity in this population.

AB Simple Summary Understanding biological invasion mechanisms is crucial to design effective management strategies preventing their impacts on ecosystems. If the role of long-distance dispersal and age-dependent fecundity in plant invasion speed has been characterized in theory, empirical support is still rare given the difficulty to jointly fit demographic and spread parameters of dynamic models to available data. We proposed a statistical model to fit such parameters to heterogeneous observations collected across space and time. We can directly test hypotheses on the importance of various mechanisms in a past invasion. We demonstrated the potential of this method by determining the roles of human-mediated long-distance dispersal and age-dependent fecundity in the invasion of the shrub Plectranthus barbatus in South Africa. Our model revealed a massive wave of spread driven by human-mediated long-distance dispersal and originating from the cities of first introduction. The species completed its invasion of all favorable areas a few years after, in the mid-1990s. Without human-mediated long-distance dispersal, the maximum population would have been obly 30% of the current population. The delayed reproductive maturity explained the invasion lag phase. It highlights the importance of early eradication of weedy horticultural alien plants around urban areas to hamper the invasive spread. Plant invasions generate massive ecological and economic costs worldwide. Predicting their spatial dynamics is crucial to the design of effective management strategies and the prevention of invasions. Earlier studies highlighted the crucial role of long-distance dispersal in explaining the speed of many invasions. In addition, invasion speed depends highly on the duration of its lag phase, which may depend on the scaling of fecundity with age, especially for woody plants, even though empirical proof is still rare. Bayesian dynamic species distribution models enable the fitting of process-based models to partial and heterogeneous observations using a state-space modeling approach, thus offering a tool to test such hypotheses on past invasions over large spatial scales. We use such a model to explore the roles of long-distance dispersal and age-structured fecundity in the transient invasion dynamics of Plectranthus barbatus, a woody plant invader in South Africa. Our lattice-based model accounts for both short and human-mediated long-distance dispersal, as well as age-structured fecundity. We fitted our model on opportunistic occurrences, accounting for the spatio-temporal variations of the sampling effort and the variable detection rates across datasets. The Bayesian framework enables us to integrate a priori knowledge on demographic parameters and control identifiability issues. The model revealed a massive wave of spatial spread driven by human-mediated long-distance dispersal during the first decade and a subsequent drastic population growth, leading to a global equilibrium in the mid-1990s. Without long-distance dispersal, the maximum population would have been equivalent to 30% of the current equilibrium population. We further identified the reproductive maturity at three years old, which contributed to the lag phase before the final wave of population growth. Our results highlighted the importance of the early eradication of weedy horticultural alien plants around urban areas to hamper and delay the invasive spread.

AB The measure H1-H2, the difference in amplitude between the first and second harmonics, is frequently used to distinguish phonation types and to characterize differences across voices and genders. While H1-H2 can differentiate voices and is used by listeners to perceive changes in voice quality, its relation to voice articulation is less straightforward. Its calculation also involves practical issues with error propagation. This paper highlights some developments in the use of H1-H2 and proposes a new measure that we call "residual H1. " In residual H1, the amplitude of the first harmonic is normalized against the overall sound energy (as measured by root mean square energy) instead of against H2. Residual H1 may mitigate some of the issues with using H1-H2. The current study tests the correlation between residual H1 and electroglottographic contact quotient (CQ) and compares the ability of residual H1 vs H1-H2 to differentiate statistically across phonation types in !Xoo and utterance-level changes in phonatory quality in Mandarin. The results show that residual H1 has a stronger correlation with CQ and differentiates contrastive and allophonic phonatory quality better than H1-H2, particularly for more constricted phonation types.

AB Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be a key component of the climate change mitigation efforts to achieve the carbon-neutrality goals. Hence, a comprehensive assessment of the CDR potential at national and local levels is crucial to identify regional opportunities and deploy practical actions timely. This study focuses on the potential function of olive agroecosystems in delivering CDR in the European Mediterranean countries. Relying on a geospatial assessment of existing olive groves (and associated residual biomass) combined with statistical, process systems engineering, and life cycle emissions data, the CDR potential considering five promising actions linked with the olive agroecosystems was here estimated. These actions are i) conservation measures protecting tree carbon sequestration, ii) agricultural practices increasing soil carbon sequestration, iii) biochar production and utilization, iv) biomass conversion routes coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and v) development of bio-based and CO2-based materials. Overall, the bottom-up assessment highlights the value of the olive groves, currently storing around 0.22 Gt CO2-eq in standing trees and potentially sequestering 0.03 Gt CO2-eq annually in soils. Moreover, exploiting the abundant biomass wastes in biorefineries coupled with CCS could deliver gigatonne-scale CDR while producing various value-added products, achieving above 0.01 Gt CO2-eq per year only using prunings for biochar or power, while other pathways show lower potential (e.g., 0.52 MtCO(2)eq yr(-1) for fermentation). These results may promote the large-scale deployment of CDR actions, stimulate new policy initiatives to exploit opportunities associated with the olive groves, and ultimately contribute to the transition toward the net-zero targets.

AB Climate and land-use changes are among the most important drivers of biodiversity loss and, moreover, their impacts on biodiversity are expected to increase further in the 21st century. In this study, the future impact of climate and land-use changes on Anatolian ground squirrels (Spermophilus xanthoprymnus) was assessed. Accordingly, a hierarchical approach with two steps was used. First, ecological niche modelling was used to assess the impact of climate change in areas accessible to Anatolian ground squirrels through dispersal (i.e. the impact of climate change). Second, based on the habitat preferences of ground squirrels, land-use data were used to assess the impact of land-use change in suitable bioclimatic areas for Anatolian ground squirrels under present and future conditions (i.e. the combined impact of both changes). Also, priority areas for the conservation of Anatolian ground squirrels were identified based on in-situ climate change refugia. This study represents a first attempt to combine niche modelling and land-use data for a species in Anatolia, one of the most vulnerable regions to the drivers of biodiversity loss, because it is the region where three of biodiversity hotspots meet, and interact. Habitat suitability (i.e. suitable habitats across suitable bioclimatic areas) was projected to decline by 19-69% in the future (depending on the scenario), mainly due to the loss of suitable bioclimatic areas (47-77%, depending on the scenario) at lower elevations and in the western part of the central Anatolia and in the eastern Anatolia, suggesting that Anatolian ground squirrels will contract their range in the future, mainly due to climate change. Thus, in-situ climate change refugia were projected mainly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the central Anatolia, suggesting these regions as priority areas for the conservation of Anatolian ground squirrels.

AB Natural habitats in rural and urban areas are increasingly fragmented and altered by human impacts that are limiting the animal and plant dispersal process. Fragmentation and isolation can be reversed by restoring landscape connectivity through effective Ecological Network (EN) planning. However, most of the studies analyzing the influence of connectivity and landscape structure on biodiversity are focused on animals, while the understanding of their interplaying role on plant diversity remains limited. .We studied the relationships between alpha and 13 diversity pattern and landscape structure and connectivity in the nodes of an EN developed in agricultural landscapes, as a part of regional landscape planning framework in Friuli Venezia Giulia region (North-East of Italy). As an innovation, the study aims at parsing the interacting effect of landscape structure, surrounding habitats and nodes, and structural connectivity on EN plant diversity at two specific scales of investigation i.e., the habitat and the node scale. The habitat was the basic ecological unit, while the node was the basic cartographical unit for the EN mapping (multi-habitat or mono-habitat nodes).A total of 443 plant species were collected across 219 sample plots, in 14 different habitats and 87 nodes of the EN. We found that high node connectivity leads to higher species richness (alpha-diversity) but also increases plant community similarity (i.e., low 13-diversity) at both scales. The effect of landscape structure showed differing trends depending on the habitat. In general, landscape composition of semi-natural land cover (i.e., hedgerows, watercourses) showed a positive effect on species diversity as opposed to that of the configuration of anthropogenic elements on both scales. Our results provided crucial information on the landscape processes useful to improving biodiversity conservation by EN. Our findings suggest that i) improving connectivity within ENs favors alpha plant diversity ii) different habitats have different sensibility to landscape structure iii) semi-natural land cover around nodes improve plant diversity; iv) planning both mono-habitat and multi-habitats nodes, increases the biodiversity conserved therein; v) nodes with more compact shapes are to be preferred.

AB Understanding and predicting how species will respond to global environmental change (i.e., climate and land use change) is essential to efficiently inform conservation and management strategies for authorities and managers. Here, we assessed the combined effect of future climate and land use change on the potential range shifts of the giant pandas (Aituropoda melanoleuca) in Sichuan Province, China. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to forecast range shifts of the giant pandas by the 2050s and 2070s under four combined climate and land use change scenarios. We also compared the differences in distributional changes of giant pandas among the five mountains in the study area. Our SDMs exhibited good model performance and were not overfitted, with a mean Boyce index of 0.960 +/- 0.015 and a mean omission rate of 0.002 +/- 0.003, and suggested that precipitation seasonality, annual mean temperature, the proportion of forest cover, and total annual precipitation are the most important factors in shaping the current distribution pattern of the giant pandas. Our projections of future species distribution also suggested a range expansion under an optimistic greenhouse gas emission, while suggesting a range contraction under a pessimistic greenhouse gas emission. Moreover, we found that there is considerable variation in the projected range change patterns among the five mountains in the study area. Especially, the suitable habitat of the giant panda is predicted to increase under all scenarios in the Minshan mountains, while is predicted to decrease under all scenarios in Daxiangling and Liangshan mountains, indicating the vulnerability of the giant pandas at low latitudes. Our findings highlight the importance of an integrated approach that combines climate and land use change to predict the future species distribution and the need for a spatial explicit consideration of the projected range change patterns of target species for guiding conservation and management strategies.

AB Knowledge of the drivers of fine-scale spatial ecology in wide-ranging marine species is vital to un-derstand population structuring and conserve threatened species. Movements and habitat use are likely to be strongly influenced by social relationships between individuals, and social units within animal populations may be subject to distinct selective pressures. Here we used passive acoustic telemetry and network-based analyses to investigate the site visit patterns and social affiliations of reef manta rays, Mobula alfredi, in Raja Ampat, West Papua. Acoustic transmitters were externally deployed on 27 rays that were tracked for up to 110 days. Visit profiles were retrieved from nine acoustic receivers positioned in clusters at known aggregation sites, enabling analysis of movement behaviour and social processes at various spatial scales. We utilized Bayesian inference and a double permutation method to address issues in sampling and hypothesis testing on social networks constructed from automated telemetry data. We found that social affiliations were assorted into spatially defined communities which remained stable over several weeks to months, although many affiliations were short lived. Interindividual variability in detection profiles was correlated with social network metrics. Individuals with high levels of site attachment had stronger social affiliations, while individuals that regularly attended different receiver clusters were more central to the overall social network. These results suggest that reef manta ray movements, habitat preferences and social relationships should be understood as linked behavioural processes for which variability between individuals and groups may drive emergent population struc-ture. Future research and local management of manta rays will likely benefit from identifying how, where and why social gatherings occur.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Two deciduous forest ecosystems, one dominated by Fagus sylvatica and a mixed one with Ouercus cerris and Ouercus frainetto, were monitored from an ecophysiological perspective during a five-year period, in order to assess seasonal fluctuations, establish links between phenology and ecophysiology, and reveal climatic controls. Field measurements of leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content, leaf specific mass (LSM), water potential (Psi) and leaf photosynthesis (Aleaf) were performed approximately on a monthly basis. LAI, chlorophylls and LSM fluctuations followed a recurrent pattern yearly, with increasing values during spring leaf burst and expansion, relatively stable values during summer and decreasing values during autumn senescence. However, pre-senescence leaf fall and chlorophyll reductions were evident in the driest year. The dynamically responsive Aleaf and 1 Psi presented considerable inter-annual variation. Both oak species showed more pronounced depressions of Aleaf and 1 Psi compared to beech, yet the time-point of their appearance coincided and was the same for all species each year. Spring temperature had a positive role in the increasing phase of all ecophysiological processes while rising autumn temperature resulted in retarded senescence. Precipitation showed asymmetric effects on the measured ecophysiological parameters. The betweenspecies differences in responses, climate sensitivity and climate memory are identified and discussed.

AB Studying the social behaviour of small or cryptic species often relies on constructing networks from sparse point-based observations of individuals (e.g. live trapping data). A common approach assumes that individuals that have been detected sequentially in the same trapping location will also be more likely to have come into indirect and/or direct contact. However, there is very little guidance on how much data are required for making robust networks from such data. In this study, we highlight that sequential trap sharing networks broadly capture shared space use (and, hence, the potential for contact) and that it may be more parsimonious to directly model shared space use. We first use empirical data to show that characteristics of how animals use space can help us to establish new ways to model the potential for individuals to come into contact. We then show that a method that explicitly models individuals' home ranges and subsequent overlap in space among individuals (spatial overlap networks) requires fewer data for inferring observed networks that are more strongly correlated with the true shared space use network (relative to sequential trap sharing networks). Furthermore, we show that shared space use networks based on estimating spatial overlap are also more powerful for detecting biological effects. Finally, we discuss when it is appropriate to make inferences about social interactions from shared space use. Our study confirms the potential for using sparse trapping data from cryptic species to address a range of important questions in ecology and evolution. Significance statement Characterising animal social networks requires repeated (co-)observations of individuals. Collecting sufficient data to characterise the connections among individuals represents a major challenge when studying cryptic organisms-such as small rodents. This study draws from existing spatial mark-recapture data to inspire an approach that constructs networks by estimating space use overlap (representing the potential for contact). We then use simulations to demonstrate that the method provides consistently higher correlations between inferred (or observed) networks and the true underlying network compared to current approaches and requires fewer observations to reach higher correlations. We further demonstrate that these improvements translate to greater network accuracy and to more power for statistical hypothesis testing.

AB We analyzed and compared the effects of biotic factors (species diversity, structural diversity, and aboveground biomass) and abiotic factors (topography and soil properties) on soil organic carbon in selected mountainous areas of Beijing China. An overall goal is to provide a preliminary scientific basis for biodiversity protection and coordinated development of forest ecosystems and the subsequent carbon balance in this region. Our study ecosystems were coniferous forests, mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests, and broadleaved forests in the western mountainous area of Beijing. We determined both direct and indirect effects of abiotic and biotic factors on soil organic carbon using multiple linear regression and a structural equation model. Results showed that the biotic factors aboveground biomass and structural diversity were the main driving forces of organic carbon accumulation in the soil surface layer (0-10 cm), but species diversity had no significant effect (p > 0.05). Abiotic factors (altitude, total nitrogen, and total potassium) had some influence on soil surface organic carbon but were subordinate to the biotic factors. The biotic factors had no significant effect on soil organic carbon in the subsurface layers (10-20 cm) and (20-30 cm) (p > 0.05), whereas the abiotic factors altitude and total nitrogen played a dominant role in subsurface soil organic carbon accumulation of both layers (p < 0.01). The influences were both direct and indirect influences, but the direct influences played a major role. Our results form an initial reference for afforestation management (Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm-source Control Project) from the perspective of biodiversity protection and carbon storage enhancement.

AB Body-size reductions are a pervasive response to climate change, and body size is a central trait linking together multiple axes of ecology, physiology and life history. Using a combination of three decades of data and controlled experiments, we show that male and female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) have become smaller structurally, despite chicks growing larger under warmer nest temperatures and larger chicks being more likely to return as adults. We find that adult structural size trends are associated with warmer overwintering conditions, rather than the nestling period. Further, adult male body mass trends depend on climate conditions during spring migration; male breeding mass decreased by 4%, whereas female mass was unchanged. This may be explained by the demands of reproduction, as lighter females produce fewer offspring. This work highlights the complex interactions that shape relationships between traits and fitness, which will be critical for predicting evolutionary responses in future environments.

AB Context. Empirical studies of intraspecific genetic diversity and population structure can inform the evolutionary and demographic history of individual species and of landscapes at the bioregional level. Aims. We aimed to assess intraspecific genetic variation at macroevolutionary and microevolutionary temporal scales for Mirbelia viminalis, a key species present on the Hamersley Range in the ancient and highly diverse landscape of the Pilbara bioregion of northwest Western Australia. Methods. We sampled extant populations and assessed diversity and structure using sequences (chloroplast DNA, 1759 base pairs) and microsatellite markers (nuclear DNA, 15 loci) data. Key results. Significant phylogeographic structure and a lack of historical demographic signals of population contraction or expansion suggest historical population persistence. Moderate chloroplast haplotype diversity (h = 15) and moderate divergence among extant haplotypes indicates a degree of historical connectivity via seed dispersal across central populations on the Hamersley Range. Levels of nuclear genetic diversity were low to moderate (allelic richness = 3.554, expected heterozygosity = 0.489, observed heterozygosity = 0.462) and depauperate compared to another member of the Mirbelia genus present further south in the Midwest region. Nuclear diversity revealed a strong signal of isolation by distance with localised admixture among populations and some contemporary genetic clustering along a north-west to south-east transect of the Hamersley Range. Conclusions. Low nuclear genetic diversity may be related to recent reductions in population size for M. viminalis. Historical population persistence with few barriers to dispersal other than geographic distance may be common for members of the Fabaceae across the Hamersley Range.

AB Understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes driving population differentiation and speciation can provide critical insights into the formation of biodiversity. Here, we examine the link between population genetic processes and biogeographic history underlying the generation of diversity in the Hengduan Mountains (HM), a region harboring a rich and dynamic flora. We used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to generate 1,907 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and four-kb of plastid sequence in species of the Gentiana hexaphylla complex (Gentianaceae). We performed genetic clustering with spatial and non-spatial models, phylogenetic reconstructions, and ancestral range estimation, with the aim of addressing the processes influencing diversification of G. hexaphylla in the HM. We find the G. hexaphylla complex is characterized by geographic genetic structure with clusters corresponding to the South, North and the central HM. Phylogenetic reconstruction and pairwise F-ST analyses showed deep differentiation between Southern and Northern populations in the HM. The population in Mount Taibai exhibited the highest genetic similarity to the North HM. Ancestral range estimation indicated that the G. hexaphylla complex originated in the central HM and then diverged in the Pliocene and the Early Pleistocene, before dispersing widely, resulting in the current distinct lineages. Overall, we found deep genomic differentiation in the G. hexaphylla complex corresponds to geographic barriers to dispersal in the HM and highlights a critical role of the uplift of the Daxue Mountains and subsequent climatic fluctuations underlying diversification. The colonization of G. hexaphylla in the Mount Taibai region suggests directional dispersal between the alpine flora of the Qinling Mountains and the HM.

AB Habitat loss represents a major threat to biodiversity, however, the modulation of its effects by the nonhabitat matrix surrounding habitat patches is still undervalued. The landscape matrix might change community assembly in different ways. For example, low-quality matrices can accentuate environmental filtering by reducing resource availability and/or deteriorating abiotic conditions but they may also excessively limit dispersal of organisms and make communities more prone to ecological drift. To understand how matrix quality modulates the effects of habitat loss, we quantified the relative importance of environmental filter and ecological drift in bird communities across more local (400 m buffer around sampling sites) and broader (2 km focal landscapes) gradients of habitat loss embedded in low- and high-quality matrices. We used a trait-based approach to understand habitat loss filtering effects on occurrences of forest specialist and habitat generalist birds. We found that low-quality matrices, composed mainly of low-productive pasturelands, increased the severity of habitat loss filtering effects for forest specialist birds, but only at the landscape scale. Bird occurrences were in general higher in high-quality matrices, that is, more heterogeneous and with low-contrasting edges, indicating the role of the matrix quality in attenuating species extinction risks at the landscape scale, probably due to mass effect. Moreover, forest specialists presented a strong negative response to habitat loss filtering across different functional traits, while generalists presented a high variability in traits response to habitat loss. Synthesis and applications: We raised evidence in supporting that landscape habitat loss filtering may be relaxed or reinforced depending on the quality of the matrix, evidencing that matrix quality has a strong impact in modulating community assembly processes in fragmented landscapes. In practical terms, it means that improving matrix quality may help in maintaining the high diversity of birds even without any increase in native forest cover.

AB Aim: This study aimed to investigate the distribution patterns of plant diversity in Kenya, how climatic fluctuations and orogeny shaped them, and the formation of its beta-diversity.
   Location: Kenya, East Africa.
   Taxon: Angiosperms.
   Methods: We quantified patterns of turnover and nestedness components of phylogenetic beta-diversity for angiosperm species among neighbouring sites using a well-resolved phylogenetic tree and extensive distribution records from public databases and other published sources. We applied clustering methods to delineate biota based on pairwise similarities among multiple sites and used a random assembly null model to assess the effects of species abundance distribution on phylogenetic beta-diversity.
   Results: The phylogenetic turnover of the Kenyan flora, intersecting with the biodiversity hotspots Eastern Afromontane, Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa, and Horn of Africa, shows a non-monotonic pattern along a latitudinal gradient that is strongly structured into volcanic and coastal areas. The other areas are mainly dominated by phylogenetic nestedness, even in the eastern part of the equatorial region parallel to the volcanic area. Phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic structure analyses explain the mechanism of the observed phylogenetic turnover and nestedness patterns. We identified five phytogeographical regions in Kenya: the Mandera, Turkana, Volcanic, Pan Coastal and West Highland Regions.
   Conclusions: Variations in turnover gradient and coexistence are highly dependent on the regional biogeographical history resulting from climatic fluctuations and longlasting orogeny, which jointly shaped the biodiversity patterns of the Kenyan flora. The nestedness component dominated climatically unstable regions and is presumed to have been caused by heavy local species extinction and recolonization from Volcanic Region. The high turnover component in climatically stable regions may have preserved old lineages and the prevalence of endemic species within narrow ranges.

AB Within the first attempt to assess marine recreational fisheries (MRF) along the coastal villages of the Basque Country (Eastern Cantabrian Sea), off-site surveys were carried out from 2015 to 2019 to estimate captures of the main targeted species by shore fishing, boat fishing and spearfishing. Phone calls got better response rates (>50%) than email questionnaires (<25%). Spearfishing population was smaller (1000 licenses, <2% of total MRF effort) and younger, whereas boat fishers (5000 licenses, 9% MRF effort) were generally older and more experienced. Shore fishing was the most extended MRF activity (50000 licenses, 90% of MRF effort), showing wider age and experience ranges. Boat fishing targeting albacore in summer was the main MRF activity interacting with regional commercial small-scale fishery. Squids were also important for both shore and boat fishing, followed by seabass, the main target species for shore anglers. Despite surveys were primarily designed to gather information about these three species, they also evidenced, moreover with clear underestimation bias, frequent captures of generally unassessed species, such as sargo-bream (Diplodus spp.), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), common dentex (Dentex dentex), red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) or scorpionfish (Scorpaena spp.). Fishers with more experience, as well as spearfishers in general, captured a wider diversity of species, but individual fishers were more specialized (i.e., showing less variation between trips). Our off-site survey assessment highlights the importance of incorporating multispecies sampling schemes to develop future MRF assessment criteria, within a context of an ecosystem approach that should also consider potential interactions with commercial small-scale fishery.

AB Animal color pattern is a phenotypic trait that may mediate assortative mixing (also known as homophily), whereby similar looking individuals have stronger social associations. Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) coat spot patterns show high variation and some spot traits appear to be heritable. Giraffes also have high visual acuity, which may facilitate intraspecific communication and recognition based on spot patterns. Giraffe groupings are dynamic, merging and splitting throughout the day, but females form long-term associations. We predicted that adult female giraffes show stronger associations with other females that have similar spot pattern traits. We quantified the spot pattern characteristics of 399 adult female Masai giraffes and determined the pattern similarity among pairs (dyads) in their social network. We then tested for an association between coat pattern similarity (spot size, shape, and orientation) and dyadic association strength, and quantified assortative mixing. The strength of social associations was positively correlated with similarity in spot shape. Our results are compatible with assortativity by coat patterns that are similar between mother and offspring, potentially reflecting an effect of relatedness on both pattern similarity and female social associations. These results offer evidence that spot pattern could function as a visual cue for intraspecific communication and kin or individual recognition in a fission-fusion species.

AB The performance of species distribution models (SDMs) is known to be affected by analysis grain and positional error of species occurrences. Coarsening of the analysis grain has been suggested to compensate for positional errors. Nevertheless, this way of dealing with positional errors has never been thoroughly tested. With increasing use of fine-scale environmental data in SDMs, it is important to test this assumption. Models using fine-scale environmental data are more likely to be negatively affected by positional error as the inaccurate occurrences might easier end up in unsuitable environment. This can result in inappropriate conservation actions. Here, we examined the trade-offs between positional error and analysis grain and provide recommendations for best practice. We generated narrow niche virtual species using environmental variables derived from LiDAR point clouds at 5 x 5 m fine-scale. We simulated the positional error in the range of 5 m to 99 m and evaluated the effects of several spatial grains in the range of 5 m to 500 m. In total, we assessed 49 combinations of positional accuracy and analysis grain. We used three modelling techniques (MaxEnt, BRT and GLM) and evaluated their discrimination ability, niche overlap with virtual species and change in realized niche. We found that model performance decreased with increasing positional error in species occurrences and coarsening of the analysis grain. Most importantly, we showed that coarsening the analysis grain to compensate for positional error did not improve model performance. Our results reject coarsening of the analysis grain as a solution to address the negative effects of positional error on model performance. We recommend fitting models with the finest possible analysis grain and as close to the response grain as possible even when available species occurrences suffer from positional errors. If there are significant positional errors in species occurrences, users are unlikely to benefit from making additional efforts to obtain higher resolution environmental data unless they also minimize the positional errors of species occurrences. Our findings are also applicable to coarse analysis grain, especially for fragmented habitats, and for species with narrow niche breadth.

AB Urbanization is increasing at an alarming rate altering biodiversity. As urban areas sprawl, it is vital to understand the effects of urbanization on biodiversity. Florida is ideal for this research; it has many reptile species and has experienced multiple anthropogenic impacts. Herein, we aim to evaluate human impacts on registered reptile richness across an urbanization gradient in Florida. The expectation is that highly urbanized areas would harbor a lower number of species. To represent urbanization, we used Venter et al. (2016) human footprint index. We downloaded georeferenced occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to collate species richness. We ran generalized linear regressions controlling for spatial auto-correlation structure to test the association between urbanization and reptile records across Florida. We found a positive association between urbanization and registered reptiles across Florida for total and non-native species richness; however, a lack of association occurred for native species. We performed rarefaction curves due to an inherent bias of citizen science data. The positive association was supported for non-native reptile species richness with greater species richness located at urban centers. Interestingly, total and native species richness were largest at low as well as moderate levels of urbanization. Thus, moderately urbanized areas may have the potential to harbor a similar number of reptile species compared to areas with low urbanization. Nevertheless, a difference exists in sample completeness between the urbanization categories. Thus, a more systematic monitoring of reptile species across an urbanization gradient, not only focusing on urban and wild areas but also including moderate levels of urbanization, is needed to provide informed conservation strategies for urban development planning. Advances in environmental sensors, environmental DNA, and citizen science outreach are necessary to implement if we are to effectively monitor biodiversity at the accelerated rate of urbanization.

AB Scientists still poorly understand how biotic interactions and dispersal limitation jointly interact and affect the ability of species to track suitable habitats under climate change. Here, we examine how animal-plant interactions and dis-persal limitations might affect the responses of Brazil nut-dependent frogs facing projected climate change. Using eco-logical niche modelling and dispersal simulations, we forecast the future distributions of the Brazil nut tree and three commensalist frog species over time (2030, 2050, 2070, and 2090) in the regional rivalry (SSP370) scenario that in-cludes great challenges to mitigation and adaptation. With the exception of one species, projections point to a decrease in suitable habitats of up to 40.6%. For frog species with potential reductions of co-occurrence areas, this is expected to reduce up to 23.8% of suitable areas for binomial animal-plant relationships. Even so, biotic interactions should not be lost over time. Species will depend on their own dispersal abilities to reach analogous climates in the future for main-taining ecological and evolutionary processes associated with commensal taxa. However, ecological and evolutionary processes associated with commensal taxa should be maintained in accordance with their own dispersal ability. When dispersal limitation is included in the models, the suitable range of all three frog species is reduced considerably by the end of the century. This highlights the importance of dispersal limitation inclusion for forecasting future distribution ranges when biotic interactions matter.

AB Background Black adults experience higher levels of stress and more dysfunctional sleep patterns compared to their White peers, both of which may contribute to racial disparities in chronic health conditions. Dysfunctional sleep patterns are also more likely in emerging adults compared to other age groups. Daily stress-sleep relations in Black emerging adults are understudied. Purpose This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and wrist-worn actigraphy to examine bidirectional associations between daily stress and sleep among Black emerging adults. Methods Black college freshmen (N = 50) completed an EMA protocol (i.e., five EMA prompts/day) and wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The first EMA prompt of each day assessed sleep duration and quality. All EMA prompts assessed stress. Wrist-worn actigraphy assessed nocturnal sleep duration, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and waking after sleep onset. Results At the within-person level, stress experienced on a given day was not associated with any sleep metrics that night (p > .05). On evenings when actigraphy-based sleep duration was shorter (B = -0.02, p = .01) and self-reported sleep quality was poorer (B = -0.12, p = .02) than usual, stress was greater the following day. At the between-person level, negative bidirectional relations existed between stress and actigraphy-based waking after sleep onset (stress predicting sleep: B = -0.35, p = .02; sleep predicting stress: B = -0.27, p = .04). Conclusions Among Black emerging adults, associations between daily sleep and stress vary at the between- and within-person level and are dependent upon the sleep metric assessed. Future research should compare these relations across different measures of stress and different racial/ethnic groups to better understand health disparities.

AB In the current context of global change, there is evidence of a large inter-individual variability in the way animals physiologically respond to anthropogenic changes. In that context, the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and the corticosterone stress response are of primary importance because they are thought to govern the ability of individuals to adjust to stress. Several studies have reported that this stress response is variable among adults and they have successfully linked this variability with abiotic and biotic factors. However, the inter-individual variability of the glucocorticoid stress response has rarely been examined during the developmental phase in wild vertebrates, and its potential ecological determinants remain unclear. In this study, we examined the ontogeny of the corticosterone stress response in an altricial seabird species (i.e., how corticosterone levels increase in response to a standardized stress protocol), the Snow petrel. We reported a strong heterogeneity of the corticosterone stress response at all ages in snow petrel chicks (11-, 20-, and 37-days old chicks). Although the magnitude of this corticosterone stress response decreases with the age of the chick, we also found that this corticosterone stress response was repeatable throughout the post-hatching developmental period (repeatability: r > 0.50 for stress-induced corticosterone levels after a 30-min restraint). Importantly, this glucocorticoid stress response was negatively associated with the body condition of the chicks (i.e., mass corrected for body size), and previous exposure to sampling was associated with a dampened corticosterone stress response. However, we did not find any link between parental traits (parental condition or parental corticosterone stress response), nest quality, hatching date, and the chick's corticosterone stress response. Our study suggests that the corticosterone stress response is a consistent individual trait that is affected to some extent by post-natal conditions, and which differs among individuals very early in life.

AB Understanding the ecological processes that underpin the dynamics of community turnover in response to environmental change is critical to predicting how warming will influence ecosystem functioning. Here, we quantify the effect of changing temperature on community composition and ecosystem functioning via the action of ecological selection on population-level thermal traits. To achieve this, we use microbes isolated from a network of geothermal streams in Iceland where in situ temperatures span 8-38 degrees C within a single catchment. We first quantified variability in thermal tolerance between taxa, and then assembled synthetic communities along a broad thermal gradient to explore how temperature-driven selection on thermal tolerance traits shaped the emergent community structures and functions. We found marked changes in community structure and composition with temperature, such that communities exposed to extreme temperatures (10, 35 degrees C) had highly asymmetric biomass distributions and low taxonomic richness. Thermal optima were a good predictor of the presence and relative abundance of taxa in the high-temperature treatments. We also found that the evenness of the abundance distribution was related to ecosystem production, such that communities with more equitable abundance distribution were also the most productive. Our results highlight the utility of using a multi-level approach that links population-level traits with community structure and ecosystem functioning to better understand how ecological communities will respond to global warming.

AB Harnessing new technologies is vital to achieve global imperatives to restore degraded ecosystems. We explored the potential of genomics as one such tool. We aimed to understand barriers hindering the uptake of genomics, and how to overcome them, via exploratory interviews with leading scholars in both restoration and its sister discipline of conservation-a discipline that has successfully leveraged genomics. We also conducted an examination of research trends to explore some insights that emerged from the interviews, including publication trends that have used genomics to address restoration and conservation questions. Our qualitative findings revealed varied perspectives on harnessing genomics. For example, scholars in restoration without genomics experience felt genomics was over-hyped. Scholars with genomics experience emphatically emphasized the need to proceed cautiously in using genomics in restoration. Both genomics-experienced and less-experienced scholars called for case studies to demonstrate the benefits of genomics in restoration. These qualitative data contrasted with our examination of research trends, which revealed 70 restoration genomics studies, particularly studies using environmental DNA as a monitoring tool. We provide a roadmap to facilitate the uptake of genomics into restoration, to help the restoration sector meet the monumental task of restoring huge areas to biodiverse and functional ecosystems.This article is part of the theme issue 'Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.

AB Over the past decade, biochar-supported nZVI composites (nZVI/biochar) have been developed and applied to treat various pollutants due to their excellent physical and chemical properties, especially in the field of chromium (VI) removal. This paper reviewed the factors influencing the preparation and experiments of nZVI/biochar composites, optimization methods, column experimental studies and the mechanism of Cr(VI) removal. The results showed that the difference in raw materials and preparation temperature led to the difference in functional groups and electron transfer capabilities of nZVI/biochar materials. In the experimental process, pH and test temperature can affect the surface chemical properties of materials and involve the electron transfer efficiency. Elemental doping and microbial coupling can effectively improve the performance of nZVI/biochar composites. In conclusion, biochar can stabilize nZVI and enhance electron transfer in nZVI/biochar materials, enabling the composite materials to remove Cr(VI) efficiently. The study of column experiments provides a theoretical basis for applying nZVI/biochar composites in engineering. Finally, the future work prospects of nZVI/biochar composites for heavy metal removal are introduced, and the main challenges and further research directions are proposed.

AB Background: Resilience in children with early family life adversity is linked with successful adulthood psychological outcomes. However, whether resilience influences daily emotional responses to stress remains unclear. This study examined whether resilience capacity in the context of early family risks predicts better daily stress and affect outcomes during a stressful transition.
   Methods: International and interstate undergraduates (N = 98; aged 18-25 years) were grouped as Resilient (high family risk, high resilience), Vulnerable (high family risk, low resilience), or Control (low family risk, average anxiety and depression). Daily negative (NA) and positive affect (PA), perceived stress, and stressors were assessed 4-times daily across 14 consecutive days (4333 total surveys; 73.7% completion rate). Affect reactivity was operationalized as the NA and PA slopes on perceived stress from each survey.
   Results: The Resilient group did not differ from the Control group on all outcomes. The Vulnerable group reported significantly higher number of stressors, perceived stress levels, NA, and NA reactivity than the Resilient and Control groups (all p < .001); as well as significantly lower PA (p = .024) and PA reactivity (p = .003) than the Control group.
   Limitations: Our findings are not generalizable to other populations and cannot determine causality.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that resilience capacity is protective against the effects of early family risks on a daily basis. However, significant findings were limited to emotional distress outcomes and not supported for PA, suggesting resilience capacity may attenuate emotional distress but not positive emotions in response to stress in emerging adults with family risk.

AB Globally, commercial fisheries for whelk (family Buccinidae) generally exhibit a boom-and-bust cycle that fuels overexploitation of resources. Channeled whelk Busycotypus canaliculatus is a commercially important species that supports a valuable fishery along the Atlantic coast of the United States. The fishery is managed at the state level, with minimum landing size varying by state. Biological studies of channeled whelk in New England and the mid-Atlantic region have indicated that females have a low probability of maturity upon entering their respective fisheries. The life history characteristics of channeled whelk, including slow growth, late maturation, and direct development paired with unsuitable minimum landing size, make this species vulnerable to overexploitation. Currently, the population genetic structure of channeled whelk is unknown, impeding the ability to appropriately inform management. This study used 2,570 single nucleotide polymorphisms to elucidate the population genetic structure of channeled whelk sampled from 10 locations ranging from Massachusetts to South Carolina. The data indicated seven genetically distinct populations across the sampled region of the U.S. Atlantic coast. Estimates of genetic divergence among populations spanned an order of magnitude (F-ST = 0.017-0.582), with higher levels of divergence observed when comparing populations separated by biogeographic barriers. Based on the magnitude of observed genetic differences, five regional management units are suggested. The results of this study will aid discussions among fisheries managers in Atlantic states aimed at the development of appropriate management plans. The complex population genetic structure revealed by this study underscores the need for more comprehensive sampling, including between fishing locations sampled in this study and among offshore locations, to better understand the population genetic structure of channeled whelk.

AB Urbanization is a major contributor to biodiversity declines. However, studies assessing effects of urban landscapes per se (i.e., disentangled from focal habitat effects) on biodiversity across spatial scales are lacking. Understanding such scale-dependent effects is fundamental to preserve habitats along an urbanization gradient in a way that maximizes overall biodiversity. We investigated the impact of landscape urbanization on communities of woodland-breeding bird species in individual (local scale) and across multiple (regional scale) cities, while controlling for the quality of sampled habitats (woodlands). We conducted bird point counts and habitat quality mapping of trees, dead wood, and shrubs in 459 woodlands along an urban to rural urbanization gradient in 32 cities in Sweden. Responses to urbanization were measured as local and regional total diversity (gamma), average site diversity (alpha), and diversity between sites (beta). We also assessed effects on individual species and to what extent dissimilarities in species composition along the urbanization gradient were driven by species nestedness or turnover. We found that landscape urbanization had a negative impact on gamma-, alpha-, and beta-diversity irrespective of spatial scale, both regarding all woodland-breeding species and red-listed species. At the regional scale, dissimilarities in species composition between urbanization levels were due to nestedness, that is, species were lost with increased landscape urbanization without being replaced. In contrast, dissimilarities at the local scale were mostly due to species turnover. Because there was no difference in habitat quality among woodlands across the urbanization gradient, we conclude that landscape urbanization as such systematically causes poorer and more homogeneous bird communities in adjacent natural habitats. However, the high local turnover and the fact that several species benefited from urbanization demonstrates that natural habitats along the entire urbanization gradient are needed to maintain maximally diverse local bird communities.

AB Invertebrates constitute the majority of animal species and are critical for ecosystem functioning and services. Nonetheless, global invertebrate biodiversity patterns and their congruences with vertebrates remain largely unknown. We resolve the first high-resolution (similar to 20-km) global diversity map for a major invertebrate clade, ants, using biodiversity informatics, range modeling, and machine learning to synthesize existing knowledge and predict the distribution of undiscovered diversity. We find that ants and different vertebrate groups have distinct features in their patterns of richness and rarity, underscoring the need to consider a diversity of taxa in conservation. However, despite their phylogenetic and physiological divergence, ant distributions are not highly anomalous relative to variation among vertebrate clades. Furthermore, our models predict that rarity centers largely overlap (78%), suggesting that general forces shape endemism patterns across taxa. This raises confidence that conservation of areas important for small-ranged vertebrates will benefit invertebrates while providing a "treasure map" to guide future discovery.

AB In this study, we examined the word superiority effect in Arabic and English, two languages with significantly different morphological and writing systems. Thirty-two Arabic-English bilingual speakers performed a post-cued letter-in-string identification task in words, pseudo-words, and non-words. The results established the presence of the word superiority effect in Arabic and a robust effect of context in both languages. However, they revealed that, compared to the non-word context, word and pseudo-word contexts facilitated letter identification more in Arabic than in English. In addition, the difference between word and pseudo-word contexts was smaller in Arabic compared to English. Finally, there was a consistent first-letter advantage in English regardless of the context, while this was more consistent only in the word and pseudo-word contexts in Arabic. We discuss these results in light of previous findings and argue that the differences between the patterns reported for Arabic and English are due to the qualitative difference between word morphophonological representations in the two languages.

AB BACKGROUND Salsola tragus is a widespread and problematic weed of semi-arid wheat production globally, and in the inland Pacific Northwest region of the USA. The species exhibits high levels of phenotypic diversity across its range and, at least in California USA, previous work has described cryptic diversity comprising a multi-species complex. Such cryptic diversity could suggest the potential for a differential response to management inputs between groups, and have important implications for the spread of herbicide resistance or other adaptive traits within populations. We used a genotyping-by-sequencing approach to characterize the population structure of S. tragus in the inland Pacific Northwest. RESULTS Our results indicated that the population in this region is comprised of a single, tetraploid species (S. tragus sensu latu) with weak population structure on a regional scale. Isolation-by-distance appears to be the primary pattern of structure, but an independent set of weakly differentiated clusters of unknown origin were also apparent, along with a mixed mating system and high levels of largely unstructured genetic diversity. CONCLUSIONS Despite considerable phenotypic variability within S. tragus in the region, agronomic weed managers can likely consider it as a single entity across the region, rather than a collection of cryptic subgroups with possible differential responses to management inputs or agroecosystem conditions. A lack of strong barriers to migration and gene flow mean that adaptive traits, such as herbicide resistance, can be expected to spread rapidly through populations across the region.

AB Due to its frequent misuse, the p value has become a point of contention in the research community. In this editorial, we seek to clarify some of the common misconceptions about p values and the hazardous implications associated with misunderstanding this commonly used statistical concept. This article will discuss issues related to p value interpretation in addition to problems such as p-hacking and statistical fragility; we will also offer some thoughts on addressing these issues. The aim of this editorial is to provide clarity around the concept of statistical significance for those attempting to increase their statistical literacy in Orthopedic research.

AB The ways in which genetic variation is distributed within and among populations is a key determinant of the evolutionary features of a species. However, most comprehensive studies of these features have been restricted to studies of subdivision in settings known to have been driven by local adaptation, leaving our understanding of the natural dispersion of allelic variation less than ideal. Here, we present a geographic population-genomic analysis of 10 populations of the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex, an emerging model system in evolutionary genomics. These populations exhibit a pattern of moderate isolation-by-distance, with an average migration rate of 0.6 individuals per generation, and average effective population sizes of similar to 650,000 individuals. Most populations contain numerous private alleles, and genomic scans highlight the presence of islands of excessively high population subdivision for more common alleles. A large fraction of such islands of population divergence likely reflect historical neutral changes, including rare stochastic migration and hybridization events. The data do point to local adaptive divergence, although the precise nature of the relevant variation is diffuse and cannot be associated with particular loci, despite the very large sample sizes involved in this study. In contrast, an analysis of between-species divergence highlights positive selection operating on a large set of genes with functions nearly nonoverlapping with those involved in local adaptation, in particular ribosome structure, mitochondrial bioenergetics, light reception and response, detoxification, and gene regulation. These results set the stage for using D. pulex as a model for understanding the relationship between molecular and cellular evolution in the context of natural environments.

AB Climate and land-use changes are expected to negatively affect many species and ecological processes, leading to biodiversity loss. However, some species can adapt to these changes. Wide-ranging species are expected to be less impacted by such changes, but they can occur in different domains with contrasting environmental conditions, resulting in different conservation statuses along their range. To understand whether a species will overall benefit or lose with global change, we evaluated the responses of a wide-ranging but a vulnerable bird (Crax fasciolata) to separate and combined effects of climate and land-use changes under different environmental policies in Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling and a land-use model within the Brazilian political context, we quantified climatic, habitat, and environmental suitability for Crax fasciolata under historical (2000) and future (2050) scenarios. Our findings showed that environmental suitability can increase for Crax fasciolata in Brazil in future, but these effects vary according to the domain and the specific future scenario considered. Climatically suitable areas will increase in all scenarios, and those environmental scenarios that include better habitat conditions will provide more environmentally suitable areas for Crax fasciolata. However, this increase comes from newly suitable areas in the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon, while the Pantanal, the Caatinga, and the Cerrado will lose environmental suitability due to native vegetation loss. Despite the availability of these new areas, reduced landscape permeability may hinder Crax fasciolata from reaching them. This reinforces the urgent call for public policies for native vegetation protection, reforestation, and effective deforestation control. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material

AB Increased temperature and prolonged soil moisture reduction have distinct impacts on tree photosynthetic properties. Yet, our knowledge of their combined effect is limited. Moreover, how species interactions alter photosynthetic responses to warming and drought remains unclear. Using mesocosms, we studied how photosynthetic properties of European beech and downy oak were impacted by multi-year warming and soil moisture reduction alone or combined, and how species interactions (intra- vs inter-specific interactions) modulated these effects. Warming of +5 degrees C enhanced photosynthetic properties in oak but not beech, while moisture reduction decreased them in both species. Combined warming and moisture reduction reduced photosynthetic properties for both species, but no exacerbated effects were observed. Oak was less impacted by combined warming and limited moisture when interacting with beech than in intra-specific stands. For beech, species interactions had no impact on the photosynthetic responses to warming and moisture reduction, alone or combined. Warming had either no or beneficial effects on the photosynthetic properties, while moisture reduction and their combined effects strongly reduced photosynthetic responses. However, inter-specific interactions mitigated the adverse impacts of combined warming and drought in oak, thereby highlighting the need to deepen our understanding of the role of species interactions under climate change.

AB Simple Summary Climate change is the main threat for conservation in the 21st century. Reliable methodologies and tools for the evaluation of its impact are urgently needed. Correlative ecological niche models (ENMs) are effective tools for predicting the future distribution of species under climate change scenarios. Despite this, many alternative different methods have been proposed, and objective reasons for a proper selection are unclear. Therefore, a comparative study to evaluate the consistency of predictions of the main ENM algorithms was performed. To test the effectiveness of correlative ENM temporal projection, we compared predictions generated using historical data and projected to the modern climate with predictions generated using modern distribution and climate data. In total, 600 case studies were generated, by using 25 Italian endemic plant species, 12 algorithms and 2 alternative sets of environmental variables. As a result, we highlighted the similarity of eight algorithms and the poor performance of four. Correlative ecological niche modelling (ENM) is a method widely used to study the geographic distribution of species. In recent decades, it has become a leading approach for evaluating the most likely impacts of changing climate. When used to predict future distributions, ENM applications involve transferring models calibrated with modern environmental data to future conditions, usually derived from Global Climate Models (GCMs). The number of algorithms and software packages available to estimate distributions is quite high. To experimentally assess the effectiveness of correlative ENM temporal projection, we evaluated the transferability of models produced using 12 different algorithms on historical and modern data. In particular, we compared predictions generated using historical data and projected to the modern climate (simulating a "future" condition) with predictions generated using modern distribution and climate data. The models produced with the 12 ENM algorithms were evaluated in geographic (range size and coherence of predictions) and environmental space (Schoener's D index). None of the algorithms shows an overall superior capability to correctly predict future distributions. On the contrary, a few algorithms revealed an inadequate predictive ability. Finally, we provide hints that can be used as guideline to plan further studies based on the adopted general workflow, useful for all studies involving future projections.

AB Abalone around the world are subject to increasing frequency of marine heatwaves, yet we have a limited understanding of how acute high temperature events impact the physiology of these commercially and ecologically important species. This study examines the impact of a 5 ? temperature increase over ambient conditions for six weeks on the metabolic rates, digestive enzyme activities in the digestive gland, and digestive efficiency of Red Abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and Paua (H. iris) on their natural diets. We test the hypothesis that abalone digestive function can keep pace with this increased metabolic demand in two separate experiments, one for each species. H. iris had higher food intake in the heat treatment. Both species had higher metabolic rates in the heat treatment with Q(10) = 1.73 and Q(10) = 2.46 for H. rufescens and H. iris, respectively. Apparent organic matter digestibility, protein digestibility, and carbohydrate digestibility did not differ between the heat treatment and the ambient (control) treatment in either experiment. H. rufescens exhibited higher maltase, alanine-aminopeptidase, and leucine-aminopeptidase activities in the heat treatment. Amylase, beta-glucosidase, trypsin, and alkaline phosphatase activities in the digestive gland tissue did not differ between temperature treatments. H. iris exhibited lower amylase and beta-glucosidase activities in the heat treatment, while maltase, trypsin, leucine-aminopeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase activities did not differ between treatments. We conclude that over six weeks of moderate heat stress both abalone species were able to maintain digestive function, but achieved this maintenance in species-specific ways.

AB Dyadic behavioral synchrony is a complex interactional process that takes place between the mother and her infant. In the first year of life, when the infant is prelinguistic, processes such as synchrony enable the dyad to communicate through shared behavior and affect. To date, no systematic review has been carried out to understand the risk and protective factors that influence behavioral synchrony in the mother-infant dyad. The aim of this review was to identify and evaluate the factors that influence behavioral synchrony in the mother-infant dyad, when the infant is between 3 and 9 months old. Key electronic databases were searched between 1970 and April 2021, and 28 eligible studies were identified for review. As the results were largely heterogeneous, four subgroups of factors were identified: (i) infant demographics, (ii) physiological factors, (iii) maternal mental health, and (iv) miscellaneous factors. Identified risk factors and covariates suggest that social determinants of health, underpinned by biological factors, play a large role in influencing behavioral synchrony within the dyad. Implications for the need to identify additional risk and protective factors, as well as design support for at-risk families are discussed.

AB Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a key negative emission technology in response to climate change. The industrial chain of BECCS is composed of multi-agent participants: farmers, middlemen, enterprises. This paper fills a gap in BECCS research by establishing a tripartite evolutionary game model and conducting system dynamics simulation to analyze the participants' interaction and strategy choices on system equilibrium in supply chain of BECCS under vertical integration operation model, and further discussing the influence of policy incentives on BECCS. The results show that the willingness of both enterprises and middlemen participate in the cooperation is very low under current scenario. Therefore, appropriate incentives must be taken to promote commercial deployment of BECCS. From sensitivity analysis, the following useful references for practical applications of BECCS in the future are obtained: Compared with other factors, costs of carbon storage have a more significant impact on the evolutionary trajectories and are highly sensitive to evolutionary equilibrium. The government should subsidize carbon utilization and electricity tariffs, but could not provide an initial investment subsidy for BECCS retrofit. Vigorously developing middlemen and promoting the improvement of carbon trading market and carbon tax policies are also of great significance to implementation of BECCS.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As vital pollinators, bumble bees play an important role in ecology and agricultural economy, but the decline in diversity and abundance has received widespread attention. Bumble bees of the subgenus Psithyrus are obligate social parasites that invade the nests of other bumble bees as part of their life cycle. This dependency on other colonies may make Psithyrus bumble bees vulnerable to decline and extinction. Hence, conservation strategies and potentially suitable habitats should be identified for these vulnerable species. Here, the potential distribution of a cuckoo bumble bee endemic to China, Bombus (Psithyrus) chinensis (Morawitz 1890) (Hymenoptera, Apidae), was predicted based on species distribution data and ten bioclimatic or environmental variables. Four important variables, namely, the minimum temperature of the coldest month, growing degree days, isothermality, and mean temperature of the warmest quarter, contributed the most to the distribution model. The maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) revealed that the potential distribution of B. chinensis was fragmented under current climate conditions. The areas of potential habitat with low suitability, moderate suitability, and high suitability were 455,451 km(2), 170,260 km(2), and 116,111 km(2), respectively. Eight provinces were evaluated as critical regions for B. chinensis conservation, especially Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan, and Ningxia Provinces. In conclusion, the results reveal a cuckoo bumble bee's fragmented distribution and provide a basis for its conservation strategies. The areas identified as highly suitable for B. chinensis should be considered primary conservation areas.

AB Simple Summary Leptocorisa (Hemiptera: Alydidae) species, which are pests to rice cultivation, have changed their habitats owing to climate change, suggesting the precautionary evaluation of the distribution of these pests. In this study, we targeted three major pests in Leptocorisa species (L. chinensis, L. acuta, and L. oratoria) and evaluated their potential distributions. Most of the recorded regions of the Leptocorisa species are consistent with the result of potential distributions predicted, and the model predicted that climate change would expand their habitats mostly under the effect of minimum temperature and precipitation varied by seasons. The potential distributions of three species were expected to cover major rice cultivation areas regardless of climate change, suggesting a necessity for establishing a sustainable control strategy for the pests. We targeted three major Leptocorisa species (L. chinensis, L. acuta, and L. oratoria) and evaluated their potential distributions using MaxEnt. The results showed that most Asian countries and northern Australia would be suitable for at least one of these pest species, and climate change will expand their habitat northward. All of the developed models were evaluated to be excellent with AUC, TSS, and OR10%. Most of the recorded regions of the Leptocorisa species are consistent with the result of potential distributions predicted in this study. The results confirmed that the minimum temperature of the coldest month mainly influences the three Leptocorisa species distributions. The potential distributions of the three species cover major rice cultivation areas regardless of climate change, suggesting that it would be necessary to establish a sustainable control strategy for the pests.

AB The genetic protective factors for cognitive decline in aging remain unknown. Predicting an individual's rate of cognitive decline-or with better cognitive resilience-using genetics will allow personalized intervention for cognitive enhancement and the optimal selection of target samples in clinical trials. Here, using genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS) of cognitive capacity as the genomic indicators for variations of human intelligence, we analyzed the 18-year records of cognitive and behavioral data of 8511 European-ancestry adults from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), specifically focusing on the cognitive assessments that were repeatedly administered to the participants with their average ages of 64.5 and 71.5. We identified a significant interaction effect between age and cognitive capacity GPS, which indicated that a higher cognitive capacity GPS significantly correlated with a slower cognitive decline in the domain of immediate memory recall (beta = 1.86 x 10(-1), p-value = 1.79 x 10(-3)). The additional phenome-wide analyses identified several associations between cognitive capacity GPSs and cognitive/behavioral phenotypes, such as similarities task (beta = 1.36, 95% CI = (1.22, 1.51), p-value = 3.59 x 10(-74)), number series task (beta = 0.94, 95% CI = (0.85, 1.04), p-value = 2.55 x 10(-78)), IQ scores (beta = 1.42, 95% CI = (1.32, 1.51), p-value = 7.74 x 10(-179)), high school classrank (beta = 1.86, 95% CI = (1.69, 2.02), p-value = 3.07 x 10(-101)), Openness from the BIG 5 personality factor (p-value = 2.19 x 10(-14), beta = 0.57, 95% CI = (0.42, 0.71)), and leisure activity of reading books (beta = 0.50, 95% CI = (0.40, 0.60), p-value = 2.03 x 10(-21)), attending cultural events, such as concerts, plays, or museums (beta = 0.60, 95% CI = (0.49, 0.72), p-value = 2.06 x 10(-23)), and watching TV (beta = -0.48, 95% CI = (-0.59, -0.37), p-value = 4.16 x 10(-18)). As the first phenome-wide analysis of cognitive and behavioral phenotypes, this study presents the novel genetic protective effects of cognitive ability on the decline of memory recall in an aging population.

AB Climate change is predicted to affect species in aquatic ecosystems. In Africa, factors that may influence the responses of aquatic species are poorly studied and challenging to predict. In this study, we examined the potential distribution of three aquatic fern species in the genus Azolla in Africa under projected climate change scenarios. MaxEnt was used to create ecological niche models of the three species using occurrence data and environmental variables. All models had satisfactory AUC and TSS values, indicating high prediction precision (AUC and TSS > 0.801). Results showed that elevation and precipitation were the most important variables limiting the species' expansion in the future. In addition, we observed significant variations in the climatic niches of the three species and their distinct climatically appropriate regions. The current potential distribution ranges for the species varied between 2,328,726 km(2) and 4,026,363 km(2). According to the model predictions for the current period, the potential range of Azolla species extended outside the known and recorded locations; however, under future climate conditions, the species were projected to lose between 8.1% and 48% of their suitable habitats due to climate change. Our findings can be used to develop sustainable conservation measures for aquatic species and raise awareness about the effects of climate change.

AB Understanding the underlying drivers of biodiversity is essential for conservation planning of large, connected seascapes. We tested how patterns in alpha and beta components of species and functional diversity of coral reef fish (214, species, 23 families) varied along the extensive Chagos Lakshadweep oceanic ridge (the largest chain of mid-oceanic atolls in the Indian Ocean) and evaluated geomorphological, environmental, and anthropogenic predictors of diversity patterns. alpha and beta diversity (species and functional) showed contrasting patterns along the ridge; richness and alpha diversity decreased towards the north and were influenced by anthropogenic pressures, while beta diversity increased towards the north, along environmental gradients and with geographic distance. Species beta diversity was dominated by turnover (> 80%), while functional beta diversity was dominated by nestedness (> 60%). Geographically distant reefs (> 2000 km apart) with high structural complexity were functionally similar, illustrating a ridge-wide capacity for reefs to maintain ecological structure and function despite significant differences in biodiversity. Low spatial congruence in different facets of biodiversity suggest differentiated management needs for reef fish communities along the Chagos-Lakshadweep ridge. Specifically, while a single large marine reserve may be effective for biodiversity conservation in the Chagos archipelago in the south, a network of several smaller conservation areas may be needed to confer resilience to densely populated and biologically differentiated reefs further north.

ID PREDICTION
AB Just-In-Time (JIT) defect models are classification models that identify the code commits that are likely to introduce defects. Cross-project JIT models have been introduced to address the suboptimal performance of JIT models when historical data is limited. However, many studies built cross-project JIT models using a pool of mixed data from multiple projects (i.e., data merging)-assuming that the properties of defect-introducing commits of a project are similar to that of the other projects, which is likely not true. In this paper, we set out to investigate the interpretation of JIT defect models that are built from individual project data and a pool of mixed project data with and without consideration of project-level variances. Through a case study of 20 datasets of open source projects, we found that (1) the interpretation of JIT models that are built from individual projects varies among projects; and (2) the project-level variances cannot be captured by a JIT model that is trained from a pool of mixed data from multiple projects without considering project-level variances (i.e., a global JIT model). On the other hand, a mixed-effect JIT model that considers project-level variances represents the different interpretations better, without sacrificing performance, especially when the contexts of projects are considered. The results hold for different mixed-effect learning algorithms. When the goal is to derive sound interpretation of cross-project JIT models, we suggest that practitioners and researchers should opt to use a mixed-effect modelling approach that considers individual projects and contexts.

AB Droughts negatively affect tree vitality, growth and mortality in temperate forests. Appropriate forest management may help mitigate these adverse effects. One such silvicultural system is coppicing, which increases a stand's drought resistance compared to high forests, but the underlying mechanisms are not well explored. Here, we aimed to deepen our mechanistic understanding of the performance of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) in response to drought stress. We compared mature trees, young coppice and seedlings. We measured seasonal variation of tree water status, photosynthesis, and biometric traits of sessile oak over three growing seasons. Coppicing increased water use and photosynthesis both under drought stress conditions and favorable conditions. During mild to severe drought, coppiced trees had better access to water and assimilated more carbon per unit of leaf area than seedlings and mature trees. The lowest predawn water potential of-4.21 MPa was recorded in seedlings, which was by 0.8 MPa less than in the coppice. Photosynthesis rates were highest in the coppice, but the water use efficiency of the coppice fell in between mature trees (higher WUEi) and seedlings (lower WUEi). Combined measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange suggested that coppice, seedlings and mature trees responded differently to drought. Coppice had the highest yield in light reactions of photosynthesis and the highest carbon assimilation. Coppicing improves the physiological vitality of young sprousts which makes it a suitable silvicultural system for dry sites.

AB Reduced precipitation and, consequently, low soil moisture are known to limit tree growth and function by affecting shoot and foliage development, as well as canopy-scale leaf area dynamics and litterfall. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) is considered one of the most drought-resistant forest species in the southeastern U.S. and could serve as a pathway to increase drought resistance of forests in the region. Still, reduced precipitation and low soil moisture impacts on longleaf canopy phenology and growth are not well understood. Over three years (2017-2019), we determined the effects of a 40% throughfall reduction (TR40) (relative to ambient throughfall treatment, TR0) on shoot and foliage phenology and growth in a young (12-14 yr. old) longleaf pine plantation. Each year, we repeatedly measured shoot and needle lengths on primary and secondary branch axes of multiple trees in each treatment plot. We fit growth curves for each tree and branch axis to estimate shoot and needle growth rate, growth start and cessation dates, growth duration (growth start - growth cessation), and final shoot and needle lengths. At the plot level, we documented temporal patterns of leaf area index (LAI) and litterfall to determine whether branch-scale phenological and growth responses to reduced water availability corresponded with temporal changes in LAI and litterfall. We observed significant and consistent differences in shoot and needle elongation patterns between primary and secondary branches. Timing of needle development varied among years and was generally later each successive year. However, shoot elongation patterns were relatively consistent across years. Although soil moisture was lower under throughfall reduction, shoot and needle growth patterns were not affected. LAI and litterfall patterns were also not affected by throughfall reduction. Our results indicate that reductions in rainfall amount (without changes in rainfall frequency or timing) may have little impact on shoot and needle phenology, canopy development, and litter production in established longleaf plantations.

AB Disentangling the evolutionary relationships of rapidly radiating clades is often challenging because of low genetic differentiation and potentially high levels of gene flow among diverging taxa. The genus Sporophila consists of small Neotropical birds that show, in general, relatively low genetic divergence, but particularly high speciation rates and pronounced variation in secondary sexual traits (e.g., plumage color), which can be important in generating premating reproductive isolation. In cases like these, the use of genome-wide sequence data can increase the resolution to uncover a clade's evolutionary history. Here, we used a phylogenomic approach to study the evolutionary history and genetic structure of the Variable Seedeater superspecies complex, which includes S. corvina, S. intermedia, and S. americana. Using similar to 25,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we confirmed that the Variable Seedeater superspecies complex is monophyletic. However, a phylogenetic reconstruction based on a mitochondrial marker (ND2) resulted in a discordant tree topology, particularly in the position of Wing-barred Seedeater S. americana, which might be due to a mitochondrial capture event. Our results suggest historical gene flow among lineages, particularly between species with conflicting topologies. Among the four phenotypically variable S. corvina subspecies, our structure analyses identified three main distinct genetic groups (K = 3), and that the entirely black subspecies, S. c. corvina, is derived from within a pied-colored clade. Further, we inferred widespread gene flow across the whole species' distribution, including between subspecies. However, gene flow was about 100 times lower at the geographic boundaries of the entirely black and the pied subspecies, suggesting an important role for plumage divergence in limiting gene flow. Overall, our findings suggest that the early diversification of the Sporophila genus occurred rapidly despite historical gene flow between lineages and that divergence in plumage color possibly influences the extent of gene flow among taxa.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) across past, present, and future timelines provide insights into the current distribution of these species and their reaction to climate change. Specifically, if a species is threatened or not well-known, the information may be critical to understand that species. In this study, we computed SDMs for Orientocoluber spinalis, a monotypic snake genus found in central and northeast Asia, across the past (last interglacial, last glacial maximum, and mid-Holocene), present, and future (2070s). The goal of the study was to understand the shifts in distribution across time, and the climatic factors primarily affecting the distribution of the species. We found the suitable habitat of O. spinalis to be persistently located in cold-dry winter and hot summer climatic areas where annual mean temperature, isothermality, and annual mean precipitation were important for suitable habitat conditions. Since the last glacial maximum, the suitable habitat of the species has consistently shifted northward. Despite the increase in suitable habitat, the rapid alterations in weather regimes because of climate change in the near future are likely to greatly threaten the southern populations of O. spinalis, especially in South Korea and China. To cope with such potential future threats, understanding the ecological requirements of the species and developing conservation plans are urgently needed.

AB Human activities can degrade the quality of coral reefs and cause a decline in fish species richness and functional diversity and an erosion of the ecosystem services provided. Environmental DNA metabarcoding (eDNA) has been proposed as an alternative to Underwater Visual Census (UVC) to offer more rapid assessment of marine biodiversity to meet management demands for ecosystem health indices. Taxonomic information derived from sequenced eDNA can be combined with functional traits and phylogenetic positions to generate a variety of ecological indices describing ecosystem functioning. Here, we inventoried reef fish assemblages of two contrasting coastal areas of Curacao, (i) near the island's capital city and (ii) in a remote area under more limited anthropogenic pressure. We sampled eDNA by filtering large volumes of seawater (2 x 30 L) along 2 km boat transects, which we coupled with species ecological properties related to habitat use, trophic level, and body size to investigate the difference in fish taxonomic composition, functional and phylogenetic indices recovered from eDNA metabarcoding between these two distinct coastal areas. Despite no marked difference in species richness, we found a higher phylogenetic diversity in proximity to the city, but a higher functional diversity on the more isolated reef. Composition differences between coastal areas were associated with different frequencies of reef fish families. Because of a partial reference database, eDNA only partly matched those detected with UVC, but eDNA surveys nevertheless provided rapid and robust species occurrence responses to contrasting environments. eDNA metabarcoding coupled with functional and phylogenetic diversity assessment can serve the management of coastal habitats under increasing threat from global changes.

AB Dispersal, the movement of individuals from their natal population to their breeding population, has important ecological and evolutionary consequences. In lotic freshwater systems, landscape features such as barriers or connectors, can affect dispersal and thus gene flow. It is of special interest to charac-terize population genetic structure in the presence of impassable barriers because they can restrict dis-persal and thus isolate populations. On the other hand, connectors such as man-made canals connect watersheds that would otherwise be isolated, thereby enhancing gene flow and potentially genetically homogenizing populations. Freshwater mussels (Order: Unionida), many of which are highly threatened, have a unique life history involving parasitism on host fish species for larval development and dispersal. Landscape features that affect fish passage will consequently affect mussel dispersal and the maintenance of populations and metapopulations. This manuscript explores how landscape features affect the popu-lation genetic structure and genetic diversity of the freshwater mussel species Lampsilis siliquoidea, Fatmucket, in the southwestern Lake Ontario drainage. Data from seven microsatellite loci revealed that 1) waterfalls act as barriers for gene flow between freshwater mussel populations within the same river, 2) populations above the barrier had lower genetic diversity, 3) there was no detectable effect of man-made canals on genetic diversity and, 4) populations that were not hydrologically connected by a canal were marginally more differentiated than the populations connected by a canal. Landscape features can alter the connectivity within and between drainages thus changing the scale at which management will be effective.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

AB Inadvertent social information (ISI) use, i.e., the exploitation of social cues including the presence and behaviour of others, has been predicted to mediate population-level processes even in the absence of cohesive grouping. However, we know little about how such effects may arise when the prey population lacks social structure beyond the spatiotemporal autocorrelation originating from the random movement of individuals. In this study, we built an individual-based model where predator avoidance behaviour could spread among randomly moving prey through the network of nearby observers. We qualitatively assessed how ISI use may affect prey population size when cue detection was associated with different probabilities and fitness costs, and characterised the structural properties of the emerging detection networks that would provide pathways for information spread in prey. We found that ISI use was among the most influential model parameters affecting prey abundance and increased equilibrium population sizes in most examined scenarios. Moreover, it could substantially contribute to population survival under high predation pressure, but this effect strongly depended on the level of predator detection ability. When prey exploited social cues in the presence of high predation risk, the observed detection networks consisted of a large number of connected components with small sizes and small ego networks; this resulted in efficient information spread among connected individuals in the detection networks. Our study provides hypothetical mechanisms about how temporary local densities may allow information diffusion about predation threats among conspecifics and facilitate population stability and persistence in non-grouping animals.
   Significance statement
   The exploitation of inadvertently produced social cues may not only modify individual behaviour but also fundamentally influence population dynamics and species interactions. Using an individual-based model, we investigated how the detection and spread of adaptive antipredator behaviour may cascade to changes in the demographic performance of randomly moving (i.e., non-grouping) prey. We found that social information use contributed to population stability and persistence by reducing predation-related per capita mortality and raising equilibrium population sizes when predator detection ability reached a sufficient level. We also showed that temporary detection networks had structural properties that allowed efficient information spread among prey under high predation pressure. Our work represents a general modelling approach that could be adapted to specific predator-prey systems and scrutinise how temporary local densities allow dynamic information diffusion about predation threats and facilitate population stability in non-grouping animals.

AB Increasing urbanisation is one of the primary drivers of land-use change that threaten biodiversity. Wild bee communities have been reported with contrasting responses to urbanisation, with varying effects on abundance and taxonomical diversity. The suite of functional traits exhibited by wild bee species might determine their persistence in urban areas. Urbanisation thus can impose an environmental filter with potential consequences on the functional and phylogenetical diversity of wild bee communities.
   Here, we sampled 2944 wild bee specimens from156 species in 29 sites located along an urbanisation gradient using a replicated design in three mid-sized cities in the Loire valley (France). We show that urban landscape cover has a negative effect on overall species richness and taxonomical diversity indices, while total abundance remains constant. Species loss was taxon dependent, mainly driven by Andrenidae and Halictidae. Only a fewspecies, especially of the genus Lasioglossum, were positively affected by the urban landscape cover.
   Urban and peri-urban areas differed in their composition of bee assemblages. Species turnover was the main component of beta diversity, driving community dissimilarities through the urban gradient. Urbanisation favours bees with small body sizes, social structure and extended flight periods but did not affect the phylogenetic or the functional diversity of communities.
   Our findings have implications for understanding the factors involved in the environmental filter exerted through the urban gradient on bee communities helping to implement conservation measures and managing urban spaces for bees.

AB Background Green-fleshed radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is an economically important root vegetable of the Brassicaceae family, and chlorophyll accumulates in its root tissues. It was reported that the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors play vital roles in the process of chlorophyll metabolism. Nevertheless, a comprehensive study on the bHLH gene family has not been performed in Raphanus sativus L. Results In this study, a total of 213 Raphanus sativus L. bHLH (RsbHLH) genes were screened in the radish genome, which were grouped into 22 subfamilies. 204 RsbHLH genes were unevenly distributed on nine chromosomes, and nine RsbHLH genes were located on the scaffolds. Gene structure analysis showed that 25 RsbHLH genes were intron-less. Collineation analysis revealed the syntenic orthologous bHLH gene pairs between radish and Arabidopsis thaliana/Brassica rapa/Brassica oleracea. 162 RsbHLH genes were duplicated and retained from the whole genome duplication event, indicating that the whole genome duplication contributed to the expansion of the RsbHLH gene family. RNA-seq results revealed that RsbHLH genes had a variety of expression patterns at five development stages of green-fleshed radish and white-fleshed radish. In addition, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis confirmed four RsbHLH genes closely related to chlorophyll content. Conclusions A total of 213 RsbHLH genes were identified, and we systematically analyzed their gene structure, evolutionary and collineation relationships, conserved motifs, gene duplication, cis-regulatory elements and expression patterns. Finally, four bHLH genes closely involved in chlorophyll content were identified, which may be associated with the photosynthesis of the green-fleshed radish. The current study would provide valuable information for further functional exploration of RsbHLH genes, and facilitate clarifying the molecular mechanism underlying photosynthesis process in green-fleshed radish.

AB Low cadmium (Cd) accumulation in a rice cultivar is shown to be due to duplication of the manganese/cadmium transporter gene. Introgression of this allele into an elite rice cultivar lowered Cd accumulation in rice grain without penalty of grain yield and eating quality when grown in Cd-contaminated soil.
   Global contamination of soils with toxic cadmium (Cd) is a serious health threat. Here we found that a tandem duplication of a gene encoding a manganese/Cd transporter, OsNramp5, was responsible for low-Cd accumulation in Pokkali, an old rice cultivar. This duplication doubled the expression of OsNramp5 gene but did not alter its spatial expression pattern and cellular localization. Higher expression of OsNramp5 increased uptake of Cd and Mn into the root cells but decreased Cd release to the xylem. Introgression of this allele into Koshihikari, an elite rice cultivar, through backcrossing significantly reduced Cd accumulation in the grain when cultivated in soil heavily contaminated with Cd but did not affect both grain yield and eating quality. This study not only reveals the molecular mechanism underlying low-Cd accumulation but also provides a useful target for breeding rice cultivars with low-Cd accumulation.

AB Simple Summary The Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis, is a worldwide invasive creature that has invaded the world for more than 20 years. Although previous studies have predicted the distribution range of A. glabripennis, this single species distribution prediction cannot provide more potential management strategies for the control of invasive organisms. In this study, we incorporated two important natural enemies (D. helophoroides and D. major) of A. glabripennis into the prediction model. We found that climate change led to the northward migration of the suitable areas of A. glabripennis and its natural enemies. In China, only the occurrence regions of A. glabripennis are mainly distributed in parts of Xinjiang, Xizang, and Qinghai. In other occurrence regions of A. glabripennis, control models of A. glabripennis + D. helophoroides, A. glabripennis + D. major, or A. glabripennis + D. helophoroides + D. major were found. Fortunately, part of the areas in Xinjiang, Xizang, and Qinghai are potentially suitable for D. helophoroides and D. major under future climatic conditions. Therefore, these two natural enemies may be used in these regions to control A. glabripennis in the future. The Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis, is a forestry pest found worldwide. A. glabripennis causes serious harm because of the lack of natural enemies in the invaded areas. Dastarcus helophoroides and Dendrocopos major are important natural enemies of A. glabripennis. MaxEnt was used to simulate the distribution of D. helophoroides and D. major in China, and their suitable areas were superimposed to pinpoint which regions are potentially appropriate to release or establish natural enemy populations under current and future conditions. The results showed that, with climate change, the suitable areas of D. helophoroides and D. major migrated northward; the centroid shift of A. glabripennis was greater than those of D. helophoroides and D. major. From current conditions to 2090, the suitable area of A. glabripennis, D. helophoroides, and D. major will increase by 1.44 x 10(4), 20.10 x 10(4), and 31.64 x 10(4) km(2), respectively. Northern China (e.g., Xinjiang, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia), where A. glabripennis causes more serious damage, is also a potentially suitable area for D. helophoroides and D. major, and this provides a potential strategy for the management of A. glabripennis. Therefore, we suggest that natural enemies should be included in the model used for predicting suitable areas for invasive pests.

AB The Lined Seedeater (Sporophila lineola) is a small intra-tropical migrant songbird. However, little is known about its breeding and wintering grounds, or migratory habits. To investigate potentially distinct breeding populations and the migratory schedule of Lined Seedeaters we analysed its spatial and temporal distribution using published breeding records, museum vouchers, and data from citizen science projects (eBird and WikiAves). Our findings suggest that there are three main breeding areas: northern Argentina and north-western Paraguay, south-eastern Brazil, and north-eastern Brazil, and that the breeding season seems to be restricted to November through May, with slight differences in timing among these three areas. The species winters in the northern part of South America (mostly in grassland areas) and maybe also in the Amazonia. Moreover, rainfall predicts the latitudinal and longitudinal movements of Lined Seedeaters, with the migratory movements associated with an increase in rainfall. Taken together, these results provide a first comprehensive overview on the migration of Lined Seedeater, calling for further empirical field studies. Understanding intra-tropical migratory patterns is paramount to comprehend the potential impacts of environmental change in tropical ecosystems.

AB The Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3 domains (LIM) transcription factors play essential roles in regulating plant biological processes. Despite that, there is a lack of a full understanding of LIMs in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, 28 wheat LIM s (TaLIMs) were identified and designated as TaLIM1-1A to TaLIM12-7D. The cis-regulatory element analysis showed that TaLIMs were rich in elements related to biological and abiotic stresses. Expression profiling analysis showed that certain members of TaLIMs were responsive to biotic and abiotic stresses, such as TaLIM1-1A, TaLIM3-2B, TaLIM8-4D, and TaLIM10-5D, were significantly induced by heat, drought, sodium chloride (NaCl), abscisic acid (ABA) and Fusarium graminearum stresses. Furthermore, the biological function of TaLIM8-4D was analyzed and results showed that it was subcellular localization in the nucleus and could induce weak cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Additionally, overexpression of TaLIM8-4D could upregulate plant pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, promoting the infection of hemibiotrophic pathogen, implying that TaLIM8-4D could function as susceptible gene in the nucleus by upregulating PR genes and inducing cell death to promote the colonization of hemibiotrophic agent F. graminearum. Overall, the systematic identification, characterization, expression profiling, evolutionary, and function analyses provided the ability to understand TaLIMs and laid a foundation for the further function study of LIM family members in wheat.

AB All mammals experience different life stages as they develop, each of which is characterised by particular physical and behavioural changes. Despite the emergence of sophisticated behaviour analysis techniques, the ways in which social behaviour varies by life stage, and how this is influenced by an individual's sex, is relatively understudied in most social mammals other than primates and elephants. Understanding the social requirements of mammals should be a central and critical component to their conservation, captive management and welfare. Here, we apply social network analysis techniques to understand how social behaviour differs with life stage in the giraffe, a gregarious fission-fusion mammal. We studied two wild populations of giraffes in Kenya and found that adolescents have significantly stronger associations with adolescents of their own sex first and foremost, then adults of their own sex. Other associations were significantly lower than would be expected, or non-significant. Our results suggest that adolescence in both male and female giraffes shares similar features to adolescence in other social mammal species. We discuss how the application of such knowledge might improve the management and welfare of captive giraffes.

AB Green areas are key habitats for urban avifauna. Urban parks stand out from other anthropic habitats especially in providing trophic resources for many bird species. Consequently, modifications of these green zones can imply major changes in urban biodiversity. Potential pernicious urban remodelling is taking place in parks of eastern Spain because natural grass is being replaced with artificial grass to save water and to avoid management. This study aimed to determine whether remodelled parks with artificial grass harbour lower avian diversity (alpha, beta and gamma diversity) than traditional parks with natural grass. We surveyed 21 parks with artificial grass and 24 parks with natural grass in 18 towns of the Valencia Region in autumn 2020. In each park, we carried out 5-minute and 25-m radius point counts for determining bird species and their abundance. The effects of park area and grass type on alpha diversity (species richness, Shannon diversity index, Pielou's Evenness and total abundance) were tested by means of GLMs. Differences in beta diversity and its components (nestedness and turnover) were also analyzed with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index. Gamma diversity was assessed by means of species accumulation curves. Finally, differences in community composition were tested by PERMANOVA and SIMPER tests. The parks with natural grass always harboured higher gamma diversity, species richness and abundance. Turnover was higher in parks with natural grass, whereas nestedness was higher in artificial grass parks. Differences in community composition were due mainly to abundance differences in common ground-feeding birds. We highlight that the trend of replacing natural by artificial grass in urban parks has harmful effects on urban bird communities and is a threat to bird conservation. Although artificial grass might save water, the effects on urban biodiversity should be carefully evaluated.

AB Lignin, one of the most abundant polymers in plants, is derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway, which also gives rise to an array of metabolites that are essential for plant fitness. Genetic engineering of lignification can cause drastic changes in transcription and metabolite accumulation with or without an accompanying development phenotype. To understand the impact of lignin perturbation, we analyzed transcriptome and metabolite data from the rapidly lignifying stem tissue in 13 selected phenylpropanoid mutants and wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Our dataset contains 20,974 expressed genes, of which over 26% had altered transcript levels in at least one mutant, and 18 targeted metabolites, all of which displayed altered accumulation in at least one mutant. We found that lignin biosynthesis and phenylalanine supply via the shikimate pathway are tightly co-regulated at the transcriptional level. The hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) grouped the 13 mutants into 5 subgroups with similar profiles of mis-regulated genes. Functional analysis of the DEGs in these mutants and correlation between gene expression and metabolite accumulation revealed system-wide effects on transcripts involved in multiple biological processes.
   Analysis of transcripts and metabolites in wild-type and 13 lignin biosynthetic mutants of Arabidopsis reveals the global impact on transcription and metabolite network perturbations.

AB Gender disparities in negotiation outcomes contribute to inequality in the workplace and beyond. Explanations of gender gaps in negotiation often focus on internal barriers women face as a consequence of contending with stigma in the workplace and other historically male-dominated environments, such as stereotype threat and apprehension about negotiating. However, stigma is also associated with relational consequences that may influence success in negotiations. This research compared internal and relational mechanisms for gender disparities in negotiation performance. Seventy-seven MBA executives reported their apprehension about negotiating, stereotype threat in negotiations, mindset about negotiation-related stress, and class social networks. Participants were then randomly paired to complete a series of one-on-one negotiations based on real-world scenarios. Overall, men outperformed women in negotiations. Significant gender differences emerged in stereotype threat, stress mindset, and social network centrality. However, only network centrality-specifically number and strength of ties-significantly mediated the relationship between gender and negotiation performance. Position in informal social networks may play an important role in negotiation outcomes, particularly in a shared social environment like the workplace. Although efforts to explain the gender gap in negotiation performance often center internal psychological mechanisms, this research suggests that relational explanations, such as disparities in social networks, merit further attention. Limitations and recommendations for future research and policy are discussed.

AB A widespread increase in tree mortality has been observed around the globe, and this trend is likely to continue because of ongoing climate-induced increases in drought frequency and intensity. This raises the need to identify regions and ecosystems that are likely to experience the most frequent and significant damage. We present SurEau-Ecos, a trait-based, plant hydraulic model designed to predict tree desiccation and mortality at scales from stand to region. SurEau-Ecos draws on the general principles of the SurEau model but introduces a simplified representation of plant architecture and alternative numerical schemes. Both additions were made to facilitate model parameterization and large-scale applications. In SurEau-Ecos, the water fluxes from the soil to the atmosphere are represented through two plant organs (a leaf and a stem, which includes the volume of the trunk, roots and branches) as the product of an interface conductance and the difference between water potentials. Each organ is described by its symplasmic and apoplasmic compartments. The dynamics of a plant's water status beyond the point of stomatal closure are explicitly represented via residual transpiration flow, plant cavitation and solicitation of plants' water reservoirs. In addition to the "explicit" numerical scheme of SurEau, we implemented a "semi-implicit" and "implicit" scheme. Both schemes led to a substantial gain in computing time compared to the explicit scheme (> 10 000 times), and the implicit scheme was the most accurate. We also observed similar plant water dynamics between SurEau-Ecos and SurEau but slight disparities in infra-daily variations of plant water potentials, which we attributed to the differences in the representation of plant architecture between models. A global model's sensitivity analysis revealed that factors controlling plant desiccation rates differ depending on whether leaf water potential is below or above the point of stomatal closure. Total available water for the plant, leaf area index and the leaf water potential at 50 % stomatal closure mostly drove the time needed to reach stomatal closure. Once stomata are closed, resistance to cavitation, residual cuticular transpiration and plant water stocks mostly determined the time to hydraulic failure. Finally, we illustrated the potential of SurEau-Ecos to simulate regional drought-induced mortality over France. SurEau-Ecos is a promising tool to perform regional-scale predictions of drought-induced hydraulic failure, determine the most vulnerable areas and ecosystems to drying conditions, and assess the dynamics of forest flammability.

AB As a porous and carbon material, biochar is focused on respectively in sequestrating carbon and stabilizing metals in soil, while few studies attempted to design biochar for simultaneously achieving these two targets. This study proposed to produce phosphorus-composite biochar for synchronously enhancing carbon sequestration and heavy metals immobilization. Two phosphorus materials from tailings, Ca(H2PO4)(2) and Ca-5(PO4)(3)(OH), were selected as modifier to load into biomass prior to pyrolysis. Results showed that incorporating P not only increased pyrolytic C retention in biochar by 36.1-50.1%, but also obtained biochar with higher stability by chemically formation of COP, C-PO3 and C-2-PO2. After 90-day incubation with soil, more C was sequestrated in the P-biochar amended soil (59.6-67.0%) than those pristine biochar (43.2-46.6%). Highly soluble Ca(H2PO4)(2) was more efficient than Ca-5(PO4)(3)(OH) in this regard. Meanwhile, these P-composite biochar exhibited more Pb/Cd immobilization (31.3-92.3%) compared with the pristine biochar (9.5-47.2%), which was mainly due to the formation of stable precipitates Pb-5(PO4)(3)Cl and Cd-3(PO4)(2), especially for Ca-5(PO4)(3)(OH) modification. Additionally, P-composite biochar "intelligently " altered soil microbial community, i.e., they suppressed Actinobacteria proliferation, which is correlated to carbon degradation, while promoted Proteobacteria growth, facilitating phosphate dissolution for ready reaction with heavy metals to form precipitate, benefiting the Pb and Cd immobilization. A dual functions biochar was engineered via simply loading phosphorous prior to pyrolysis and simultaneously enhanced carbon sequestration and heavy metal immobilization.

AB Copy number variation (CNV) can cause phenotypic changes. However, in contrast to amino acid substitutions and cis-regulatory changes, little is known about the functional categories of genes in which CNV is important for adaptation to novel environments. It is also unclear whether the same genes repeatedly change the copy numbers for adapting to similar environments. Here, we investigate CNV associated with freshwater colonization in fishes, which was observed multiple times across different lineages. Using 48 ray-finned fishes across diverse orders, we identified 23 genes whose copy number increases were associated with freshwater colonization. These genes showed enrichment for peptide receptor activity, hexosyltransferase activity and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. We further revealed that three of the genes showed copy number increases in freshwater populations compared to marine ancestral populations of the stickleback genus Gasterosteus. These results indicate that copy number increases of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (FADS2), immune function (PSMB8a) and thyroid hormone metabolism (UGT2) may be important for freshwater colonization at both the inter-order macroevolutionary scale and at the intra-genus microevolutionary scale. Further analysis across diverse taxa will help to understand the role of CNV in the adaptation to novel environments.This article is part of the theme issue 'Genetic basis of adaptation and speciation: from loci to causative mutations'.

AB Research on using biochar for environmental applications has witnessed unprecedented advances in the past decade. Biochar is universally considered one of the best alternatives to store carbon to fight global warming. Thus, the sequential use of biochar in environmental remediation compatible with carbon sequestration is receiving growing attention. One of the reasons for such huge interest is the possibility to engineer biochar with targeted properties (e.g., surface area and chemistry) relevant to existing environmental issues. These properties can be achieved by selecting appropriate raw materials, processing conditions, carbonization technology, and the possibility of selecting postproduction modification approaches. The objective of this review is to summarize strategies to enhance biochar properties relevant to its use in environmental services (e.g., water purification, air/gas cleaning, construction materials, soil amendments) and the corresponding results on the use of this material for these applications. The main methods for enhancing biochar properties for environmental applications reviewed include activation (physical and chemical), oxidation, metal and metal oxide modification, metal-free heteroatom doping, and biological modification. Both modified and unmodified biochars have been used for soil amendments as adsorbents of pollutants in the aqueous phase (e.g., removal of P and N, heavy metals, and organic pollutants), adsorbents of pollutants in the gas phase (e.g., biogas cleaning), as a catalyst, as an additive for improving anaerobic digestion, and as an admixture to cementitious/construction materials, with promising results in all cases. New opportunities for using biochar are being reported as the science of biochar production, modification, and use advances.

AB The shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization (selfing) is considered one of the most prevalent evolutionary transitions in flowering plants. Selfing species tend to share similar reproductive traits in morphology and function, and such a set of traits is called the 'selfing syndrome'. Although the genetic basis of the selfing syndrome has been of great interest to evolutionary biologists, knowledge of the causative genes or mutations was limited until recently. Thanks to advances in population genomic methodologies combined with high-throughput sequencing technologies, several studies have successfully unravelled the molecular and genetic basis for evolution of the selfing syndrome in Capsella, Arabidopsis, Solanum and other genera. Here we first introduce recent research examples that have explored the loci, genes and mutations responsible for the selfing syndrome traits, such as reductions in petal size or in pollen production, that are mainly relevant to pre-pollination processes. Second, we review the relationship between the evolution of selfing and interspecific pollen transfer, highlighting the findings of post-pollination reproductive barriers at the molecular level. We then discuss the emerging view of patterns in evolution of the selfing syndrome, such as the pervasive involvement of loss-of-function mutations and the relative importance of selection versus neutral degradation.This article is part of the theme issue 'Genetic basis of adaptation and speciation: from loci to causative mutations'.

AB Temperature is a key climate indicator, whose distribution is expected to shift right in a warming world. However, the high-temperature tolerance of trees is less widely understood than their drought tolerance, especially when it comes to sub-lethal impacts of temperature on tree growth. I use a large data set of annual tree ring widths, combined with a flexible degree day model, to estimate the relationship between temperature and tree radial growth. I find that tree radial growth responds non-linearly to temperature across many ecoregions of the United States: across temperate and/or dry ecoregions, spring-summer temperature increases are beneficial or mostly neutral for tree growth up to around 25-30 degrees C in humid climates and 10-15 degrees C in dry climates, beyond which temperature increases suppress growth. Thirty additional degree days above the optimal temperature breakpoint lead to an average decrease in tree ring width of around 1%-5%, depending on ecoregions, seasons, and inclusion or exclusion of temperature-mediated drought impacts. High temperatures have legacy effects across a 5-year horizon in dry ecoregions, but none in the temperate-humid South-East or among temperature-sensitive trees. I find limited evidence that trees acclimatize to high temperatures within their lifetime: local variation in early exposure to high temperatures, which stems from local variation in the timing of tree birth, does not significantly impact the response to high temperatures, although temperature-sensitive trees acquire some heightened sensitivity from early exposure. I also find some evidence that trees adapt to high temperatures in the long run: across humid ecoregions of the United States, high temperatures are 40% less harmful to tree growth, where their average incidence is one standard deviation above average. Overall, these results highlight the strength of a new methodology which, applied to representative tree ring data, could contribute to predicting forest carbon uptake potential and composition under global change.

AB We aim to identify the importance of vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil water content (SWC) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) as drivers of tree canopy conductance, which is a key source of uncertainty for modelling vegetation responses under climate change. We use sap flow time series of 1858 trees in 122 sites from the SAPFLUXNET global database to obtain whole-tree canopy conductance (G). The driver importance, defined as the percentage of variance (R2) of G explained by the three main hydrometeorological drivers (VPD, SWC and PPFD), was evaluated using linear mixed models. For each driver we assess differences in their importance among biomes, and use multiple linear regression to explain how driver importance varies with climate, soil and vegetation structure. We found that in most areas tree canopy conductance is better explained by VPD than by SWC or PPFD, although results for drylands were inconclusive. Climate, soil and vegetation structure were common controls for the importance of all three hydrometeorological drivers, with wetter climates, fine-textured soils and tall vegetation being associated with stronger influence of the driver on G. Differences across sites in the importance of the hydrometeorological drivers of tree canopy conductance may affect predictions of ecosystem dynamics under future climates, and should be accounted for explicitly in models.

AB The increase in the global population and industrialization has induced an unprecedented increase in biogenic wastes. These biogenic wastes are a potential source of energy and a suitable alternative to energy from nonrenewable fossil fuels. Thermochemical technologies are effective ways to transform wastes biomass into biofuels and value-added biochemicals. However, non-catalytic thermochemical conversion technologies are associated with challenges such as low yield, undesirable byproducts and higher levels of heteroatoms affecting the quality of final fuel products. Therefore, there is a need for innovative catalytic approaches to mitigate such challenges. In this review article, various catalyst and their synthesis pathways have been highlighted with specific applications in thermocatalytic conversion technologies. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art review was performed to discuss the impacts of catalysts on the production of biofuels and biochemicals via pyrolysis, gasification, liquefaction, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and polysaccharides conversion. In addition, an attempt has been made to address the challenges posed by catalysts and their synthesis routes by evaluating the effect of different process parameters.

AB Spatially explicit population genetic models have long been developed, yet have rarely been used to test hypotheses about the spatial distribution of genetic diversity or the genetic divergence between populations. Here, we use spatially explicit coalescence simulations to explore the properties of the island and the two-dimensional stepping stone models under a wide range of scenarios with spatio-temporal variation in deme size. We avoid the simulation of genetic data, using the fact that under the studied models, summary statistics of genetic diversity and divergence can be approximated from coalescence times. We perform the simulations using gridCoal, a flexible spatial wrapper for the software msprime (Kelleher et al., 2016, Theoretical Population Biology, 95, 13) developed herein. In gridCoal, deme sizes can change arbitrarily across space and time, as well as migration rates between individual demes. We identify different factors that can cause a deviation from theoretical expectations, such as the simulation time in comparison to the effective deme size and the spatio-temporal autocorrelation across the grid. Our results highlight that F-ST, a measure of the strength of population structure, principally depends on recent demography, which makes it robust to temporal variation in deme size. In contrast, the amount of genetic diversity is dependent on the distant past when N-e is large, therefore longer run times are needed to estimate N-e than F-ST. Finally, we illustrate the use of gridCoal on a real-world example, the range expansion of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) since the last glacial maximum, using different degrees of spatio-temporal variation in deme size.

AB Global climate change and the increase in the frequency and intensity of drought have led to widespread forest decline and tree mortality. Studying the resilience components of tree growth to drought, including resistance (Rt), recovery (Rc), and resilience (Rs) and the influencing factors, helps assess forests' production and ecological stability under a changing climate. This study analyzed the responses of three resilience components of natural Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) to drought events by examining individual-tree characteristics in two sites of Hulunbuir using the linear mixed effect model. The result showed that drought severity, diameter at breast height (dbh), pre drought growth, and growth variability prior to drought had significant effects on the three resilience components of Mongolian pine growth. Specifically, as drought severity, dbh and growth variability increased, the Rt and Rs decreased, but Rc increased, showing a trade-off relationship with Rt. However, the Rt, Rc, and Rs decreased with pre drought growth. Inter-tree competition and tree age also significantly impacted two resilience components. Besides, the interaction term between tree competition and tree age negatively affects Rt and Rs but positively affects Rc. Our findings highlight the influence of drought severity and individual-tree characteristics on drought resilience components, which can serve the adaptive management of natural Mongolian pine forests in the future.

AB Aim Changes in climatic conditions are predicted to impact species distribution and hence alter their diversity patterns. Modifications in the composition of biological communities are expected as a result of the loss and replacement of species due to global warming. Forest frugivorous birds already suffer from habitat loss and may disappear locally due to suitable area contraction or range shifts to novel areas, disrupting seed dispersal and consequently the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here, we investigate the impacts of different climate scenarios on alpha and beta diversities of forest frugivorous birds. Location Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest (CCAF), Brazil. Methods We used ecological niche models to project species distribution of 68 frugivorous birds for the baseline and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios. We generated binary maps of suitable areas for each species by climate scenario to calculate alpha and beta diversities. Results Most forest frugivorous birds were projected to lose suitable area, as a consequence of climate change, reducing alpha diversity in future scenarios and increasing temporal beta diversity, which is dominated by the nestedness component. In addition, species richness decreased from the east to the west portion of the CCAF, while differentiation of bird communities increased in the same direction, a pattern consistent across all climate scenarios evaluated. Main conclusions Climate change may exert drastic alterations in the composition of frugivorous bird communities in the CCAF. As forest frugivorous birds are critical to seed dispersal of forest plant species, impoverishment of their communities can drastically affect forest regeneration, diversity, and structure in the decades to come. Therefore, a better comprehension of spatio-temporal changes in diversity patterns of frugivorous birds can help us to avoid the disruption of seed dispersal and its consequences, such as cascading effects that will trigger biodiversity loss in the CCAF.

AB The prevalence and intensity of parasitism can have different fitness costs between sexes, and across species and developmental stages. This variation could arise because of species specific sexual and developmental differences in body condition, immunity, and resistance. Theory predicts that the prevalence of parasitism will be greater in individuals with poor body condition and the intensity of parasitism will be greater in individuals with larger body size. These predictions have been tested and verified in vertebrates. In insects, however, contradictory evidence has been found in different taxa. Here, we tested these predictions on two species of Agriocnemis (Agriocnemis femina and Agriocnemis pygmaea) damselflies, which are parasitized by Arrenurus water mite ectoparasites. We measured body weight, total body length, abdomen area and thorax area of non-parasitized damselflies and found body condition varied between males and females, between immature females and mature females and between A. femina and A. pygmaea. Then, we calculated the parasite prevalence, i.e., the absence or presence of parasites and intensity, i.e., the number of parasites per infected damselfly in eleven natural populations of both species. In line to our predictions, we observed greater prevalence in immature females than mature females but found no difference in parasite prevalence between males and females. Furthermore, we found that parasite intensity was higher in females than males and in immature females than mature females. Our result also showed that the frequency and intensity of parasitism varied between the two studied species, being higher in A. pygmaea than A. femina. Our study provides evidence that parasitism impacts sexes, developmental stages and species differentially and suggests that variation may occur due to sex, developmental stage, and species-specific resistance and tolerance mechanism.

AB Assembly of plant communities has long been scrutinized through the lens of trait-based ecology. Studies generally analyse functional traits related to the vegetative growth, survival and resource acquisition and thus ignore how assembly rules may affect plants at other stages of their life cycle, particularly when seeds disperse, persist in soil and germinate. Here, we analysed an extensive dataset of 16 traits for 167 species measured in-situ in 36 grasslands located along an elevation gradient and studied the impact of abiotic filtering, biotic interactions and dispersal on traits reflecting different trait categories: plant vegetative growth, germination, dispersal and seed morphology. For each community, we quantified community-weighted means (CWMs) and functional diversity (FD) for all traits and established their relationships to mean annual temperature. The seed traits were weakly correlated with vegetative traits. Therefore, these traits constituted independent axes of plant phenotypical variation that could be affected differently by community assembly rules. Abiotic filtering impacted mostly vegetative traits and to a lesser extent seed germination and morphological traits. Increasing low-temperature stress in upland sites selected for short-stature, slow-growing and frost-tolerant species that produce small quantities of small seeds with high degree of dormancy, high temperature requirements for germination and low germination speed. Biotic interactions, specifically competition in the lowlands and facilitation in uplands, also filtered some functional traits in the studied communities. The benign climate in lowlands seems to promote plant with competitive strategies that include fast growth and resource acquisition (vegetative growth traits) and early and fast germination (germination traits), whereas the effects of facilitation on the vegetative and germination traits were cancelled out by the strong abiotic filtering. The changes in the main dispersal vector from zoochory to anemochory along the elevation gradient strongly affected the dispersal and the seed morphological trait structure of the communities. This may be explained by stronger vertical turbulence and moderate warm upwinds and low grazing intensity in the uplands that select for light and non-round shaped seeds with lower terminal velocity and endozoochorous potential. Synthesis. We demonstrate that, in addition to vegetative traits, seed traits can substantially contribute to functional structuring of plant communities along environmental gradients. Thus, the 'hard' seed traits related to germination and dispersal are critical to detect multiple, complex community assembly rules. Consequently, such traits should be included in core lists of plant traits and, when applicable, be incorporated into the analysis of community assembly.

AB Multilevel models are used ubiquitously in the social and behavioral sciences and effect sizes are critical for contextualizing results. A general framework of R-squared effect size measures for multilevel models has only recently been developed. Rights and Sterba (2019) distinguished each source of explained variance for each possible kind of outcome variance. Though researchers have long desired a comprehensive and coherent approach to computing R-squared measures for multilevel models, the use of this framework has a steep learning curve. The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce and demonstrate using a new R package - r2mlm - that automates the intensive computations involved in implementing the framework and provides accompanying graphics to visualize all multilevel R-squared measures together. We use accessible illustrations with open data and code to demonstrate how to use and interpret the R package output.

AB Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in humans and is generally diagnosed through visual means. Since it is essential to detect this type of cancer in its early phases, one of the challenging tasks in developing and designing digital medical systems is the development of an automated classification system for skin lesions. For the automated detection of melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer, using dermoscopic images, convolutional neural network (CNN) models are getting noticed more than ever before. This study presents a new model for the early detection of skin cancer on the basis of processing dermoscopic images. The model works based on a well-known CNN-based architecture called the VGG-16 network. The proposed framework employs an enhanced architecture of VGG-16 to develop a model, which contributes to the improvement of accuracy in skin cancer detection. To evaluate the proposed technique, we have conducted a comparative study between our method and a number of previously introduced techniques on the International Skin Image Collaboration dataset. According to the results, the proposed model outperforms the compared alternative techniques in terms of accuracy.

AB Key message Transpiration of urban Pinus tabulaeformis was strongly controlled by leaf stomata and its positive response to leaf water potential and whole-tree hydraulic conductance during soil droughts. Many studies have elucidated the response of urban tree transpiration to environmental factors, but little is known about how soil water alters canopy conductance (G(c)), leaf water potential, the whole-tree hydraulic conductance (K), and their influences on canopy transpiration (E-c). In this study, sap flow, leaf water potential, and environmental factors were measured in a 60-year-old Pinus tabulaeformis plantation in a semi-arid urban environment of northern China. We found E-c, G(c), and K (0.11 +/- 0.01 mm d(-1), 0.13 +/- 0.01 mm s(-1), and 0.007 +/- 0.001 kgm(-2) h(-1) MPa-1, respectively) under soil water-stressed conditions were significantly lower than that (0.32 +/- 0.01 mm d(-1), 0.34 +/- 0.01 mm s(-1), and 0.042 +/- 0.004 kg m(-2) h(-1) MPa-1, respectively) under non-water-stressed conditions (p < 0.05). Leaf water potential at predawn and midday (psi(m)) and the hydrodynamic water potential gradient from roots to shoots was relatively constant, with averages of -1.25 +/- 0.26 MPa, -1.87 +/- 0.19 MPa, and 0.62 +/- 0.20 MPa, respectively. G(c) was negatively related to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) but was positively correlated to soil volume water content (VWC) and wind speed when soil water was relatively sufficient. As soil drought progressed, G(c) was more impacted by VWC and was negatively associated with air temperature to reduce water loss, but it was positively related to psi(m) and K. These findings indicated that urban P. tabulaeformis could control transpiration by strict stomatal regulation and maintain a constant water potential gradient to avoid a hydraulic breakdown during soil droughts.

AB Multipartite viruses have a segmented genome, with each segment encapsidated separately. In all multipartite virus species for which the question has been addressed, the distinct segments reproducibly accumulate at a specific and host-dependent relative frequency, defined as the 'genome formula'. Here, we test the hypothesis that the multipartite genome organization facilitates the regulation of gene expression via changes of the genome formula and thus via gene copy number variations. In a first experiment, the faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV), whose genome is composed of eight DNA segments each encoding a single gene, was inoculated into faba bean or alfalfa host plants, and the relative concentrations of the DNA segments and their corresponding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were monitored. In each of the two host species, our analysis consistently showed that the genome formula variations modulate gene expression, the concentration of each genome segment linearly and positively correlating to that of its cognate mRNA but not of the others. In a second experiment, twenty parallel FBNSV lines were transferred from faba bean to alfalfa plants. Upon host switching, the transcription rate of some genome segments changes, but the genome formula is modified in a way that compensates for these changes and maintains a similar ratio between the various viral mRNAs. Interestingly, a deep-sequencing analysis of these twenty FBNSV lineages demonstrated that the host-related genome formula shift operates independently of DNA-segment sequence mutation. Together, our results indicate that nanoviruses are plastic genetic systems, able to transiently adjust gene expression at the population level in changing environments, by modulating the copy number but not the sequence of each of their genes.

AB Pathogen transmission depends on host density, mobility and contact. These components emerge from host and pathogen movements that themselves arise through interactions with the surrounding environment. The environment, the emergent host and pathogen movements, and the subsequent patterns of density, mobility and contact form an 'epidemiological landscape' connecting the environment to specific locations where transmissions occur. Conventionally, the epidemiological landscape has been described in terms of the geographical coordinates where hosts or pathogens are located. We advocate for an alternative approach that relates those locations to attributes of the local environment. Environmental descriptions can strengthen epidemiological forecasts by allowing for predictions even when local geographical data are not available. Environmental predictions are more accessible than ever thanks to new tools from movement ecology, and we introduce a 'movement-pathogen pace of life' heuristic to help identify aspects of movement that have the most influence on spatial epidemiology. By linking pathogen transmission directly to the environment, the epidemiological landscape offers an efficient path for using environmental information to inform models describing when and where transmission will occur.

AB Food security and carbon emissions are major challenges for China and the international community. To investigate the effects of different subsoiling depths on summer maize grain yield and soil carbon emissions, in 2016 and 2018, three tillage treatments, that is, rotary tillage at the depth of 15 cm (R15), subsoiling tillage at the depth of 40 cm (S40), and subsoiling tillage at the depth of 35 cm (S35), were set before winter wheat sowing. The effects of different tillage treatments on summer maize grain yield and soil carbon emissions were analyzed. The results showed that compared with R15, subsoiling increased the microbial biomass carbon in the 20-40 cm soil layers, and improved the soil respiration rate and CO2-C cumulative emissions. The grain yield was increased by subsoiling, especially S35 (8.30% and 13.89% in 2018 and 2019, respectively). The carbon emission efficiency in S35 was significantly higher than that in S40. Altogether, we found that the best performance on grain yield of summer maize and carbon emission efficiency occurred in S35. S35 could be used to coordinate the relationship between summer maize grain yield and soil carbon emission. Therefore, this treatment can be applied and promoted in the NCP.

AB Establishing an effective restoration program requires baseline genetic information to make sound decisions for seed increase and transfer. For many plants this information is lacking, especially among native forbs that are critical for pollinator health. Erigeron speciosus is a widespread, perennial forb occupying montane environments in the western United States and Canada. This species is important in fostering pollinator diversity. Our study examines the population genetic patterns across the species range using reduced-representation sequencing and surveys for genome duplication using flow cytometry and cytology. These genomic tools provide critical information for seed increase and seed transfer, necessary for restoration programs. Population genetic differentiation (F-ST) average was 0.13 and ranged from 0.05 to 0.24 among 23 collection sites. Model-based Bayesian clustering supported a model with collection sites grouped into two populations, occupying distinct geographic regions of this species range. A genetic distance-based neighbor-joining tree also supported this division. Flow cytometry of 53 samples from 17 populations had 2C values that ranged from 1.7 to 3.6 pg with a mean 2C value of 2.3 pg. Putative triploids were found in two individuals from one collection site. The spatial distribution of genetic structure supports regionally based taxonomic descriptions of two varieties: speciosus in the North and macranthus in the South. This assessment of genetic structure and genome duplication describes an effective approach in developing baseline genetic information for restoration species, especially those species that may harbor complex taxonomy and polyploidy.

We tested how maras adapt to the forced separation of pair-bonded partners and how the potential new mates perform over the breeding season and during the process of forming new pairs. Fourteen established pairs from a captive population were randomly assigned to a control (C-group; N = 7) or an experimental (E-group; N = 7) condition. The experiment consisted of replacing seven paired males with seven socially unfamiliar males (new potential mates). Individual behaviour and social interactions were recorded over a 6-month period (spring-summer; i.e. 14 sessions) from 0800 to 1800 hours, totalling 11 hourly sampling points per session. We measured pair behaviours and degree of general behavioural synchrony over sessions 1-7 (early) and over sessions 8-14 (late). We also measured how social disruption affected the social networking of individuals forming new pair bonds as compared to individuals with established mates. We furthermore assessed the level of activity of females exposed to mate switching and the production of offspring over the breeding season. In the E-group, maras showed a reduction in pair behaviours and synchronization of activities. There were also multiple interactions among females with several males, revealing initial mate choice activity during the early time period. The period of mate choice was characterized by instability in social networking and changes in the strength of a pair's fidelity. Although the E-group included five newly established pairs, offspring production was similar to that of the C-group. Our findings show that after presumably stressful experimental social disruption, most maras re-paired in captivity, although with some delay in offspring production, suggesting that this species has the plasticity to cope with male partner loss under semi controlled environmental conditions. However, the strength of monogamous bonds was affected by this social disruption. (C) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to their substantial volume, subsoils contain more of the total soil carbon (C) pool than topsoils. Much of this C is thousands of years old, suggesting that subsoils offer considerable potential for long-term C sequestration. However, knowledge of subsoil C behaviour and manageability remains incomplete, and subsoil C storage potential has yet to be realised at a large scale, particularly in agricultural systems. A range of biological (e.g. deep-rooting), chemical (e.g. biochar burial) and physical (e.g. deep ploughing) C sequestration strategies have been proposed, but are yet to be assessed. In this review, we identify the main factors that regulate subsoil C cycling and critically evaluate the evidence and mechanistic basis of subsoil strategies designed to promote greater C storage, with particular emphasis on agroecosystems. We assess the barriers and opportunities for the implementation of strategies to enhance subsoil C sequestration and identify 5 key current gaps in scientific understanding. We conclude that subsoils, while highly heterogeneous, are in many cases more suited to long-term C sequestration than topsoils. The proposed strategies may also bring other tangible benefits to cropping systems (e.g. enhanced water holding capacity and nutrient use efficiency). Furthermore, while the subsoil C sequestration strategies we reviewed have large potential, more long-term studies are needed across a diverse range of soils and climates, in conjunction with chronosequence and space-for-time substitutions. Also, it is vital that subsoils are more consistently included in modelled estimations of soil C stocks and C sequestration potential, and that subsoil-explicit C models are developed to specifically reflect subsoil processes. Finally, further mapping of subsoil C is needed in specific regions (e.g. in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, South and Central America, South Asia and Africa). Conducting both immediate and long-term subsoil C studies will fill the knowledge gaps to devise appropriate soil C sequestration strategies and policies to help in the global fight against climate change and decline in soil quality. In conclusion, our evidence-based analysis reveals that subsoils offer an untapped potential to enhance global C storage in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Simple Summary Lacewings are insects with a great diversity of morphology and habits and are potentially important as bioindicators and biological control agents. However, there is little worldwide information on their patterns of distribution and diversity. Therefore, it is essential to understand what changes occur in their diversity through spatial changes such as elevation. We analyzed Neuroptera diversity locally and between sites through an elevation gradient, finding two marked trends: (1) a decrease in richness with increasing altitude and, (2) greater diversity and potential richness at an intermediate elevation. In addition, a high degree of species turnover means that there is an evident transition between the lowland communities and the forest in the upper parts of the volcano, reflecting an altitudinal replacement of species and exclusivity for certain altitudes. These patterns will help us understand the distribution diversity of lacewings for better management and conservation of insects and the ecosystems with which they are associated. Neuroptera is an order of insects with a moderate diversity of species numbers yet a high between-family morphological diversity, which has a significant ecological role as a predator. However, there are few studies focused on describing changes in species diversity along environmental gradients. We evaluated changes in the alpha and beta diversity of species and the higher taxa in Neuroptera communities in the Tacana Volcano in southern Mexico. Five sites each at different altitudes were studied through systematic annual sampling. The taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha diversity were analyzed, as well as the beta diversity and its components, species turnover and nestedness. The alpha diversity had two trends: (1) decreased standardized richness and taxonomic distinctness with increasing altitude, and (2) increased estimated richness and species diversity at intermediate altitudes. The highest turnover values for species, as well as for supra-specific taxa, were recorded at sites with lower altitudes. The highest total beta diversity value was recorded at elevations above 3000 m, whereas the highest number of species and supra-specific taxa were observed at sites between 600 and 2000 m, with an evident decrease above 3000 m. The type of vegetation and environmental conditions may be influencing the decrease in diversity toward higher elevations, which could explain the niche specialization of Neuroptera species to particular sites within the gradient. These results highlight the need to study the environmental factors and their effects on species composition along an elevation gradient.

AB Reliable identification of individuals plays an important role in behavioural studies of free-ranging animal populations. In field studies of elephants, the naturally acquired markings on their ears, such as notches, tears and holes, are frequently used for individual identification. Although not as easily discernible from a distance as ear markings, the facial wrinkle pattern around the eye, temporal gland and ear on both sides of elephant's head are individually unique and, with application of high-resolution photographs, can also be used for individual identification. In fact, the wrinkle pattern is highly consistent and reliable as the primary identifiable feature; it changes little over time, facilitates identification of individuals with non-distinctive ear pattern (e.g., calves), and performs well against several practical challenges to the traditional ear-pattern approach. We used data from a 3-year photo-identification study of African elephant population to examine how the two identification methods, one that uses marks on elephant ears and the other using facial wrinkle pattern, affect the results of basic analyses of social dynamics, such as patterns of associations and social preferences, derived from datasets generated with these two identification methods. Comparative analyses demonstrate that by increasing the identifiability of otherwise poorly marked individuals and minimising identification error, the wrinkle-based method reduces substantially the sample bias, enhances the robustness of datasets, and minimises analytical error. While ear-pattern-based distinctiveness is age-dependent, the wrinkle-based method facilitates a more representative sample of the population, with photo-ID data collected non-discriminately across all age classes. This carries further implications, such as enabling more accurate depiction of elephant sociality, long-term population monitoring, calculation of class-specific population parameters, etc. Adopting the facial wrinkle pattern for elephant individual identification is relatively easy, and we encourage future and ongoing studies to consider incorporating the facial wrinkle approach. Given the advantages of wrinkle-based identification and recent advances in machine learning, we recommend it to be considered for the development of automated matching algorithms; such development would benefit long-term socio-behavioural studies and monitoring of elephant populations.

AB The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is a strictly myrmecophagous xenarthran species that ranges from Honduras to northern Argentina, occupying various habitats, from grassland and floodplains to forests. According to the IUCN, it is a vulnerable species mainly threatened by poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation, and road kills. Here, we investigate the phylogeography, distribution, ecology, and historical demography of Brazilian populations of the giant anteater. We analysed two mitochondrial (mtDNA) and three nuclear (nDNA) markers in 106 individuals from the Cerrado, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest, and Amazon Forest biomes through analyses of population structure and demography, phylogeography, and ecological niche modelling. Two divergent mtDNA clusters were found, one in the Amazon (AM) and another in the Cerrado, Pantanal, and Atlantic Forest biomes (CEPTAF). At the population level, CEPTAF presented higher mtDNA haplotype richness than AM and a unidirectional mtDNA gene flow was identified from AM to CEPTAF, which could be linked to more favourable habitat conditions for the species in Cerrado and Pantanal. Paleodemographic reconstructions with mtDNA and nDNA data indicate a large population expansion of the species starting at the end of the Pleistocene. Finally, the integrative phylogeographic analyses of giant anteater populations reinforce the importance of the Brazilian Cerrado as a priority biome for the species' conservation.

AB Several studies have addressed the potential biorefinery, through small-scale pyrolysis, of coffee silverskin (CSS), grape pomace (GP) and olive mill waste (OMW), which are respectively the main solid residues from coffee roasting, wine making and olive oil production processes. However, increasing the scale of reactor to bring these studies to an industrial level may affect the properties, and hence applications, of the resulting products. The aim of this study is therefore to perform pilot scale experiments to compare and verify the results of analytical study (TGA) and bench scale reactor runs, in order to understand the fundamental differences and create correlations between pyrolysis runs at different scales. To this end, pyrolysis liquids and biochars from the slow pyrolysis of CSS, GP and OMW, performed using different scale auger reactors (15 kg/h and 0.3 kg/h), have been analysed (TGA, pH, density, proximate and ultimate analyses, HHV, FTIR, GCMS) and compared. The results showed no major differences in biochars when the temperature and the solid residence time were fixed. However, regarding pyrolysis liquids, compounds from the lab reactor were more degraded than pilot plant ones, due to, in this case, the vapour residence time was longer. Regarding the properties of the pyrolysis products, GP 400 degrees C biochars showed the best properties for combustion; CSS biochars were especially rich in nitrogen, and 400 degrees C GP and OMW pyrolysis liquids showed the highest number of phenolics. Hence, this study is considered a first step towards industrial scale CSS, GP and OMW pyrolysis-based biorefinery.

AB Soil is the largest terrestrial reservoir of organic carbon and is central for climate change mitigation and carbon-climate feedbacks. Chemical and physical associations of soil carbon with minerals play a critical role in carbon storage, but the amount and global capacity for storage in this form remain unquantified. Here, we produce spatially-resolved global estimates of mineral-associated organic carbon stocks and carbon-storage capacity by analyzing 1144 globally-distributed soil profiles. We show that current stocks total 899 Pg C to a depth of 1 m in non-permafrost mineral soils. Although this constitutes 66% and 70% of soil carbon in surface and deeper layers, respectively, it is only 42% and 21% of the mineralogical capacity. Regions under agricultural management and deeper soil layers show the largest undersaturation of mineral-associated carbon. Critically, the degree of undersaturation indicates sequestration efficiency over years to decades. We show that, across 103 carbon-accrual measurements spanning management interventions globally, soils furthest from their mineralogical capacity are more effective at accruing carbon; sequestration rates average 3-times higher in soils at one tenth of their capacity compared to soils at one half of their capacity. Our findings provide insights into the world's soils, their capacity to store carbon, and priority regions and actions for soil carbon management.
   Mineral-organic associations play a key role in soil carbon preservation. Here, Georgiou et al. produce global estimates of mineral-associated soil carbon, providing insight into the world's soils and their capacity to store carbon

AB Simple Summary The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has one of the most abundant aquatic biodiversity in China, and it is a hotspot of global biodiversity research. In the present study, we explored the diversity, distribution, and biogeography of freshwater fishes in Guangxi. Our results showed that 380 species of freshwater fishes were recorded in Guangxi; the species diversity from northwest to southeast gradually decreased for most Sub-basins; the spatial turnover component was the main contributor to beta diversity; the freshwater fish system belonged to the South China division in the Southeast Asiatic subregion of the Oriental region. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has the largest number of cavefish species in the world and is a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, a species list of freshwater fishes in 12 Sub-basins of Guangxi was compiled systematically. Moreover, the species composition and distribution of the diversity were analyzed via the G-F index, taxonomic diversity index, and beta diversity index. Results showed that 380 species of freshwater fishes were recorded in this region, which belonged to 158 genera in 43 families and 17 orders in 2 phyla, in which 128 species of endemic fishes and 83 species of cavefish accounted for 33.68% and 21.84%, respectively. The species diversity from northwest to southeast gradually decreased for most Sub-basins. The G-F index has generally risen in recent years. The taxonomic diversity index showed that the freshwater fish taxonomic composition in Guangxi is uneven. The spatial turnover component was the main contributor to beta diversity. A cluster analysis showed that the 12 Sub-basins in the study area could be divided into four groups, and the phylogenetic relationships of freshwater fishes in Guangxi generally reflect the connections between water systems and geological history. The freshwater fish system in Guangxi, which belonged to the South China division in the Southeast Asiatic subregion of the Oriental region, originated in the early Tertiary period. The results will provide the information needed for freshwater fish resource protection in Guangxi and a reference for promoting the normalization of fish diversity conservation in the Pearl River Basin and other basins.

AB With the looming threat of abrupt ecological disruption due to a changing climate, predicting which species are most vulnerable to environmental change is critical. The life-history of a species is an evolved response to its environmental context, and therefore a promising candidate for explaining differences in climate-change responses. However, we need broad empirical assessments from across the world's ecosystems to explore the link between life history and climate-change responses. Here, we use long-term abundance records from 157 species of terrestrial mammals and a two-step Bayesian meta-regression framework to investigate the link between annual weather anomalies, population growth rates, and species-level life history. Overall, we found no directional effect of temperature or precipitation anomalies or variance on annual population growth rates. Furthermore, population responses to weather anomalies were not predicted by phylogenetic covariance, and instead there was more variability in weather responses for populations within a species. Crucially, however, long-lived mammals with smaller litter sizes had smaller absolute population responses to weather anomalies compared with their shorter living counterparts with larger litters. These results highlight the role of species-level life history in driving responses to the environment.

AB Negative emissions are increasingly seen as a policy option to limit climate change. However, the most readily available technologies that could deliver negative emissions require, if deployed at scale, large amounts of land, with huge risks for livelihoods and the environment. This land is often assumed to be in the Global South. This article analyzes the nascent policy discourse on negative emissions by assessing 116 policy documents by 97 organizations with a focus on land-based technologies (afforestation and reforestation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, soil carbon sequestration). We conclude that this policy discourse is largely centered in the Global North (mostly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany), with only five organizations directly linked to the Global South. 61% of the organizations in our sample, however, somehow refer to the Global South in their contributions, with nongovernmental organizations being most strongly focused on the role of the Global South and in particular the risks for vulnerable countries. While the earlier policy discourse on negative emissions was linked to a more general "geoengineering" discourse, this link has loosened in the last years. Overall, in the documents that we studied, negative emissions technologies seem to become more accepted, and parts of the discourse shift towards deployment. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage seems more often associated with risks if compared to other land-based negative emissions technologies, especially with a view to the Global South.

AB The interspecific and temporal dynamics of tree water use are poorly understood. We investigated in hightemporal resolution patterns of water use of two tree species, Platycladus orientalis and Quercus variabilis, in a temperate mountainous monsoon forest in northern China. We leverage a unique sampling design where we systematically traced tree water source of ten individuals continuously throughout a three-year period (2015-2017) using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, coupled with root distribution assessment and measurements of transpiration rates. We observed species-specific patterns in tree water use. Q. variabilis withdrew water evenly from different soil layers without detectable seasonal changes in pattern in water use throughout the different years. By contrast, P. orientalis increases shallow source water uptake during the rainy season in all three years. Isotopic composition of both species plotted along an evaporation line below the local meteoric water line (LMWL). However, during sporadic periods in the rainy and transition season, P. orientalis plotted on the LMWL and showed similar isotopic to spring water. This suggests an ephemeral ecohydrological connectivity between tree water source and spring water during short periods within the wet and transition season. The observed distinct patterns in tree water use between the two species may be associated with root distribution characteristics. Besides root morphological traits, our data also suggest that the influence of overall stem volume (Vob) on water source contribution depends on the rainfall and species. Our results support the seasonality of ecohydrological separation observed in previous studies. Additionally, our data show that that ecohydrological separation may be species dependent in a temperate mountainous monsoon forest.

AB Delaying metamorphosis in low-temperature conditions by anuran larvae known as 'overwintering' have been poorly studied, especially in terms of habitat ecology and behavioural aspects. The present study investigates some of the ecological aspects of overwintering tadpoles of the genus Nanorana in the Western Himalaya in an anthropogenically modified stream where check dams have altered the natural habitat, which can potentially influence the amphibian ecology. We present insights on the influence of check dams on the tadpole activity pattern and morphometric traits useful in the conservation planning of the narrowly distributed and understudied species, which are most sensitive to habitat modification. We monitored natural and modified pool habitats in the stream during winter and post-winter seasons based on the visual density of tadpoles to assess the diurnal and seasonal emergence pattern with associated habitat variables. Generalized Linear Mixed Modeling (GLMM) was used to understand the influence of various habitat variables on the visible density of tadpoles. Fine-scale temporal scan sampling of tadpoles was carried out to complement the understanding of the visible density variation and analyzed using circular plots and activity overlap estimation. Variation in morphometric traits was assessed using field morphometry and photogrammetry. Mean tadpole visible density at nighttime was higher in modified pools than natural pools during winter, but there was no statistically significant difference during daytime; the nocturnal pattern changed in the post-winter, where visible density was higher in natural pools. Tadpole visible density was influenced by the interaction of mean canopy cover with water temperature, instream cover items richness, mean canopy cover percentage, water temperature, leaf litter depth, water velocity and interaction of time of the day with pool modification. Tadpole activity patterns varied significantly between pool types during post-winter, where modified pool population increased daytime activity and thus the activity overlap reduced from winter (90.8%) to post-winter (64.5%). During both seasons, the mean body size of the natural pool population was significantly lower than the modified pool population; mean relative tail length was significantly lower in natural pools during post-winter; mean tail depth was significantly lower in natural pools during winter. The study presents evidence of the influence of anthropogenic habitat alterations on behaviour and morphometric traits of overwintering tadpoles, which needs to be further investigated. We also discuss the variation in nocturnal emergence, habitat selection and morphometric trait patterns in the modified habitat, potential reasons and similar behaviour in other aquatic organisms, which need to be considered while developing conservation strategies for the overwintering tadpoles in the region.

AB The up-surging population in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has led to the conversion of more land for agricultural purposes. Resilient land utilization types that input carbon to the soil are key in enhancing climate change mitigation. However, there are limited data on different land utilization types' contribution to climate mitigation through carbon input to soils. The study aims to quantify carbon stock across different land utilization types (LUT) practiced in Western Kenya. The following land utilization types were studied: agroforestry M (agroforestry with Markhamia lutea), sole sorghum, agroforestry L (agroforestry with Leucaena leucocephalaI), sole maize, and grazing land replicated thrice. To determine soil bulk density, SOC concentration, and soil carbon stock, soil samples were collected at depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm from different LUTs. A PROC ANOVA was used to determine the difference in soil bulk density, SOC, and SOC stock between different LUTs and depths. The four variables differed across the LUTs and depths. A high soil bulk density was observed at 0-5 cm under grazing land (1.6 g cm(-3)) and the lowest under agroforestry M (1.30 g cm(-3)). Conversely, the soil bulk density was low at 20-30 cm under grazing land. The 0-5 cm depth accounted for a high share of SOC and SOC stock under Agroforestry M, while the 10-20 and 20-30 cm depth accounted for the high share of SOC stock under agroforestry L. The study showed differences in SOC across the different depths and LUTs. The findings highlight that agroforestry L and agroforestry M are promising interventions toward climate mitigation through carbon induction to soils.

AB Drought and desertification have become a worldwide ecological problems, which pose new challenges for plant survival and adaptation. Thus, it is of great significance to explore the adaptive strategies of plants to drought stress for the survival and sustainable development of man-made ecosystem in desert. In this study, two drought treatments of control (10-day irrigation cycle) and drought (no irrigation) respectively were used to study the physiological and morphological acclimation of Haloxylon ammodendron (C.A. Mey) Bunge and Calligonum arborescens Litv, in a man-made landscape of the Taklimakan desert shelter belt. The results showed that not only significant difference for stomatal conductance and water potential was presented in this research for two species, but also the morphological difference. In response to drought, C. arborescens produced significantly shorter and thicker leaves, while H. ammodendron produced significantly shorter and thinner leaves. Addition-ally, for C. arborescens, non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) were significantly aggregated in the roots (P < 0.05), while in H. ammodendron NSC exhibited no significant change in leaves, stems, or roots, but significantly accumulated in the whole plant. The different leaf water potential psi l for two species leading to a different WUE. In all, the two species exhibited different acclimation responses to drought, C. arborescens with a great higher WUE in drought, but H. ammodendron was smaller. Morphological adjustment was the main mechanism by which C. arborescens acclimated to drought, and it can be used as a "pioneer "sand-fixation species in deserts if resources enough. In contrast, H. ammodendron acclimated to drought by physiological adjustment dominated by stomatal closure, suggesting it could be used in sustainable development of ecological restoration areas.

AB In recent years, Central European forests and trees have been severely suffered from drought events in the growing season. To examine the tree growth response to drought stress, measurements of annual shoot lengths (ASL) of various tree species with distinct ages and habitats were taken in southeast Germany. The index of relative ASL increase (RAI), which is a standardized ASL increase, was calculated to indicate the growth rate of various tree species between the non-drought (2015-2017) and the drought period (2018-2020). The results showed the ASLs of most early-young trees (< 10 years) significantly showed a decreasing tendency in the drought period, whereas the middle-young (11-15 years) and late-young trees (> 16 years) presented a relatively stable trend. The ring-porous species with anisohydric behavior were likely to have higher RAIs associated with higher drought tolerance than diffuse-porous species with isohydric behavior. However, tree growth rate did not correlate with drought tolerance (resistance) of tree species indicated by leaf turgor loss point (psi(tlp), MPa). Therefore, this study suggested parameters, such as growth rate, age phases, and microhabitats, should be considered to predict tree species' drought tolerance other than psi(tlp). Finally, we emphasized tree shoot growth responses to drought were affected by multiple internal and external factors, and strongly depended on species-and site-specific characteristics, such as age phases, xylem structure, hydraulic strategy, microhabitat, grafting effect, and competition. ASL measurement can be recommended to be an easy, fast, and effective method to detect tree growth rate and response to environmental stress.

AB Objective: Weight suppression refers to the difference between an individual's current and highest body weight at their current height. Higher weight suppression has been found to predict weight gain in both non-clinical samples and patients with eating disorders. Few studies also have reported interactive effects between weight suppression and current body mass index when predicting weight gain.
   Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed clinical records of inpatients with anorexia nervosa (N = 2191, 97% female) and tested whether weight suppression and body mass index at admission would interactively predict different weight trajectories during treatment.
   Results: Body weight increased non-linearly during treatment. Higher weight suppression predicted larger weight gain but the nature of this effect depended on body mass index at admission. In patients with a relatively low body weight at admission, those with high weight suppression started at a lower weight and showed a nearly linear and steeper weight gain than those with low weight suppression. In patients with a relatively high body weight at admission, those with high weight suppression started at a similar weight and showed a non-linear and larger weight gain than those with low weight suppression.
   Conclusion: Findings further support that weight suppression is a robust predictor of weight gain in addition to-and in interaction with-current body weight. As weight suppression can easily be assessed at admission, it may help to anticipate treatment course and outcome in patients with anorexia nervosa.

AB Nearctic-Neotropical migratory birds are threatened by land-use change throughout their complex annual cycles. While urbanization is an essential driver of land-use change, it is unclear how it affects migrant birds. Although migratory birds are more diverse in non-urban patches of native vegetation than in urban areas, neotropical cities can host diverse assemblages of overwintering migrant birds. Migratory birds in neotropical cities tend to be closely associated with urban green areas (UGAs). However, how their presence and abundance are affected by the habitat elements of UGAs and the urban matrix of neotropical cities is poorly understood. In this study, we compared the migratory bird species richness and abundances among UGAs and the urban matrix of the southern section of the megacity of Mexico City and native vegetation sites outside the city. Our results show that UGAs in neotropical cities provide habitats capable of maintaining complex overwintering migratory bird assemblages with local trees as critical features. We also assess the role that UGAs' characteristics play in determining migrant bird assemblages. We conducted bird censuses and measured habitat traits to determine how migrant bird assemblages are related to the habitat features of our study sites. We measured local, buffer, and spatial habitat features of each UGA. We found 23 overwintering migrant species in the three habitats, with 22 present within UGAs. Both UGAs and urban matrix sites had higher estimated species richness of migrant birds than non-urban native vegetation sites located outside the city. Only local features of UGAs affected migrant birds. While tree abundance in UGAs was positively associated with migratory bird species richness, the proportion of tree coverage was positively related to bird abundance. Our results show that UGAs in neotropical cities can maintain complex overwintering migratory bird assemblages, with trees being the most critical habitat feature. As a result, UGA management focused on maintaining trees and increasing their numbers can improve habitat conditions for migratory birds overwintering in neotropical cities.

AB The prevalence and intensity of parasitism can have different fitness costs between sexes, and across species and developmental stages. This variation could arise because of species specific sexual and developmental differences in body condition, immunity, and resistance. Theory predicts that the prevalence of parasitism will be greater in individuals with poor body condition and the intensity of parasitism will be greater in individuals with larger body size. These predictions have been tested and verified in vertebrates. In insects, however, contradictory evidence has been found in different taxa. Here, we tested these predictions on two species of Agriocnemis (Agriocnemis femina and Agriocnemis pygmaea) damselflies, which are parasitized by Arrenurus water mite ectoparasites. We measured body weight, total body length, abdomen area and thorax area of non-parasitized damselflies and found body condition varied between males and females, between immature females and mature females and between A. femina and A. pygmaea. Then, we calculated the parasite prevalence, i.e., the absence or presence of parasites and intensity, i.e., the number of parasites per infected damselfly in eleven natural populations of both species. In line to our predictions, we observed greater prevalence in immature females than mature females but found no difference in parasite prevalence between males and females. Furthermore, we found that parasite intensity was higher in females than males and in immature females than mature females. Our result also showed that the frequency and intensity of parasitism varied between the two studied species, being higher in A. pygmaea than A. femina. Our study provides evidence that parasitism impacts sexes, developmental stages and species differentially and suggests that variation may occur due to sex, developmental stage, and species-specific resistance and tolerance mechanism.

AB Climate change is now recognized as a reality and along with human pressures such as river fragmentation by dams, amplifies the threats to freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity. In the Brazilian portion of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) that encompasses the Pantanal, one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world, in addition to the high biodiversity found there, fisheries are an important ecosystem service mostly supported by migratory fishes. We estimated the current range of migratory fish of commercial interest, also assessing the climate change effects predicted on the distribution patterns. Then, we assessed the effects of future climate on fish richness, and combining species ranges with routes blocked by artificial darns investigated possible impacts on fishery and food security in the UPRB. Climate change will induce range contraction between 47% and 100% for the species analyzed, and only four migratory fish may have suitable habitat until the end-of-century. The local richness will reduce about 85% in the basin. River fragmentation by dams acting together with climate change will prevent upstream shifts for most fish species. About 4% of present range and up to 45% of future range of migratory fish should be blocked by darns in UPRB. Consequently, this will also negatively affect fishery yield and food security in the future.

AB Despite strong selective pressures inherent in competition for mates, in species with non-resource-based mating systems males commonly engage in non-agonistic interactions with same-sex visitors at display arenas. Bowerbirds perform courtship dances on elaborate display structures - known as bowers - that are built and defended by one resident male. Several reports have suggested that bower owners tolerate the presence of specific male visitors at their display arenas, referred to here as 'subordinates'. Subordinate males may learn the skills required for successful sexual signalling via prolonged social interactions at adults' arenas, but little is known about whether courtship proficiency changes with experience and/or whether subordinates actively contribute to enhancing the resident male's mating success. In this study, we investigated male-male associations in wild spotted bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchus maculatus). We first sought to determine whether courtship behaviour differs based on bower ownership status. We then examined whether social interactions between bower owners and subordinate males may qualify as courtship coalitions. Our analysis of courtship postural components did not reveal differences in timing or relative occurrence of postural components between subordinate males and bower owners, whereas we found evidence that male-male associations in spotted bowerbirds may provide an example of rudimentary courtship coalitions. In particular, higher subordinate attendance is associated with lower destruction rates by neighbouring rivals and with overall higher mating success, and male pairs are stable in subsequent years. This study provides novel information about social dynamics among male bowerbirds, and further insights into the evolution of coalitionary behaviour in male displays. Significance statement Same-sex associations between established males and subordinate visitors on display arenas are common in birds, yet poorly understood. Using video recordings from a population of wild spotted bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus maculatus, we performed a quantitative analysis on motor courtship components across males, and on their social interactions on display arenas to investigate the nature of male-male partnerships. Our results showed that motor courtship performance in subordinate visitors is not suggestive of an early ontogenetic stage, as previously speculated. Moreover, though bower 'owners' and subordinate males do not coordinate their behaviour during courtship or bower building, male-male partnerships may qualify as a rudimentary or incipient form of courtship coalitions. Subordinate males are tolerated at bowers, the magnitude of subordinate attendance correlates with owner males' mating success, and repeated interactions between individuals reveal consistent partner associations.

AB In animal societies, individuals may take on different roles to fulfil their own needs and the needs of their group. Ant colonies display high levels of organizational complexity, with ants fulfilling different roles at different timescales (what is known as task allocation). Factors affecting task allocation can be at the individual level (e.g. physiology), or at the group level (e.g. the network of interactions). We focus on group level processes by exploring the relationship between interaction networks, task allocation and task switching using a previously published data set (Mersch et al., 2013, Science, 340(6136), 1090-1093) tracking the behaviour of six Camponotus fellah colonies over 41 days. In our new analyses, our goal was to better explain the noisy process of task switching beyond simple age polyethism. First, we investigated the architecture of interaction networks using node (individual) level network measures and their relation to the individual's task - foraging, cleaning or nursing - and whether or not the ant switched tasks. We then explored how noisy information propagation was among ants, as a function of the colony composition (how many ants carried out which tasks), through the information-theoretic metric of 'effective information'. Our results show that interaction history is tied to task allocation: ants that switched to a task were more likely to have interacted with other ants carrying out that task. The degree to which interactions related to task allocation, as well as the noise in those interactions, depended on which groups of ants were interacting. Overall, we found that colony cohesion was stable even as ant level network measures varied more for ants when they switched functional groups; thus, ant colonies maintained a high level of information flow as determined by network analysis, and ant functional groups played different roles in maintaining colony cohesion through varied information flows.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Accurately predicting the future distribution of species is crucial for understanding how species will response to global environmental change and for evaluating the effectiveness of current protected areas (PAs). Here, we assessed the effect of climate and land use change on the projected suitable habitats of Davidia involucrata Baill under different future scenarios using the following two types of models: (a) only climate covariates (climate SDMs) and (b) climate and land use covariates (full SDMs). We found that full SDMs perform significantly better than climate SDMs in terms of both AUC (p < .001) and TSS (p < .001) and also projected more suitable habitat than climate SDMs both in the whole study area and in its current suitable range, although D. involucrate is predicted to loss at least 26.96% of its suitable area under all future scenarios. Similarly, we found that these range contractions projected by climate SDMs would negate the effectiveness of current PAs to a greater extent relative to full SDMs. These results suggest that although D. involucrate is extremely vulnerability to future climate change, conservation intervention to manage habitat may be an effective option to offset some of the negative effects of a changing climate on D. involucrate and can improve the effectiveness of current PAs. Overall, this study highlights the necessity of integrating climate and land use change to project the future distribution of species.

AB It is essential to accurately model species distributions and biodiversity in response to many ecological and conservation challenges. The primary means of reliable decision-making on conservation priority are the data on the distributions and abundance of species. However, finding data that is accurate and reliable for predicting species distribution could be challenging. Data could come from different sources, with different designs, coverage, and potential sampling biases. In this study, we examined the emerging methods of modelling species distribution that integrate data from multiple sources such as systematic or standardized and casual or occasional surveys. We applied two modelling approaches, "data-pooling" and " model-based data integration" that each involves combining various datasets to measure environmental interactions and clarify the distribution of spe-cies. Our paper demonstrates a reliable data integration workflow that includes gathering information on model -based data integration, creating a sub-model of each dataset independently, and finally, combining it into a single final model. We have shown that this is a more reliable way of developing a model than a data pooling strategy that combines multiple data sources to fit a single model. Moreover, data integration approaches could improve the poor predictive performance of systematic small datasets, through model-based data integration techniques that enhance the predictive accuracy of Species Distribution Models. We also identified, consistent with previous research, that machine learning algorithms are the most accurate techniques to predict bird species distribution in our heterogeneous study area in the western Swiss Alps. In particular, tree-dependent ensembles of Random Forest (RF) contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between species and the environment.

AB As CO2 concentration in the atmosphere rises, there is a need for improved physical understanding of its impact on global plant transpiration. This knowledge gap poses a major hurdle in robustly projecting changes in the global hydrologic cycle. For this reason, here we review the different processes by which atmospheric CO2 concentration affects plant transpiration, the several uncertainties related to the complex physiological and radiative processes involved, and the knowledge gaps which need to be filled in order to improve predictions of plant transpiration. Although there is a high degree of certainty that rising CO2 will impact plant transpiration, the exact nature of this impact remains unclear due to complex interactions between CO2 and climate, and key aspects of plant morphology and physiology. The interplay between these factors has substantial consequences not only for future climate and global vegetation, but also for water availability needed for sustaining the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Future changes in global plant transpiration in response to enhanced CO2 are expected to be driven by water availability, atmospheric evaporative demand, plant physiological processes, emergent plant disturbances related to increasing temperatures, and the modification of plant physiology and coverage. Considering the universal sensitivity of natural and agricultural systems to terrestrial water availability we argue that reliable future projections of transpiration is an issue of the highest priority, which can only be achieved by integrating monitoring and modeling efforts to improve the representation of CO2 effects on plant transpiration in the next generation of earth system models.

AB Simple Summary Elevation has a significant impact on the distribution of plant species. However, the structure and distribution patterns of Himalayan vegetation are poorly explored, and research on species composition along an elevation gradient in these mountain ranges is still deficient. Plant species richness is supposed to diminish with altitude, although numerous scientists have found a peak in species richness at mid-elevation, yielding a humped relationship. Many studies along the Himalayan altitudinal gradients have been conducted in order to better understand large-scale biogeographical patterns as well as what drives them, but no clear pattern has emerged. In order to understand how elevation affects plant species, we focused on species diversity, species composition and beta-diversity, which allow for the interpreting of different patterns along the elevations. It was found that all these components of diversity vary significantly with the change in altitude.
   The structure and distribution patterns of Himalayan vegetation are poorly explored, and research on species composition along the elevation gradient in these mountain ranges is still deficient. The current study was undertaken to analyze the variation and pattern of plant species composition along a vertical gradient in northwestern Himalaya, India. A total of 18 sites were selected along an elevation gradient ranging from 2200 to 3900 m asl positioned at an interval of 100 m. The Renyi diversity profile, non-metric multidimensional scaling based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric and beta diversity components among the elevation belts were calculated. Furthermore, to study the influence of altitude on species richness and diversity, a generalized additive model was created. Two hundred and ten plant species representing 66 families and 147 genera were recorded. The Renyi diversity profiles show that the lower and mid-altitudes had rich species diversity. The results of the non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis show a considerable variation in the total plant species composition among the studied elevation belts. The observed multiple-site Sorensen dissimilarity index across the studied elevation belts was very high. The contribution of species replacement or the turnover component to the observed dissimilarity was much higher than the nestedness component. Furthermore, the herbaceous and tree richness showed a significant decrease with increase in elevation; however, the richness of shrubs showed a bimodal pattern. The present study increases our understanding of the trends and patterns of species richness along the vertical gradient in the Himalayan region.

AB Bird habitats are becoming increasingly fragmented as a result of rapid urbanization. As one of the essential refuges for urban bird communities, mountain parks are of practical significance for studying the spatial changes of birds, which can inform the future planning of mountain park planning. In this study, we assessed the alpha, beta, and functional diversity of bird communities in mountain parks in Fuzhou, China, at three levels of urbanization (urban, peri-urban, suburban) and explored how diversity (abundance, richness, alpha-diversity, Chao1) varies along the urbanization gradient. A three-month bird survey was conducted using the transect method to examine the impact of urbanization on bird community structures in mountain parks. In addition, we evaluated the functional diversity of bird guilds in order to identify potential indicator species for monitoring different urbanization gradients in mountain parks. The results showed that: (1) During the three bird surveys from December 2021 to February 2022, 96 bird species and 2429 individuals of 9 orders, 34 families, and 63 genera were identified. (2) Urbanization had a significant impact on the overall bird alpha-diversity (p = 0.040) and richness (p = 0.024) but not on the overall bird abundance (p = 0.056). (3) The results of non-metric multidimensional scaling showed significant variations among overall birds in mountain parks along with three urbanization levels (stress = 0.155, p = 0.027). Similarly, significant differences were observed in the upper-stratum guild (stress = 0.183, p = 0.049) but not in other diet and vertical foraging stratum guilds. (4) Five species were identified as potential candidates for monitoring the trends of urban gradients. Moreover, compared to insectivorous or omnivorous guilds, most carnivorous and herbivorous guilds may not be suitable for monitoring the negative effects of urbanization in mountain parks. Our findings can help inform urban mountain park management or restoration strategies intended to mitigate the adverse impacts of urbanization.

AB Visual scenes typically contain redundant information. One mechanism by which the visual system compresses such redundancies is 'redundancy masking' - the reduction of the perceived number of items in repeating patterns. For example, when presented with three lines in the periphery, observers frequently report only two lines. Redundancy masking is strong in radial arrangements and absent in tangential arrangements. Previous studies suggested that redundancy-masked percepts predominate in stimuli susceptible to redundancy masking. Here, we investigated whether strong redundancy masking is associated with high confidence in perceptual judgements. Observers viewed three to seven radially or tangentially arranged lines at 10 degrees eccentricity. They first indicated the number of lines, and then rated their confidence in their responses. As expected, redundancy masking was strong in radial arrangements and weak in tangential arrangements. Importantly, with radial arrangements, observers were more confident in their responses when redundancy masking occurred (i.e., lower number of lines reported) than when it did not occur (i.e., correct number of lines reported). Hence, observers reported higher confidence for erroneous than for correct judgments. In contrast, with tangential arrangements, observers were similarly confident in their responses whether redundancy masking occurred or not. The inversion of confidence in the radial condition (higher confidence when accuracy was low and lower confidence when accuracy was high) suggests that redundancy-masked appearance trumps 'veridical' perception. The often-reported richness of visual consciousness may partly be due to overconfidence in erroneous judgments in visual scenes that are subject to redundancy masking.

AB Biochar is widely used for immobilizing heavy metals in soil as a kind of high-effective passivator. This research conducted incubation and simulated rainfall experiments to study the effects of biochar application on the loss characteristics of runoff and sediment, as well as the transportation of the Cd during the water erosion process. Two rainfall intensities (60 and 120 mm h(-1)) and five biochar application rates (0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7%) were considered in the experiment. The result showed that slaking had a greater effect than mechanical stirring in aggregate breakdown of the soil, and the addition of biochar generally increased the sensitivity of the soil to wet stirring, while had no obvious influence on the resistance to slaking. The H2O and CaCl2 extractable Cd in soil significantly decreased with the increase of biochar application rate. The runoff yields decreased with the increase of biochar application rate at both the two rainfall intensities, while the eroded sediment generally decreased at the 120 mm h(-1) rainfall intensity. The addition of biochar tended to increase the loss of the middle-sized (1-0.05 mm) aggregates at the 60 mm h(-1) rainfall intensity, whereas reduced their loss at the 120 mm h(-1) rainfall intensity. Biochar application could significantly reduce the concentration of Cd in the runoff and decreased the total loss amount of Cd (sediment+runoff) in most of the cases. Excessively high level (7%) of biochar application may aggravate soil erosion and result in more Cd loss.

AB Drip fertigation with reduced fertilizer and water inputs has been widely used in greenhouse vegetable production in China. However, farmers usually do not apply additional organic material with a high carbon content, although soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations are mostly below the optimum level for vegetable production. Returning straw or biochar to fields is an effective strategy for sustainability and environmental friendliness. We tested whether drip fertigation, (DIF) combined with maize straw (DIF+S) or biochar (DIF+BC), is a suitable option to improve SOC sequestration over eight growing seasons, and how these options affect soil N2O emissions and yields or partial factor productivity of applied N (PFPN) of crops over three growing seasons. During the winter-spring growing season, DIF+BC significantly reduced soil N2O emission by 61.2% and yield-scaled N2O emission by 62.4%, while increasing the tomato yield and PFPN compared with DIF. Straw incorporation had similar trends but without significant effects. Conversely, straw and biochar incorporation increased N2O emission during the autumn-winter season. The structural equation model indicated N2O emission was dominantly driven by soil NH4+-N concentration, temperature and moisture. The N2O emission factor decreased significantly with increased PFPN. Moreover, the contribution of biochar to the increased SOC was approximately 78%, which was four times higher than that of straw incorporation. Overall, the results highlighted the potential of drip fertigation with biochar incorporation to mitigate N2O emissions, improve PFPN and significantly increase SOC storage, which could all contribute to maintaining environmental sustainability and soil quality of greenhouse vegetable production.

AB Gene duplications occur in prokaryotic genomes at a detectable frequency. In many instances, the biological function of the duplicates is unknown, and hence, the significance of the presence of multiple copies of these genes remains unclear.
   Gene duplications significantly impact the gene repertoires of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms. The genomes of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains share a group of duplicated genes whose function is mostly unknown. The irmA gene is one of the duplicates encoded in several pathogenic E. coli strains. The function of its gene product was investigated in the uropathogenic E. coli strain CFT073, which contains a single functional copy. The IrmA protein structure mimics that of human interleukin receptors and likely plays a role during infection. The enteroaggregative E. coli strain 042 contains two functional copies of the irmA gene. In the present work, we investigated their biological roles. The irmA_4509 allele is expressed under several growth conditions. Its expression is modulated by the global regulators OxyR and Hha, with optimal expression at 37 degrees C and under nutritional stress conditions. Expression of the irmA_2244 allele can only be detected when the irmA_4509 allele is knocked out. Differences in the promoter regions of both alleles account for their differential expression. Our results show that under several environmental conditions, the expression of the IrmA protein in strain 042 is dictated by the irmA_4509 allele. The irmA_2244 allele appears to play a backup role to ensure IrmA expression when the irmA_4509 allele loses its function. IMPORTANCE Gene duplications occur in prokaryotic genomes at a detectable frequency. In many instances, the biological function of the duplicates is unknown, and hence, the significance of the presence of multiple copies of these genes remains unclear. In pathogenic E. coli isolates, the irmA gene can be present either as a single copy or in two or more copies. We focused our work on studying why a different pathogenic E. coli strain encodes two functional copies of the irmA gene. We show that under several environmental conditions, one of the alleles dictates IrmA expression, and the second remains silent. The latter allele is only expressed when the former is silenced. The presence of more than one functional copy of the irmA gene in some pathogenic E. coli strains can result in sufficient expression of this virulence factor during the infection process.

AB Salt cress (Eutrema salsugineum), an Arabidopsis-related halophyte, can naturally adapt to various harsh climates and soil conditions; thus, it is considered a desirable model plant for deciphering mechanisms of salt and other abiotic stresses. Accumulating evidence has revealed that compared with Arabidopsis, salt cress possesses stomata that close more tightly and more succulent leaves during extreme salt stress, a noticeably higher level of proline, inositols, sugars, and organic acids, as well as stress-associated transcripts in unstressed plants, and they are induced rapidly under stress. In this review, we systematically summarize the research on the morphology, physiology, genome, gene expression and regulation, and protein and metabolite profile of salt cress under salt stress. We emphasize the latest advances in research on the genome adaptive evolution encountering saline environments, and epigenetic regulation, and discuss the mechanisms underlying salt tolerance in salt cress. Finally, we discuss the existing questions and opportunities for future research in halophytic Eutrema. Together, the review fosters a better understanding of the mechanism of plant salt tolerance and provides a reference for the research and utilization of Eutrema as a model extremophile in the future. Furthermore, the prospects for salt cress applied to explore the mechanism of salt tolerance provide a theoretical basis to develop new strategies for agricultural biotechnology.

AB Human between-group interactions are highly variable, ranging from violent to tolerant and affiliative. Tolerance between groups is linked to our unique capacity for large-scale cooperation and cumulative culture, but its evolutionary origins are understudied. In chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives, predominantly hostile between-group interactions impede cooperation and information flow across groups. In contrast, in our other closest living relative, the bonobo, tolerant between-group associations are observed. However, as these associations can be frequent and prolonged and involve social interactions that mirror those within groups, it is unclear whether these bonobos really do belong to separate groups. Alternatively, the bonobo grouping patterns may be homologous to observations from the large Ngogo chimpanzee community, where individuals form within-group neighborhoods despite sharing the same membership in the larger group. To characterize bonobo grouping patterns, we compare the social structure of the Kokolopori bonobos with the chimpanzee group of Ngogo. Using cluster analysis, we find temporally stable clusters only in bonobos. Despite the large spatial overlap and frequent interactions between the bonobo clusters, we identified significant association preference within but not between clusters and a unique space use of each cluster. Although bonobo associations are flexible (i.e., fission-fusion dynamics), cluster membership predicted the bonobo fission compositions and the spatial cohesion of individuals during encounters. These findings suggest the presence of a social system that combines clear in-group/out-group distinction and out-group tolerance in bonobos, offering a unique referential model for the evolution of tolerant between-group interactions in humans.

AB This article is the first of a two-part series presenting the thermodynamic evaluation and techno-economics of developing negative-emission power plants. The aim of this research is to evaluate the potential of biochar co-production in negative-emission power plants based on biomass-fed integrated gasification solid oxide fuel cell systems with carbon capture and storage (BIGFC/CCS) units. The influence of two gasification agents, namely, air and steam-oxygen, on the proposed system is investigated. In Part I, we present the thermodynamic models. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the system response to stepwise increase in biochar co-production (up to 10% by weight). Providing a secondary oxy-combustor in the steam-oxygen gasification case has been shown to be a solution to meet the heat requirements of the allothermal gasification process. A comprehensive exergy analysis indicated significant efficiency improvement for the steam-oxygen gasification case. The results show that the biomass steam-oxygen gasification yields the higher electrical exergy efficiency (48.3%) and combined heat and power (CHP) exergy efficiency (54.6%) for the similar rates of biochar co-production. The specific power output per unit of CO2 stored is 2.65 MW/(kg/s) and 3.58 MW/(kg/s) for the air and steam-oxygen gasification cases, respectively, when the biochar is co-produced at 10% by weight for the given biomass flow of 20 kg/s. Moreover, the total CO2 stored due to the proposed system is calculated as 133.9 t/h, and it is estimated to remove 1.17 Mt of CO2 from the atmosphere annually (when the biochar-based carbon storage is also considered). The models are used for the techno-economic analysis presented in Part II of the series.

AB The increasing pressures of global warming, population growth and epidemic occurrence are causing challenges in meeting the growing requirements for water, energy and food. In particular, the contradiction between the supply and demand for water, food, and energy is exacerbated by inefficient resource utilization and carbon emission increase. Incorporation of the interlinked aspects of water, energy, food and carbon emissions from agricultural systems into one water-food-energy-carbon nexus facilitates integrated resource management. Biochar application to farmland is a potential strategy for carbon management and agricultural productivity improvement. The integration of biochar systems and the water-food-energy-carbon nexus is an efficient and coordinated alternative method for sustainable agricultural management and a crucial strategy for addressing water, energy and food security issues. Accordingly, this paper proposes an approach for the synergistic regulation of water, land, energy, and carbon emissions in a circular agricultural system by balancing water supply and demand, land allocation, electricity consumption, and economic upgrading principles. A two-stage circular agriculture framework is constructed, with biochar and electricity generated from agricultural residues at the first stage and employed at the second stage. Economic-environmental-energy harmonization is considered in the methodology, and the agrotechnical potential of biochar is quantified via crop yield increase and greenhouse gas emission reduction functions. This approach can assist decision makers in providing the best policy options given certain agricultural resources to achieve the maximum economic performance of the system while minimizing environmental side effects. In this paper, the model framework is applied to the Sanjiang Plain in northeastern China to verify the feasibility of the approach. The results indicate that the external electricity demand is reduced by 87.8% due to the generation of biofuels. Cropland greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 34.09%-67.06% via the application of biochar. This study proposes an optimization method with important implications for the improvement of regional cropland management techniques and development of sustainable circular agriculture. This methodology can be extended to other agriculture-centered regions with limited resources and environmental problems.

AB Spatial patterns of species richness, phylogenetic and morphological diversity are key to answering many questions in ecology and evolution. Across spatial scales, geographical and environmental features, as well as evolutionary history and phenotypic traits, are thought to play roles in shaping both local species communities and regional assemblages. By examining these geographical patterns, it is possible to infer how different axes of biodiversity influence one another, and how their interaction with abiotic factors has led to the spatial distribution of species assemblages-and their attributes-that we observe in the present. Although there has been interest in this area of research for some time, it has recently become more tractable to include multivariate shape data in such analyses. Shape information has the potential to provide a more direct measure of the functional morphology of species as compared to individual trait measurements and might be more relevant to understanding community composition. However, few tools currently exist to explore geographical patterns of both phylogenetic and shape diversity. We present the EcoPhyloMapper r package (epm) that aims to streamline the handling of geographical range polygons or point occurrences and integration of resulting species metacommunities with phylogenetic trees and morphological shape. Geographical maps can be generated that demonstrate spatial patterns in diversity metrics pertaining to phylogenetic similarity, multivariate shape similarity and disparity, and combinations of the two. Patterns of taxonomic, phylogenetic and shape disparity turnover can also be visualized. Biodiversity indices summarized across grid cells can easily be exported to GIS software as well as to other r packages that specialize in community assembly or geospatial statistics. This r package will facilitate the geographical exploration of multivariate shape data in concert with phylogenetic diversity, which will, in turn, support macroecological research exploring how species assemblages are structured. Furthermore, this r package should prove useful across a wide range of macroecological applications that extend beyond the study of morphology.

AB Biophysical evaluations of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) often overlook the potential interactions with and implications for biodiversity and ecosystem services, which are important determinants of food system resilience and sustainability. Drawing on a case study in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, we compare the impacts of CSA with other agricultural management practices on invertebrate pest and natural enemy diversity, and the associated effects on crop damage and crop yield. We found that the most common CSA practices in the region, terracing and trenching with live and compost mulches, provided the best outcomes for crop production, pest suppression and agricultural income. However, greater diversity of pests was observed when neighboring fields planted improved crop varieties, suggesting that the use of improved varieties by farmers creates increased vulnerability to pest damage among neighboring farmers that used local varieties. Also, greater natural enemy diversity was found when neighboring fields were either intercropped or left fallow highlighting spatial flows of ecosystem services between fields. Landcover heterogeneity was positively correlated with pest diversity, whilst landcover richness was positively associated with higher pest volume, highlighting the importance of landscape characteristics in pest and natural enemy dynamics. Finally, we found that crop damage was most severe when pest communities had low species richness, suggesting that a small number of key crop pests contribute to most yield losses. Our findings illustrate that those varied combinations of agricultural management practices lead to heterogeneous biodiversity outcomes and trade-offs, and highlight the importance of local management, neighborhood effects and landscape characteristics. CSA evaluations must therefore look beyond productivity as a measure for success, as trade-offs with invertebrate biodiversity, food production, and environmental sustainability often interact and feedback in complex and unexpected ways.

AB Stingless bees are a diverse group of insects that contribute a wealth of fauna to Central America, as well as being important pollinators. Colonies of these stingless bees are managed and transported unregulated across geographic regions on the basis that they are native species. Populations of Nannotrigona perilampoides, one of the most common stingless bee species in Mexico and Central America, are separated by several geographical barriers that may act as obstacles to gene flow. In addition, their biological and reproductive characteristics make them susceptible to variation among their populations. In this work, we combined morphometric and molecular analyses (through cox1, 16S, ITS1 and ITS2 sequencing) to test whether there is a differentiation between distant populations of N. perilampoides separated by the Sierra Madre Mountain complex. Analyses of wing geometric morphometrics and sequence variation of a fragment of the 16S gene revealed significant differences between populations. These differences show a pattern of isolation by distance, and the possible effect of the Sierra Madre as a biogeographical barrier. The results suggest that N. perilampoides may be composed of distinct evolutionary units and that colony exchange among regions should be restricted to preserve the diversity of this species.

AB Knowledge of the effects of climate change on agro-ecosystems is fundamental to identifying local actions aimed to maintain productivity and reduce environmental issues. This study investigates the effects of climate perturbation on the European crop and grassland production systems, combining the findings from two specific biogeochemical models. Accurate and high-resolution management and pedoclimatic data were employed. Results have been verified for the period 1978-2004 (historical period) and projected until 2099 with two divergent intensities: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate projections, Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5. We have provided a detailed overview of productivity and the impacts on management (sowing dates, water demand, nitrogen use efficiency). Biogenic greenhouse gas balance (N2O, CH4, CO2) was calculated, including an assessment of the gases' sensitivity to the leading drivers, and a net carbon budget on production systems was compiled. Results confirmed a rise in productivity in the first half of the century (+5 % for croplands at +0.2 t DM ha(-1) yr(-1), +1 % for grasslands at +0.1 t DM ha(-1) yr(-1); DM denotes dry matter), whereas a significant reduction in productivity is expected during the period 2050-2099, caused by the shortening of the length of the plant growing cycle associated with rising temperatures. This effect was more pronounced for the more pessimistic climate scenario (-6.1 % for croplands and -7.7 % for grasslands), for the Mediterranean regions and in central European latitudes, confirming a regionally distributed impact of climate change. Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions were triggered by rising air temperatures and increased exponentially over the century, often exceeding the CO2 accumulation of the explored agro-ecosystems, which acted as potential C sinks. The emission factor for N2O was 1.82 +/- 0.07 % during the historical period and rose to up to 2.05 +/- 0.11 % for both climate projections. The biomass removal (crop yield, residues exports, mowing and animal intake) converted croplands and grasslands into net C sources (236 +/- 107 Tg CO2 eq. yr(-1) in the historical period), increasing from 19 % to 26 % during the climate projections, especially for RCP4.5. Nonetheless, crop residue restitution might represent a potential management strategy to overturn the C balance. Although with a marked latitudinal gradient, water demand will double over the next few decades in the European croplands, whereas the benefit in terms of yield (+2 % to +10 % over the century) will not contribute substantially to balance the C losses due to climate perturbation.

AB Rhizobial lipochitooligosaccharidic Nod factors (NFs), specified by nod genes, are the primary determinants of host specificity in the legume-Rhizobia symbiosis. We examined the nodulation ability of Medicago truncatula cv Jemalong A17 and M. truncatula ssp. tricycla R108 with the Sinorhizobium meliloti nodF/nodL mutant, which produces modified NFs. We then applied genetic and functional approaches to study the genetic basis and mechanism of nodulation of R108 by this mutant. We show that the nodF/nodL mutant can nodulate R108 but not A17. Using genomics and reverse genetics, we identified a newly evolved, chimeric LysM receptor-like kinase gene in R108, LYK2bis, which is responsible for the phenotype and can allow A17 to gain nodulation with the nodF/nodL mutant. We found that LYK2bis is involved in nodulation by mutants producing nonO-acetylated NFs and interacts with the key receptor protein NFP. Many, but not all, natural S. meliloti and S. medicae strains tested require LYK2bis for efficient nodulation of R108. Our findings reveal that a newly evolved gene in R108, LYK2bis, extends nodulation specificity to mutants producing nonO-acetylated NFs and is important for nodulation by many natural Sinorhizobia. Evolution of this gene may present an adaptive advantage to allow nodulation by a greater variety of strains.

AB Land-use and land-cover change strongly affect biodiversity patterns and are assumed to be growing threats in the future. Particularly increasing urbanisation may affect species turnover and functional composition of biological communities. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of land-cover change in a medium-sized urban municipality from 2011 to 2018, and the effects of urbanisation on avian species- and functional diversity. The study was performed in Trondheim (Norway), using local land-cover maps and GBIF bird species occurrence records. GLMMs were used to model species turnover as a function of urbanisation, and the probability of species appearance and disappearance based on urbanisation and species traits. The extent of bird species turnover within a municipality-wide 500 x 500m(2) grid was not predicted by a changes in developed area, but the probability of disappearance and appearance of bird species varied with urbanisation and bird functional traits. Species associated with urban- or open areas showed a decreasing probability of disappearing and an increasing probability of appearing with increasing amount of developed area within grid cells. Similarly, granivorous species showed a decreasing probability of disappearing. Species feeding above ground-level showed positive responses to changes in land-cover. The probability of both appearance and disappearance, thus species turnover, increased with increasing longevity. Most functional groups respond negatively to increasing urbanisation, indicating a potential impoverishment of local avifauna with future land-cover modifications. Considering planned future land-cover changes within the municipality, the local avian communities are in danger of homogenisation. The recommendations for local management are to minimise conversion of vulnerable habitats, such as wetlands and woodlands, in particular if these are converted to developed area.

AB The impact of climate extremes on forest ecosystems is poorly understood but important for predicting carbon and water cycle feedbacks to climate. Some knowledge gaps still remain regarding how drought-related adjustments in intra-annual tree-ring characteristics directly impact tree carbon and water use. In this study we quantified the impact of an extreme summer drought on the water-use efficiency and carbon sequestration of four mature Norway spruce trees. We used detailed observations of wood formation (xylogenesis) and intra-annual tree-ring properties (quantitative wood anatomy and stable carbon isotopes) combined with physiological water-stress monitoring. During 41 d of tree water deficit, we observed an enrichment in C-13 but a reduction in cell enlargement and wall-thickening processes, which impacted the anatomical characteristics. These adjustments diminished carbon sequestration by 67% despite an 11% increase in water-use efficiency during drought. However, with the resumption of a positive hydric state in the stem, we observed a fast recovery of cell formation rates based on the accumulated assimilates produced during drought. Our findings enhance our understanding of carbon and water fluxes between the atmosphere and forest ecosystems, providing observational evidence on the tree intra-annual carbon sequestration and water-use efficiency dynamics to improve future generations of vegetation models.

AB Climate change is transforming the decision-making landscape for many conservation organizations. Conservation planning and implementation under climate change are challenging due to uncertainties about climate impacts and the effectiveness of adaptation options. Strategically building flexibility into conservation plans so they can be adjusted over time in response to unforeseen events, or new information, is one solution to this challenge. Yet, there are a wide range of mechanisms to choose from to enhance flexibility and so there is a need for a more structured approach to inform building flexibility into conservation plans. To achieve this, we conceptualize flexible strategies as three types, procedural flexibility, resource flexibility, and action flexibility, and explicitly link these to climate risks and steps in conservation decision-making processes. We discuss how this framework can guide choices of flexible strategies, including identifying the costs and benefits, and illustrate this using examples. This provides a new conceptual tool for conservation organizations to make strategic choices about flexibility for climate adaptation.

AB Reporting of statistical analysis is essential in any clinical and translational research study. However, medical research studies sometimes report statistical analysis that is either inappropriate or insufficient to attest to the accuracy and validity of findings and conclusions. Published works involving inaccurate statistical analyses and insufficient reporting influence the conduct of future scientific studies, including meta-analyses and medical decisions. Although the biostatistical practice has been improved over the years due to the involvement of statistical reviewers and collaborators in research studies, there remain areas of improvement for transparent reporting of the statistical analysis section in a study. Evidence-based biostatistics practice throughout the research is useful for generating reliable data and translating meaningful data to meaningful interpretation and decisions in medical research. Most existing research reporting guidelines do not provide guidance for reporting methods in the statistical analysis section that helps in evaluating the quality of findings and data interpretation. In this report, we highlight the global and critical steps to be reported in the statistical analysis of grants and research articles. We provide clarity and the importance of understanding study objective types, data generation process, effect size use, evidence-based biostatistical methods use, and development of statistical models through several thematic frameworks. We also provide published examples of adherence or non-adherence to methodological standards related to each step in the statistical analysis and their implications. We believe the suggestions provided in this report can have far-reaching implications for education and strengthening the quality of statistical reporting and biostatistical practice in medical research.

AB Stomata regulate leaf CO2 assimilation (A) and water loss. The Ball-Berry and Medlyn models predict stomatal conductance (g(s)) with a slope parameter (m or g(1)) that reflects the sensitivity of g(s) to A, atmospheric CO2 and humidity, and is inversely related to water use efficiency (WUE). This study addressed knowledge gaps about what the values of m and g(1) are in C-4 crops under field conditions, as well as how they vary among genotypes and with drought stress. Four inbred maize genotypes were unexpectedly consistent in how m and g(1) decreased as water supply decreased. This was despite genotypic variation in stomatal patterning, A and g(s). m and g(1) were strongly correlated with soil water content, moderately correlated with predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)), but not correlated with midday leaf water potential (psi(md)). This implied that m and g(1) respond to long-term water supply more than short-term drought stress. The conserved nature of m and g(1) across anatomically diverse genotypes and water supplies suggests there is flexibility in structure-function relationships underpinning WUE.

AB Agricultural land use and management affect land surface albedo and thus the climate. Increasing the albedo of cropland could enhance reflection of solar radiation, counteracting the radiative forcing (RF) of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and local warming. However, knowledge is lacking on how agricultural practices affect albedo under local conditions, and on the benefits of individual practices. In this study, field measurements were made in 15 paired plots at a site in Northern Europe to determine albedo, net shortwave irradiance and RF impacts under various common crops, cultivation intensities and tillage practices. Field data for 2019-2020 were compared with satellite-based albedo for the surrounding region in 2010-2020. At regional level, different combinations of soil type, yearly weather and agricultural practices led to great variability in the albedo of individual crops, despite similar pedo-climatic conditions. At field level within years, albedo differences were determined mainly by crop type, species-specific phenology and post-harvest management. Annual albedo was higher with perennial ley (0.20-0.22) and winter-sown crops (0.18-0.22) than with spring-sown crops (0.16-0.18) and bare soil (0.13). Barley had the highest albedo among winter and spring cereals. In summer, when increased albedo could alleviate local heat stress, oats reduced net shortwave irradiance at the surface by 0.8-5.8 Wm(-2) compared with other cereals, ley, peas or rapeseed. Delayed or reduced tillage gave high local cooling potential (up to-13.6 Wm(-2)) in late summer. Potential benefits for global mean climate as GWP(100 )per hectare and year reached-980 kg CO(2)e for avoiding black fallow,-578 kg CO(2)e for growing a winter-sown variety and-288 kg CO(2)e for delayed tillage. Thus realistic albedo increases on cropland could have important effects on local temperatures and offset a substantial proportion of the RF deriving from field-scale GHG emissions on short time-scales.

AB As root exudation may be altered by drought stress, we investigated if biochar amendment could moderate these effects. In a pot experiment with maize, treatments amended with straw or wood biochar were exposed to different irrigation regimes: well-watered (irrigated to 90% of water holding capacity (WHC)), drought (no irrigation for 4 days), and recovery (irrigated to 90% of WHC for 4 days after drought). Photosynthesis was measured during plant growth. At harvest, the leaf water potential (LWP), plant biomass, rhizosphere and bulk soil NH4+ content, pH, multiple substrate-induced respiration (MSIR), and rhizosphere content of selected primary metabolites (as an indication of root exudation) were determined. While the plant biomass was unaffected by biochar amendment, biochar had positive effects on the LWP and photosynthetic parameters in the initial drought and recovery phases. Furthermore, soil pH and NH4+ content were affected by biochar and the C-substrate utilization (MSIR) increased in the biochar treatments, independently of irrigation. Both biochars significantly altered the rhizosphere content of primary metabolites, especially under full irrigation and drought, and it is suggested that direct and indirect effects of biochar application on soil properties are the cause of these changes. Biochar specifically increased the content of organic acids, and drought even had an additive effect on the content of succinic acid in the wood biochar treatment.

AB Class III peroxidases (PODs) are plant-specific enzymes that play significant roles in plant physiological processes and stress responses. However, a comprehensive analysis of the POD gene family in tobacco has not yet been conducted. In this study, 210 non-redundant POD gene members (NtPODs) were identified in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and distributed unevenly throughout 24 tobacco chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis clustered these genes into six subgroups (I-VI). Gene structure and motif analyses showed the structural and functional diversity among the subgroups. Segmental duplication and purifying selection were the main factors affecting NtPOD gene evolution. Our analyses also suggested that NtPODs might be regulated by miRNAs and cis-acting regulatory elements of transcription factors that are involved in various biological processes. In addition, the expression patterns in different tissues and under various stress treatments were investigated. The results showed that the majority of NtPODs had tissue-specific expression patterns and may be involved in many biotic and abiotic responses. qRT-PCR analyses of different tissues and stress treatments were performed to verify transcriptome patterns. Expression of a green fluorescent protein-NtPOD fusion confirmed the plasma membrane localization of NtPOD121 and NtPOD4. Furthermore, 3D structures provided evidences of membrane-bound peroxidase. These findings provide useful information to better understand the evolution of the NtPOD gene family and lay the foundation for further studies on POD gene function in tobacco.

AB The objective of the current study was to determine the potential effects of changes in climate, population density and land use land cover (LULC) on the spatial distribution of Adansonia digitata (baobab tree) suitable habitats in Africa using MaxEnt. Across its distribution, A. digitata is confined to Africa's mainland and isolated parts of the continent such as Madagascar. The geographical distribution of A. digitata will shrink gradually under climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), population density and LULC-development threat changes. Rainfall wettest quarter, soil type, elevation, rainfall seasonality and mean annual rainfall were the most important variables in terms of relative contribution to the occurrence of A. digitata. Population density was also important compared to LULC - development threat index. Only a small part of the current range of the baobab tree in Africa will retain suitable environmental conditions for viable baobab populations in future, high concentration will be in Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Benin, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Tanzania and Madagascar. Despite threats to the specie, there are areas currently not suitable although they will be suitable in future. There is an urgent need for conservation strategies aimed at preserving A. digitata to benefit local communities socially and economically.

AB Animals that succeed as non-native species may have highly plastic characteristics. We conducted a radio telemetry survey for introduced masked palm civets (Paguma larvata), which inhabit rural landscapes in almost all of Japan, to clarify their habitat selection and intraspecific variation. We compared two generalized linear mixed models, one that did not consider individual differences and another that did, which indicated the importance of incorporating individual differences for evaluating habitat selection by this species. We obtained results of habitat selectivity for all individuals (i.e., common effect on the species) and for each individual using coefficients of fixed effects or fixed effects with random effects. Masked palm civets significantly selected deciduous broad-leaved forests, artificial structures, rice fields, and orchards as a common effect for all individuals. However, these habitats were not necessarily selected as a significant effect for each individual. Deciduous broad-leaved forests and artificial structures were more important than other habitats. The wide range of possible environments and the plasticity of habitat selection shown in this study may partly explain the success of this species in expanding its distribution in Japan.

AB Drought stress affects plant growth and development. Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) was formed by a cross between A. duranensis and A. ipaensis. The drought tolerance of A. duranensis and A. ipaensis is reportedly stronger than that of cultivated peanut. However, there has been little study of drought tolerance genes in Arachis. In this study, we compared drought tolerance genes between A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner and its diploid donors. We have observed that polyploidization does not generate more drought tolerance genes in A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner but promotes the loss of many ancient drought tolerance genes. Although putative drought tolerance genes occurred on gene duplication events in A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner, most copies lacked drought tolerance. These findings suggest that the loss of drought tolerance genes in A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner could possibly result in weaker drought tolerance. In addition, we have observed that the three Arachis species stochastically lost putative drought tolerance genes. The evolution of drought tolerance genes could possibly have correlated with environmental changes. Our results enhance the current understanding of drought tolerance and polyploidy evolution in Arachis species.

AB CCT transcription factors are involved in the regulation of photoperiod and abiotic stress in Arabidopsis and rice. It is not clear that how CCT gene family expand and regulate heading date in foxtail millet. In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of the CCT gene family in foxtail millet. Thirty-nine CCT genes were identified and divided into four subfamilies based on functional motifs. Analysis showed that dispersed duplication played a predominant role in the expansion of CCT genes during evolution. Nucleotide diversity analysis suggested that genes in CONSTANS (COL)-like, CCT MOTIF FAMILY (CMF)-like, and pseudoresponse response regulator (PRR)-like subfamilies were subjected to selection. Fifteen CCT genes were colocalized with previous heading date quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) signals. Transgenic plants were then employed to confirm that overexpression of the CCT gene SiPRR37 delayed the heading date and increased plant height. Our study first investigated the characterization and expansion of the CCT family in foxtail millet and demonstrated the role of SiPRR37. These results lay a significant foundation for further research on the function of CCT genes and provide a cue for the regulation of heading date.

AB Introduction/Aims Diaphragm ultrasound is increasingly used in the diagnosis of diaphragm dysfunction and to guide respiratory management in patients with neuromuscular disorders and those who are critically ill. However, the association between diaphragm ultrasound variables and demographic factors like age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) are understudied. Such relationships are important for correct interpretation of normative values and comparison with selected patients groups. The aim of this study was to determine the associations between diaphragm ultrasound variables and subject characteristics. Methods B-mode ultrasound was used to image the diaphragm at the zone of apposition in 83 healthy subjects. Diaphragm thickness at resting end-expiration (Tend-exp), diaphragm thickness at maximal end-inspiration (Tmax-insp), diaphragm thickening ratio (Tmax-insp/Tend-exp), and diaphragm echogenicity were measured. Multivariate linear regression was used to explore the associations between diaphragm ultrasound variables and subject characteristics. Results Tend-exp, Tmax-insp, and thickening ratio do not change with age whereas diaphragm echogenicity increases with age. The thickening ratio had a weak negative association with BMI, while Tend-exp was positively associated with BMI. Men had a larger Tend-exp and Tmax-insp than women (Tend-exp 1.6 +/- 0.5 and 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm; p = .011, Tmax-insp 3.8 +/- 1.0 and 3.2 +/- 0.9 mm; p = .004), but similar thickening ratios. Discussion Diaphragm thickness, thickening, and echogenicity measured with ultrasound are associated with factors such as age, BMI, and sex. Therefore, subject characteristics should be considered when interpreting diaphragm ultrasound measurements. In the absence of normative values, matched control groups are a prerequisite for research and in clinical practice.

AB The sensitivity of amphibian species to shifts in environmental conditions has been exhibited through long-term population studies and the projection of ecological niche models under expected conditions. Species in biodiversity hotspots have been the focus of ample predictive modeling studies, while, despite their significant ecological value, wide-ranging and common taxa have received less attention. We focused on predicting range restriction of the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), blue-spotted salamander (A. laterale), four-toed salamander (Hemidactylium scutatum), and red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) under future climate scenarios. Using bias-corrected future climate data and biodiversity database records, we developed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models under current conditions and for climate change projections in 2050 and 2070. We calculated positivity rates of species localities to represent proportions of habitat expected to remain climatically suitable with continued climate change. Models projected under future conditions predicted average positivity rates of 91% (89-93%) for the blue-spotted salamander, 23% (2-41%) for the spotted salamander, 4% (0.7-9%) for the four-toed salamander, and 61% (42-76%) for the red-backed salamander. Range restriction increased with time and greenhouse gas concentration for the spotted salamander, four-toed salamander, and red-backed salamander. Common, widespread taxa that often receive less conservation resources than other species are at risk of experiencing significant losses to their climatic ranges as climate change continues. Efforts to maintain populations of species should be focused on regions expected to experience fewer climatic shifts such as the interior and northern zones of species' distributions.

AB The oryzomyine rodent Euryzoryzomys russatus is endemic to the Atlantic Forest of South America, where it inhabits mostly pristine humid forests. Previous phylogeographical studies performed with limited sample sizes indicated that rivers and climatic oscillations might have driven the diversification of this species. Here, we used a more comprehensive database to revisit the phylogeography and demographic history of E. russatus. Our phylogenetic inferences and haplotype network recovered four groups within E. russatus, each of which diversified between 0.33 and 0.60 Mya. These groups are mostly allopatric and are structured latitudinally along the Atlantic Forest. We did not detect any genetic break related to the major river drainages. Species distribution models recovered similar suitable areas for E. russatus in the present and past times, suggesting stability in the geographical range during the Pleistocene. The most pronounced change was the expansion of suitable areas onto the emerged continental shelf during the Last Glacial Maximum. Demographic analyses showed evidence of population expansion during periods of lowered seal levels, especially for the haplogroup associated with the Serra do Mar forest refuge. Therefore, our results failed to support the hypothesis of riverine barriers and suggest that the diversification of E. russatus is explained better by forest refugial processes.

AB Unprecedented advances in sequencing technology in the past decade allow a better understanding of genetic variation and its partitioning in natural populations. Such inference is critical to conservation: to understand species biology and identify isolated populations. We review empirical population genetics studies of Endangered Bengal tigers within India, where 60-70% of wild tigers live. We assess how changes in marker type and sampling strategy have impacted inferences by reviewing past studies, and presenting three novel analyses including a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel, genome-wide SNP markers, and a whole-mitochondrial genome network. At a broad spatial scale, less than 100 SNPs revealed the same patterns of population clustering as whole genomes (with the exception of one additional population sampled only in the SNP panel). Mitochondrial DNA indicates a strong structure between the northeast and other regions. Two studies with more populations sampled revealed further substructure within Central India. Overall, the comparison of studies with varied marker types and sample sets allows more rigorous inference of population structure. Yet sampling of some populations is limited across all studies, and these should be the focus of future sampling efforts. We discuss challenges in our understanding of population structure, and how to further address relevant questions in conservation genetics.This article is part of the theme issue 'Celebrating 50 years since Lewontin's apportionment of human diversity'.

AB Interactions of surface water and groundwater (SW-GW) in hyporheic zones produce biogeochemical hotspots. However, response patterns of hyporheic groundwater to external influences remain unclear. In this study, three datasets (hydrochemistry, antibiotics, and microbiome) were collected over a hydrological year to explore the influence of a 12-year managed aquifer recharge (MAR) project. We observed that the long-term MAR practice elevated nutrient and antibiotic levels while reduced redox potential in hyporheic groundwater, and these im-pacts depended on decreasing SW-GW interaction intensity with aquifer depth. In contrast, the long-term MAR practice increased community dissimilarity of 30-m groundwater but had little impact on 50-m or 80-m groundwater. Moreover, hyporheic community assembly was dominated by dispersal limitation, and thereby co-varied hydrochemistry and antibiotics only attributed to small community variability. The long-term MAR practice decreased species-interaction intensity and changed the abundance of metabolic functions in hyporheic groundwater. Furthermore, predicted community functions involving carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and manganese cycles for 30-m groundwater showed higher abundances than those for 50-and 80-m groundwater. Collectively, we showed that hyporheic groundwater was sensitive to the SW-GW interaction and human activities, with the interactions of hydrochemistry, contaminants, and microbiome linking to hyporheic groundwater quality and ecosystem functioning.

AB 1. Widespread declines in insects will threaten ecosystem functioning and services. Nevertheless, a lack of data hinders assessments of population and biodiversity trends for many insect groups and thus effective conservation actions. Implementing cost-effective, unbiased, and accurate monitoring programmes targeting different groups across a larger geographical range has therefore become a key conservation priority.
   2. We evaluated a sampling protocol designed for community science initiatives targeting butterflies and bees. Specifically, we tested how well a short (200-m long) version of traditional Pollard walk transects, designed to be accessible for large numbers of community scientists, captures changes in alpha and beta diversity of these two pollinator groups.
   3. We used resampling methods to simulate and assess scenarios varying in sampling intensity and frequency. We found that alpha and beta diversity of butterflies and bees were estimated at similar accuracies across different scenarios, which suggests that even short transects can provide useful information on diversity patterns for both taxa. However, common sampling frequencies resulted in low accuracies (e.g. one sample every 10 days finds on average similar to 50% of the species present at a site).
   4. We discuss our results in the context of developing large scale, structured monitoring systems for multiple insect taxa, and how information on biodiversity patterns can inform the expansion of monitoring schemes. We explain why, moving forward, even rapid sampling designs similar to the approach tested here will be useful given a higher potential to involve community scientists, data integration techniques, and the opportunities to sample under-represented habitat types

AB Deciphering the effects of historical and recent demographic processes responsible for the spatial patterns of genetic diversity and structure is a key objective in evolutionary and conservation biology. Using population genetic analyses, we investigated the demographic history, the contemporary genetic diversity and structure, and the occurrence of hybridization and introgression of two species of anadromous fish with contrasting life history strategies and which have undergone recent demographic declines, the allis shad (Alosa alosa) and the twaite shad (Alosa fallax). We genotyped 706 individuals from 20 rivers and 5 sites at sea in Southern Europe at thirteen microsatellite markers. Genetic structure between populations was lower for the nearly semelparous species A. alosa, which disperses greater distances compared to the iteroparous species, A. fallax. Individuals caught at sea were assigned at the river level for A. fallax and at the region level for A. alosa. Using an approximate Bayesian computation framework, we inferred that the most likely long term historical divergence scenario between both species and lineages involved historical separation followed by secondary contact accompanied by strong population size decline. Accordingly, we found evidence for contemporary hybridization and bidirectional introgression due to gene flow between both species and lineages. Moreover, our results support the existence of at least one distinct species in the Mediterrannean sea: A. agone in Golfe du Lion area, and another divergent lineage in Corsica. Overall, our results shed light on the interplay between historical and recent demographic processes and life history strategies in shaping population genetic diversity and structure of closely related species. The recent demographic decline of these species' populations and their hybridization should be carefully considered while implementing conservation programs.

AB Climate change is a pervasive threat to biodiversity. While range shifts are a known consequence of climate warming contributing to regional community change, less is known about how species' positions shift within their climatic niches. Furthermore, whether the relative importance of different climatic variables prompting such shifts varies with changing climate remains unclear. Here we analysed four decades of data for 1,478 species of birds, mammals, butterflies, moths, plants and phytoplankton along a 1,200 km high latitudinal gradient. The relative importance of climatic drivers varied non-uniformly with progressing climate change. While species turnover among decades was limited, the relative position of species within their climatic niche shifted substantially. A greater proportion of species responded to climatic change at higher latitudes, where changes were stronger. These diverging climate imprints restructure a full biome, making it difficult to generalize biodiversity responses and raising concerns about ecosystem integrity in the face of accelerating climate change.
   The authors analyse four decades of distribution data for various taxonomic groups to understand the shift of species within their climatic niches and the changing influences of different climate factors. The diverse and diverging climate imprints raise concerns about future ecosystem integrity.

AB Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is a common strategy to selectively prevent the growth of certain species of meat spoiling bacteria. This study aimed to determine the impact of high oxygen MAP (70% O-2, 30% CO2, red and white meats) and oxygen-free MAP (70% N-2, 30% CO2, also white meat and seafood) on preventing the growth of spoiling photobacteria on meat. Growth of Photobacterium carnosum and P. phosphoreum was monitored in a meat simulation media under different gas mixtures of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, and samples were taken during exponential growth for a comparative proteomic analysis. Growth under air atmosphere appears optimal, particularly for P. carnosum. Enhanced protein accumulation affected energy metabolism, respiration, oxygen consuming reactions, and lipid usage. However, all the other atmospheres show some degree of growth reduction. An increase in oxygen concentration leads to an increase in enzymes counteracting oxidative stress for both species and enhancement of heme utilization and iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins for P. phosphoreum. Absence of oxygen appears to switch the metabolism toward fermentative pathways where either ribose (P. phosphoreum) or glycogen (P. carnosum) appear to be the preferred substrates. Additionally, it promotes the use of alternative electron donors/acceptors, mainly formate and nitrate/nitrite. Stress response is manifested as an enhanced accumulation of enzymes that is able to produce ammonia (e.g., carbonic anhydrase, hydroxylamine reductase) and regulate osmotic stress. Our results suggest that photobacteria do not sense the environmental levels of carbon dioxide, but rather adapt to their own anaerobic metabolism. The regulation in presence of carbon dioxide is limited and strain-specific under anaerobic conditions. However, when oxygen at air-like concentration (21%) is present together with carbon dioxide (30%), the oxidative stress appears enhanced compared to air conditions (very low carbon dioxide), as explained if both gases have a synergistic effect. This is further supported by the increase in oxygen concentration in the presence of carbon dioxide. The atmosphere is able to fully inhibit P. carnosum, heavily reduce P. phosphoreum growth in vitro, and trigger diversification of energy production with higher energetic cost, highlighting the importance of concomitant bacteria for their growth on raw meat under said atmosphere.

AB CONTEXT: Although rice production has increased significantly in the last decade in West Africa, the region is far from being rice self-sufficient. Inland valleys (IVs) with their relatively higher water content and soil fertility compared to the surrounding uplands are the main rice-growing agroecosystem. They are being promoted by governments and development agencies as future food baskets of the region. However, West Africa's crop production is estimated to be negatively affected by climate change due to the strong dependence of its agriculture on rainfall. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the study is to apply a set of machine learning models to quantify the extent of climate change impact on land suitability for rice using the presence of rice-only data in IVs along with bioclimatic indicators. METHODS: We used a spatially explicit modeling approach based on correlative Ecological Niche Modeling. We deployed 4 algorithms (Boosted Regression Trees, Generalized Linear Model, Maximum Entropy, and Random Forest) for 4-time periods (the 2030s, 2050s, 2070s, and 2080s) of the 4 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8) from an ensemble set of 32 spatially downscaled and bias-corrected Global Circulation Models climate data.

AB Androgens like testosterone mediate suites of physical and behavioral traits across vertebrates, and circulation varies considerably across and within taxa. However, an understanding of the causal factors of variation in circulating testosterone has proven difficult despite decades of research. According to the challenge hypothesis, agonistic interactions between males immediately prior to the breeding season produce the highest levels of testosterone measured during this period. While many studies have provided support for this hypothesis, most species do not respond to male-male competition by elevating testosterone. As a result, a recent revision of the hypothesis ('challenge hypothesis 2.0') places male-female interactions as the primary cause of rapid elevations in testosterone circulation in male vertebrates. Here, we offer a test of both iterations of the challenge hypothesis in a tropical bird species. We first illustrate that male White-shouldered Fairywrens (Malurus alboscapulatus) differ by subspecies in plasma androgen concentrations. Then we use a social network approach to find that males of the subspecies with higher androgens are characterized by greater social interaction scores, including more time aggregating to perform sexual displays. Next, we use a controlled experiment to test whether males respond to simulated territorial intrusion and/or courtship competition contexts by elevating androgens. We found that males elevated androgens during territorial intrusions relative to flushed controls, however, males sampled during courtship competitions had greater plasma androgens both relative to controls and males sampled while defending territories. Ultimately, our results are consistent with challenge hypothesis 2.0, as sexual interactions with extra-pair females were associated with greater elevation of androgens than territorial disputes.

AB The Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative was formed to promote restoration of red spruce Picea rubens forests in Central Appalachia. One goal of the initiative is to increase availability and enhance quality of habitat for wildlife, including the threatened Cheat Mountain salamander Plethodon nettingi. The purpose of this research was to compare microhabitat characteristics between an occupied Cheat Mountain salamander site and early-stage spruce restoration sites, and between four occupied sites and proximal nondetection sites. We found that soil pH was higher and soil moisture was lower at spruce restoration sites compared with the occupied site, and that light intensity, subcanopy air temperature, and ground-level air temperature were higher in spruce restoration sites with reduced canopy cover. We found that soil moisture was higher at occupied sites compared with proximal nondetection sites, but soil pH was not significantly different. Our study suggests that Cheat Mountain salamanders are associated with low soil pH and high soil moisture, and thus spruce restoration could enhance habitat quality for this species in the long-term.

AB Changes in network position and behavioral interactions have been linked with infectious disease in social animals. Here, we investigate the effects of an experimental disease challenge on social network centrality of group-housed Holstein bull dairy calves. Within group-housed pens (6/group) calves were randomly assigned to either a previously developed challenge model, involving inoculation with Mannheimia haemolytia (n = 12 calves; 3 calves/group) or a control involving only saline (n = 12 calves; 3 calves/group). Continuous behavioral data were recorded from video on pre-treatment baseline day and for 24 h following inoculation to describe social lying frequency and duration and all active social contact between calves. Mixed-model analysis revealed that changes in network position were related to the challenge. Compared to controls, challenged calves had reduced centrality and connectedness, baseline to challenge day. On challenge day, challenged calves were less central in the directed social contact networks (lower degree, strength and eigenvector centrality), and initiated contact (higher out-degree) with more penmates, compared to healthy calves. This finding suggests that giving rather than receiving affiliative social contact may be more beneficial for challenged calves. This is the first study demonstrating that changes in social network position coincide with an experimental challenge of a respiratory pathogen in calves.

AB Climate change has caused habitat fragmentation and reduced connectivity. The Fen River Basin in Shanxi Province, China is an important habitat for the central population of the brown-eared pheasant (BEP). The effects of climate change need to be considered in the conservation planning of BEP habitats. We used a species dispersion model to determine the BEP core habitat and graph theory to explore the connectivity of the BEP's main habitats. The pinch point areas of BEP dissemination were determined by circuit theory. Least-cost pathways were used to identify the critical corridors for BEP dissemination. A gap analysis was conducted to estimate the efficiency of BEP conservation measures. Under the future climate scenarios, BEP habitats decreased by between 54.69% and 97.63%, and the connectivity of the main habitats was reduced by a similar magnitude. The BEP core habitat shifted to the southwestern region under the influence of climatic conditions. Currently, 90.84% of the species' critical habitat remains unprotected. Due to climate change, the core habitat in the future was projected to differ from the current protected area. Enhancing the protection of the pinch point region may aid in the restoration of habitat connectivity.

AB The fishery of the muricid gastropod Concholepas concholepas is iconic in the southeast Pacific Ocean, since several studies on the species served as basis for changing from an open access regime to territorial user rights in fisheries (TURFs), in the form of management and exploitation areas for benthic resources. This predatory gastropod can be abundant in exposed rocky shores, yet its landings are highly variable in space and time. A few years after new management was implemented, TURF areas exhibited stabilized landings at the national level. However, we have no clear understanding of the outcomes of this management over time at national level versus individual area level. We estimated landings trends using long-term data (18 years) on landings of C. concholepas in most TURF areas of north-central Chile. These temporal trends were estimated by quantifying the landings slopes for each area and their individual deviations from the population level estimates (overall slope minus individual slope). We found that nearly 20% of areas stopped harvesting in 2010, most areas exhibited declining landings over time, and nearly as many areas exhibited slopes above and below the mean overall slope. The change in the traditional way of fishing, the increase in illegal fishing, and the lack of adequate knowledge about the larval cycle of the species may have driven the failure of the TURF areas for C. concholepas. Since fishing is prohibited in the remaining open access areas but is poorly controlled, we suggest ending this prohibition in open access areas and maintaining existing TURF areas to assess actual landings of C. concholepas in Chile. This change may improve the protection of the species.

AB Although spatial analysis of population genetic structure has been one of the most important ways to infer microevolutionary processes, these studies are usually focused on neutral dynamics and limited dispersal, interpreted under the theoretical reasoning of isolation-by-distance. More recently, however, there has been a growing interest on how environmental variation is also involved in population differentiation, both by direct effects of local adaptation and other processes related to environmentally or ecologically constrained dispersal. Here we evaluated patterns of genetic population structure and isolation-by-ecology, or environment (IBE), in Eugenia dysenterica DC (Myrtaceae), a fruit tree species of economic potential interest and widely distributed throughout the Central Brazil and endemic to the Cerrado biome (Neotropical savannas). We analyzed population structure using nuclear SSR markers for 736 individuals sampled from 23 localities (local population) and disentangled the effects of genetic molecular variation, estimated by pairwise F-ST (matrix G) and geographical distances (matrix S) into Grinnelian niche of populations (matrix E), based on climate and soil data. Spatial patterns in eigenvectors of G and E reveal northwest-southeast gradients, coherent with geographic range shifts after the Last Glacial Maximum. We used different forms of Mantel regression and correlation and redundancy analyses, as well as simulations of isolation-by-distance, to show that there is a significant partial correlation between G and E taking S into account, thus supporting the IBE process for E. dysenterica, in addition to other processes related to spatially constrained gene flow.

AB A key challenge of the 21st century will be to provide the growing world population with a sustainable and secure supply of food. Consequently, the dairy farming's primary task is to lower milk losses and other inefficiencies associated with diseased cows. Moreover, a shift from curative to preventive health management would be desirable for mastitis and a wide variety of other infectious and non-infectious cattle diseases, some of which are known to have profound negative effects on the performance and well-being of cows. Differential cell counting (DCC), a procedure that aims to determine the proportions of different somatic cell types in raw milk samples, has not only the potential to optimize mastitis diagnostics, but it could furthermore serve as a diagnostic tool for monitoring the general and overall health status of dairy cows. Based on a broad search of the literature, the practical utility of various types of DCC is summarized and discussed in this review. Since it might be of advantage to interpret DCC with the aid of data from studies in humans, differences between the immune systems of humans and dairy cattle, with a special focus on surface marker expression profiles and gamma delta (gamma delta) T-cell characteristics, are also described.

AB Simple Summary During the last Ice Age, most European animals retreated into southern refuges (mainly the Iberian, Italian, and Balkan peninsulas) from which they recolonized central and northern countries after deglaciation. These medio-European territories may have subsequently acted as secondary centers of southward dispersion for many species. Acting both as a refuge and as an area of colonization from adjacent territories, Italy was the theater of complex biogeographical histories, as illustrated by current distributional patterns of odonates (damselflies and dragonflies). These patterns are a result of historical factors and current ecological conditions. Odonates need freshwater for their development, and their richness in Italy decreases southwards, both because of a decrease in precipitation and because of increasing distance from the mainland (peninsula effect). Biogeographical composition of Italian regions is influenced by climate, geographical distances and historical factors. In particular, biogeographical similarities between Italian regions and adjacent areas revealed multiple colonization patterns. After serving as a glacial refuge from which odonates may have colonized medio-European areas, Italy was in turn subject to complex colonization processes, that made its fauna biogeographically very complex, albeit not particularly rich. As a natural bridge between Europe and Africa, Italy occupies a prominent position to understand the biogeography of Europe. The influence of climatic, spatial, and historical factors on current patterns of species richness and turnover (i.e., inter-regional biogeographical differences) has been analyzed for 88 species occurring in 17 Italian natural regions. Use of multimodel inference showed that odonate richness decreased southwards in response to decreasing rainfall, as expected for animals that depend on freshwater for their development. Use of Mantel tests indicated that patterns of inter-regional similarities were influenced by both climate and geographical distances. These patterns, as highlighted using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling, indicate a role for historical factors. Biogeographical similarities between Italian regions and adjacent areas revealed multiple colonization pathways. These results, coupled with the overall southward decrease in species richness, suggest that, after serving as a Pleistocene refuge from which odonates may have colonized medio-European areas, Italy was in turn subject to colonization from north to south. This resulted in Italian odonate fauna being less species rich compared to faunas in the medio-European territories, but also being biogeographically very complex.

AB This research aimed at analyzing the response of apple tree varieties subjected to soil water deficit and atmo-spheric drought in a field phenotyping platform located in the Mediterranean area. The main assumption of the study was that seasonal and daily stomatal behavior can be monitored by continuous measurement of canopy surface temperature (Ts) as a proxy of stomatal closure. To achieve the study objectives, thermal monitoring of 6 pre-commercial apple varieties was simultaneously carried out throughout one season by nadir-oriented thermo-radiometers placed 1.50 m over the tree top canopy. Two water regimes were applied to each variety during a 4-week summer period: normal irrigation (WW) vs progressive water deficit (WS). The maximum difference in Ts between water regimes was recorded daily between 11:00 and 14:20 GMT, with an earlier closure of stomata in WS trees. During the day, a more negative stem water potential (psi stem) and a higher diurnal Ts (+1 & nbsp; to +2 C) were observed on WS trees, resulting in a significant limitation of fruit growth. Tree water stress was caused by both edaphic and atmospheric droughts, in the medium and short terms respectively, with inter-varietal and inter-regime differences highlighting distinct stomatal closure behaviors. Results suggest that some of the vari-eties studied are well adapted to stressful summer conditions, as long as irrigation needs are met, while other varieties show a particular sensitivity to the mid-day evaporative demand, which may limit their extension. Although these results are not comprehensive enough to predict the optimal performance of varieties under different stress scenarios, the proposed methodology allows to assess the dynamics of tree response to water constraints using non-invasive thermal sensors. It opens up new perspectives for the phenotyping of apple cultivars under abiotic stress, achievable through the quantified study of their transpiration flux in response to stress scenarios. These prospects will require further in planta measurements to dissect varietal differences.

AB Biochars as soil amendments have been reported to improve soil properties and may have an important role in the mitigation of the consequences of climate change. As a novel approach, this study examines whether biochar and digestate co-application can be utilized as cost-effective, renewable plant nutrients. The effects of two types of biochar-wood chip biochar (WBC) and animal bone biochar (ABC), applied alone or in combination with an anaerobic digestate-on soil physicochemical properties, on the levels of selected elements, and on growth yields of ryegrass were studied in laboratory experiments. Most parameters were significantly affected by the treatments, and the investigated factors (biochar type, application rate, and the presence of digestate), as well as their interactions, were found to have significant effects on the characteristics investigated. The easily soluble phosphorus content (AL-P2O5) of the soil increased in all WBC and ABC biochar treatments, and the presence of digestate caused a further increase in AL-P2O5 in the case of anaerobic digestate-supplemented ABC treatment (ABCxAD). The pH increased in both ABC and WBC treatments, and also in the case of ABCxAD treatments. Similar increases in the salt content were detected in ABC-treated samples and in ABCxAD treatments at higher application rates. WBC increased the water holding capacity and carbon content of the soil. Phytotoxic effects of biochars were not detected, although higher doses resulted in slower germination. Combined biochar-digestate applications resulted in increased plant yields compared to sole biochar treatments. Thus, biochar-digestate combinations appear to be applicable as organo-mineral fertilizers.

AB Large carnivores maintain the balance of ecosystems. Understanding distribution and population changes are necessary prerequisites for scientific conservation strategy. The east of Jilin Province is the habitat of endangered Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica). The Chinese government has focused the monitoring on protecting the Amur tiger. However, little is known about Asiatic black bear (ABB, Ursus thibetanus) distribution, population dynamics in the wild, and protection awareness of local residents in Jilin Province, China. We conducted a integrative survey in mountain areas of eastern Jilin to determine ABB distribution. We explored the drivers of the distribution of ABB in Jilin using logstic regression, we further predicted the habitat suitability and potential suitable habitat of the ABB. Totally, we surveyed 112 grids (15 km x 15 km) from November 2015 to January 2019. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the main factors driving ABB distribution in Jilin are forest coverage, distance from protected areas, distance from main roads (railways and highways), and distance from water bodies. The results of questionnaire survey showed that the local residents' understanding of ABB distribution is congruent with our field research. They believed that the number of ABBs has gradually increased in the past ten years. Nevertheless, the local residents have a negative attitude toward the ABBs, which may adversely affect efforts to protect them, possibly leading to more conflicts between humans and bears. Therefore, there is a need to consider ways to change the attitude of the locals through the strengthening of the protection propaganda and advocating management as being critical for the protection of ABBs. Our research provides a scientific basis for future conservation planning. We recommend taking local people's attitude into consideration during conservation management strategy making to reduce human-bear conflicts and promote the coexistence of humans and bears.

AB Thriving under high population density is considered a major feature of urban exploiter species. Nevertheless, population density appears to be a surprisingly overlooked factor in urban ecology studies. High population numbers observed in urban species might promote pathogen transmission and negatively affect health or condition, thus requiring investments in immunocompetence. The feral pigeon Columba livia domestica is an example of a successful city-dweller, found in great abundance in large cities across the globe. We investigated the effects of population density on induced immune response (phytohaemagglutinin skin test) and body condition (blood haemoglobin concentration and size-corrected body mass) in 120 feral pigeons, captured along population density gradient in Lodz (central Poland). We found that stronger immune response was associated with higher population density, but was not related to physiological condition and physiological stress (heterophil/lymphocyte ratio). Moreover, condition indices were not associated with population density. However, since pigeon population density was highly correlated with the level of habitat urbanization, we cannot exclude that any density-dependent effects may be mediated by habitat variation. Our results indicate that urban environment, via population density, might exert different selective pressures on immunocompetence and body condition in this successful urban exploiter.

AB Glacial oscillations and associated tectonic processes during the middle-late Pleistocene are thought to have created a unique pattern of species distribution diversity in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). As a subterranean rodent endemic to the QTP, the impact of these geological events on the genetic diversity and demographic history of plateau zokors (Eospalax baileyi) is worth exploring. In this study, genetic diversity analyses were performed based on two mitochondrial DNA regions and microsatellite markers, representing 370 individuals from five populations on a large scale and six populations on two small scales in the eastern QTP. On a large scale, both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers implied substantial genetic diversity and strong differentiation of the five populations. All sampled populations showed only unique haplotypes and lacked shared haplotypes, revealing the isolated nature of most populations. The genetic differentiation of the plateau zokor was in line with that of the isolate by distance (IBD) model. Mismatch distribution and Bayesian skyline analysis suggested recent demographic expansions highly consistent with glaciation events, and BEAST divergence analysis unveiled southward divergence events originating from the northern populations of the eastern QTP. The genetic structure of the five populations was almost singular. On a small scale, all the populations showed high genetic diversity. However, the analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) showed less variation among populations; the genetic differentiation of the populations no longer conformed to IBD model, and the genetic information among populations was more heterogenous and similar to those of each other. Overall, our research revealed the genetic differentiation of plateau zokor driven by quaternary climatic oscillation and the variations in the genetic diversity of the plateau zokor at different geographical scales.

AB Understanding plant hydraulic regulation is critical for predicting plant and ecosystem responses to projected increases in drought stress. Plant hydraulic regulation is controlled by observable, diverse plant hydraulic traits that can vary as much across individuals of the same species as they do across different species. Direct measurements of plant hydraulic traits from a range of ecosystems remain limited in comparison to other, more readily measured traits (e.g., specific leaf area). Furthermore, plant hydraulic trait measurements, often made at leaf or branch levels, are not easily scaled to whole-plant values that are typically used to predict plant and ecosystem fluxes. In this study, multiple whole-plant hydraulic parameters are inferred from observations of plant water use (i.e., sap flow), soil properties, and meteorological data. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo model inversion approach to obtain the best estimates and uncertainty of plant hydraulic parameters that capture whole-plant effective embolism resistance and stomatal sensitivity to decreasing plant water potential. We then use the inferred values in the model to estimate whole-tree water use and isohydricity. This approach reliably infers whole-plant parameter values with enough specificity to resolve inter- and intra-specific differences, and thus supplements time- and labor-intensive direct measurements of traits.

TI On the Potential of Biochar Soil Amendments as a Sustainable Water
   Management Strategy
SO SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Article
DE tropical agriculture; melons; biochar; hydrometric observations; stable
   water isotopes
AB Biochar has been put forward as a potential technology that could help achieve sustainable water management in agriculture through its ability to increase water holding capacity in soils. Despite this opportunity, there are still a limited number of studies, especially in vulnerable regions like the tropics, quantifying the impacts of biochar on soil water storage and characterizing the impacts of biochar additions on plant water composition. To address this critical gap, we present a case study using stable water isotopes and hydrometric data from melon production in tropical agriculture to explore the hydrological impacts of biochar as a soil amendment. Results from our 10-week growing season experiment in Costa Rica under drip irrigation demonstrated an average increase in volumetric soil moisture content of about 10% with an average moisture content of 25.4 cm(3) cm(-3) versus 23.1 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively, for biochar amended plots compared with control plots. Further, there was a reduction in the variability of soil matric potential for biochar amended plots compared with control plots. Our isotopic investigation demonstrated that for both biochar and control plots, there was a consistent increase (or enrichment) in isotopic composition for plant materials moving from the roots, where the average delta O-18 was -8.1 parts per thousand and the average delta H-2 was -58.5 parts per thousand across all plots and samples, up through the leaves, where the average delta O-18 was 4.3 parts per thousand and the average delta H-2 was 0.1 parts per thousand across all plots and samples. However, as there was no discernible difference in isotopic composition for plant water samples when comparing across biochar and control plots, we find that biochar did not alter the composition of water found in the melon plant material, indicating that biochar and plants are not competing for the same water sources. In addition, and through the holistic lens of sustainability, biochar additions allowed locally sourced feedstock carbon to be directly sequestered into the soil while improving soil water availability without jeopardizing production for the melon crop. Given that most of the expansion and intensification of global agricultural production over the next several decades will take place in the tropics and that the variability of tropical water cycling is expected to increase due to climate change, biochar amendments could offer a pathway forward towards sustainable tropical agricultural water management.

AB Since antiquity, the sense of smell (olfaction) is considered as a distance sense, just like sight and hearing. Conversely, the sense of taste (gustation) is thought to operate by direct contact, similarly to touch. With the progress of natural sciences, information at molecular, anatomical, and neurobiological levels has also contributed to the taste-smell dichotomy, but much evidence inconsistent with a sharp differentiation of these two senses has emerged, especially when considering species other than humans. In spite of this, conflicting information has been interpreted so that it could conform to the traditional differentiation. As a result, a confirmation bias is currently affecting scientific research on chemosensory systems and is also hindering the development of a satisfactory narrative of the evolution of chemical communication across taxa. From this perspective, the chemosensory dichotomy loses its validity and usefulness. We thus propose the unification of all chemosensory modalities into a single sense, moving toward a synthetic, complex, and interconnected perspective on the gradual processes by which a vast variety of chemicals have become signals that are crucially important to communication among and within cells, organs, and organisms in a wide variety of environmental conditions.

AB There has been a growing interest in the scientific world in the production of biochar from natural organic wastes as potential sustainable precursors for bioremediation. Potato peel biochar was produced by slow pyrolysis method under oxygen-limited conditions and used as bio adsorbent in bioremediation of commercial pesticide having Chlorpyrifos as an active component. Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate pesticide, highly neurotoxic, and primarily targets the central nervous system of pests and insects. The excess residues of chlorpyrifos are hazardous to environmental flora and fauna. Chlorpyrifos was treated against biochar at varying physical pa-rameters and further optimized by using response surface methodology through Box-Behnken design (BBD). 72.06% of pesticide removal was observed post 24 h of treatment against a pesticide concentration of 1346.85 mu g/ml with a biochar concentration of 1.04 mg/ml under room temperature at pH 5.04. Biochar was charac-terized by proximate and ultimate analysis, FTIR, and SEM-EDX. Characterization by SEM-EDX showed the surface morphology and minerals on the peel and biochar. Microgram of potato peel shows pores of larger size than biochar having many cavities with different dimensions. In the plant system, growth morphology, nutri-tional status, polyphenols, total antioxidant content, and free radical scavenging activity were assessed. Enhancement in presence of biochar was recorded in growth morphology and plant biomolecules including photosynthetic pigments. Better translocation of the nutrient is recorded in biochar treated plants, as evidenced by the low amount of carbohydrate and protein in treated leaves. Biocompatibility assessment of chlorpyriphos in fish erythrocytes showed 43.26% hemolysis by pesticide-treated biochar. The practical use of this approach can also be best utilized if applied to those geographical regions where the soil pH is acidic. Biochar is a marketable bio-product, which can have a positive impact in agriculture, industries, and the energy sector creating a bio-based economy with reduced environmental pollution.

AB The population dynamics of most animal species inhabiting agro-ecosystems may be determined by landscape characteristics, with agricultural intensification and the reduction of natural habitats influencing dispersal and hence limiting gene flow. Increasing landscape complexity would thus benefit many endangered species by providing different ecological niches, but it could also lead to undesired effects in species that can act as crop pests and disease reservoirs. We tested the hypothesis that a highly variegated landscape influences patterns of genetic structure in agricultural pest voles. Ten populations of fossorial water vole, Arvicola scherman, located in a bocage landscape in Atlantic NW Spain were studied using DNA microsatellite markers and a graph-based model. The results showed a strong isolation-by-distance pattern with a significant genetic correlation at smaller geographic scales, while genetic differentiation at larger geographic scales indicated a hierarchical pattern of up to eight genetic clusters. A metapopulation-type structure was observed, immersed in a landscape with a low proportion of suitable habitats. Matrix scale rather than matrix heterogeneity per se may have an important effect upon gene flow, acting as a demographic sink. The identification of sub-populations, considered to be independent management units, allows the establishment of feasible population control efforts in this area. These insights support the use of agro-ecological tools aimed at recreating enclosed field systems when planning integrated managements for controlling patch-dependent species such as grassland voles.

AB Large-scale disturbance events are forecast to increase in severity and frequency due to climate change. Onground surveys are crucial for assessing the immediate impact of disturbances on biodiversity and for informing management responses. However, there are few examples where quantitative tools have guided postdisturbance survey design. In this study, we integrated species distribution modelling and spatial prioritisation to identify taxonomic and spatial gaps in surveys for 92 priority vertebrates 6 months after the 2019-20 wildfires in Australia. We predicted the pre-fire distribution of priority species, mapped locations of post-wildfire surveys that were already underway, and integrated this information with remotely-sensed fire severity maps in the tool, Zonation, to prioritise locations for new surveys across three fire severity classes (unburnt, low severity, high severity). Our results suggest that 6 months after the wildfires, surveys by government agencies had targeted 17 of 20 mammals (85%); 11 of 17 birds (65%); 10 of 17 frogs (59%); 10 of 23 reptiles (43%) and 5 of 17 fish (29%). We developed species distribution models for 63 of these species after collating 120,118 occurrence records from 6 data repositories. By predicting their distribution before the wildfires, we most efficiently identified gaps in survey effort while ensuring representation across species and fire severity classes. Our analysis provided an important `stocktake' of the response effort to the 2019-20 wildfires in Australia and helped inform the allocation of government-funded wildfire recovery programs. Although we focus on wildfire, our approach could assess gaps in survey effort following any large-scale disturbance.

AB Having a complete and reliable list of risk factors from routine laboratory blood test for COVID-19 disease severity and mortality is important for patient care and hospital management. It is common to use meta-analysis to combine analysis results from different studies to make it more reproducible. In this paper, we propose to run multiple analyses on the same set of data to produce a more robust list of risk factors. With our time-to-event survival data, the standard survival analysis were extended in three directions. The first is to extend from tests and corresponding p-values to machine learning and their prediction performance. The second is to extend from single-variable to multiple-variable analysis. The third is to expand from analyzing time-to-decease data with death as the event of interest to analyzing time-to-hospital-release data to treat early recovery as a meaningful event as well. Our extension of the type of analyses leads to ten ranking lists. We conclude that 20 out of 30 factors are deemed to be reliably associated to faster-death or faster-recovery. Considering correlation among factors and evidenced by stepwise variable selection in random survival forest, 10 ~ 15 factors seem to be able to achieve the optimal prognosis performance. Our final list of risk factors contain calcium, white blood cell and neutrophils count, urea and creatine, D-dimer, red cell distribution widths, age, ferritin, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocyte, basophils, anemia related factors (hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration), sodium, potassium, eosinophils, and aspartate aminotransferase.

AB For afforestation, it is necessary to consider habitat conditions and their impact on specific tree species, in order to enable the selection of appropriate species to improve forest productivity and stand stability. Based on the 2014 Beijing forest management inventory data, we evaluated site quality using theoretical growth equations and quantile regression; we analyzed the effects of climate, topography, and soil variables on the growth of six main tree species using random forest models optimized by a genetic algorithm; and we mapped the potential habitat of six main tree species in Beijing. The results showed that climatic factors were the most important factors affecting tree growth. The prediction models had good accuracy, with an AUC of 0.75-0.85. Among the six main tree species studied, Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. was suitable for all of Beijing's forest land. Platycladus orientalis (Linn.) Franco, Robinia pseudoacacia Linn. and Salix matsudana Koidz. were suitable for the mountainous areas, while Sophora japonica Linn. and Populus tomentosa Carr. were suitable for planting in the plains area of southeast Beijing. The optimized random forest model applied in this study gives insight into the distribution suitability of the main tree species in Beijing, and could serve as a reference for afforestation design.

AB Climatic shifts to warmer and often drier conditions are challenging terrestrial species worldwide. These shifts are occurring more rapidly at higher elevations and latitudes, likely causing disproportionate effects to mammalian hibernators there. While there is some information about how these species' ranges are responding to climatic shifts, we lack an understanding of how climate components are affecting species' life history variation, which is key to individual success and population-level resilience. We reviewed the literature to identify the direction of life history responses to climate change in mammalian hibernators along three axes: latitudinal, elevational and temporal. We found 39 studies involving 27 species that reported climate effects on our four target life history traits - phenology, body mass/condition and growth, reproduction and survival. We found warmer temperatures are advancing hibernator phenology and increasing reproductive success. By contrast, warming and drying trends are having uncertain effects on body condition, and complex effects on survival - depending on season, age class, latitude and elevation. We found no pattern of significant climate-trait outcomes by duration or decade of study. More research on drought conditions - particularly in relation to resource availability - would help inform hibernator susceptibility to increased drying trends expected to intensify globally. Notably, our results are highly biased towards small mammal hibernators in Northern Hemisphere alpine/mountain ecosystems, with few long-term studies conducted on Southern Hemisphere hibernators. This review highlights that phenological shifts constitute one of the most obvious consequences of climate change, yet, the timing of life history events (e.g. timing of migration, reproduction, hibernation) remains poorly understood. Further integration of insights from physiologists, evolutionary biologists and population ecologists working on wild populations will improve our collective understanding of the effects of seasonal climatic shifts on mammalian hibernator life history traits, key drivers of their population-level persistence.

AB In June 2019 the UK legislated a 2050 net-zero emissions target. This will require the realisation of a technical Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) sector potentially generating over 60 MtCO(2) pa of negative emissions by 2050. In October 2021, the UK pledged that at least 5 MtCO(2) of engineered negative emissions be deployed by 2030. At present less than 0.5 ktCO(2) pa of engineered negative emissions are deployed. The 10,000-fold scale-up to 2030 will require the co-ordinated engagement of first movers to establish and realise at least one GGR value chain. The 120,000-fold scale up to 2050 will require the integration of multiple GGR value chains with existing infrastructure systems and substantive societal engagement to enhance positive social outcomes. This scaling is fundamental to the UK, and arguably international efforts, to address the worst impacts of climate change.& nbsp;A series of exploratory exercises have been undertaken to identify the financial and non-financial barriers to the establishment of a UK multi-MtCO(2) pa scale GGR sector from a first mover perspective. This is the first synthesis of first mover drivers in the UK GGR sector.& nbsp;The key findings include: (1) The GGR sector represents a multi-billion pound opportunity in 2050; and (2) inspite of this opportunity -as the incentive, policy, regulatory and governance ecosystem presently stands -first movers face too much risk, uncertainty and a multiplicity of dilemmas to commit substantive investments in establishing the UK GGR multi-MtCO2 pa sector.

AB Forest tree growth plays an important role in forest ecosystem carbon cycle and carbon sequestration, and tree growth is affected by many factors. However, information on the contribution rate of different factors to tree growth is still limited. Thus, we hypothesized that increased regional competition has a significant negative impact on tree growth in plantations. In order to ascertain this hypothesis, tree-rings width for developing chronologies and competition data of the Larix kaempferi in Chinese plantations were sampled. Using tree-ring climatology method and non-linear models based on maximum likelihood analysis etc., the relationship between the tree-ring growth and competition index and climatic factors and their relative importance were evaluated in different years-interval and climate-zone. The results showed that the competitive effect for trees growth was always much stronger than the climatic or size effect. Competitive effects change over time, with drought effects (vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI)) on tree growth exacerbated. The significant negative effects of neighborhood competition gradually increased over time. Climate moderates competitive effects during stand development, especially the negative effects of drought index on trees. Trees decline in growth due to climate warming with temperature and precipitation changes, and mainly, increased competition. Overall, these results constitute important new information, which not only further deepens our understanding of important theoretical issues related to plantation tree growth, but also helps to formulate new guidelines to make larch plantations adapt to global changes. Therefore, thinning measures are valuable suggestions to change forest density can promote trees growth, it provides highly valuable information for estimating future forest dynamics and changes in carbon storage and carbon neutrality under climate change.

AB Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases play an important role in the biosynthesis and detoxification of endogenous compounds. In this study, we analyzed a number of P450 genes through transcriptome-wide and genome analyses in Aphis gossypii Glover, the most notorious cotton pests. A total of 49 CYP-putative sequences were identified and classified into 13 families and 21 subfamilies. We identified a putative P450 motif (FXXGXXXCXG), and further analyzed other conserved sequences, which indicate that forty-seven of the fortynine genes seem to be functional, but one is likely non-functional and one is predicted pseudogenes. We found that P450-encoding genes are conserved in gene structure and organization (number, position, and phase of introns) in cotton aphids. The size, transcription orientation, and comparison with other insects of the cotton aphid P450 family suggested that it has evolutionary differentiation. The distribution across the genome and phylogenetic clustering analysis indicated past occurrence of gene duplication events. These results may provide valuable clues for understanding the evolution of the aphid genome, studying the functions of P450s in cotton aphid, and further selecting candidate genes for novel insect control methods.

AB Conservation tillage practices may stimulate soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in croplands by reducing soil disturbance and increasing inputs of crop residue. Although the effect of tillage practices on soil C dynamics is mediated by soil microbes, the relation between microbial community traits and SOC accumulation rate (SAR) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of tillage management on soil properties and microbial community traits (i.e. diversity, composition and keystone taxa) in a long-term (17 years) field experiment. Our experiment was located in a spring maize field with a sandy loam soil (Calcaric-Fluvic Cambisol) in northwest China and included three tillage practices: 1) CT-RR, conventional tillage with residue removed; 2) RT-RI, reduced tillage with residue incorporated; and 3) NT-RM, no-tillage with residue mulched. We sampled soil at 0-10 cm and 10-25 cm to assess the relation between bacterial and fungal community traits and SAR. We found that the initial and current of average SOC stocks was 19 and 28 Mg ha-1 at 0-25 cm, respectively. RT-RI and NTRM increased SOC accumulation at 0-10 cm by 116% and 131% compared with CT-RR, respectively, and RT-RI increased SOC accumulation at 10-25 cm by 159%. Changes in co-occurrence network analysis revealed that NTRM resulted in a stable bacterial network, whereas both RT-RI and NT-RM produced a stable fungal network relative to CT-RR. Microbial diversity and keystone taxa correlated positively with SAR under conservation tillage practices. Using a Zi-Pi plot, we identified several keystone OTUs, five of which (i.e. Cytophagales, JG30KF-CM45, Sphingobacteriales, Thelephorales and Pleosporales) showed a positive correlation with SAR. Our results suggest a strong link between microbial community traits and SOC accumulation rate under conservation tillage practices, and provide insights into the contribution of microbial traits to the sustainability of agroecosystems.

AB Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems that host unique biota and provide vital ecosystem services. Despite their critical importance, we still lack a fundamental understanding of factors controlling species suitability and climate change impacts in wetlands essential to conserving these imperiled ecosystems in the face of anthropogenic threats. Here, we applied ecological niche models (ENMs) inferred from a massive nationwide data set including field surveys and herbarium specimens representing 101 dominant plant species of China's inland wetlands, to explore the potential climate-driven shifts in these ecosystems. Our optimal models applying machine learning and integrating key aspects of climate, soil, topographic hydrology, and anthropogenic disturbance, identified that (a) species of different types (e.g., woody/nonwoody) showed significant differences in their sensitivity to extracted key environmental factors (e.g., isothermality, water table depth) in wetlands; (b) native wetland species likely face habitat shrinkage under climate change, especially in Northeast China, as well as potential encroachment of xeric and nonnative species; (c) only less than 20% of projected conservation hotspots are currently protected. We propose four protection gaps that need to be addressed urgently in China's current wetland protection framework. This study clarifies the conservation priorities of China's inland wetlands and provides practical guidelines for the improvement of wetland conservation efforts.

AB Washing biochar modifies its properties for use as a soil amendment. The important biochar properties for use as a soil amendment are hydrophilicity, adsorption, and stability. Biochar was obtained with intermediate pyrolysis at 400 degrees C of three different feedstocks: woodchips, Bayview Flowers Digestate, and Storm Fisher Digestate biomass. A simple wash with an aqueous surfactant solution improved the properties of the biochar for soil amendment, with a non-ionic surfactant combined with oxidizing hydrogen peroxide being the most effective. The improved properties included the removal of tars and possible modification of surface properties that increased hydrophilicity and adsorption and decreased leaching of any hydrocarbons that could negatively impact the surroundings. As a result, the washed biochar will exhibit better water retention and a more hospitable environment for the growth of beneficial microorganisms. In addition, by making the biochar more hydrophilic, a wash will make its granulation easier, reducing dust emissions during its application and allowing its formulation with enhancement additives. Although many post-pyrolysis treatments of biochars have been investigated, the proposed wash is simple and effective, with beneficial advantages for downstream processing and application as a soil amendment.

AB Increasing atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (D) can influence plant water and carbon uptake. However, growing season variation in stomatal responses to D among tree taxa has not been thoroughly quantified and therefore has not been well-characterized in stomatal regulation models. Using sap flux data from nine riparian species spanning a 600-m elevation gradient in semi-arid northern Utah, USA, we fit a time-varying empirical model of stomatal conductance to D in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The reference conductance (G(ref), conductance at D = 1 kPa) term was modelled as a function of cumulative growing season D, which varied with site elevation. Seven species exhibited G(ref) that varied significantly with cumulative growing season D, but the direction was not consistent among species. Two low-elevation ring-porous species, the invasive Tamarix ramosissima and Elaeagnus angustifolia, exhibited significantly positive correlation between G(ref) and cumulative D, such that standardized stomatal sensitivity (S) decreased during the season. Despite lower D at the mid- and high-elevation sites, five diffuse-porous native species exhibited progressively increasing sensitivity to D during the growing season. Stomatal strategies exhibit seasonal trends that vary by environmental conditions (D) and functional traits (wood anatomy), which complicates the prediction of plant hydraulic function under increasing atmospheric drought. In the increasingly arid western United States, the progressively less sensitive stomatal behaviour of invasive taxa may hasten their dominance in riparian forests.

AB The purpose of this article is to stimulate research on business strategies for biodiversity protection. To that end, we first dispel a common misperception among business scholars that biodiversity loss is caused by only a few industries, clarifying that it is driven by practically all. Further, we organize corporate biodiversity protection strategies into four categories based on temporal and spatial dimensions, namely, conservation, restoration, compensation, and reparation. Finally, we illustrate the unsettled nature of the field and the continuing debates among conservation biologists about the best approaches to biodiversity management. We argue that (i) a firm's biodiversity protection strategy should aim to mitigate the primary driver through which the firm causes biodiversity loss; (ii) firms should report performance in each of the four biodiversity protection strategies separately; and (iii) interdisciplinary collaborations among corporate sustainability scholars and conservation biologists are critical to developing effective biodiversity protection strategies.

AB Background: Haplotype provides significant insights into understanding genomes at both individual and population levels. However, research on many non-model organisms is still based on independent genetic variations due to the lack of haplotype.Results: We conducted haplotype assembling for Equus asinu, a non-model organism that plays a vital role in human civilization. We described the hybrid single individual assembled haplotype of the Dezhou donkey based on the high-depth sequencing data from single-molecule real-time sequencing (x30), Illumina short-read sequencing (x211), and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (x56). We assembled a near-complete haplotype for the high-depth sequenced Dezhou donkey individual and a phased cohort for the resequencing data of the donkey population.Conclusion: Here, we described the complete chromosome-scale haplotype of the Dezhou donkey with more than a 99.7% phase rate. We further phased a cohort of 156 donkeys to form a donkey haplotype dataset with more than 39 million genetic variations.

AB Aim Revealing how diversity varies across the depth gradient is key for understanding the role of mesophotic coral ecosystems in the functioning of coral reefs. We quantitatively examined how alpha and beta generic diversity of scleractinian coral assemblages vary across a wide depth gradient for coral reefs. Location Sixteen sites in eight islands of three archipelagos in French Polynesia. Methods We studied generic diversity patterns of scleractinian corals, as derived from the analysis of photo-quadrats, across the seafloor from shallow to lower mesophotic depths (6-120 m) and on a wide geographic scale. Our sampling considered quantitative coral cover to explore the patterns of alpha and beta components of diversity across depth and horizontal space. Results We show that in French Polynesia, mesophotic coral ecosystems host higher alpha and beta generic diversity than shallow reefs despite decreasing coral cover with depth. The variation of coral genus richness across the depth gradient is mainly driven by a mid-domain effect with a peak at 40 m depth. At the same time, we found that the differences in coral genera across islands (spatial beta-diversity) increased steadily along the depth gradient. Main conclusions Our findings report the first quantitative results of coral cover and diversity from mesophotic coral ecosystems in French Polynesia and also present one of the few existing studies to examine the broad breadth of the mesophotic depth gradient. We demonstrate that mesophotic depths can host unexpectedly high generic richness of scleractinian coral assemblages. At the same time, we showed that increasing depth increases the differences in generic diversity composition across islands, whereas shallow reefs are similar in between. While a single island could conserve shallow regional biodiversity, mesophotic depths containing the richest diversity require site-specific measures, suggesting that considering these mesophotic depths in conservation is necessary to maintain regional diversity.

AB Biodiversity loss due to climate change is one of the most critical current environmental problems. Global warming is causing substantial species-range shifts and local extirpations, especially for species with restricted distribution ranges. Studies of impact of the climate change on species ranges and environmental suitability have become a fundamental tool for evaluating conservation strategies. However, one important limitation of these approaches is that only species with an adequate number of spatially distinct occurrence records can be modelled, generally excluding threatened rare species from the analyses, a situation referred to as the 'rare species modelling paradox'. To overcome this limitation, we analysed the effect of climate change on the richness of threatened endemic plants of Argentina employing a macroecological modelling approach, using three different modelling techniques (generalized linear mixed models - GLMM, generalized additive models - GAM, and boosted regression trees - BRT), four general circulation models, two representative CO2 concentration pathways (RCPs), and two time periods (2050 and 2070). We identified grid cells with the greatest decline in numbers of threatened endemics, determined species composition in these cells and characterized their vulnerability using three indices. A loss of species richness is observed in ca 83% of the cells, and both protected areas and hotspots of threatened species show significant decrease in future species richness. We identified 32 most affected cells under future climatic projections, including a total of 370 threatened endemic species and exhibiting high beta diversity values (high dissimilarity) among most of the cells. Cells with the highest vulnerability were located along the Central Andes of northwestern Argentina, along the Southern Andean Yungas, High Monte and Central Andean Puna ecoregions, and including a total of 118 threatened endemics (15% of those registered for Argentina) with greater representation of Asteraceae, Apocynaceae, Cactaceae and Iridaceae. However, coverage of protected area network is less than 5% for each of these cells. Our results highlight the urgent need for both in situ and ex situ conservation policies and strategies for the vascular flora of Argentina.

AB As agricultural land use and climate change continue to pose increasing threats to biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa, efforts are being made to identify areas where trade-offs between future agricultural development and terrestrial biodiversity conservation are expected to be greatest. However, little research so far has focused on freshwater biodiversity conservation in the context of agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to identify lakes and lake areas where freshwater biodiversity is most likely to be affected by eutrophication and Harmful Algal Blooms (i.e., when algae multiply to the extent that they have toxic effects on people and freshwater fauna), some of the most important emerging threats to freshwater ecosystems worldwide, especially with the onset of climate change. Using novel remote-sensing techniques, we identified lakes that demonstrated high biodiversity and algal bloom levels. We calculated the richness of freshwater species and the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) to prioritize lakes in Ghana, Ethiopia, Zambia, and bordering countries, of high priority for conservation. We identified 169 priority lakes and lake areas for conservation, based on high levels of biodiversity exposed to potentially harmful algal blooms. Zambia had the most lakes identified as conservation priorities (76% of its small lakes and five 100-km(2) areas in large lakes). Many of the conservation priority lakes and lake areas identified in this study were in transboundary watersheds; thus, collaborative water resource management and conservation at the watershed scale is needed. The use of remote-sensing tools to prioritize freshwater systems for conservation according to algal-bloom risk is vital in remote, undersampled world regions, especially given the increasing threat posed to freshwater biodiversity by rapidly expanding agriculture and climate change.

AB Habitat fragmentation threatens biodiversity worldwide, particularly affecting large-bodied species that require vast territories and move across long distances, including most large felids. The jaguar Panthera onca has lost more than half of its habitat throughout its range and its subpopulations are becoming isolated, making them susceptible to local extinction. Knowledge about the status of its subpopulations in highly fragmented environments is lacking but urgently needed. Using camera traps during 2019-2020, we estimated number of individuals, age classes and sex ratio, occupancy, relative abundance and density of jaguars in Nayarit, western Mexico. We also determined the relative abundance of potential prey and estimated the land-cover change rate during 1999-2019, using GIS. We found that a resident subpopulation of five adult females, two adult males and one cub, at a high density (5.3 individuals/100 km(2)), is supported by at least 14 wild prey species. Natural habitat in the area is rapidly decreasing because of expanding agriculture and shrimp farming: agricultural areas increased from 39 to 50% and mangroves decreased from 35 to 26% of the study area over 20 years. The high jaguar population density and the diversity and relative abundance of remaining wild prey are remarkable, considering that natural habitat in the area is highly fragmented, shrinking rapidly and embedded in a matrix of human-dominated land-cover types. Effective conservation actions are needed urgently, including the protection of patches with native vegetation, reforestation to maintain connectivity between these patches, and the involvement of local communities.

AB A growing body of research suggests that genome size in animals can be affected by ecological factors. Half a century ago, Ebeling et al. proposed that genome size increases with depth in some teleost fish groups and discussed a number of biological mechanisms that may explain this pattern (e.g., passive accumulation, adaptive acclimation). Using phylogenetic comparative approaches, we revisit this hypothesis based on genome size and ecological data from up to 708 marine fish species in combination with a set of large-scale phylogenies, including a newly inferred tree. We also conduct modeling approaches of trait evolution and implement a variety of regression analyses to assess the relationship between genome size and depth. Our reanalysis of Ebeling et al.'s dataset shows a weak association between these variables, but the overall pattern in their data is driven by a single Glade. Although new analyses based on our "all-species" dataset resulted in positive correlations, providing some evidence that genome size evolves as a function of depth, only one subclade consistently yielded statistically significant correlations. By contrast, negative correlations are rare and nonsignificant. All in all, we find modest evidence for an increase in genome size along the depth axis in marine fishes. We discuss some mechanistic explanations for the observed trends.

AB Premise Biodiversity is often only measured with species richness; however, this metric ignores evolutionary history and is not sufficient for making conservation decisions. Here, we characterize multiple facets and drivers of biodiversity to understand how these relate to bioregions and conservation status in the ferns of Japan. Methods We compiled a community data set of 1239 grid cells (20 x 20 km each) including 672 taxa based on >300,000 specimen records. We combined the community data with a phylogeny and functional traits to analyze taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity and modeled biodiversity metrics in response to environmental factors and reproductive mode. Hierarchical clustering was used to delimit bioregions. Conservation status and threats were assessed by comparing the overlap of significantly diverse grid cells with conservation zones and range maps of native Japanese deer. Results Taxonomic richness was highest at mid-latitudes. Phylogenetic and functional diversity and phylogenetic endemism were highest in small southern islands. Relative phylogenetic and functional diversity were high at high and low latitudes, and low at mid-latitudes. Grid cells were grouped into three (phylogenetic) or four (taxonomic) major bioregions. Temperature and apomixis were identified as drivers of biodiversity patterns. Conservation status was generally high for grid cells with significantly high biodiversity, but the threat due to herbivory by deer was greater for taxonomic richness than other metrics. Conclusions Our integrative approach reveals previously undetected patterns and drivers of biodiversity in the ferns of Japan. Future conservation efforts should recognize that threats can vary by biodiversity metric and consider multiple metrics when establishing conservation priorities.

   GUIDELINES; FRAMEWORK; POWER
AB A paradigm shift away from null hypothesis significance testing seems in progress. Based on simulations, we illustrate some of the underlying motivations. First, p-values vary strongly from study to study, hence dichotomous inference using significance thresholds is usually unjustified. Second, 'statistically significant' results have overestimated effect sizes, a bias declining with increasing statistical power. Third, 'statistically non-significant' results have underestimated effect sizes, and this bias gets stronger with higher statistical power. Fourth, the tested statistical hypotheses usually lack biological justification and are often uninformative. Despite these problems, a screen of 48 papers from the 2020 volume of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology exemplifies that significance testing is still used almost universally in evolutionary biology. All screened studies tested default null hypotheses of zero effect with the default significance threshold of p = 0.05, none presented a pre-specified alternative hypothesis, pre-study power calculation and the probability of 'false negatives' (beta error rate). The results sections of the papers presented 49 significance tests on average (median 23, range 0-390). Of 41 studies that contained verbal descriptions of a 'statistically non-significant' result, 26 (63%) falsely claimed the absence of an effect. We conclude that studies in ecology and evolutionary biology are mostly exploratory and descriptive. We should thus shift from claiming to 'test' specific hypotheses statistically to describing and discussing many hypotheses (possible true effect sizes) that are most compatible with our data, given our statistical model. We already have the means for doing so, because we routinely present compatibility ('confidence') intervals covering these hypotheses.

AB Wood density (WD), a key trait in the trait-based approach of plant ecology, represents a carbon investment trait that varies across species and reflects a trade-off between metabolism and longevity. Across species, WD has been found to vary with phylogeny, moisture, temperature and xylem anatomy (e.g. vessel diameter). However, we know little about WD variation at the intraspecific level. Here, we examined how ecologically important functional traits vary in relation to WD in three generalist, exceptionally wide-niche breadth tree species from southern Chile, making use of broad precipitation and temperature gradients. We collected branches from Embothrium coccineum and Nothofagus antarctica across a wide W-E precipitation gradient (2,500-600 mm of annual precipitation) and from N. pumilio across an elevational gradient (from low to treeline elevation). For each individual, we determined WD, several xylem anatomical features, for example, mean vessel diameter (MVD), hydraulic diameter (Dh), hydraulic conductivity (Kt), mean vessel area (MVA), vessel size distribution (MVA/VD) and other traits including concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), secondary growth, leaf traits, water-use efficiency (iWUE) and growth rate (AI). We quantified the correlation between WD and other traits and evaluated whether WD-trait relationships differed across species using linear mixed-effects models. We found consistent and significant negative relationships between WD and several xylem anatomy traits, including Dh, Kt, MVA and MVD. Contrary to our expectations, WD was not related to leaf traits, NSCs, iWUE and AI. Wood density had a significantly negative relationship to MVA/VD (and to a lesser extent, MVD) for both E. coccineum and N. antarctica (the precipitation gradient), while these relationships were positive for N. pumilio (the temperature gradient). Few of the WD and other trait relationships examined at the intraspecific level in this study paralleled those found across species. At the intraspecific level, WD proved to be much more related to xylem anatomical traits than to other traits. Importantly, in some cases, WD-xylem anatomical trait relationships showed opposite trends depending on the environmental gradient. We must be cautious when using interspecific studies as the basis for inferring trait-based responses to environmental change across other organisation levels.

AB The impact of climate change and the effect of rapid urbanisation in a region can be best identified by detecting land use and land cover changes. The present research attempts to statistically evaluate the land cover changes in the state of Kerala over two decades (2001-2019), using land cover derived by the supervised classification of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. Land cover classification, based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), differentiated nine land cover types in the region such as forests (F), shrublands/scrublands (SL), savannas (S), croplands (CL), grasslands (GL), urban and built-up lands (UBL), cropland/natural vegetation mosaics (CLNVM), water body (WB) and other types (OT). Among the land cover types, savannas cover more than 41% of the total area, followed by forests (20%) and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics (14%). During the analysis period, forests, cropland/natural vegetation mosaics and built-up lands showed increases in their area coverage. Furthermore, the decadal (D1 and D2) analysis of land cover dynamics reveals that maximum spatial variation in area coverage of individual land cover occurred in the second decade, i.e. D2 (2011-2019). Accurate examination of the distribution of land cover types indicates the elevation dependant gradational land cover pattern in the study area. Trend statistics of land cover assessed through Mann-Kendall and linear regression analysis also showed similar results with a statistically significant increase in the area covered by forests, shrublands, urban and built-up lands and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics. In contrast, savannas and grasslands showed a significant decreasing trend. Together, the results indicate an increasing pattern of urbanisation and the development of cropland/natural vegetation mosaics, irrespective of elevation and land cover types point towards the degradation and fragmentation of strong and healthy vegetation cover in the region. Furthermore, the present research finding will help researchers and policy makers to concentrate on areas that showed maximum changes in land cover to derive accurate and sustainable environmental protection and development plans.

AB Photosynthetic bacteria in hot springs are of great importance to both microbial evolution and ecology. While a large body of work has focused on oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria in Mushroom and Octopus Springs in Yellowstone National Park, many questions remain regarding the metabolic potential and ecology of hot spring anoxygenic phototrophs.
   Alkaline hot springs in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) provide a framework to study the relationship between photoautotrophs and temperature. Previous work has focused on studying how cyanobacteria (oxygenic phototrophs) vary with temperature, sulfide, and pH, but many questions remain regarding the ecophysiology of anoxygenic photosynthesis due to the taxonomic and metabolic diversity of these taxa. To this end, we examined the distribution of genes involved in phototrophy, carbon fixation, and nitrogen fixation in eight alkaline (pH 7.3-9.4) hot spring sites near the upper temperature limit of photosynthesis (71oC) in YNP using metagenome sequencing. Based on genes encoding key reaction center proteins, geographic isolation plays a larger role than temperature in selecting for distinct phototrophic Chloroflexi, while genes typically associated with autotrophy in anoxygenic phototrophs, did not have distinct distributions with temperature. Additionally, we recovered Calvin cycle gene variants associated with Chloroflexi, an alternative carbon fixation pathway in anoxygenic photoautotrophs. Lastly, we recovered several abundant nitrogen fixation gene sequences associated with Roseiflexus, providing further evidence that genes involved in nitrogen fixation in Chloroflexi are more common than previously assumed. Together, our results add to the body of work on the distribution and functional potential of phototrophic bacteria in Yellowstone National Park hot springs and support the hypothesis that a combination of abiotic and biotic factors impact the distribution of phototrophic bacteria in hot springs. Future studies of isolates and metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from these data and others will further our understanding of the ecology and evolution of hot spring anoxygenic phototrophs. IMPORTANCE Photosynthetic bacteria in hot springs are of great importance to both microbial evolution and ecology. While a large body of work has focused on oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria in Mushroom and Octopus Springs in Yellowstone National Park, many questions remain regarding the metabolic potential and ecology of hot spring anoxygenic phototrophs. Anoxygenic phototrophs are metabolically and taxonomically diverse, and further investigations into their physiology will lead to a deeper understanding of microbial evolution and ecology of these taxa. Here, we have quantified the distribution of key genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in both oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs. Our results suggest that temperature >68oC selects for distinct groups of cyanobacteria and that carbon fixation pathways associated with these taxa are likely subject to the same selective pressure. Additionally, our data suggest that phototrophic Chloroflexi genes and carbon fixation genes are largely influenced by local conditions as evidenced by our gene variant analysis. Lastly, we recovered several genes associated with potentially novel phototrophic Chloroflexi. Together, our results add to the body of work on hot springs in Yellowstone National Park and set the stage for future work on metagenome assembled genomes.

AB In gregarious animals, social network positions of individuals may influence their life-history and fitness. Although association patterns and the position of individuals in social networks can be shaped by phenotypic differences and by past interactions, few studies have quantified their relative importance. We evaluated how phenotypic differences and familiarity influence social preferences and the position of individuals within the social network. We monitored wild-caught common waxbills (Estrilda astrild) with radio-frequency identifiers in a large mesocosm during the non-breeding and breeding seasons of two consecutive years. We found that social networks were similar, and that the centrality of individuals was repeatable, across seasons and years, indicating a stable social phenotype. Nonetheless, there were seasonal changes in social structure: waxbills associated more strongly with opposite-sex individuals in breeding seasons, whereas in non-breeding seasons they instead assorted according to similarities in social dominance. We also observed stronger assortment between birds that were introduced to the mesocosm at the same time, indicating long-lasting bonds among familiar individuals. Waxbills that had been introduced to the mesocosm more recently occupied more central network positions, especially during breeding seasons, perhaps indicating that these birds had less socially-differentiated associations with flock members. Finally, individual differences in color ornamentation and behavioral assays of personality, inhibitory control, and stress were not related to network centrality or association patterns. Together, these results suggest that, in gregarious species like the common waxbill, social networks may be more strongly shaped by long-lasting associations with familiar individuals than by phenotypic differences among group members.
   Social networks of common waxbills appear more strongly shaped by associations with familiar individuals than by phenotypes. Familiarity was the main predictor of long-term associations among wild-caught waxbills over two years in a large mesocosm, but waxbills also preferred opposite-sex associations during breeding seasons and, in non-breeding seasons, assorted according to dominance rank. Results show that social structure in gregarious animals can depend more on long-lasting familiarity than on phenotypic differences among individuals.

AB Despite the long-standing interest in the organization of ant communities across elevational gradients, few studies have incorporated the evolutionary information to understand the historical processes that underlay such patterns. Through the evaluation of phylogenetic alpha and beta-diversity, we analyzed the structure of leaf-litter ant communities along the Cofre de Perote mountain in Mexico and evaluated whether deterministic- (i.e., habitat filtering, interspecific competition) or stochastic-driven processes (i.e., dispersal limitation) were driving the observed patterns. Lowland and some highland sites showed phylogenetic clustering, whereas intermediate elevations and the highest site presented phylogenetic overdispersion. We infer that strong environmental constraints found at the bottom and the top elevations are favoring closely-related species to prevail at those elevations. Conversely, less stressful climatic conditions at intermediate elevations suggest interspecific interactions are more important in these environments. Total phylogenetic dissimilarity was driven by the turnover component, indicating that the turnover of ant species along the mountain is actually shifts of lineages adapted to particular locations resembling their ancestral niche. The greater phylogenetic dissimilarity between communities was related to greater temperature differences probably due to narrow thermal tolerances inherent to several ant lineages that evolved in more stable conditions. Our results suggest that the interplay between environmental filtering, interspecific competition and habitat specialization plays an important role in the assembly of leaf-litter ant communities along elevational gradients.

AB Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a promising tool to monitor species distribution and abundance in aquatic ecosystems. These estimates can be biased in lotic environments by the effects of eDNA transport and deposition processes. However, our understanding of eDNA downstream transport dynamics is limited because it can fluctuate greatly depending on target species abundance and eDNA quantity in a source site and the design of aquatic sampling. Furthermore, eDNA deposition into bottom substrates also determines the availability of aqueous eDNA, but knowledge about deposition is much more limited. Consequently, there is little consensus about eDNA downstream transport and deposition, as well as their interactions with hydrogeographic conditions. In this study, we compiled previous papers concerning riverine eDNA transport and synthesised knowledge about eDNA transport and deposition. A few studies have recently applied a hydrodynamic modelling approach and calculated the average length of eDNA downstream transport (S-w) and velocity of eDNA deposition (V-dep). Referring to those studies, we manually calculated, or directly extracted, S-w and V-dep from the nine eDNA papers and conducted meta-analyses to reveal the association of these estimates with river discharges. Furthermore, we simulated the mean length of eDNA downstream transport in a channel with given hydrogeographic conditions. The estimated S-w and V-dep values ranged from 2.6 to 13,187.4 m and 0.003 to 1.900 mm/s, respectively. When log-transformed, the median S-w and V-dep values were 10(2.188) (= 154.1) m and 10(-1.387) (= 0.041) mm/s. The calculated maximum eDNA transport distances until 95% and 99% of the target eDNA particles are deposited ranged from 334.0 to 1,272.7 m and 513.5 to 1,956.4 m, respectively. Moreover, we found that river discharges were positively associated with S-w, whereas V-dep was lower for natural environments than mesocosms. This trend could be due to other environmental factors, such as bottom substrates. Our meta-analysis implied that, under ordinary hydrogeographic conditions, most eDNA particles could travel less than 2 km downstream even when considering the resuspension of eDNA from riverbeds. By contrast, our study did not consider multiple environmental factors that potentially affect eDNA transport and would accordingly introduce a moderate to high degree of heterogeneity across studies. These issues will be addressed in future studies. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantitatively synthesise the length of eDNA downstream transport in riverine environments and infer general properties of eDNA downstream transport distance and deposition velocity. According to our results, much of the eDNA released from individuals might have little effect on the detection of target eDNA in the sampling sites more than 2 km downstream. Although further accumulation of empirical studies is necessary, our findings propose the groundwork for optimal eDNA sampling designs in riverine ecosystems to reduce the false-positive inference of species presence and false-negative eDNA detection.

AB Byers-Heinlein et al. (2021) argue that a greater focus on reliability in infant research is much needed and desirable for the field. Moreover, they offer a number of possible solutions to increase reliability in infant research. Here, I do not discuss the suitability of the offered solutions. Instead, I further develop the authors' argument by considering the worryingly downstream consequences of low reliability for the very possibility of drawing meaningful inferences from the results of replication studies. I argue that the sources of error related to sampling and measurement greatly affect the estimates, resulting in confidence intervals being often very wide. Consequently, interpreting the differences between small-scale original and replication studies becomes a meaningless task, which, I maintain, could be replaced by a meta-analytic mindset and the habit of fully incorporating uncertainty in the reasoning about research findings.

AB Aims Human-induced pressures such as deforestation cause anthropogenic range contractions (ARCs). Such contractions present dynamic distributions that may engender data misrepresentations within species distribution models. The temporal bias of occurrence data-where occurrences represent distributions before (past bias) or after (recent bias) ARCs-underpins these data misrepresentations. Occurrence-habitat mismatching results when occurrences sampled before contractions are modelled with contemporary anthropogenic variables; niche truncation results when occurrences sampled after contractions are modelled without anthropogenic variables. Our understanding of their independent and interactive effects on model performance remains incomplete but is vital for developing good modelling protocols. Through a virtual ecologist approach, we demonstrate how these data misrepresentations manifest and investigate their effects on model performance. Location Virtual Southeast Asia. Methods Using 100 virtual species, we simulated ARCs with 100-year land-use data and generated temporally biased (past and recent) occurrence datasets. We modelled datasets with and without a contemporary land-use variable (conventional modelling protocols) and with a temporally dynamic land-use variable. We evaluated each model's ability to predict historical and contemporary distributions. Results Greater ARC resulted in greater occurrence-habitat mismatching for datasets with past bias and greater niche truncation for datasets with recent bias. Occurrence-habitat mismatching prevented models with the contemporary land-use variable from predicting anthropogenic-related absences, causing overpredictions of contemporary distributions. Although niche truncation caused underpredictions of historical distributions (environmentally suitable habitats), incorporating the contemporary land-use variable resolved these underpredictions, even when mismatching occurred. Models with the temporally dynamic land-use variable consistently outperformed models without. Main conclusions We showed how these data misrepresentations can degrade model performance, undermining their use for empirical research and conservation science. Given the ubiquity of ARCs, these data misrepresentations are likely inherent to most datasets. Therefore, we present a three-step strategy for handling data misrepresentations: maximize the temporal range of anthropogenic predictors, exclude mismatched occurrences and test for residual data misrepresentations.

AB Aim: How beta-diversity patterns are shaped by landscape-level processes remains unclear across habitat island systems. Here we assessed landscape-level bird beta-diversity in habitat island systems and aimed to (1) evaluate the relative contribution of turnover (beta(SIM)) and nestedness-resultant (beta(SNE)) components to multisite beta-diversity (beta(SOR)) from taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions; (2) examine the influence of climate factors and system characteristics in shaping landscape-level patterns of beta-diversity measures; and (3) study how beta-diversity patterns of bird communities vary with the spatial extents of island systems.
   Location: Global.
   Taxon: Birds.
   Methods: We compiled bird data in 22 habitat island systems from literature and classified these island systems into small and large spatial scales. We partitioned beta(SOR) into beta(SIM) and beta(S)(NE) from three dimensions for each system and calculated standardized functional and phylogenetic beta-diversity measures. We assessed the effects of climate factors and system characteristics on observed and standardized beta-diversity measures by multiple linear models for both small and large systems.
   Results: We found that the dominant role of beta(SI)(M) to beta(SO)(R) in habitat island systems was pervasive. However, the best explanatory variables were not consistent across systems, which depended on the beta-diversity components, diversity dimensions and spatial extent of habitat island systems. In general, climate factors acted as the main drivers of bird communities across small and large systems, whereas system characteristics played minor roles.
   Main conclusions: Spatial turnover dominated overall bird beta-diversity in most habitat island systems. Our results imply the roles of niche-based assembly processes through the interplay among differential functional traits and phylogenetic distances of species, climate factors and system characteristics as well as spatial extent in driving bird communities across multiple habitat island systems at a landscape level. This study offers a better understanding of the processes underlying macroecological patterns of isolated biological communities across habitat island systems.

AB Enhanced rock weathering is competitive with other carbon sequestration strategies in terms of land, energy and water use with its overall sustainability dependent on that of the energy system supplying it, according to a process-based life cycle assessment.
   Enhanced Rock Weathering is a proposed Carbon Dioxide Removal technology involving the application of crushed silicate rocks, such as basalt, to agricultural soils with potential co-benefits for crops and soils, and mitigation of ocean acidification. Here we address the requirement of diverse stakeholders for informative studies quantifying possible environmental and health risks of Enhanced Rock Weathering. Using life-cycle assessment modelling of potential supply chain impacts for twelve nations undertaking Enhanced Rock Weathering deployment to deliver up to net 2 Gt CO2 y(r-1) CDR, we find that rock grinding rather than mining exerts the dominant influence on environmental impacts. This finding holds under both a business-as-usual and clean energy mix scenario to 2050 but transitioning to undertaking Enhanced Rock Weathering in the future with low carbon energy systems improves the sustainability of the Enhanced Rock Weathering supply chain. We find that Enhanced Rock Weathering is competitive with other large-scale Carbon Dioxide Removal strategies in terms of energy and water demands.

AB To verify the "nearly neutral theory (NNT)," the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) was compared among populations of different species. To determine the validity of NNT, however, populations that are genetically isolated from each other but share the same selection agents and differ in size should be compared. Genetically different lineages of obligate asexual Daphnia pulex invading Japan from North America are an ideal example as they satisfy these prerequisites. Therefore, we analyzed the whole-genome sequences of 18 genotypes, including those of the two independently invaded D. pulex lineages (JPN1 and JPN2) and compared the dN/dS ratio between the lineages. The base substitution rate of each genotype demonstrated that the JPN1 lineage having a larger distribution range diverged earlier and thus was older than the JPN2 lineage. Comparisons of the genotypes within lineages revealed that changes in dN/dS occurred after the divergence and were larger in the younger lineage, JPN2. These results imply that the JPN1 lineage has been more effectively subjected to purification selections, while slightly deteriorating mutations are less purged in JPN2 with smaller population size. Altogether, the lineage-specific difference in the dN/dS ratio for the obligate asexual D. pulex was well explained by the NNT.

AB Increasing temperature and drought can result in leaf dehydration and defoliation even in drought-adapted tree species such as the Mediterranean evergreen Quercus ilex L. The stomatal regulation of leaf water potential plays a central role in avoiding this phenomenon and is constrained by a suite of leaf traits including hydraulic conductance and vulnerability, hydraulic capacitance, minimum conductance to water vapour, osmotic potential and cell wall elasticity. We investigated whether the plasticity in these traits may improve leaf tolerance to drought in two long-term rainfall exclusion experiments in Mediterranean forests. Osmotic adjustment was observed to lower the water potential at turgor loss in the rainfall-exclusion treatments, thus suggesting a stomatal closure at more negative water potentials and a more anisohydric behaviour in drier conditions. Conversely, leaf hydraulic conductance and vulnerability did not exhibit any plasticity between treatments so the hydraulic safety margins were narrower in the rainfall-exclusion treatments. The sequence of leaf responses to seasonal drought and dehydration was conserved among treatments and sites but trees were more likely to suffer losses of turgor and hydraulic functioning in the rainfall-exclusion treatments. We conclude that leaf plasticity might help the trees to tolerate moderate drought but not to resist severe water stress.

AB Language processing relies on a left-lateralized fronto-temporal brain network. How this network emerges ontogenetically remains debated. We asked whether frontal language areas emerge in the absence of temporal language areas through a 'deep-data' investigation of an individual (EG) born without her left temporal lobe. Using fMRI methods that have been validated to elicit reliable individual-level responses, we find that-as ex-pected for early left-hemisphere damage-EG has a fully functional language network in her right hemisphere (comparable to the LH network in n = 145 controls) and intact linguistic abilities. However, we detect no response to language in EG's left frontal lobe (replicated across two sessions, 3 years apart). Another net-work-the multiple demand network-is robustly present in frontal lobes bilaterally, suggesting that EG's left frontal cortex can support non-linguistic cognition. The existence of temporal language areas therefore appears to be a prerequisite for the emergence of the frontal language areas.

AB Aims To identify environmental and anthropogenic drivers of alpha- and beta-diversity for native and alien plant species. Location Rio de la Plata grasslands, South America (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay; 27.3-39.1 degrees S, 50.1-66.5 degrees W). Methods We assembled a data set of 597 vegetation plots distributed across the Rio de la Plata grasslands. To assess the drivers of native and alien alpha-diversity (species richness), we performed a generalized least-squares regression using environmental and anthropogenic predictors. We evaluated differences in beta-diversity using Simpson's pairwise dissimilarity between pairs of plots and used multiple regression on distance matrixes to investigate environmental and anthropogenic drivers on compositional dissimilarity for both native and alien plant species. Results Native species richness was higher in sites with less demanding environmental conditions, such as lower precipitation seasonality and soils with higher cation exchange capacity. Numbers of alien species were positively related to soil pH, cropland density and road density and negatively to precipitation seasonality, mean temperatures and soil cation exchange capacity. The compositional dissimilarity was similar for native and alien species assemblages (mean +/- SD: 0.64 +/- 0.16 and 0.64 +/- 0.35 respectively). Areas having similar climates and being geographically close shared more taxonomically similar assemblages, for both native and alien assemblages, while soil had disparate effects. Compositional dissimilarity of alien plants decreased with increasing road density. Conclusions Our results highlight a grassland ecosystem where native species richness is still shaped only by environmental factors, but both sets of factors influence its composition. On the other hand, alien plants carry a strong signal of both environmental and human factors. As time progresses the number of alien species tend to increase, eroding the patterns of native biodiversity. To avoid this, efforts should be made to reduce road encroachment and the conversion of natural grasslands into croplands.

AB Marine coastal areas are increasingly affected by human activities resulting in changes in species and habitat distributions. Understanding these patterns and its causes and consequences is important for conservation and restoration of such changing habitats. One habitat that has been heavily affected by human use are the North Sea oyster beds which once were abundant but have lost large parts of its coastal distribution due to overexploitation. Based on data of living and dead assemblages of Ostrea edulis collected using video transects, we used an ensemble modeling technique to model and predict current and recent distribution of O. edulis along the Swedish west coast where its distribution is, in relative terms, still rather unaffected. We could detect a recent change in the distribution of O. edulis along the coast which to a large extent could be attributed to a change in depth distribution, suggesting that the population of O. edulis have a slightly shallower distribution today than in the past. Although a potential mismatch between living and dead assemblages, caused by a complex combination of biological and environmental conditions, needs to be considered in the interpretations drawn, it may be a way around the lack of suitable background data in management decisions. This provides important information for management and conservation of the native oyster beds. Furthermore, this study illustrates a method for identifying recent changes in species distribution using dead assemblages of bivalves.

AB The implementation of climate-smart policies to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce emissions is being encouraged worldwide to fight climate change. Afforestation practices and rewilding initiatives are climate-smart examples suggested to tackle these issues. In contrast, fire-smart approaches, by stimulating traditional farmland activities or agroforestry practices, could also assist climate regulation while protecting biodiversity. However, there is scarce information concerning the potential impacts of these alternative land management strategies on climate regulation ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. As such, this work simulates future effects of different land management strategies in the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica (Portugal-Spain). Climate-smart ('Afforestation', 'Rewilding') and fire-smart ('Farmland recovery', 'Agroforestry recovery') scenarios were modelled over a period of 60 years (1990-2050), and their impacts on climate regulation services were evaluated. Species distribution models for 207 vertebrates were built and future gains/losses in climate-habitat suitability were quantified. Results suggest climate-smart policies as the best for climate regulation (0.98 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) of mean carbon sequestration increase and 6801.5 Meuro of avoided economic losses in 2020-2050 under Afforestation scenarios), while providing the largest habitat gains for threatened species (around 50% for endangered and critically endangered species under Rewilding scenarios). Fire-smart scenarios also benefit carbon regulation services (0.82 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) of mean carbon sequestration increase and 3476.3 Meuro of avoided economic losses in 2020-2050 under Agroforestry scenarios), benefiting the majority of open-habitat species. This study highlights the main challenges concerning management policies in European rural mountains, while informing decision-makers regarding landscape planning under global change.

AB Urbanization and climate change are two inevitable megatrends of this century. Knowledge about the growth responses of urban trees to climate is of utmost importance towards future management of green infrastructure with the aim of a sustainable provision of the environmental ecosystem services. Using tree-ring records, this study analyzed growth response to climate by stem diameter at breast height (DBH) of 1178 trees in seven large cities worldwide, including Aesculus hippocastanum L. in Munich; Platanus x hispanica Munchh. in Paris; Quercus nigra L. in Houston; Quercus robur L. in Cape Town; Robinia pseudoacacia L. in Santiago de Chile, Munich, and Wurzburg; and Tilia cordata Mill. in Berlin, Munich, and Wurzburg. Climate was characterized following the de Martonne aridity index (DMI). Overall, trees showed an 8.3% lower DBH under arid than humid climate at the age of 100. Drought-tolerant tree species were overall not affected by climate. However, R. pseudoacacia showed a lower diameter when growing in semi-dry than humid climate. In contrast, drought-sensitive tree species were negatively affected by arid climate. Moreover, the effect of drought years on annual diameter increment was assessed. P. x hispanica and R. pseudoacacia appeared as the most drought-resistant species. The highest sensitivity to drought was detected in T. cordata and Q. robur. A. hippocastanum and Q. nigra showed a lower diameter growth during drought events, followed by a fast recovery. This study's findings may contribute to a better understanding of urban tree growth reactions to climate, aiming for sustainable planning and management of urban trees.

AB Studying patterns of population structure across the landscape sheds light on dispersal and demographic processes, which helps to inform conservation decisions. Here, we study how social organization and landscape factors affect spatial patterns of genetic differentiation in an ant species living in mountainous regions. Using genome-wide SNP markers, we assess population structure in the Alpine silver ant, Formica selysi. This species has two social forms controlled by a supergene. The monogyne form has one queen per colony, while the polygyne form has multiple queens per colony. The two social forms co-occur in the same populations. For both social forms, we found a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance across the Alps. Within regions, genetic differentiation between populations was weaker for the monogyne form than for the polygyne form. We suggest that this pattern is due to higher dispersal and effective population sizes in the monogyne form. In addition, we found stronger isolation-by-distance and lower genetic diversity in high elevation populations, compared to lowland populations, suggesting that gene flow between F. selysi populations in the Alps occurs mostly through riparian corridors along lowland valleys. Overall, this survey highlights the need to consider intraspecific polymorphisms when assessing population connectivity and calls for special attention to the conservation of lowland habitats in mountain regions.

AB Grazing management strategies tend to have different effects on rangeland plant production. Changes in grazing management can, therefore, affect the carbon stock potential of rangelands. Despite rangeland ecosystems being important global sinks for carbon, we know relatively little about the effect of traditional grazing management practices on their potential to store carbon. In this study, we evaluated the carbon stock and change rate of rangelands using three traditional grazing management practices in the semiarid pastoral ecosystem of eastern Ethiopia. By comparing data on vegetation and soil carbon stocks, we found that there was a strong significant difference (p < 0.001) between these different management practices. In particular, the establishment of enclosures was associated with an annual increase in carbon stocks of soil (3%) and woody (11.9%) and herbaceous (57.6%) biomass, when compared to communal open lands. Both enclosure and browsing management practices were found to have the highest levels of soil organic carbon stocks, differing only in terms of the amount of woody and herbaceous biomass. Thus, modest changes in traditional grazing management practices can play an important role in carbon storage and sequestration. Further research is required on a wider range of traditional pastoral management practices across space and time, as understanding these processes is key to combating global climate change.

AB Patterns of association in animal societies vary through space and time. Understanding such variation is key to predicting inter- and intra-population variation across factors as diverse as gene flow, disease transmission, and resilience to climate change. Here, we use 3.5 years of observational data, coupled with static and dynamic methods in social network analysis, to investigate patterns of social association in wild giraffe in the northern Namib Desert, Namibia (a habitat of extreme aridity for the species). Our static analyses reveal similar robust nested social communities, but less distinct community structures, than those found in giraffe populations inhabiting less arid environments. Furthermore, results of our dynamic social network analyses show increased social connectivity in this population during the morning and hot-dry season. These temporal patterns align with patterns of thermoregulatory and sociosexual behaviour in this population. However, they differ from temporal patterns of connectivity revealed in populations in less arid environments. Combined, results of both our static and temporal analyses suggest that while the major characteristics of giraffe society persist through space and time, there is substantial variation in the strength of patterns of social connectivity both within and between populations at multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. Significance statement Animal social networks are inherently dynamic. Patterns of connectivity can be shaped by both social factors and habitat variation across space and time. We reveal that a population of uniquely desert-dwelling giraffe maintains a robust, albeit weaker, community structure in a habitat at the extreme edge of its natural range. We also reveal variation in intra-population temporal patterns of connectivity at both daily and seasonal resolutions. Combined, these results suggest that while the major characteristics of giraffe society persist across habitats and through time, the strength of patterns of social connectivity markedly varies in line with habitat factors both within and between populations.

AB Fish perform rapid escape responses to avoid sudden predatory attacks. During escape responses, fish bend their bodies into a C-shape and quickly turn away from the predator and accelerate. The escape trajectory is determined by the initial turn (stage 1) and a contralateral bend (stage 2). Previous studies have used a single threat or model predator as a stimulus. In nature, however, multiple predators may attack from different directions simultaneously or in close succession. It is unknown whether fish are able to change the course of their escape response when startled by multiple stimuli at various time intervals. Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) were startled with a left and right visual stimulus in close succession. By varying the timing of the second stimulus, we were able to determine when and how a second stimulus could affect the escape response direction. Four treatments were used: a single visual stimulus (control); or two stimuli coming from opposite sides separated by a 0 ms (simultaneous treatment), 33 ms or 83 ms time interval. The 33 ms and 83 ms time intervals were chosen to occur either side of a predicted 60 ms visual escape latency (i.e. during stage 1). The 0 ms and 33 ms treatments influenced both the escape trajectory and the stage 1 turning angle, compared with a single stimulation, whereas the 83 ms treatment had no effect on the escape trajectory. We conclude that Pacific staghorn sculpin can modulate their escape trajectory only between stimulation and the onset of the response, but the escape trajectory cannot be modulated after the body motion has started.

AB The ecology and genetic diversity of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae before human domestication remain poorly understood. Taiwan is regarded as part of this yeast's geographic birthplace, where the most divergent natural lineage was discovered. Here, we extensively sampled the broadleaf forests across this continental island to probe the ancestral species' diversity. We found that S. cerevisiae is distributed ubiquitously at low abundance in the forests. Whole-genome sequencing of 121 isolates revealed nine distinct lineages that diverged from Asian lineages during the Pleistocene, when a transient continental shelf land bridge connected Taiwan to other major landmasses. Three lineages are endemic to Taiwan and six are widespread in Asia, making this region a focal biodiversity hotspot. Both ancient and recent admixture events were detected between the natural lineages, and a genetic ancestry component associated with isolates from fruits was detected in most admixed isolates. Collectively, Taiwanese isolates harbor genetic diversity comparable to that of the whole Asia continent, and different lineages have coexisted at a fine spatial scale even on the same tree. Patterns of variations within each lineage revealed that S. cerevisiae is highly clonal and predominantly reproduces asexually in nature. We identified different selection patterns shaping the coding sequences of natural lineages and found fewer gene family expansion and contractions that contrast with domesticated lineages. This study establishes that S. cerevisiae has rich natural diversity sheltered from human influences, making it a powerful model system in microbial ecology.

AB A critical review of the articles dealing with biochar in terms of the reuse of biomass waste in building materials and its impact on material properties was conducted using five different electronic databases; thirteen articles were selected for this critical review. Biochar was used as a replacement for cement and aggregate in cementitious composites and as an addition in wood polypropylene composites and plasters. The biochar dosages ranged from 0.5% to 40%; in most composites, the addition of biochar increased strength and reduced thermal conductivity and the bulk density of fresh mortars. Also, biochar dosages of 0.5-2% decreased, while dosages of 10-40% increased water absorption and penetration on cementitious composites. The selected studies mainly introduced biochar use in building materials as a means of biomass waste reduction and its reuse for various purposes, while carbon footprint reduction was addressed in only a few of them. Biochar-containing building material's capability of capturing CO2 from the air was also observed (0.033 mmol CO2 g(biochar)-(1) to 0.138 mmol CO2 g(biochar)-(1)). The results also showed that mortars with CO2-unsaturated biochar had better mechanical and physical properties than mortars with CO2-saturated biochar. Selected studies showed biochar-containing building materials have a great potential for carbon footprint reduction. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies about biochar use in building materials concerning climate change mitigation.

AB The feasibility of chemical stabilization-based strategy for extensive field application is under debate due to lacking a proper framework for its sustainability assessment during its life cycle. Herein, a comprehensive framework consisting of crop production, soil quality, and carbon footprintwas constructed for assessing agricultural land remediation based on a two-year paddy field trial. Results showthat between the two representative agents, biochar scenario substantially benefits for environmental, social, and agricultural sustainability, because of its more positive impacts on human health and ecosystem, public acceptance, soil reproductive, and rice yield. A notably higher sustainability score of 80.7 for biochar scenario than that of 47.0 for lime is found, in spite of the economical sustainability of lime. The net ecosystem carbon budget of the biochar scenario exhibits an unprecedentedly positive value of 17.8 t CO2-eq ha(-1), which can finely contribute to a positive carbon budget during remediation. Our finding demonstrates that biochar strategy enables a multi-objective achievement of soil quality - crop production - carbon budget during agricultural land remediation. This study provides new insights into sustainability assessment for restoring agricultural land for safe crop production and synergizing with carbon neutral plan.

AB beta-diversity has been under continuous debate, with a current need to better understand the way in which a new wave of measures work. We assessed the results of 12 incidence-based beta-diversity indices. Our results of gradual species composition overlap between paired assemblages considering progressive differences in species richness show the following: (i) four indices (beta(-2), beta(-3), beta(-3.s), and beta(r)) should be used cautiously given that results with no shared species retrieve results that could be misinterpreted; (ii) all measures conceived specifically as partitioned components of species compositional dissimilarities ought to be used as such and not as independent measures per se; (iii) the non-linear response of some indices to gradual species composition overlap should be interpreted carefully, and further analysis using their results as dependent variables should be performed cautiously; and (iv) two metrics (beta(sim) and beta(sor)) behave predictably and linearly to gradual species composition overlap. We encourage ecologists using measures of beta-diversity to fully understand their mathematical nature and type of results under the scenario to be used in order to avoid inappropriate and misleading inferences.

AB How intensely animals use habitat features depends on their functional properties (i.e., how the feature influences fitness) and the spatial and temporal scale considered. For herbivores, habitat use is expected to reflect the competing risks of starvation, predation, and thermal stress, but the relative influence of each functional property is expected to vary in space and time. We examined how a dietary and habitat specialist, the pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), used these functional properties of its sagebrush habitat-food quality, security, and thermal refuge-at two hierarchical spatial scales (microsite and patch) across two seasons (winter and summer). At the microsite and patch scales, we determined which plant functional traits predicted the number of bites (i.e., foraging) by pygmy rabbits and the number of their fecal pellets (i.e., general habitat use). Pygmy rabbits used microsites and patches more intensely that had higher crude protein and aerial concealment cover and were closer to burrows. Food quality was more influential when rabbits used microsites within patches. Security was more influential in winter than summer, and more at Cedar Gulch than Camas. However, the influence of functional properties depended on phytochemical and structural properties of sagebrush and was not spatiotemporally consistent. These results show function-dependent habitat use that varied according to specific activities by a central-place browsing herbivore. Making spatially explicit predictions of the relative value of habitat features that influence different types of habitat use (i.e., foraging, hiding, and thermoregulating) will improve how we predict patterns of habitat use by herbivores and how we monitor and manage functional traits within habitats for wildlife.

AB Food provisioning promotes close interaction with wildlife but can negatively impact the targeted species. Repeated behavioural disruptions have the potential to negatively impact vital rates and have population level consequences. In Bunbury, Western Australia, food-provisioned female bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, suffer reduced reproductive success via lower calf survival. However, the proximal causes of this long-term negative effect remain unknown. To infer processes that could lead to fitness costs, we combined network analyses, Markov Chain, regression models and kernel density estimates to evaluate the social environment, behavioural budget and home range size of provisioned dolphins relative to their nonprovisioned counterparts. We found that provisioned dolphins spent significantly less time socializing and had smaller home ranges and weaker social associations than the nonprovisioned dolphins. Overall, these findings suggest that provisioned dolphins experience a more restricted social environment among themselves, which likely results from investing time in an unnatural foraging tactic around the provisioning site, in proximity to human activities. This modified social environment associated with food provisioning and begging behaviour, reinforced by the limited time spent socializing, could affect the opportunities of calves of provisioned females to acquire fitness enhancing skills and form essential social bonds. This study highlights the need to consider the potential impact of human activities on the social environment of animals.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Opportunistic citizen science data are commonly filtered in an attempt to improve their applicability for relating species occurrences with environmental variables. Recommendations on when and how to filter, however, have remained relatively general and associations between species traits and filtering recommendations are sparse. We collected six traits (body size, detectability, classification error rate, familiarity, reporting probability and range size) of 52 birds, 25 butterflies and 14 dragonflies. Both absolute (values not rescaled) and relative traits (values rescaled per taxonomic group) were linked to filter effects, i.e. the impact on three different measures of species distribution model performance caused by applying three different quality filters, for different degrees of sample size reduction. First, we applied multiple regressions that predicted the filter effects by either absolute (including taxonomic group) or relative traits. Second, a principal component and clustering analysis were performed to define five species profiles based on species traits that were retained after a multiple regression model selection. The analysis of the profiles indicated the relative importance of species traits and revealed new insights into the association of species traits with changes in model performance after data quality filtering. Both taxonomic group (more than absolute traits) and relative species traits (mainly classification error rate, range size and familiarity) defined the impact of data quality filtering on model performance and we discourage the selection of a quality filtering strategy based on one single species trait. Results further confirmed the importance of considering the goal of the study (i.e. increasing model discrimination capacity, sensitivity or specificity) as well as the change in sample size caused by stringent filtering. The general species knowledge amongst citizen scientists (importance of observer experience), together with the mechanism of record verification in an opportunistic data platform (importance of verifiable metadata) have the largest potential for enhancing the quality of opportunistic records.

AB Currently, the effects of various pyrolysis atmosphere types (air-limitation, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen) on the chemical compositions and carbon structures of biochar remain little known. Elemental analysis, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), two-dimensional perturbation correlation infrared spectroscopy (2D-PCIS), and Raman spectroscopy were applied to investigate the chemical compositions and carbon structures of pine sawdust- and wheat straw-derived biochars produced in air-limitation, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen atmospheres, as well as their variation with the charring temperature. The results showed that, of the three atmospheres, air-limitation pyrolysis made biochar contain more inorganic elements, while carbon dioxide and nitrogen preferred to retain organic carbon in biochars. The 2D-PCIS spectra indicated air-limitation pyrolysis supported to retain methylene of glucopyranose ring, while carbon dioxide and nitrogen pyrolysis promoted its breaking. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen pyrolysis made an earlier decline in H-bond of alcohol and phenolic groups than methylene, and air-limitation pyrolysis presented an opposite trend. The XPS spectra showed that, at 450-750 degrees C, biochars produced in carbon dioxide and nitrogen had more surface C-C/C=C groups than biochars produced in air-limitation. Furthermore, the content of C-O followed the order of nitrogen > or approximate to carbon dioxide > air-limitation at 300 degrees C, and was approximately equivalent at 450-750 degrees C for the three atmospheres. Air-limitation and carbon dioxide pyrolysis supported more C=O to retain in biochars than nitrogen pyrolysis. With elevated charring temperature, the carbon content of graphitic structure decreased for biochars produced in air-limitation and increased for biochars produced in carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The carbon content of graphitic structure followed the order of air-limitation > carbon dioxide approximate to nitrogen at a relatively low charring temperature and carbon dioxide > nitrogen > air-limitation at a relatively high charring temperature. The results provide an important direction for selecting suitable pyrolysis atmospheres to optimize the properties of biochars.

AB Biological invasions may result from multiple introductions, which might compensate for reduced gene pools caused by bottleneck events, but could also dilute adaptive processes. A previous common-garden experiment showed heritable latitudinal clines in fitness-related traits in the invasive goldenrod Solidago canadensis in Central Europe. These latitudinal clines remained stable even in plants chemically treated with zebularine to reduce epigenetic variation. However, despite the heritability of traits investigated, genetic isolation-by-distance was non-significant. Utilizing the same specimens, we applied a molecular analysis of (epi)genetic differentiation with standard and methylation-sensitive (MSAP) AFLPs. We tested whether this variation was spatially structured among populations and whether zebularine had altered epigenetic variation. Additionally, we used genome scans to mine for putative outlier loci susceptible to selection processes in the invaded range. Despite the absence of isolation-by-distance, we found spatial genetic neighborhoods among populations and two AFLP clusters differentiating northern and southern Solidago populations. Genetic and epigenetic diversity were significantly correlated, but not linked to phenotypic variation. Hence, no spatial epigenetic patterns were detected along the latitudinal gradient sampled. Applying genome-scan approaches (BAYESCAN, BAYESCENV, RDA, and LFMM), we found 51 genetic and epigenetic loci putatively responding to selection. One of these genetic loci was significantly more frequent in populations at the northern range. Also, one epigenetic locus was more frequent in populations in the southern range, but this pattern was lost under zebularine treatment. Our results point to some genetic, but not epigenetic adaptation processes along a large-scale latitudinal gradient of S. canadensis in its invasive range.

AB Aim The availability of data related to species occurrences has favoured the development of species distribution models using only observations of presence. These data are intrinsically biased by the sampling effort. Presence-only (PO) species distribution models (SDM) typically account for this effect by introducing additional data considered to be related with the sampling. This approach, however, does not allow the characterisation of the sampling effort and hinders the interpretation of the model. Here, we propose a Bayesian framework for PO SDMs that can explicitly model the sampling effect. Location Mexico. Taxon Pines, flycatchers (family Tyranidae), birds and plants. Methods The framework defines a bivariate process separable into ecological and sampling effort processes. PO data are conceived of incomplete observations where some presences have been filtered out. A choosing principle is used to separate out presences, missing data and absences relative to the species of interest and the sampling observations. The framework provides three modelling alternatives to account for a spatial autocorrelation structure: independent latent variables (model I); common latent spatial random effect (model II) and correlated latent spatial random effects (model III). The framework was compared against the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm in two case studies: one for the prediction of pines and another for the prediction of flycatchers. Results In both case studies, at least one of the proposed models achieved higher predictive accuracy than MaxEnt. The model III fit best when the sampling effort was informative, while model II was more suitable in cases with a high proportion of non-sampled sites. Main Conclusions Our approach provides a flexible framework for PO SDMs aided by a sampling effort process informed by the accumulated observations of independent and heterogeneous surveys. For the two case studies, the framework provided a model with a higher predictive accuracy than an optimised version of MaxEnt.

AB Background Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is highly variable across sites and primarily depends on site properties and land use. It is therefore difficult for farmers to evaluate the actual SOC status of a site. To aid the interpretation of measured SOC contents, easy-to-use frameworks for the assessment of SOC contents are needed. Aims The aim of this study was to derive site-specific SOC benchmarks for German mineral soils under agricultural use based on the dataset of the first German Agricultural Soil Inventory. Methods The dataset was stratified into 33 strata by land use, soil texture, C/N ratio and mean annual precipitation. Lower and upper SOC benchmarks were calculated for all strata (0.125 and the 0.875 quantile). Results The SOC benchmark value ranges were lower for cropland (6.8-48.9 g kg(-1)) than for grassland (14.1-76.6 g kg(-1)), and increased with rising clay content and precipitation. Sandy soils with a wide C/N ratio and high SOC content due to their heathland or peatland history were divided into separate strata. The number of strata only decreased the SOC benchmark ranges slightly. Around 15-20 sites were required as a minimum to quantify SOC benchmarks for one stratum. Conclusions The presented framework is easy to use, requiring only four readily available stratification factors to perform a comparative classification of SOC contents. It allows farmers and extension services to compare where their measured SOC contents fall within the expected SOC value range for their site, and can thus help develop an initial evaluation of the SOC status of a site with regard to soil-specific differences.

AB The global redistribution of species due to climate change and other anthropogenic causes is driving novel human-wildlife interactions with complex consequences. On the one hand, range-shifting species could disrupt recipient ecosystems. On the other hand, these species may be contracting in their historic range, contributing to loss of biodiversity there. Given that arriving range-shifting species could also perhaps have positive effects on recipient ecosystems, there is [in principle] a net benefit equation to be calculated. Thus, public opinion on these species may be divided and they may present a unique challenge to wildlife management. We surveyed the opinion of wildlife recorders about the establishment and management of eight birds and eight insects whose ranges have recently shifted into the United Kingdom. We asked whether respondents' attitudes were explained by the species' or respondents' characteristics, and whether or not climate change was emphasised as a cause of range-shift. We also conducted qualitative analysis of the recorders' text responses to contextualise these results. Attitudes to range-shifting species were mostly positive but were more ambivalent for less familiar taxa and for insects compared with birds. Respondents were strongly opposed to eradicating or controlling new range-shifters, and to management aimed to increase their numbers. Whether climate change was presented as the cause of range-shifts did not affect attitudes, likely because respondents assumed climate change was the driver regardless. These findings suggest that it will be difficult to generate support for active management to support or hinder species' redistribution, particularly for invertebrate or overlooked species among wildlife recorders. However, the positive attitudes suggest that on the whole range-shifting species are viewed sympathetically. Engaging with wildlife recorders may represent an opportunity to garner support for conservation actions which will benefit both currently native and arriving species, such as improvements to habitat quality and connectivity.

AB A fragmented landscape, which contains a patchwork of vegetated hospitable areas and a barren intervening matrix, may reduce gene flow in a population and over time result in an increase in population structure. We tested this prediction in crab spiders (Mecaphesa celer (Hentz, 1847)) inhabiting isolated habitat patches in the lava matrix of Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, Idaho, USA. Using reduced-representation genomic sequencing, we did not find evidence of population structure due to a reduction in gene flow among habitat patches. Instead, our results show strong evidence of panmixia likely due to abundant juvenile dispersal and possible connectivity to outer regions surrounding the lava flows despite the species' habitat specificity.

AB Pupylation is an important posttranslational modification in proteins and plays a key role in the cell function of microorganisms; an accurate prediction of pupylation proteins and specified sites is of great significance for the study of basic biological processes and development of related drugs since it would greatly save experimental costs and improve work efficiency. In this work, we first constructed a model for identifying pupylation proteins. To improve the pupylation protein prediction model, the KNN scoring matrix model based on functional domain GO annotation and the Word Embedding model were used to extract the features and Random Under-sampling (RUS) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were applied to balance the dataset. Finally, the balanced data sets were input into Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The performance of 10-fold cross-validation shows that accuracy (ACC), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and area under the ROC curve (AUC) are 95.23%, 0.8100, and 0.9864, respectively. For the pupylation site prediction model, six feature extraction codes (i.e., TPC, AAI, One-hot, PseAAC, CKSAAP, and Word Embedding) served to extract protein sequence features, and the chi-square test was employed for feature selection. Rigorous 10-fold cross-validations indicated that the accuracies are very high and outperformed its existing counterparts.

AB Urban environments provide challenging conditions for species survival, including increased temperatures, drought and pollution. Species can deal with these conditions through evolution across generations or the immediate expression of phenotypic plasticity. The resulting phenotypic changes are key to the performance of species and their interactions with other species in the community. We here document patterns of herbivory in Arabidopsis thaliana along a rural-urban gradient, and tested the genetic background and ecological consequences of traits related to herbivore resistance. Aphid densities increased with urbanization levels along the gradient while plant size did not change. Offspring of urban mothers, raised under common garden conditions, were larger and had a decreased trichome density and seed set but a higher caterpillar (Pieris brassicae) tolerance. In contrast, no urban evolution was detected for defences against aphids (Myzus persicae). Aphids reduced seed set more strongly in urban offspring, but this effect disappeared in second-generation plants. In general, urban adaptations as expressed in size and caterpillar tolerance were found, but these adaptations were associated with smaller inflorescences. The maternal effect on the response of seed set to aphid feeding demonstrates the relevance of intergenerational plasticity as a direct ecological consequence of herbivory. Our study demonstrates that the urban environment interacts with the plant's genotype and the extended phenotype as determined by ecological interactions.

ID QUANTIFYING INDIVIDUAL VARIATION; ECOLOGY
AB Individuals differ in average phenotypes and in sensitivity to environmental variation. Such context sensitivity can be modelled as random slope variation. Random slope variation implies that the proportion of between-individual variation varies across the range of a covariate (environment/context/time/age) and has thus been called 'conditional' repeatability. We propose to put conditional repeatabilities in perspective of the total phenotypic variance and suggest a way of standardization using the random slope coefficient of determination RS2$$ {R}_S<^>2 $$. Furthermore, we illustrate that the marginalized repeatability Rmar$$ {R}_{\mathrm{mar}} $$ averaged across an environmental gradient offers a biologically relevant description of between-individual variation. We provide simple equations for calculating key descriptors of conditional repeatabilities, clarify the difference between random intercept variation and average between-individual variation and make recommendations for comprehensive reporting. While we introduce the concept with individual variation in mind, the framework is equally applicable to other type of between-group/cluster variation that varies across some (environmental) gradient.

AB Background Previous phylogeographic studies of the lion (Panthera leo) have improved our insight into the distribution of genetic variation, as well as a revised taxonomy which now recognizes a northern (Panthera leo leo) and a southern (Panthera leo melanochaita) subspecies. However, existing whole range phylogeographic studies on lions either consist of very limited numbers of samples, or are focused on mitochondrial DNA and/or a limited set of microsatellites. The geographic extent of genetic lineages and their phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain, clouded by massive sampling gaps, sex-biased dispersal and incomplete lineage sorting. Results In this study we present results of low depth whole genome sequencing and subsequent variant calling in ten lions sampled throughout the geographic range, resulting in the discovery of >150,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Phylogenetic analyses revealed the same basal split between northern and southern populations, as well as four population clusters on a more local scale. Further, we designed a SNP panel, including 125 autosomal and 14 mitochondrial SNPs, which was tested on >200 lions from across their range. Results allow us to assign individuals to one of these four major clades (West & Central Africa, India, East Africa, or Southern Africa) and delineate these clades in more detail. Conclusions The results presented here, particularly the validated SNP panel, have important applications, not only for studying populations on a local geographic scale, but also for tracing samples of unknown origin for forensic purposes, and for guiding conservation management of ex situ populations. Thus, these genomic resources not only contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary history of the lion, but may also play a crucial role in conservation efforts aimed at protecting the species in its full diversity.

AB Holobionts are dynamic ecosystems that may respond to abiotic drivers with compositional changes. Uncovering elevational diversity patterns within these microecosystems can further our understanding of community-environment interactions. Here, we assess how the major components of lichen holobionts-fungal hosts, green algal symbionts, and the bacterial community-collectively respond to an elevational gradient. We analyse populations of two lichen symbioses, Umbilicaria pustulata and U. hispanica, along an elevational gradient spanning 2100 altitudinal metres and covering three major biomes. Our study shows (i) discontinuous genomic variation in fungal hosts with one abrupt genomic differentiation within each of the two host species, (ii) altitudinally structured bacterial communities with pronounced turnover within and between hosts, and (iii) altitude-specific presence of algal symbionts. Alpha diversity of bacterial communities decreased with increasing elevation. A marked turnover in holobiont diversity occurred across two altitudinal belts: at 11 degrees C-13 degrees C average annual temperature (here: 800-1200 m a.s.l.), and at 7 degrees C-9 degrees C average annual temperature (here: 1500-1800 m a.s.l.). The two observed zones mark a clustering of distribution limits and community shifts. The three ensuing altitudinal classes, that is, the most frequent combinations of species in holobionts, approximately correspond to the Mediterranean, cool-temperate, and alpine climate zones. We conclude that multitrophic microecosystems, such as lichen holobionts, respond with concerted compositional changes to climatic factors that also structure communities of macroorganisms, for example, vascular plants.

AB Owing to the scarcity of raw materials and environmental concerns, concrete industry demands a suitable environment friendly material, which can substitute it partially while maintaining its required characteristics. Biochar from agricultural biomass is sustainable product for construction uses without any adverse effect on environment. It acts as effective binder/filler for enhancing performance of construction material, including mechanical/rheological properties, water absorbing capacity, insulating nature, chemical stability and environmental safety. This review presents significant aspects of biochar as additive to cementitious materials. It highlights its role in improving the performance of concrete for various applications in construction industry. It also suggests that a suitable permutation and combination is necessary for optimizing its properties and effectiveness. It can be derived from the studies carried out in this domain that on average, 1-3% addition of biochar derived from various lignocellulosic biomass can serve as optimum concentration for enhancing performance in building constituents. The review also highlights the economic viability and environmental benefits of biochar addition in cementitious composition. This article will provide deep insight and understanding about appropriateness of biochar as important constituent in construction industry. It will be encouraging for the researchers to strengthen their observations and outcomes, helping in categorizing biochar as 'green concrete' in upcoming time.

AB Findings from animal experiments are often difficult to transfer to humans. In this perspective article I discuss two questions. First, why are the results of animal experiments often so difficult to transfer to humans? And second, what can be done to improve translation from animal experiments to humans? Translation failures are often the result of poor methodology. It is not merely the fact that low statistical power of basic and preclinical studies undermine a "real effect," but the accuracy with which data from animal studies are collected and described, and the resulting robustness of the data is generally very low and often does not allow translation to a much more heterogeneous human condition. Equally important is the fact that the vast majority of publications in the biomedical field in the last few decades have reported positive findings and have thus generated a knowledge bias. Further contributions to reproducibility and translation failures are discussed in this paper, and 10 points of recommendation to improve reproducibility and translation are outlined. These recommendations are: (i) prior to planning an actual study, a systematic review or potential preclinical meta-analysis should be considered. (ii) An a priori power calculation should be carried out. (iii) The experimental study protocol should be pre-registered. (iv) The execution of the study should be in accordance with the most recent ARRIVE guidelines. (v) When planning the study, the generalizability of the data to be collected should also be considered (e.g., sex or age differences). (vi) "Method-hopping" should be avoided, meaning that it is not necessary to use the most advanced technology but rather to have the applied methodology under control. (vii) National or international networks should be considered to carry out multicenter preclinical studies or to obtain convergent evidence. (viii) Animal models that capture DSM-5 or ICD-11 criteria should be considered in the context of research on psychiatric disorders. (ix) Raw data of publication should be made publicly available and should be in accordance with the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management. (x) Finally, negative findings should be published to counteract publication bias. The application of these 10 points of recommendation, especially for preclinical confirmatory studies but also to some degree for exploratory studies, will ultimately improve the reproducibility and translation of animal research.

AB Intermittent rivers are the focus of a burgeoning subdiscipline of freshwater science, driven by mounting recognition of their ubiquity, biodiversity, and climate sensitivity. However, our understanding of their ecology is hampered by a reliance on unstandardised diversity measures, an underrepresentation of certain stream types in metacommunity research and a reticence to acknowledge biotic interactions as a potentially fundamental driver of catchment-scale patterns in assemblage composition. This study analysed both local- and catchment-scale responses of invertebrates to flow intermittence and hydrological isolation in an understudied ecosystem type (low-gradient, groundwater-fed headwaters). We compared responses of conventional (taxonomic richness, Shannon diversity) and more robust (coverage-adjusted Hill-Shannon) alpha-diversity metrics to drying, and analysed changes in beta-diversity components as a function of hydrological and spatial distances between samples. We also inferred the influence of biotic interactions on metacommunity structure, using hierarchical species distribution modelling to capture species-to-species associations after accounting for hydrological variability and dispersal traits. The conventional and robust alpha-diversity metrics exhibited broadly similar shifts, although richness overestimated the decline in alpha-diversity with intermittence and the Shannon index failed to detect a significant interaction between flow duration and hydrological isolation. Decomposition of beta-diversity revealed a dominance of species turnover over nestedness along the flow gradient, a finding contrary to prevailing conceptual wisdom in intermittent river ecology and one we attribute to the climatic and geological context of our study. Even after accounting for differences in hydrological niche occupation, we discovered a significant propensity for species to co-occur with others of similar conservation status, implying that competition/colonisation trade-offs involving rare specialists and widespread generalists could underpin metacommunity assembly in some drying headwater networks. Our results suggest that enhancing aquatic habitat connectivity in headwaters harbouring intermittent-stream specialists could be counterproductive, and conservation plans should instead look to safeguard isolated habitats serving as biotic refuges for rare species.

AB Elysiais a genus of sea slugs in which some species can "steal" chloroplasts (kleptoplasty) from algae and keep them photosynthetically active inside their cells. Solar-powered animals are more susceptible to climate change as photosynthesis can increase the stress for these animals in extreme environmental conditions. Here, we used the Maxent algorithm and environmental envelopes (i.e. the multi-dimensional environmental space in which a species can occur) to model the ecological niche of 21 Elysia species in the Caribbean to estimate their current and future potential distribution. We then used predicted distributions to map potential taxonomical richness and to describe the representation of the genus inside the marine protected areas (MPAs). For most species, we show an expansion of the northern and southern range of distribution, but a reduction in the central part. Although changes in richness appeared in different areas, predictions emphasize four large extensions that have a potential current richness of 13 and will have no species in the future: Pamlico Sound, North Carolina; the southwest of the Gulf of Mexico; the Great Bahama Bank; and the southwest of Brazil. Out of the total area with environmental conditions adequate for at least one of the species in the genus, 24.7% is located within MPAs.

AB Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment, being found commonly in soils and natural bodies of freshwater. However, little is known about the environmental niches of NTM and how they relate to NTM prevalence in homes and other human-dominated areas.
   Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic pathogens that cause chronic pulmonary disease (PD). NTM infections are thought to be acquired from the environment; however, the basal environmental factors that drive and sustain NTM prevalence are not well understood. The highest prevalence of NTM PD cases in the United States is reported from Hawai'i, which is unique in its climate and soil composition, providing an opportunity to investigate the environmental drivers of NTM prevalence. We used microbiological sampling and spatial logistic regression complemented with fine-scale soil mineralogy to model the probability of NTM presence across the natural landscape of Hawai'i. Over 7 years, we collected and microbiologically cultured 771 samples from 422 geographic sites in natural areas across the Hawaiian Islands for the presence of NTM. NTM were detected in 210 of these samples (27%), with Mycobacterium abscessus being the most frequently isolated species. The probability of NTM presence was highest in expansive soils (those that swell with water) with a high water balance (>1-m difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration) and rich in Fe-oxides/hydroxides. We observed a positive association between NTM presence and iron in wet soils, supporting past studies, but no such association in dry soils. High soil-water balance may facilitate underground movement of NTM into the aquifer system, potentially compounded by expansive capabilities allowing crack formation under drought conditions, representing further possible avenues for aquifer infiltration. These results suggest both precipitation and soil properties are mechanisms by which surface NTM may reach the human water supply. IMPORTANCE Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment, being found commonly in soils and natural bodies of freshwater. However, little is known about the environmental niches of NTM and how they relate to NTM prevalence in homes and other human-dominated areas. To characterize NTM environmental associations, we collected and cultured 771 samples from 422 geographic sites in natural areas across Hawai'i, the U.S. state with the highest prevalence of NTM pulmonary disease. We show that the environmental niches of NTM are most associated with highly expansive, moist soils containing high levels of iron oxides/hydroxides. Understanding the factors associated with NTM presence in the natural environment will be crucial for identifying potential mechanisms and risk factors associated with NTM infiltration into water supplies, which are ultimately piped into homes where most exposure risk is thought to occur.

AB The ideal-free distribution and central-place foraging are important ecological models that can explain the distribution of foraging organisms in their environment. However, this model ignores distance-based foraging costs from a central place (hive, nest), whereas central-place foraging ignores competition. Different foraging currencies and cooperation between foragers also create different optimal distributions of foragers, but are limited to a simple two-patch model. We present a hybrid model of the ideal-free distribution that uses realistic competitive effects although accounting for distance-based foraging, and test it using honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) foraging in canola fields (Brassica napus L.). Our simulations show that foragers maximizing efficiency (energy profits divided by losses) prioritize distance to their aggregation more than those maximizing net-rate (energy profits divided by time), and that social foragers move to more distant patches to maximize group benefits, meaning that social foragers do not approach an ideal-free distribution. Simulated efficiency-maximizers had a hump-shaped relationship of trip times with distance, spending shorter amounts of time in both nearby and far-away patches. Canola fields were far more attractive to simulated foragers than semi-natural areas, suggesting limited foraging on semi-natural lands during the bloom period of canola. Finally, we found that the observed distribution of honey bees in canola fields most closely resembled the optimal distribution of solitary efficiency-maximizers. Our model has both theoretical and practical uses, as it allows us to model central-place forager distributions in complex landscapes as well as providing information on appropriate hive stocking rates for agricultural pollination.

AB Long-term forest experiments provide valuable knowledge in managing forests for productivity and other ecosystem services. California's "Garden of Eden" experiment was established to determine growth potential of Pinus ponderosa plantations in response to intensive cultural treatments. We examined the 20-year growth-response of tree volume to intensive cultural treatments consisting of combinations of herbicide on competing vegetation (H), fertilization (F), and insecticide (I). We found that both H and F treatments synergistically increased tree growth at intermediate and lower-quality sites. Growth increased by 1.5-2.1 times with F, 2.1-2.5 times with H, and 2.3-3.8 times with HF treatments versus control (range = 39.3-109.2 m(3) ha(-1)). Across the highest productive site, H and F effects on volume seemed additive at younger ages, but largely dissipated by age 20, with volume increasing by 1.6, 1.2, and 1.6 times relative to control in F, H, and HF treatments, respectively. However, 20-year mean annual increment was 21.7 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) for the F treatment, the highest volume reported for ponderosa pine in California. The results underscore how site-specific cultural treatments, especially H and F, may widely enhance plantation productivity and boost stand development. Study Implications In Mediterranean climates, competing vegetation control is essential for ponderosa pine planation establishment and early growth, especially at intermediate and poor-quality sites. At higher-productivity sites, fertilization enhances stand growth and development, although fertilization's beneficial effects on growth do not appear until canopy closure. Precommercial thinning in herbicide and fertilization treatments will not reduce overall stand growth 10 years postthinning. Intensively managed plantations appear to have a higher maximum stand density index compared to natural stands or unmanaged plantations. Therefore, these cultural treatments can be used to rapidly reforest areas after disturbances and subsequently promote larger trees on reforested landscapes.

AB Aim While the floras of eastern Asia (EA) and eastern North America (ENA) share numerous genera, they have drastically different species richness. Despite an overall similarity in the quality of their temperate climates, the climate of EA is more spatially heterogeneous than that of ENA. Spatial environmental heterogeneity has been found to play a key role in influencing species richness in some regions. Here, we tested the following hypotheses: (a) EA species will occupy larger climatic niches than their ENA congeners, (b) congeners of EA-ENA disjunct genera will occupy statistically equivalent climatic niches, and (c) congeners of EA-ENA disjunct genera will occupy more similar climatic niches than expected by their respective physiographic context. Location North America and Asia. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Seed plants. Methods Predictions generated by ecological niche models (ENMs) were compared for 88 species across 31 EA-ENA disjunct genera. ENM predictions were assessed for geographic and ecological breadth. Tests for niche equivalency and similarity were performed for congeneric species pairs to determine if species of disjunct genera have experienced niche conservatism or divergence. Results EA species tend to occupy greater amounts of climatic niche space than their close relatives in ENA. Over two-thirds of the conducted niche comparisons show that EA-ENA congeners either occupy equivalent climatic niche space within these broader climatic regimes or occupy non-equivalent niches that are as similar as expected given their physiographic contexts. Main conclusions EA species tend to occupy larger climatic niches, and congeners of EA-ENA disjunct genera tend to occupy equivalent/similar niche space within their respective distributions, with differences in occupied niches possibly due to their respective physiographic contexts, highlighting how niche-neutral processes and niche conservatism may affect the distributions of disjunct species.

AB The capacity of soils to stabilize carbon (C) may decrease over time, limiting the potential of no-till soil to act as a C sink in the long-term. Our objectives were to evaluate the effects of long-term no-till cropping systems on (i) C storage in soil, (ii) C stabilization in the fine silt plus clay-size (< 20 mu m) fraction and its relationship with the decrease of C saturation deficit (CSD) in this fraction, and (iii) on C accumulation in labile fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) in 0-2.5, 2.5-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm layers of a subtropical Acrisol. The study was based on a long-term (36 years) no-till experiment where five cropping systems, with variable annual C inputs, were assessed: bare-soil, [ii] black oat/maize, [iii] black oat + vetch/maize + cowpea, [iv] lablab + maize and [v] pigeon pea + maize. Cropping systems including maize and tropical legumes (lablab, pigeon pea and cowpea) with high C input led to the highest C storage in the top layers (up to 10 cm depth) of this no-till soil. Also, a decrease of CSD in fine silt plus clay-size fraction was observed in all soil layers to 20 cm depth, but the most expressive impact on CSD occurred in the topsoil (0-2.5 cm), where the capacity to further stabilize more carbon decreased by 90-97% when compared to bare soil. Considering the full C saturation level of the silt plus clay-size fraction and the current C contents in the soil, the remaining capacity of C sequestration up to 20 cm was estimated as ranging from 22.5 to 32.8 Mg C ha(-1), and much of it (58-75%) was in the 10-20 cm layer. Our results highlight the importance of diversified cropping systems with high input (quantity and quality) crop residues to C sequestration in soil. Moreover, although the mineral-associated SOM of the top layer reached a C stabilization limit, C accumulation continues in non-saturated labile fractions, and in non-saturated fine silt plus clay-size fraction in deeper layers of subtropical no-till soils.

TI Radiation dose-rate is a neglected critical parameter in dose-response
   of insects
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

AB Reproductive sterility is the basis of the sterile insect technique (SIT) and essential for its success in the field. Numerous factors that influence dose-response in insects have been identified. However, historically the radiation dose administered has been considered a constant. Efforts aiming to standardize protocols for mosquito irradiation found that, despite carefully controlling many variable factors, there was still an unknown element responsible for differences in expected sterility levels of insects irradiated with the same dose and handling protocols. Thus, together with previous inconclusive investigations, the question arose whether dose really equals dose in terms of biological response, no matter the rate at which the dose is administered. Interestingly, the dose rate effects studied in human nuclear medicine indicated that dose rate could alter dose-response in mammalian cells. Here, we conducted experiments to better understand the interaction of dose and dose rate to assess the effects in irradiated mosquitoes. Our findings suggest that not only does dose rate alter irradiation-induced effects, but that the interaction is not linear and may change with dose. We speculate that the recombination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in treatments with moderate to high dose rates might minimize indirect radiation-induced effects in mosquitoes and decrease sterility levels, unless dose along with its direct effects is increased. Together with further studies to identify an optimum match of dose and dose rate, these results could assist in the development of improved methods for the production of high-quality sterile mosquitoes to enhance the efficiency of SIT programs.

AB Analysis of bacterial genomes shows that, whereas diverse species share many genes in common, their linear order on the chromosome is often not conserved. Whereas rearrangements in gene order could occur by genetic drift, an alternative hypothesis is rearrangement driven by positive selection during niche adaptation (SNAP). Here, we provide the first experimental support for the SNAP hypothesis. We evolved Salmonella to adapt to growth on malate as the sole carbon source and followed the evolutionary trajectories. The initial adaptation to growth in the new environment involved the duplication of 1.66 Mb, corresponding to one-third of the Salmonella chromosome. This duplication is selected to increase the copy number of a single gene, dctA, involved in the uptake of malate. Continuing selection led to the rapid loss or mutation of duplicate genes from either copy of the duplicated region. After 2000 generations, only 31% of the originally duplicated genes remained intact and the gene order within the Salmonella chromosome has been significantly and irreversibly altered. These results experientially validate predictions made by the SNAP hypothesis and show that SNAP can be a strong driving force for rearrangements in chromosomal gene order.

AB Understanding the joint roles of protein sequence variation and differential expression during adaptive evolution is a fundamental, yet largely unrealized goal of evolutionary biology. Here, we use phylogenetic path analysis to analyze a comprehensive venom-gland transcriptome dataset spanning three genera of pitvipers to identify the functional genetic basis of a key adaptation (venom complexity) linked to diet breadth (DB). The analysis of gene-family-specific patterns reveals that, for genes encoding two of the most important venom proteins (snake venom metalloproteases and snake venom serine proteases), there are direct, positive relationships between sequence diversity (SD), expression diversity (ED), and increased DB. Further analysis of gene-family diversification for these proteins showed no constraint on how individual lineages achieved toxin gene SD in terms of the patterns of paralog diversification. In contrast, another major venom protein family (PLA(2)s) showed no relationship between venom molecular diversity and DB. Additional analyses suggest that other molecular mechanisms-such as higher absolute levels of expression-are responsible for diet adaptation involving these venom proteins. Broadly, our findings argue that functional diversity generated through sequence and expression variations jointly determine adaptation in the key components of pitviper venoms, which mediate complex molecular interactions between the snakes and their prey.

AB Ungulate herbivory is a key driver of leaf trait syndromes and defense strategies at the ecological and macroevolutionary levels. Herbivory should also cause short-term evolution within plant populations, but few studies have experimentally tested this prediction. We set out to experimentally assess the plastic and heritable effects of contemporary history of ungulate herbivory on 1) leaf trait syndromes at the intraspecific level, and on the defense traits, 2) leaf size and 3) size of spines. We measured leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf mechanical resistance) in populations of six grass and four woody legume species that had grown under contrasting pressures of domestic ungulate herbivory for at least 40 years. We then performed a common garden experiment, measuring the same traits. Next, we performed cutting experiments on the plants grown in the common garden to measure leaf trait plasticity. In the woody species, we also measured the length of spines and the leaf size (average area per leaf), in the field and in the common garden experiment. We found that in grasses field herbivory over decades produced a displacement toward more acquisitive leaf trait syndromes. Most of these changes appeared largely due to plasticity. In woody legume species, in contrast, herbivory produced a displacement towards more conservative leaves, longer spines and smaller leaves, with the trait differences between histories of herbivory being mostly hereditary. These results point out that vertebrate herbivory can lead to evolutionary processes at contemporary time scales even in long-lived perennial plant species, but the direction of such change depends on the life form of the species. These divergent effects could depend on the predominant anti-herbivore strategies in the different life forms (tolerance versus resistance).

AB Japanese apricot (Prunus mume) is an attractive fruit tree originating from China, and its cultivation history dates back 7000 years. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity, population structure, and genetic relationship of Japanese apricots in different regions of China and Japan. The analyses of the genetic variation between wild and cultivated populations improved our understanding of the general mechanisms of domestication and improvement. A total of 146 accessions of Japanese apricot from different geographic locations were sequenced. The genetic diversity of wild and domesticated accessions (3.60 x 10(-3) and 3.51 x 10(-3), respectively) from China was high, and the effect of artificial selection pressure on domesticated accessions was small; however, the genetic diversity of artificially bred accessions decreased significantly (2.68 x 10(-3)) compared to domesticated accessions, which had an obvious improvement bottleneck effect. The chloroplast genome results showed that 41 haplotypes were detected, and Japanese apricots from the Yunnan region had the most haplotypes and the highest genetic diversity. The results revealed the dissemination route of Japanese apricot, not only along the Yangtze River basin system (from southwest China to Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui, and finally to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai areas). Additionally, we discovered a second route for Japanese apricot dispersion, which was mostly in the Pearl River basin system, from southwest China to Libo of Guizhou and then to the Guangdong, Fujian, and Taiwan areas. This also showed that Japanese-bred accessions originated from Zhejiang, China. In addition, selective sweep analysis showed that most of the high-impact single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in genes related to glucose metabolism, aromatic compound metabolism, flowering time, dormancy, and resistance to abiotic stress during the domestication and improvement of Japanese apricot.

AB Aim Exploring the relationships between the different facets of beta diversity and both past and current environmental conditions can unveil the processes that have shaped spatial patterns of biodiversity. In the marine realm, large-scale patterns and processes of beta diversity have been less investigated. Our study aimed to investigate the patterns and drivers of multiple facets of beta diversity and its components, contrasting pairs of reef fish assemblages among marine realms. Location Tropical reefs. Taxon Reef fishes. Methods Based on trait data and phylogenetic relationships for 5182 tropical reef fish species, we calculated compositional differences between pairs of reef fish assemblages across the Atlantic, the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and the Indo-Pacific realms. We also applied a partitioning approach to distinguish between the turnover and nestedness components. We then evaluated the relative importance of several variables related to historical and contemporary environmental conditions in shaping spatial patterns of beta diversity using Constrained Analysis of Principal coordinates (CAP) models. Results Both the turnover and the nestedness components contributed to total phylogenetic and taxonomic beta diversity in the TEP and Indo-Pacific realms, while the turnover component was found to be more important in the Atlantic realm. In contrast, total trait beta diversity displayed very low values and was primarily explained by the nestedness component. Taxonomic and phylogenetic differences in the composition of tropical reef fish assemblages were influenced by both historical and contemporary factors or solely by historical variables. Main conclusions Our results suggest that past climate changes and historical contingency left an imprint in the present-day composition of tropical reef fish assemblages. The very low levels of trait beta diversity indicate that reef fish assemblages display similar trait composition even among geographically distant assemblages with contrasting evolutionary histories, which may result from environmental filtering or evolutionary convergence, or the combination of both processes.

AB Drought-related tree mortality has become a major concern worldwide due to its pronounced negative impacts on the functioning and sustainability of forest ecosystems. However, our ability to identify the species that are most vulnerable to drought, and to pinpoint the spatial and temporal patterns of mortality events, is still limited. Model is useful tools to capture the dynamics of vegetation at spatiotemporal scales, yet contemporary land surface models (LSMs) are often incapable of predicting the response of vegetation to environmental perturbations with sufficient accuracy, especially under stressful conditions such as drought. Significant progress has been made regarding the physiological mechanisms underpinning plant drought response in the past decade, and plant hydraulic dysfunction has emerged as a key determinant for tree death due to water shortage. The identification of pivotal physiological events and relevant plant traits may facilitate forecasting tree mortality through a mechanistic approach, with improved precision. In this review, we (1) summarize current understanding of physiological mechanisms leading to tree death, (2) describe the functionality of key hydraulic traits that are involved in the process of hydraulic dysfunction, and (3) outline their roles in improving the representation of hydraulic function in LSMs. We urge potential future research on detailed hydraulic processes under drought, pinpointing corresponding functional traits, as well as understanding traits variation across and within species, for a better representation of drought-induced tree mortality in models.

AB Over the past decades, global environmental changes have led to unfavorable effects on migratory birds. However, many species that encounter climate change are listed as least concern by International Union for Conservation of Nature. Using species distribution models, we quantified the redistributions of breeding and wintering sites of oriental honey buzzards, OHB (Pernis ptilorhynchus), a long-distance migratory raptor that often preys on the larvae of wasps and bees under changing climate based on shared socio-economic pathways scenarios. We also incorporated climate and land use risks based on climate anomalies and vegetation dynamics to assess future conservation strategies. The results revealed a significant range contraction on the wintering and breeding areas of the OHB species by 2050 and 2100. Our results suggest that the migration distance will likely increase under all scenarios. In addition, we found many high-risk areas across OHB habitats while refugia areas were relatively only covered a small proportion. Habitat restoration and developing new protected areas become a fundamental strategy for OHB conservation. Our approaches have provided comprehensive insights into broad biogeographic dynamics under multifaceted threats and how to tackle global changes through the specific landscape management for long-distance migrants.

AB Beta diversity is useful to explain community assembly across landscapes with spatial variation. Its turnover and nestedness components help explain how beta diversity is structured across environmental and spatial gradients. Assessing beta diversity in freshwater ecosystems is essential to conservation, as it reveals the mechanisms that maintain regional diversity. Nonetheless, so far, no studies have examined the beta diversity patterns of benthic macroinvertebrates in tropical lakes. We aimed to examine the beta diversity patterns and components of the deep benthic macroinvertebrate communities of tropical Lakes of Montebello, Mexico, along spatial and environmental gradients. We used presence/absence data of deep benthic macroinvertebrates from 13 lakes distributed along environmental and spatial gradients. We calculated beta diversity indices and correlated them to each lake's environmental and spatial variables. The macroinvertebrate communities of the Lakes of Montebello showed high beta diversity driven by a turnover pattern that emphasises the importance of regional-scale conservation efforts. Short distances between lakes and high environmental heterogeneity promoted species turnover, resulting in a great singularity level among lakes. We did not find significant correlations between the beta diversity components and the environmental variables, suggesting a random distribution given by the species' high dispersal capacity in a reduced spatial extent across the lake district.

AB Aim Climate change is driving species to migrate to novel areas as current environments become unsuitable. As a result, species distributions have shifted uphill in montane ecosystems globally. Heterogeneous dispersal rates among shifting species could result in complex changes to community assemblages. For example, interspecific differences in dispersal ability could lead to the disruption, or creation, of species interactions and processes within communities, likely amplifying the impact of climate change on ecosystems. Here, we studied the dispersal success of vertebrate species in a tropical montane ecosystem under a climate-induced uphill shift and assessed the derived impacts on community structures. Location The Australian Wet Tropics bioregion. Method We simulated the uphill shift of 7613 community assemblages across the elevational gradient using thermal resistance layers for movement analyses. Dispersal success was calculated as the probability of shifting given species' dispersal ability and landscape composition. We then used dissimilarity indices to measure the potential changes in community structures resulting from the heterogeneous dispersal success among migrating species. Results Dispersal success was strongly influenced by species' dispersal ability, landscape composition and climate change. The heterogeneous dispersal success among migrating species induced marked temporal changes between community assemblages along the elevational gradient. The local extinction rate (i.e. the proportion of species unable to shift) was especially remarkable at high elevations, suggesting potential mass local extinctions of upland species. Furthermore, the increasing local extinction rate with elevation resulted in substantial declines in species co-occurrence in high-altitude ecosystems. Main conclusions Our study highlights the escalating impact of climate change on community assemblages in response to climate-induced elevational shifts, providing a classic example of the "escalator to extinction." Future predictions of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems will benefit from improvements in understanding species interactions, population dynamics and species potential to adapt to a changing environment.

AB Climate refugia, or places where habitats are expected to remain relatively buffered from regional climate extremes, provide an important focus for science and conservation planning. Within high-priority, multi-jurisdictional landscapes like the Madrean sky islands of the United States and Mexico, efforts to identify and manage climate refugia are hindered by the lack of high-quality and consistent transboundary datasets. To fill these data gaps, we assembled a bi-national field dataset (n = 1416) for five pine species (Pinus spp.) and used generalized boosted regression to model pine habitats in relation to topographic variability as a basis for identifying potential microrefugia at local scales in the context of current species' distribution patterns. We developed additional models to quantify climatic refugial attributes using coarse scale bioclimatic variables and finer scale seasonal remote sensing indices. Terrain metrics including ruggedness, slope position, and aspect defined microrefugia for pines within elevation ranges preferred by each species. Response to bioclimatic variables indicated that small shifts in climate were important to some species (e.g., P. chihuahuana, P. strobiformis), but others exhibited a broader tolerance (e.g., P. arizonica). Response to seasonal climate was particularly important in modeling microrefugia for species with open canopy structure and where regular fires occur (e.g., P. engelmannii and P. chihuahuana). Hotspots of microrefugia differed among species and were either limited to northern islands or occurred across central or southern latitudes. Mapping and validation of refugia and their ecological functions are necessary steps in developing regional conservation strategies that cross jurisdictional boundaries. A salient application will be incorporation of climate refugia in management of fire to restore and maintain pine ecology. Una version en espanol de este articulo esta disponible como descarga.

AB Pain represents an embodied experience, wherein inferences are not only drawn from external sensory inputs, but also from bodily states. Previous research has demonstrated that a placebo administered to an embodied rubber hand can effectively induce analgesia, providing first evidence that placebos can work even when applied to temporarily embodied, artificial body parts. Using a heat pain paradigm, the present study investigates placebo analgesia and pain perception during virtual embodiment. We examined whether a virtual placebo (a sham heat protective glove) can successfully induce analgesia, even when administered to a virtual body. The analgesic efficacy of the virtual placebo to the real hand (augmented reality setting) or virtual hand (virtual reality setting) was compared to a physical placebo administered to the own, physical body (physical reality setting). Furthermore, pain perception and subjective embodiment were compared between settings. In this mixed design experiment, healthy participants (n = 48) were assigned to either an analgesia-expectation or control-expectation group, where subjective and objective pain was measured at pre-and post-intervention time points. Results demonstrate that pre-intervention pain intensity was lower in the virtual reality setting, and that participants in the analgesia-expectation group, after the intervention, exhibited significantly higher pain thresholds, and lower pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings than control-expectation participants, independent of the setting. Our findings show that a virtual placebo can elicit placebo analgesia comparable to that of a physical placebo, and that administration of a placebo does not necessitate physical bodily interaction to produce analgesic responses.
   Perspective: This study demonstrates that a virtual placebo treatment, even when administered to a virtual body, can produce placebo analgesia. These findings indicate that the efficacy of a virtual placebo is comparable to that of a physical placebo, which could pave the way for effective new non-pharmacological approaches for pain management.

AB In this study, leaf hydraulic functionality of co-occurring evergreen and deciduous shrubs, grown on Olympus Mountain, has been compared. Four evergreen species (Arbutus andrachne, Arbutus unedo, Quercus ilex and Quercus coccifera) and four deciduous species (Carpinus betulus, Cercis siliquastrum, Coronilla emeroides and Pistacia terebinthus) were selected for this study. Predawn and midday leaf water potential, transpiration, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature and leaf hydraulic conductance were estimated during the summer period. The results demonstrate different hydraulic tactics between the deciduous and evergreen shrubs. Higher hydraulic conductance and lower stomatal conductance were obtained in deciduous plants compared to the evergreens. Additionally, positive correlations were detected between water potential and transpiration in the deciduous shrubs. The seasonal leaf hydraulic conductance declined in both deciduous and evergreens under conditions of elevated vapor pressure deficit during the summer; however, at midday, leaf water potential reached comparable low values, but the deciduous shrubs exhibited higher hydraulic conductance compared to the evergreens. It seems likely that hydraulic traits of the coexisting evergreen and deciduous plants indicate water spending and saving tactics, respectively; this may also represent a limit to drought tolerance of these species grown in a natural environment, which is expected to be affected by global warming.

AB Simple Summary Eleutherodactylus planirostris has a strong dispersal ability, and the main route of introduction to new regions is likely due to transport via seedlings. This species is taken into account as one of the foremost successful invasive amphibian species with direct or indirect negative impacts in multiple regions. In our study, we predict the potential distribution of E. planirostris in China by species distribution models (SDMs) methods. The results show that this species has a much larger suitable habitat area in China than reflected by the current distribution, so the species is likely to spread from the Pearl River Delta to surrounding areas. Under future warming, its invasive range will expand northward in China. Species distribution models (SDMs) have become indispensable tools in risk assessment and conservation decision-making for invasive species. Eleutherodactylus planirostris has a strong dispersal ability, and the main route of introduction to new regions is likely transport via seedlings. This species is understood as one of the foremost successful invasive amphibian species with direct or indirect negative impacts in multiple regions. In this study, we used MaxEnt to assess suitable areas for this species under current and future climates globally and in China. We considered seven climatic variables, three timepoints (current, 2050, and 2070), and three CO2 emission scenarios. Annual mean temperature, precipitation of the driest month, and annual precipitation were the most important variables predicting E. planirostris occurrence. This species has a much larger suitable habitat area in China than reflected by the current distribution, so the species is likely to spread from the Pearl River Delta to surrounding areas. Under future warming, its invasive range will expand northward in China. In conclusion, this study assessed the risk of invasion of this species and made recommendations for management and prevention.

AB The goal of the study was to examine whether treatments of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with psychotherapy (PE), pharmacotherapy (paroxetine) and their combination would result in changes in temperament towards a pattern of increasing stimulation processing capacity. We assumed that temperament changes might be recorded in participants with posttreatment remission of PTSD. The research question was whether all treatment modalities used in the study would lead to the same changes in temperament. Data from 135 patients who had completed therapy were randomly assigned to a twelve-week treatment of PE, paroxetine or combined treatments and were analysed. Temperamental traits were assessed by the Formal Characteristics of Behaviour Temperament Inventory before and after treatment and at the one-year follow-up, and PTSD symptoms were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and a Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. The results showed that temperament changes were observed only in subjects with remission of PTSD symptoms regardless of treatment modality and were maintained at follow-up. In conclusion, the study indicates that temperament traits change under effective treatment of PTSD towards a pattern of increased stimulation processing capacities. Despite the mechanisms of change, pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions influence this process.

AB Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) has been used to focally regulate excitability of neural cortex over the past decade - however there is little consensus on the generalizability of effects reported in individual studies. Many studies use small sample sizes (N < 30), and there is a considerable amount of methodological heterogeneity in application of the stimulation itself. This systematic meta-analysis aims to consolidate the extant literature and determine if up-regulatory theta-burst stimulation reliably enhances cognition through measurable behavior. Results show that iTBS - when compared to suitable control conditions - may enhance cognition when outlier studies are removed, but also that there is a significant amount of heterogeneity across studies. Significant contributors to between-study heterogeneity include location of stimulation and method of navigation to the stimulation site. Surprisingly, the type of cognitive domain investigated was not a significant contributor of heterogeneity. The findings of this meta-analysis demonstrate that standardization of iTBS is urgent and necessary to determine if neuroenhancement of particular cognitive faculties are reliable and robust, and measurable through observable behavior.

AB Although cellular elastic property (CEP, also known as cellular elastic modulus) has been frequently reported as a biomarker to distinguish some cancerous cells from their benign counterparts, it cannot be adopted as a universal hallmark to be applied to every kind cell. In the present study, we report that insignificant difference is observed between normal gastric cell and its cancer counterpart which is one of the common human malignancies, in terms of CEP statistical distribution. In this regard, we propose multiple cellular mechanical phenotypes (CMPs) to differentiate the above two cell types, which is realized by machine learning algorithm (MLA). The results show that the cellular classification effect proves better with more CMPs adopted, regardless of the exact MLA employed. Moreover, the MLA-based method remains effective if we add two more cell lines to the above two cell categories. Our study indicates that MLA-based cellular classification can potentially serve as an efficient and objective means to assist or even validate cancer prognostics.

AB Limiting temperature rise below 2 degrees C requires large deployment of Negative Emission Technologies (NET) to capture and store atmospheric CO2. Compared to other types of NETs, biochar has emerged as a mature option to store carbon in soils while providing several co-benefits and limited trade-offs. Existing life-cycle assessment studies of biochar systems mostly focus on climate impacts from greenhouse gasses (GHGs), while other forcing agents, effects on soil emissions, other impact categories, and the implications of a large-scale national deployment are rarely jointly considered. Here, we consider all these aspects and quantify the environmental impacts of application to agricultural soils of biochar from forest residues available in Norway considering different scenarios (including mixing of biochar with synthetic fertilizers and bio-oil sequestration for long-term storage). All the biochar scenarios deliver negative emissions under a life-cycle perspective, ranging from-1.72 +/- 0.45 tonnes CO2-eq. ha(-1) yr(-1) to-7.18 +/- 0.67 tonnes CO2-eq. ha(-1) yr(-1) (when bio-oil is sequestered). Esti-mated negative emissions are robust to multiple climate metrics and a large range of uncertainties tested with a Monte-Carlo analysis. Co-benefits exist with crop yields, stratospheric ozone depletion and marine eutrophica-tion, but potential trade-offs occur with tropospheric ozone formation, fine particulate formation, terrestrial acidification and ecotoxicity. At a national level, biochar has the potential to offset between 13% and 40% of the GHG emissions from the Norwegian agricultural sector. Overall, our study shows the importance of integrating emissions from the supply chain with those from agricultural soils to estimate mitigation potentials of biochar in specific regional contexts.

AB Climate change is one of the most significant challenges to biodiversity conservation, particularly in dry tropical islands, such as the Cabo Verde archipelago where only three endemic tree taxa occur - Dracaena draco subsp. caboverdeana, Phoenix atlantica and Sideroxylon marginatum - all classified as threatened. The main goal of this study was to predict the possible shifts in the climatically suitable habitat ranges for Cabo Verdean endemic tree species under different climate change scenarios. We applied species distribution models (SDMs) to the available occurrence data, and projected the distribution of the three taxa for 2050 and 2080, according to the expected climate change scenarios. The best models were obtained using the Random Forest algorithm; they showed that, by 2080, the suitable habitat for Dracaena draco subsp. caboverdeana and Sideroxylon marginatum will have decreased by 28% and 34%, respectively; conversely, the suitable habitat will have increased by 59% for Phoenix atlantica, the taxon best adapted to arid conditions. Additionally, Santo Antao is the island where endangered trees are more encompassed by protected areas. Overall, this study contributed with new integrated data to support the design and implementation of a strategic plan to promote the conservation and ecological value of Cabo Verde endemic trees in this climatically vulnerable country.

AB In accordance with the ecological civilization strategy, it is necessary to conduct in-depth analyses and provide a systematic elaboration of the characteristics of territorial-space structure (TSS). In the present paper, we examine Shandong Province and construct a framework for the evolution and optimization of TSS based on regional functions. The evolutionary process, pattern, and driving mechanisms of TSS are clarified using a geo-information atlas, the gravity center shift model, spatial autocorrelation analyses, and a geographic detector model. Furthermore, multi-scenario territorial-space simulations are carried out using the CA-Markov model, based on which an optimal pattern of territorial space is constructed. The results show that the comprehensive dynamic degree of territorial space in Shandong Province was valued at 0.56% from 2000 to 2020. Furthermore, six geo-information Tupu of TSS evolution changed, with a total area of 35,485 km(2), distributed mainly in the Yellow River Delta, the central and southern Shandong Mountain area, and the Jiaodong Peninsula. The migration route of the TSS gravity center curved over time. Territorial spaces are characterized by the exchange of ecological and agricultural space, while urban spaces occupy agricultural ones. The level of economic development, policy, and the institutional environment are driving forces in the transformation of ecological into agricultural spaces, as well as in transforming agricultural space into ecological and urban spaces. The trade-off connection of TSSs is made evident after a multi-scenario simulation of territorial space considering the 2020-2025 timeframe. Based on the goal of regional function co-ordination, Shandong Province is divided into three and four types of single and complex TSS, respectively. The obtained results may provide scientific reference for the co-ordination between human-land relationships and the sustainable use of territorial space, and serve to guide territorial spatial planning.

TI In-IDE Code Generation from Natural Language: Promise and Challenges
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Natural language programming assistant; code generation; code retrieval;
   empirical study
AB A great part of software development involves conceptualizing or communicating the underlying procedures and logic that needs to be expressed in programs. One major difficulty of programming is turning concept into code, especially when dealing with the APIs of unfamiliar libraries. Recently, there has been a proliferation of machine learning methods for code generation and retrieval from natural language queries, but these have primarily been evaluated purely based on retrieval accuracy or overlap of generated code with developer written code, and the actual effect of these methods on the developer workflow is surprisingly unattested. In this article, we perform the first comprehensive investigation of the promise and challenges of using such technology inside the PyCharm IDE, asking, "At the current state of technology does it improve developer productivity or accuracy, how does it affect the developer experience, and what are the remaining gaps and challenges?" To facilitate the study, we first develop a plugin for the PyCharm IDE that implements a hybrid of code generation and code retrieval functionality, and we orchestrate virtual environments to enable collection of many user events (e.g., web browsing, keystrokes, fine-grained code edits). We ask developers with various backgrounds to complete 7 varieties of 14 Python programming tasks ranging from basic file manipulation to machine learning or data visualization, with or without the help of the plugin. While qualitative surveys of developer experience are largely positive, quantitative results with regards to increased productivity, code quality, or program correctness are inconclusive. Further analysis identifies several pain points that could improve the effectiveness of future machine learning-based code generation/retrieval developer assistants and demonstrates when developers prefer code generation over code retrieval and vice versa. We release all data and software to pave the road for future empirical studies on this topic, as well as development of better code generation models.

AB Understanding how local conditions and dispersal dynamics structure communities of passively dispersing aquatic invertebrates remains uncertain, especially in aridland systems. In these systems, dispersal is irregular and successful colonization is subject to priority effects. To investigate these factors, we compared rotifer species composition from Chihuahuan Desert rock pools, playas, and tanks. (1) We found 132 species with high beta-dissimilarity among sites (> 0.8). (2) Correlation between species richness and habitat area was significant, but weak, for all sites. (3) Dissimilarity analyses, supported by negative Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) values, showed that stochastic processes dominate community assembly. (4) We examined influence of three important environmental variables on richness and community structure: hydroperiod, algal mat and macrophyte development, and conductivity; we also examined how rotifer trophi type (a functional trait) affected DNCI and identified indicator species. Hydroperiod was important for playas and tanks, but not rock pools. Conductivity had a strong influence. Richness was greatest in habitats with highest amounts of vegetation. Environmental factors explained similar to 12% of variation in community composition, indicating that while deterministic processes are significant, stochastic processes dominate in these systems. We provide a conceptual model that highlights the distinctive of nature aquatic communities in aridlands compared to temperate regions.

AB Genetic adaptation to future environmental conditions is crucial to help species persist as the climate changes. Genome scans are powerful tools to understand adaptive landscapes, enabling us to correlate genetic diversity with environmental gradients while disentangling neutral from adaptive variation. However, low gene flow can lead to both local adaptation and highly structured populations, and is a major confounding factor for genome scans, resulting in an inflated number of candidate loci. Here, we compared candidate locus detection in a marine mollusc (Onithochiton neglectus), taking advantage of a natural geographical contrast in the levels of genetic structure between its populations. O. neglectus is endemic to New Zealand and distributed throughout an environmental gradient from the subtropical north to the subantarctic south. Due to a brooding developmental mode, populations tend to be locally isolated. However, adult hitchhiking on rafting kelp increases connectivity among southern populations. We applied two genome scans for outliers (Bayescan and PCAdapt) and two genotype-environment association (GEA) tests (BayeScEnv and RDA). To limit issues with false positives, we combined results using the geometric mean of q-values and performed association tests with random environmental variables. This novel approach is a compromise between stringent and relaxed approaches widely used before, and allowed us to classify candidate loci as low confidence or high confidence. Genome scans for outliers detected a large number of significant outliers in strong and moderately structured populations. No high-confidence GEA loci were detected in the context of strong population structure. However, 86 high-confidence loci were associated predominantly with latitudinally varying abiotic factors in the less structured southern populations. This suggests that the degree of connectivity driven by kelp rafting over the southern scale may be insufficient to counteract local adaptation in this species. Our study supports the expectation that genome scans may be prone to errors in highly structured populations. Nonetheless, it also empirically demonstrates that careful statistical controls enable the identification of candidate loci that invite more detailed investigations. Ultimately, genome scans are valuable tools to help guide further research aiming to determine the potential of non-model species to adapt to future environments.

AB Self-affirmations-responding to self-threatening information by reflecting on positive values or strengths-help to realign working self-concept and may support adaptive coping and wellbeing. Little research has been undertaken on spontaneous self-affirmations in response to everyday threats, and less has been undertaken on the relationships between spontaneous self-affirmations, coping, and wellbeing. This study aimed to test both within- and between-person relationships between spontaneous self-affirmations, coping, and wellbeing, controlling for threat intensity and other outcomes. A repeated survey assessment design was adopted to achieve these aims. Outcome measures included approach coping, avoidance coping, positive affect, negative affect, and eudaimonic wellbeing. It was found that spontaneous self-affirmations positively predicted approach coping and positive affect at both within- and between-person levels, and eudaimonic wellbeing at the between-person level. Overall, spontaneous self-affirmations were positively associated with approach coping and aspects of wellbeing.

AB Besides being central for understanding both global biodiversity patterns and associated anthropogenic impacts, species range maps are currently only available for a small subset of global biodiversity. Here, we provide a set of assembled spatial data for terrestrial vascular plants listed at the global IUCN red list. The dataset consists of pre-defined native regions for 47,675 species, density of available native occurrence records for 30,906 species, and standardized, large-scale Maxent predictions for 27,208 species, highlighting environmentally suitable areas within species' native regions. The data was generated in an automated approach consisting of data scraping and filtering, variable selection, model calibration and model selection. Generated Maxent predictions were validated by comparing a subset to available expert-drawn range maps from IUCN (n = 4,257), as well as by qualitatively inspecting predictions for randomly selected species. We expect this data to serve as a substitute whenever expert-drawn species range maps are not available for conducting large-scale analyses on biodiversity patterns and associated anthropogenic impacts.

AB Thermokarst lakes are forming from permafrost thaw and are severely affected by accelerating climate change. Sediment and water in these lakes are distinct habitats but closely connected. However, our understanding of the differences and linkages between sediment and water in thermokarst lakes remains largely unknown, especially from the perspective of community assembly mechanisms. Here, we examined bacterial communities in sediment and water in thermokarst lakes in the Yellow River Source area, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Bacterial taxa were divided into abundant and rare according to their relative abundance, and the Sorensen dissimilarity (beta(sor)) was partitioned into turnover (beta(turn)) and nestedness (beta(nest)). The whole bacterial communities and the abundant and rare subcommunities differed substantially between sediment and water in taxonomical composition, alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity. Sediment had significantly lower alpha-diversity indexes but higher beta-diversity than water. In general, bacterial communities are predominantly governed by strong turnover processes (beta(turn)/beta(sor) ratio of 0.925). Bacterial communities in sediment had a significantly higher beta(turn)/beta(sor) ratio than in water. Abundant subcommunities were significantly lower in the beta(turn)/beta(sor) ratio compared with rare subcommunities. The results suggest that the bacterial communities of thermokarst lakes, especially rare subcommunities or particularly in sediment, might be strongly structured by heterogeneity in the source material, environmental filtering, and geographical isolation, leading to compositionally distinct communities. This integral study increased our current knowledge of thermokarst lakes, enhancing our understanding of the community assembly rules and ecosystem structures and processes of these rapidly changing and vulnerable ecosystems.

AB Background: Hybrids between Schistosoma haematobium (Sh) and S. bovis (Sb) have been found in several African countries as well as in Europe. Since the consequences of this hybridization are still unknown, this study aims to verify the presence of such hybrids in Cameroonian humans, to describe the structure of S. haematobium populations on a large geographic scale, and to examine the impact of these hybrids on genetic diversity and structure of these populations.
   Methods: From January to April 2019, urine from infected children was collected in ten geographically distinct populations. Miracidia were collected from eggs in this urine. To detect the presence of hybrids among these miracidia we genotyped both Cox1 (RD-PCR) and ITS2 gene (PCR-RFLP). Population genetic diversity and structure was assessed by genotyping each miracidium with a panel of 14 microsatellite markers. Gene diversity was measured using both heterozygosity and allelic richness indexes, and genetic structure was analyzed using paired Fst, PCA and Bayesian approaches.
   Results: Of the 1327 miracidia studied, 88.7% were identified as pure genotypes of S. haematobium (Sh_Sh/Sh) while the remaining 11.3% were hybrids (7.0% with Sh_Sh/Sb, 3.7% with Sb_Sb/Sh and 0.4% with Sb_Sh/Sb). No miracidium has been identified as a pure genotype of S. bovis. Allelic richness ranged from 5.55 (Loum population) to 7.73 (Matta-Barrage) and differed significantly between populations. Mean heterozygosity ranged from 53.7% (Loum) to 59% (Matta Barrage) with no significant difference. The overall genetic differentiation inferred either by a principal component analysis or by the Bayesian approach shows a partial structure. Southern populations (Loum and Matta Barrage) were clearly separated from other localities but genetic differentiation between northern localities was limited, certainly due to the geographic proximity between these sites.
   Conclusions: Hybrids between S. haematobium and S. bovis were identified in 11.3% of miracidia that hatched from eggs present in the urine of Cameroonian schoolchildren. The percentages of these hybrids are correlated with the genetic diversity of the parasite, indicating that hybridization increases genetic diversity in our sampling sites. Hybridization is therefore a major biological process that shapes the genetic diversity of S. haematobium.

AB Quantifying variability is important for understanding how evolution operates in polymorphic species such as those of the genus Proceratophrys Miranda-Ribeiro, 1920, which is widely distributed in South America. P. cristiceps distribution is limited to the Caatinga biome in Brazil. We examined its chromatic variation from a populational perspective, looking at different phenetic polymorphism levels and probable chromotypic association by applying statistical and GIS tools that could facilitate future taxonomic research regarding this and other species. We characterized P. cristiceps colour patterns and re-evaluated its geographic variation, highlighting potential consequences for the taxonomy of the genus. Our results revealed six principle chromotypes whose frequencies varied among sex and ontogenetic classes. Phenotypic expression appeared to respect defined proportions and evidenced selective value for the species. We conclude that individual variation, together with typological traditionalism may overestimate the polymorphic magnitude at the population level and cause taxonomic inflation. Our data support the usefulness of P. cristiceps as a model for microevolutionary studies.

AB Botanical gardens could serve as pollinator-friendly gardens and are suitable locations for investigating plant-pollinator interactions. Pollination in botanical gardens is a challenging topic of research, and its ecological function remains unclear in terms of pollination management for both pollinators and plants. Objective monitoring methods-including the selection of insect taxa and analytical methods-are required to elucidate plant-pollinator interactions in botanical gardens. In this study, we evaluated pollen transport networks using generalist hoverflies, as they are important pollinator insects, generalist flower visitors, and heterospecific pollen vectors that carry pollen over large distances. Hoverflies can form generalized pollen transport networks with an adequate abundance and wide distribution, and are easily collectable using sticky traps. Pollen grains on hoverfly bodies were identified based on pollen DNA barcoding using the ITS, rbcL, and trn regions. Bipartite pollen transport networks in the study period in 2018 and 2019 consisted of 116 plant taxa that were significantly generalized and showed similar structures in both years. The dominant plant taxa were two invasive species-Solidago canadensis and Bidens sp.-which had a significantly high eigenvector centrality in unipartite pollen transport networks. Hoverfly-mediated pollen transfer distances were 116-131 m on average and were significantly shorter in heterogeneous open environments. These findings suggest that hoverflies are non-negligible actors in pollen transport networks in the studied botanical garden.

AB Aim Evaluate how large-scale forest regeneration based on a low-cost restoration method may mitigate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation associated to future climate changes on the distribution of birds and arboreal mammals in a tropical biodiversity hotspot; find areas with different current and future potential species richness and assess how passive restoration can reduce the risk of species extinction. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF). Methods We built a forest regeneration scenario via a model of seed dispersal based on the potential movement of frugivorous fauna and projected the potential distribution of 356 bird species and 21 arboreal mammals based on Species Distribution Models (SDM) which employed 79,462 occurrence records and four algorithms for different climate and landscape scenarios. SDM were based on climate and landscape predictors separately and the results were combined into maps of species richness. Finally, we assessed the species' risk of extinction based on the species-area relationship. Results Without considering the effects of climate change, the potential distribution area for each species increases on average by 72.5% (SD = 8%) in the scenario of potential regeneration. Climate change decreases the area of potential occurrence of 252 species, which may suffer a mean reduction of 74.4% (SD = 9.3%) in their current potential distribution areas. BAF regions with the largest amounts of forest had the greatest potential richness of species. In future climate scenario, 3.4% of species may become extinct, but we show that large-scale regeneration may prevent these extinctions. Main conclusions Despite the possible negative impacts of climate change on the distribution of 67% of the studied species, which would increase the risk of species extinction, our analysis indicated that promoting large-scale BAF restoration based on natural regeneration may prevent biodiversity loss.

AB 1. Ecotones between tropical forests and lakes compose an ecosystem interconnection with a high abundance of terrestrial invertebrates, which represent an outstanding resource for the aquatic fauna. However, there is still little quantitative information on tropical forest contribution in terms of invertebrate inputs into lacustrine systems and the factors controlling this flux.
   2. To quantify the terrestrial invertebrate contribution into tropical lakes, we selected six lakes located in the Atlantic rainforest, south-eastern Brazil, and used pan traps placed in the lakeshore. We focused on total abundance, biomass, and richness of insect orders. To assess the influence of forest and lake morphometry on terrestrial invertebrate inputs into lakes, we measured the forest-lake distance and considered the morphometric characteristics of each lake.
   3. Distance from forest negatively affected the invertebrate biomass reaching the lakes. The dissimilarity across different ecotones also increased with distance from the forest. Perimeter-to-area ratio negatively affected the invertebrate abundance, suggesting that more dendritic lakes receive more invertebrates from the forest.
   4. We estimated that annually, on average 21 tons of terrestrial invertebrates fall into the studied lakes, representing a massive food resource for the aquatic ecosystem. Hence, if the distance from the forest increases due, for instance, to severe drought or deforestation, it will create an herbaceous environment unable to provide such a quantity of insects to the water ecosystems, compromising aquatic and terrestrial trophic webs dynamics.

AB Medicinal plants contribute substantially to the well-being of people in large parts of the world, providing traditional medicine and supporting livelihoods from trading plant parts, which is especially significant for women in low-income communities. However, the availability of wild medicinal plants is increasingly threatened; for example, the Natal Lily (Clivia miniata), which is one of the most widely traded plants in informal medicine markets in South Africa, lost over 40% of individuals over the last 90 years. Understanding the species' response to individual and multiple pressures is essential for prioritizing and planning conservation actions. To gain this understanding, we simulated the future range and abundance of C. miniata by coupling Species Distribution Models with a metapopulation model (RAMAS-GIS). We contrasted scenarios of climate change (RCP2.6 vs. RCP8.5), land cover change (intensification vs. expansion), and harvesting (only juveniles vs. all life-stages). All our scenarios pointed to continuing declines in suitable habitat and abundance by the 2050s. When acting independently, climate change, land cover change, and harvesting each reduced the projected abundance substantially, with land cover change causing the most pronounced declines. Harvesting individuals from all life stages affected the projected metapopulation size more negatively than extracting only juveniles. When the three pressures acted together, declines of suitable habitat and abundance accelerated but uncertainties were too large to identify whether pressures acted synergistically, additively, or antagonistically. Our results suggest that conservation should prioritize the protection of suitable habitat and ensure sustainable harvesting to support a viable metapopulation under realistic levels of climate change. Inadequate management of C. miniata populations in the wild will likely have negative consequences for the well-being of people relying on this ecosystem service, and we expect there may be comparable consequences relating to other medicinal plants in different parts of the world.

AB Arctic warming is affecting snow cover and soil hydrology, with consequences for carbon sequestration in tundra ecosystems. The scarcity of observations in the Arctic has limited our understanding of the impact of covarying environmental drivers on the carbon balance of tundra ecosystems. In this study, we address some of these uncertainties through a novel record of 119 site-years of summer data from eddy covariance towers representing dominant tundra vegetation types located on continuous permafrost in the Arctic. Here we found that earlier snowmelt was associated with more tundra net CO2 sequestration and higher gross primary productivity (GPP) only in June and July, but with lower net carbon sequestration and lower GPP in August. Although higher evapotranspiration (ET) can result in soil drying with the progression of the summer, we did not find significantly lower soil moisture with earlier snowmelt, nor evidence that water stress affected GPP in the late growing season. Our results suggest that the expected increased CO2 sequestration arising from Arctic warming and the associated increase in growing season length may not materialize if tundra ecosystems are not able to continue sequestering CO2 later in the season.

AB Agricultural soils contribute a significant amount of anthropogenic CO2 emission, a greenhouse gas of global environmental concern. Hence, discovering sustainable materials that can capture CO2 in cultivated soils is paramount. Since the effect of biochar on C mineralization/retention in fertilized soils is unclear, we produced biochar-based MgO and sepiolite-nanocomposites with CO2 capture potential. The field-scale impacts of the modified-biochars were evaluated on net C exchange rate (NCER) periodically for 3 months in fertilized plots. The effects of the modified-biochar on organic-C mineralization, the activities, and dynamics of C-cycling-related 16S rRNA which are unknown, were investigated. Results revealed an initial rapid and higher cumulative CO2 emission from the sole fertilizer treatment (F). Unlike the biochar treatment (BF), the successful incorporation of MgO/Mg(OH)(2) nanoparticles into the matrix and surface of biochar, and the potential formation of MgCO3 with soil CO2, mitigated CO2 emission, especially in the MgO-modified biochar (MgOBF), compared to the sepiolite-biochar treatment (SBF). Compared to F and BF, the higher C retention as MgCO3 in the modified biochar treatments led to an increase in cellulase activity, stimulation of key C cycling-related bacteria, and the expression of genes associated with starch, sucrose, amino sugar, nucleotide sugar, ascorbate, aldarate, cellulose, and chitin degradation, thus, increasing organic C mineralization. Among the modified-biochar treatments, higher C mineralization was recorded in SBF, resulting in increased cumulative CO2 emission, despite its initial capture for up to 42 days. However, MgOBF was effective in capturing soil-derived CO2, despite the increased C mineralization compared to biochar. The changes in soil moisture and temperature significantly regulated NCER. Also, the modified biochars positively influenced the distribution of C-cycling-related bacteria by improving soil pH and available nutrients. Among the modified biochars, the observed higher mitigation effect of MgOBF on NCER indicated that it could be preferably applied in agricultural soils.

AB Throughout the speciation process, genomic divergence can be differentially impacted by selective pressures, as well as gene flow and genetic drift. Disentangling the effects of these evolutionary mechanisms remains challenging, especially for nonmodel organisms. Accounting for complex evolutionary histories and contemporary population structure often requires sufficient sample sizes, for which the expense of full genomes remains prohibitive. Here, we demonstrate the utility of partial-genome sequence data for range-wide samples to shed light into the divergence process of two closely related ducks, the Mexican duck (Anas diazi) and mallard (A. platyrhynchos). We determine the role of selective and neutral processes during speciation of Mexican ducks by integrating evolutionary and demographic modelling with genotype-environment and genotype-phenotype association testing. First, evolutionary models and demographic analyses support the hypothesis that Mexican ducks originally diverged similar to 300,000 years ago in climate refugia arising during a glacial period in southwest North America, and that subsequent environmental selective pressures played a key role in divergence. Mexican ducks then showed cyclical demographic patterns that probably reflected repeated range expansions and contractions, along with bouts of gene flow with mallards during glacial cycles. Finally, we provide evidence that sexual selection acted on several phenotypic traits as a co-evolutionary process, facilitating the development of reproductive barriers that initially arose due to strong ecological selection. More broadly, this work reveals that the genomic and phenotypic patterns observed across species complexes are the result of myriad factors that contribute in dynamic ways to the evolutionary trajectories of a lineage.

AB Mineral doping of biomass prior to pyrolysis enhances carbon dioxide removal associated with biochar application to soils due to increased stable carbon yield, while also improving biochar fertiliser value through added nutrients and enhanced phosphorus availability.
   Biochar production via biomass pyrolysis with subsequent burial in soils provides a carbon dioxide removal technology that is ready for implementation, yet uptake requires acceleration; notably, through generation of cost reductions and co-benefits. Here we find that biomass enrichment (doping) with refined minerals, mineral by-products, or ground rocks reduces carbon loss during pyrolysis, lowering carbon dioxide removal costs by 17% to US$ 80-150 t(-1) CO2, with 30% savings feasible at higher biomass costs. As a co-benefit, all three additives increase plant-available nutrient levels. Doping with potassium-bearing minerals can increase both potassium and phosphorus release. Mineral doping in biochar production therefore offers carbon dioxide removal at lower costs, while alleviating global phosphorus and potassium shortages. This makes it unique among carbon dioxide removal technologies.

AB Biochar production and application as soil amendment is a promising carbon (C)-negative technology to increase soil C sequestration and mitigate climate change. However, there is a lack of knowledge about biochar degradation rate in soil and its effects on native soil organic carbon (SOC), mainly due to the absence of long-term experiments performed in field conditions. The aim of this work was to investigate the long-term degradation rate of biochar in an 8-year field experiment in a poplar short-rotation coppice plantation in Piedmont (Italy), and to modify the RothC model to assess and predict how biochar influences soil C dynamics. The RothC model was modified by including two biochar pools, labile (4 % of the total biochar mass) and recalcitrant (96 %), and the priming effect of biochar on SOC. The model was calibrated and validated using data from the field experiment. The results confirm that biochar degradation can be faster in field conditions in comparison to laboratory experiments; nevertheless, it can contribute to a substantial increase in the soil C stock in the long term. Moreover, this study shows that the modified RothC model was able to simulate the dynamics of biochar and SOC degradation in soils in field conditions in the long term, at least in the specific conditions examined.

AB Astrocytes are critical for healthy brain function. In Alzheimer's disease, astrocytes become reactive, which affects their signaling properties. Here, we measured spontaneous calcium transients ex vivo in hippocampal astrocytes in brain slices containing the dentate gyrus of 6- (6M) and 9-month-old (9M) APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. We investigated the frequency and duration of calcium transients in relation to aging, amyloid-beta (A beta) pathology, and the proximity of the astrocyte to A beta plaques. The 6M APP/PS1 astrocytes showed no change in spontaneous calcium-transient properties compared to wild-type (WT) astrocytes. 9M APP/PS1 astrocytes, however, showed more hyperactivity compared to WT, characterized by increased spontaneous calcium transients that were longer in duration. Our data also revealed an effect of aging, as 9M astrocytes overall showed an increase in calcium activity compared to 6M astrocytes. Subsequent calcium-wave analysis showed an increase in sequential calcium transients (i.e., calcium waves) in 9M astrocytes, suggesting increased network activity ex vivo. Further analysis using null models revealed that this network effect is caused by chance, due to the increased number of spontaneous transients. Our findings show that alterations in calcium signaling in individual hippocampal astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice are subject to both aging and A beta pathology but these do not lead to a change in astrocyte network activity. These alterations in calcium dynamics of astrocytes may help to understand changes in neuronal physiology leading to cognitive decline and ultimately dementia.

AB Context Deciphering how the complex environmental dynamics of highland temperate forests drive local patterns of genetic variation is key to understanding species diversity and distribution. Objectives Evaluate how the environmental complexity of La Malinche volcano influences patterns of genomic variation in Peromyscus melanotis, across two mountain slopes and global and regional geographic scales. Methods Using reduced representation genomic sequencing we estimated population genetic diversity, subdivisions and migration rates. Remote sensing data and drone image processing were used to characterize landscape variables. We evaluated their effect on connectivity, based on a landscape analyses framework, using resistance surfaces, circuit theory and omnidirectional connectivity. Results In our global analysis assessing multiple elevation levels on two mountain slopes, we identified three genetic clusters differentiating two elevation levels of the north mountain slope (ECLM; 3150 m, 3300 m) from the rest of sampled areas. Within the northeast mountain slope (CVM), we found reduced genetic variation, limited connectivity, fewer migrants and isolation in higher elevation populations. ECLM populations showed higher genetic diversity and lowest connectivity at intermediate levels. NDVI and tree height were the main factors promoting connectivity in CVM, while tree height and litter cover were most important in ECLM. Conclusions Our findings showed how the forest environmental complexity across different geographic scales drives dispersal, genomic structure and connectivity patterns in this rodent, where dirt roads and disturbed areas limit its connectivity, while exhibiting higher connectivity at the highest elevations where the forest is less disturbed. Notably, that our 3D variable of tree height was significant demonstrates the utility in incorporating 3D vegetation structure variables into landscape genetic analyses.

AB Gene expression, especially in multispecies experiments, is used to gain insight into the genetic basis of how organisms adapt and respond to changing environments. However, evolutionary processes that can influence gene expression patterns between species such as the presence of paralogues which arise from gene duplication events are rarely accounted for. Paralogous transcripts can alter the transcriptional output of a gene, and thus exclusion of these transcripts can obscure important biological differences between species. To address this issue, we investigated how differences in transcript family size are associated with divergent gene expression patterns in five species of Caribbean reef-building corals. We demonstrate that transcript families that are rapidly evolving in terms of size have increased levels of expression divergence. Additionally, these rapidly evolving transcript families are enriched for multiple biological processes, with genes involved in the coral innate immune system demonstrating pronounced variation in homologue number between species. Overall, this investigation demonstrates the importance of incorporating paralogous transcripts when comparing gene expression across species by influencing both transcriptional output and the number of transcripts within biological processes. As this investigation was based on transcriptome assemblies, additional insights into the relationship between gene duplications and expression patterns will probably emergence once more genome assemblies are available for study.

AB High elevation mountain forests in the European Alps are strongly affected by climate change. In this study we aimed to investigate the long- and short-term effects of climate on radial stem growth and tree hydraulics of the two dominant tree species at the forest line of the Eastern central Alps, European larch (Larix decidua Mill. and Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L). To this end, we analyzed tree ring widths from stem cores from five sites between 1990 and 2320 m above sea level (a.s.l.) and measured sap flow for three years and radial stem variation for four years at three sites between 1990 and 2100 m a.s.l. in an inner alpine dry valley in Northern Italy. We found that tree ring width of larch responded stronger to temperature and increased more with warming in the last decades than in Swiss stone pine. In the short term, low soil moisture reduced sap flow during the summer in Swiss stone pine but not in larch. Additionally, air vapor pressure deficit clearly reduced the number of days with radial stem growth in Swiss stone pine, leading to lower annual growth than in larch. Consequently, larch at high elevation might actually benefit from climate change at the expense of Swiss stone pine.

AB The development of coral reefs results from the interaction between ecological and geological processes in space and time. Their difference in scale, however, makes it difficult to detect the impact of ecological changes on geological reef development. The decline of coral cover over the last 50 years, for example, has dramatically impaired the function of ecological processes on reefs. Yet given the limitedresolution of their Holocene record, it is uncertain how this will impact accretion and structural integrity over longer timescales. In addition, reports of this ecological decline have focused on intrinsic parameters such as coral cover and colony size at the expense of extrinsic ones such as geomorphic and environmental variables. Despite these problems, several attempts have been made to predict the long-term accretion status of reefs based entirely on the contemporary health status of benthic communities. Here we explore how this ecological decline is represented within the reef geomorphic structure, which represents the long-term expression of reef development. Using a detailed geomorphic zonation scheme, we analyze the distribution and biodiversity of reef-building corals in fringing-reef systems of the Mesoamerican Reef tract. We find a depth-related pattern in community structure which shows that the relative species distribution between geomorphic zones is statistically different. Despite these differences, contemporary coral assemblages in all zones are dominated by the same group of pioneer generalist species. These findings imply that first, coral species distribution is still controlled by extrinsic processes that generate the geomorphic zonation; second, that coral biodiversity still reflects species zonation patterns reported by early studies; and third that dominance of pioneer species implies that modern coral assemblages are in a prolonged post-disturbance adjustment stage. In conclusion, any accurate assessment of the future viability of reefs requires a consideration of the geomorphic context or risks miscalculating the impact of ecological changes on long-term reef development.

AB Blue light regulates the leaf hydraulic conductance via the bundle-sheath cells' blue light PHOT receptors which, via an autonomous signaling pathway, activate the BSCs' AHA2 H+-pump.
   The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf veins bundle-sheath cells (BSCs)-a selective barrier to water and solutes entering the mesophyll-increase the leaf radial hydraulic conductance (K-leaf) by acidifying the xylem sap by their plasma membrane H+-ATPase, AHA2. Based on this and on the BSCs' expression of phototropins PHOT1 and PHOT2, and the known blue light (BL)-induced K-leaf increase, we hypothesized that, resembling the guard cells, BL perception by the BSCs' phots activates its H+-ATPase, which, consequently, upregulates K-leaf. Indeed, under BL, the K-leaf of the knockout mutant lines phot1-5, phot2-1, phot1-5 phot2-1, and aha2-4 was lower than that of the wild-type (WT). BSC-only-directed complementation of phot1-5 or aha2-4 by PHOT1 or AHA2, respectively, restored the BL-induced K-leaf increase. BSC-specific silencing of PHOT1 or PHOT2 prevented such K-leaf increase. A xylem-fed kinase inhibitor (tyrphostin 9) replicated this also in WT plants. White light-ineffective in the phot1-5 mutant-acidified the xylem sap (relative to darkness) in WT and in the PHOT1-complemented phot1-5. These results, supported by BL increase of BSC protoplasts' water permeability and cytosolic pH and their hyperpolarization by BL, identify the BSCs as a second phot-controlled water conductance element in leaves, in series with stomatal conductance. Through both, BL regulates the leaf water balance.

AB Dispersal is generally difficult to directly observe. Instead, dispersal is often inferred from genetic markers and biophysical modelling where a correspondence indicates that dispersal routes and barriers explain a significant part of population genetic differentiation. Biophysical models are used for wind-driven dispersal in terrestrial environments and for propagules drifting with ocean currents in the sea. In the ocean, such seascape genetic or seascape genomic studies provide promising tools in applied sciences, as actions within management and conservation rely on an understanding of population structure, genetic diversity and presence of local adaptations, all dependent on dispersal within the metapopulation. Here, we surveyed 87 studies that combine population genetics and biophysical models of dispersal. Our aim was to understand if biophysical dispersal models can generally explain genetic differentiation. Our analysis shows that genetic differentiation and lack of genetic differentiation can often be explained by dispersal, but the realism of the biophysical model, as well as local geomorphology and species biology also play a role. The review supports the use of a combination of both methods, and we discuss our findings in terms of recommendations for future studies and pinpoint areas where further development is necessary, particularly on how to compare both approaches. This article is part of the theme issue 'Species' ranges in the face of changing environments (part I)'.

AB Social interactions drive many important ecological and evolutionary processes. It is therefore essential to understand the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that underlie social patterns. A central tenet of the field of behavioural ecology is the expectation that the distribution of resources shapes patterns of social interactions. We combined experimental manipulations with social network analyses to ask how patterns of resource distribution influence complex social interactions. We experimentally manipulated the distribution of an essential food and reproductive resource in semi-natural populations of forked fungus beetles Bolitotherus cornutus. We aggregated resources into discrete clumps in half of the populations and evenly dispersed resources in the other half. We then observed social interactions between individually marked beetles. Half-way through the experiment, we reversed the resource distribution in each population, allowing us to control any demographic or behavioural differences between our experimental populations. At the end of the experiment, we compared individual and group social network characteristics between the two resource distribution treatments. We found a statistically significant but quantitatively small effect of resource distribution on individual social network position and detected no effect on group social network structure. Individual connectivity (individual strength) and individual cliquishness (local clustering coefficient) increased in environments with clumped resources, but this difference explained very little of the variance in individual social network position. Individual centrality (individual betweenness) and measures of overall social structure (network density, average shortest path length and global clustering coefficient) did not differ between environments with dramatically different distributions of resources. Our results illustrate that the resource environment, despite being fundamental to our understanding of social systems, does not always play a central role in shaping social interactions. Instead, our results suggest that sex differences and temporally fluctuating environmental conditions may be more important in determining patterns of social interactions.

ID POLYPHARMACY
AB Background Falls are a major public health problem affecting millions of older adults each year. Little is known about FRID prescribing behaviors after injurious falls occur. The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether an injurious fall is associated with being prescribed a new FRID. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2016). We included visits from patients age >= 65 years and classified visits based on presence of an injurious fall. The outcome of interest was prescription of new FRID between those with and without an injurious fall. Multivariable logistic regression weighted for sampling and adjusted for demographics, health history and other medications was used. Age and Alzheimer's disease were examined as potential effect measure modifiers. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported. Bayes factor upper bounds were also reported to quantify whether the data were better predicted by the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis. Results The sample included 239,016,482 ambulatory care visits. 5,095,734 (2.1%) of the visits were related to an injurious fall. An injurious fall was associated with a non-statistically significant increase in odds of at least one new FRID prescription: adjusted OR = 1.6 (95% CI 0.6, 4.0). However, there was non-statistically significant evidence that the association depended on patient age, with OR = 2.6 (95% CI 0.9, 7.4) for ages 65-74 versus OR = 0.4 (95% CI 0.1, 1.6) for ages >= 75. In addition to age, Alzheimer's disease was also identified as a statistically significant effect measure modifier, but stratum specific estimates were not determined due to small sample sizes. Conclusions Ambulatory care visits involving an injurious fall showed a non-statistically significant increase in odds of generating a new FRID prescription, but this association may depend on age.

AB Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used predictive tools to forecast potential biological invasions. However, the reliability of SDMs extrapolated to exotic ranges remains understudied, with most analyses restricted to few species and equivocal results. We examine the spatial transferability of SDMs for 647 non-indigenous species extrapolated across 1,867 invaded ranges, and identify what factors may help differentiate predictive success from failure. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Six hundred and forty-seven terrestrial species; eight taxonomic classes. Methods We performed a large-scale assessment of the transferability of SDMs using two modelling approaches: generalized additive models (GAMs) and MaxEnt. We fitted SDMs on the native ranges of species and extrapolated them to exotic ranges. We examined the influence of general factors and factors related to biological invasions on spatial transferability. Results Despite both modelling approaches performing well in the range of the species used for fitting, we observed moderate to low spatial transferability on average [mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) c. .7] when extrapolating to their invaded ranges. Transferability differed between taxonomic classes and invaded continents and was positively influenced by the performance of the model and environmental generalism in the native range, and the year of first record. Models performed worse with greater environmental coverage in the exotic range, gross domestic product and number of occurrences in the native range, geographic distance between ranges and when extrapolating to islands. Main conclusions After controlling for sampling bias, half of SDMs were only weakly predictive, which should affect how SDM-based forecasts are interpreted. Performance differed based on characteristics of the data, species, and ranges, and can suggest when SDMs may be reliable and when we should be most cautious. These considerations touch directly upon the potential use of SDMs for management of biological invasions. We discuss possible mechanisms of these findings.

AB This study examines the cognitive and affective commonalities and differences between humour and insight problems, focusing on the reasons given by the participants to explain their preferences. For both cartoons (study 1) and insight problems (study 2), the participants gave more reasons for liking than disliking something and the motivations for liking versus disliking did not always correspond. Many overlaps emerged between cartoons and insight puzzles in the categories relating to Curiosity, Violation of expectation, Virtuosity, Happiness related to superficial aspects and to content type confirming an overall similarity between these two "pleasures of the mind". They are nevertheless distinct in terms of certain aspects. For instance, the most common reason for liking a cartoon was that it elicited a sense of general happiness and Lack of surprise more often motivated dislike for a cartoon, whereas Lack of joy of verification was the main reason for disliking an insight puzzle.

AB The Arctic is among the fastest-warming areas of the globe. Understanding the impact of climate change on foundational Arctic marine species is needed to provide insight on ecological resilience at high latitudes. Marine forests, the underwater seascapes formed by seaweeds, are predicted to expand their ranges further north in the Arctic in a warmer climate. Here, we investigated whether northern habitat gains will compensate for losses at the southern range edge by modelling marine forest distributions according to three distribution categories: cryophilic (species restricted to the Arctic environment), cryotolerant (species with broad environmental preferences inclusive but not limited to the Arctic environment), and cryophobic (species restricted to temperate conditions) marine forests. Using stacked MaxEnt models, we predicted the current extent of suitable habitat for contemporary and future marine forests under Representative Concentration Pathway Scenarios of increasing emissions (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5). Our analyses indicate that cryophilic marine forests are already ubiquitous in the north, and thus cannot expand their range under climate change, resulting in an overall loss of habitat due to severe southern range contractions. The extent of marine forests within the Arctic basin, however, is predicted to remain largely stable under climate change with notable exceptions in some areas, particularly in the Canadian Archipelago. Succession may occur where cryophilic and cryotolerant species are extirpated at their southern range edge, resulting in ecosystem shifts towards temperate regimes at mid to high latitudes, though many aspects of these shifts, such as total biomass and depth range, remain to be field validated. Our results provide the first global synthesis of predicted changes to pan-Arctic coastal marine forest ecosystems under climate change and suggest ecosystem transitions are unavoidable now for some areas.

AB Understanding diversity patterns and associated driving factors are the critical topics in macroecology and conservation biology. Phytoplankton are highly susceptible to environmental changes in estuaries, particularly eutrophication. This study examined phytoplankton alpha and beta diversity using investigation data in May (springtime), August (summer) and November (autumn) 2009 in China's Jiulong River estuary, where it was easily polluted because of considerable discharge from a highly dense human population and low self-purification capacity with its limited river basin area, potentially resulting in eutrophication and then influencing phytoplankton diversity. Potential influencing factors were also explored, including dissolved oxygen, salinity, nutrients, nutrient ratios, geographic and hydrologic distance, and so on. The results indicated that Shannon's index (H') and Pielou's index (J) decreased from the estuary's upper to middle and then increased from middle to lower reaches, Simpson's (D) observed the opposite trend and species number (S) gradually increased from the estuary's upper to lower reaches. For beta diversity, all the indices showed a gradual decrease trend from the estuary's upper to lower reaches, where also, turnover dominated beta diversity for all seasons. It is noteworthy that the significant roles that nutrients and nutrient ratios played in shaping phytoplankton diversity patterns and the nutrient balance were characterized by excess nitrogen (N) and silicon (Si) and limited phosphorus (P), which could potentially cause diatom blooms. Findings also showed that decreasing Si concentrations can help to reduce overall pollution levels as well as the restoration of the estuary's ecosystem better than just reducing N alone. Accordingly, this study advocates for the protection of the entire estuary system with particular emphasis on its upper reaches. Moreover, greater attention should also be paid to impacts associated with N input and nutrient ratio trade-offs to the prospective watershed management of this estuary. This study provides a practical approach to explore estuarine diversity in a comprehensive way, which can inform effective biodiversity conservation and also be applied to other marine ecosystems to better guide sustainable management and conservation practices.

AB Leaf water pressure head (psi(leaf)) and more specifically its critical thresholds (psi(threshold)) characterize stomatal control of transpiration, particularly for C-4 plants, but this physiological process has rarely been integrated into dynamic crop models at the field scale. We further extended two coupled models with Feddes root water uptake (RWU) and Couvreur RWU models by adding the C-4 photosynthesis model in order to be applicable to a maize (Zea mays L.) crop growing under field conditions. The Feddes RWU model relates RWU and plant stress directly to the root zone water hydraulic potential, whereas the Couvreur model explicitly represents hydraulic signals between soil and stomata. Model performance was evaluated with a comprehensive dataset including stomatal conductance, psi(leaf), sap flow, gross assimilation rate (GAR), soil water content (SWC), dry biomass, and leaf area index (LAI) from a two-season maize experiment under contrasting environments and water regimes. For the Couvreur model, the RWU and dry biomass were more sensitive to the root hydraulic conductance parameters than to psi(threshold) and root growth parameters. The agreement index (I) for the Couvreur model after calibration was 0.91, 0.80, 0.81, and 0.69 for biomass, LAI, RWU, and GAR, respectively. The Feddes model performed similarly for the same metrics. The Feddes model simulated accurately the plant water stress in the first 45 d of the growing season, whereas the Couvreur model inaccurately predicted water stress, which resulted in lower agreement with observations (i.e., RMSEs of biomass simulated by Feddes and Couvreur model averaged from four validated plots were 0.171 and 0.214 kg m(-2), respectively). The Feddes model showed the potential to be used for maize under water stress whereas the Couvreur model needs to be further evaluated and improved with an adequate estimation of root hydraulic conductance. A dynamic parameterization of normalized root system conductance and/or more accurate assimilate allocation to the roots, especially under drought stress, should be considered in order to apply this model in future studies to maize.

AB Understanding the role of natural selection in the evolution of wild populations is challenging due to the spatial complexity of natural systems. The richest diversity of freshwater fishes in the world is found in the Amazon Basin, a system where marked hydrochemical differences exist at the interface of major rivers with distinct "water colors" (i.e., black, white, and clear water). We hypothesize that divergent natural selection associated with these "aquatic ecotones" influences population-level adaptive divergence in the non-migratory Amazonian fish fauna. This hypothesis was tested using a landscape genomics framework to compare the relative contribution of environmental and spatial factors to the evolutionary divergence of the Amazonian characin fish Triportheus albus. The framework was based on spatial data, in situ hydrochemical measurements, and 15,251 filtered SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) for T. albus sampled from three major Amazonian rivers. Gradient Forest, redundancy analysis (RDA) and BayPass analyses were used to test for signals of natural selection, and model-based and model-free approaches were used to evaluate neutral population differentiation. After controlling for a signal of neutral hierarchical structure which was consistent with the expectations for a dendritic system, variation in turbidity and pH were key factors contributing to adaptive divergence. Variation in genes involved in acid-sensitive ion transport pathways and light-sensitive photoreceptor pathways was strongly associated with pH and turbidity variability. This study improves our understanding of how natural selection and neutral evolution impact on the distribution of aquatic biodiversity from the understudied and ecologically complex Amazonia.

AB An understanding of the distribution range and status of a species is paramount for its conservation. We used photo captures from 26,838 camera traps deployed over 121,337 km(2) along with data from radio-telemetry, published, and authenticated wolf sightings to infer wolf locations. A total of 3,324 presence locations were obtained and after accounting for spatial redundancy 574 locations were used for modeling in maximum entropy framework (MaxEnt) with ecologically relevant covariates to infer potentially occupied habitats. Relationships of wolf occurrence with eco-geographical variables were interpreted based on response curves. Wolves avoided dense wet forests, human disturbances beyond a threshold, arid deserts, and areas with high top-carnivore density, but occurred in semi-arid scrub, grassland, open forests systems with moderate winter temperatures. The potential habitat that can support wolf occupancy was 364,425 km(2) with the largest wolf habitat available in western India (Saurashtra-Kachchh-Thar landscape 102,837 km(2)). Wolf habitats across all landscapes were connected with no barriers to dispersal. Breeding packs likely occurred in approximate to 89,000 km(2). Using an average territory size of 188 (SE 23) km(2), India could potentially hold 423-540 wolf packs. With an average adult pack size of 3 (SE 0.24), and a wolf density < 1 per 100 km(2) in occupied but non-breeding habitats, a wolf population of 3,170 (SE range 2,568-3,847) adults was estimated. The states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra were major strongholds for the species. Within forested landscapes, wolves tended to avoid top-carnivores but were more sympatric with leopards and dhole compared to tigers and lions. This ancient wolf lineage is threatened by habitat loss to development, hybridization with dogs, fast-traffic roads, diseases, and severe persecution by pastoralists. Their status is as precarious as that of the tiger, yet focused conservation efforts are lacking. Breeding habitat patches within each landscape identified in this study should be made safe from human persecution and free of feral dogs so as to permit packs to breed and successfully recruit individuals to ensure wolf persistence in the larger landscape for the long term.

AB Introduction Codonoblepharon forsteri (Dicks.) Goffinet is a rare epiphytic moss characteristically associated with water-filled holes in trees. We reviewed its range and population and assessed effects of climate change. Methods An inventory of sites from where Codonoblepharon forsteri has been recorded was compiled. Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) were calculated. Population size was estimated, treating an occupied tree as an 'individual-equivalent' of the moss. Climatic conditions of the species' current distribution were characterised, and an ensemble model of its distribution was generated. The latter was projected onto present and future climatic layers. Key results Codonoblepharon forsteri has been recorded from 19 countries and 205 sites in Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia. It has been undergoing an overall decline. Most sites have few occupied trees, and a world population of 1000-10,000 individual-equivalents is estimated. Model projections suggest that the species will experience a range increase of +0.36-0.65 by 2050 and +0.35-0.68 by 2070, especially in its northwest range, particularly across France and the UK. Range loss is predicted to be between -0.20 and -0.39 in 2050 and -0.21 and -0.65 in 2070, affecting the driest areas of the current range around the Mediterranean, especially in North Africa. Conclusions Codonoblepharon forsteri has a relatively large EOO but relatively small AOO, probably due to habitat specialism. A major reason for recent declines appears to be widespread abandonment of traditional 'pollarding' of trees. The potential climatic range of the species will shift significantly northwards over the next few decades.

AB Plant stresses causing accumulation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) are scavenged by effective antioxidant defense systems. Therefore, the present study performed genome-wide identification of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) gene families in cultivated and wild soybeans, and 11 other legume species. We identified a total of 101 and 95 genes of SOD and GPX, respectively, across thirteen legume species. The highest numbers of SODs and GPXs were identified in cultivated (Glycine max) and wild (Glycine soja). A comparative phylogenetic study revealed highest homology among the SODs and GPXs of cultivated and wild soybeans relative to other legumes. The exon/intron structure, motif and synteny blocks were conserved in both soybean species. According to Ka/Ks, purifying the selection played the major evolutionary role in these gene families, and segmental duplication are major driving force for SODs and GPXs expansion. In addition, the qRT-PCR analysis of the G. max and G. soja SOD and GPX genes revealed significant differential expression of these genes in response to oxidative, drought and salinity stresses in root tissue. In conclusion, our study provides new insights for the evolution of SOD and GPX gene families in legumes, and provides resources for further functional characterization of these genes for multiple stresses.

AB Forest composition in the eastern United States (US) has been shifting from an oak-hickory to maple-beech assemblage, but whether there are species-specific differences within these oak-hickory stands in their responses and recovery from drought remains unclear. Here, we examined drought responses and resilience derived from radial growth of 485 co-occurring Carya ovata and Quercus alba individual trees at 15 forests in the eastern US. Water availability over the growing season (May to August) of the current year controls growth variability of both C. ovata and Q. alba. Drought that occurred in June caused the greatest growth reduction for both species while interspecific differences inof drought-induced growth reduction was found in July, where Q. alba experienced stronger reduction than C. ovata. Both species are resilient to early growing season drought, but late growing season drought caused larger drought legacy effects for Q. alba. The increasing drought frequency and intensity will have a more prominent impact in oak-hickory stands in the eastern US. The species composition of a forest along with species-specific responses and recovery is likely to be a critical control on forest productivity and species abundance.

AB Morphologically similar but genetically distinct species have been termed cryptic and most have been assumed to be ecologically similar. However, if these species co-occur at a certain spatial scale, some niche differences at finer scales should be expected to allow for coexistence. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a disjointed distribution of cryptic bladed Bangiales along spatial (intertidal elevations) and temporal (seasons) environmental gradients. Bladed Bangiales were identified and quantified across four intertidal elevations and four seasons for one year, at five rocky intertidal sites (between 39 degrees S and 43 degrees S) in southern Chile. Species determination was based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene amplification. To assess species gross morphology, thallus shape, color, and maximum length and width were recorded. Hundreds of organisms were classified into nine Bangiales species belonging to three genera (i.e., Fuscifolium, Porphyra, and Pyropia), including five frequent (>97% of specimens) and four infrequent species. All species, except for Pyropia saldanhae, had been previously reported along the coasts of Chile. The thallus shape and color were very variable, and a large overlap of the maximum width and length supported the cryptic status of these species. Multivariate analyses showed that the main variable affecting species composition was intertidal elevation. Species such as Py. orbicularis were more abundant in low and mid intertidal zones, while others, such as Po. mumfordii and Po. sp. FIH, were principally observed in high and spray elevations. Despite all numerically dominant species being present all year long, a slight effect of seasonal variation on species composition was also detected. These results strongly support the existence of spatial niche partitioning in cryptic Bangiales along the Chilean rocky intertidal zone.

AB As natural and anthropogenic forcings impel anticipated climate change, their effects on biodiversity and environmental sustainability are evident. A fundamental question that is often overlooked is: which changes in climate will cause the redistribution or extinction of threatened species? Here, we mapped and modelled the current and future geographical distributions of the four threatened medicinal plants - Aconitum heterophyllum Wall. ex Royle, Fritillaria cirrhosa D.Don, Meconopsis aculeata Royle and Rheum webbianum Royle - in Kashmir Himalaya using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. Species occurrence records were collated from detailed field studies carried out between the years 2010 and 2020. Four general circulation models for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios were chosen for future range changes over periods around 2050 (average for 2041-2060) and 2070 (average of 2061-2080). Notable differences existed between species in their responses to predictive environmental variables of temperature and precipitation. Increase in the most suitable habitat, except for A. heterophyllum and R. webbianum, were evident across Himalayan Mountain regions, while the Pir Panjal mountain region exhibited a decrease for all four species under future climate change scenarios. This study exemplifies the idiosyncratic response of narrow-range plants to expected future climate change and highlights conservation implications.

AB The contribution of seasonality in species communities to elevational diversity of tropical insects remains poorly understood. We here assessed seasonal patterns and drivers of bee diversity in the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot, Kenya, to understand the contribution of seasonality to elevational biodiversity patterns. Bee species and plant species visited by bees were recorded on 50 study plots in regrowth vegetation across four major seasons along two elevation gradients from 525 to 2530 m above sea level. Bees were sampled by transect walks using sweep nets and aspirators. We examined how local species richness (alpha-diversity) and seasonal changes in local species communities (beta-diversity) contribute to species richness across seasons (gamma-diversity) along elevation gradients. Using a multimodel inference framework, we identified the contribution of climate and floral seasonality to elevational patterns in bee diversity. We found that both alpha- and gamma-diversity decreased with elevation. Seasonal beta-diversity decreased with elevation and the high turnover of species across seasons contributed to a considerably higher gamma- than alpha-diversity on study plots. A combination of seasonality in climate and the seasonal turnover of floral resources best explained the seasonality in bee species communities (seasonal beta-diversity). We, therefore, conclude that, despite the more stable, and favorable climatic conditions in the tropics (in comparison to temperate regions), climatic seasonality and its influence on bees' floral resources largely determined seasonal patterns of bee species diversity along elevation gradients on tropical mountains.

AB It is recognized that biochar undergoes changes when it is applied to soils. However, the mechanisms of biochar alterations are not fully understood yet. To this purpose, the present study is designed to investigate the transformations in the soil of two different biochars obtained from pyrolysis of fir-wood pellets. The production of the biochars differed for the dry and wet quenching procedures used to terminate the pyrolysis. Both biochars were applied to clay soil (26% sand, 6% silt, and 68% clay) placed into lysimeters. After water saturation and 15 days of equilibration, seeds of watercress (Lepidium sativum) were cultivated. After a further 7 weeks, the biochars were manually separated from the systems. A total of four samples were collected. They were analyzed for chemical-physical characteristics by using an innovative technique referred to as fast field cycling nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry. The results showed that the dry-quenching produced a material that was mainly chemically altered after application to soil compared to the biochar obtained by the wet-quenching. Indeed, the latter was both chemically and physically modified. In particular, results showed that water was better retained in the soil treated with the dry-quenched material. Consequently, we may suggest that crop productivity and environmental remediation may be modulated by applying either the dry-quenched or the wet-quenched biochar.

AB Understanding the spatial distribution of plant diversity and its drivers are major challenges in biogeography and conservation biology. Integrating multiple facets of biodiversity (e.g., taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional biodiversity) may advance our understanding on how community assembly processes drive the distribution of biodiversity. In this study, plant communities in 60 sampling plots in desert ecosystems were investigated. The effects of local environment and spatial factors on the species, functional, and phylogenetic alpha- and beta-diversity (including turnover and nestedness components) of desert plant communities were investigated. The results showed that functional and phylogenetic alpha-diversity were negatively correlated with species richness, and were significantly positively correlated with each other. Environmental filtering mainly influenced species richness and Rao quadratic entropy; phylogenetic alpha-diversity was mainly influenced by dispersal limitation. Species and phylogenetic beta-diversity were mainly consisted of turnover component. The functional beta-diversity and its turnover component were mainly influenced by environmental factors, while dispersal limitation dominantly effected species and phylogenetic beta-diversity and their turnover component of species and phylogenetic beta-diversity. Soil organic carbon and soil pH significantly influenced different dimensions of alpha-diversity, and soil moisture, salinity, organic carbon, and total nitrogen significantly influenced different dimensions of alpha- and beta-diversity and their components. Overall, it appeared that the relative influence of environmental and spatial factors on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity differed at the alpha and beta scales. Quantifying alpha- and beta-diversity at different biodiversity dimensions can help researchers to more accurately assess patterns of diversity and community assembly.

   DISCRIMINATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; ACCURACY
AB Species distribution models use occurrence data of the focus species together with environmental variables to estimate a habitat suitability score. Typically, the discrimination capacity of the models, that is, how good the instances of presence and absence are correctly classified, is assessed with statistics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). However, the value of any discrimination statistic depends on the distribution of the suitability scores in the evaluation dataset, the so-called representativeness effect. For example, the same well-calibrated model evaluated with two datasets, one set with mostly intermediate predicted values (around 0.5) and another set in which most cases have extreme predicted values (close to 0 and close to 1), will yield low (towards 0.5) and high (towards 1) AUC values, respectively. Thus, discrimination values are entirely context dependent and cannot be directly compare between datasets because they are not intrinsic measures of a model's performance. In this contribution, I propose a methodology based on stratified bootstrapping with an inverse probability weighting that makes the distribution of the suitability values uniform and harmonizes the AUC so that the so-called uAUC can now be compared between different datasets. I run simulations considering a range of sample sizes and different initial distributions of the suitability values to validate the method. I apply the method to an empirical exercise, and implement it in the R package vandalico. Although I mainly focused on the AUC, the harmonization procedure can be applied to any other discrimination measure that is prevalence independent in a strict mathematical sense, such as the sensitivity star (Se*). To provide accurate estimations, it is important to have a high-quality evaluation dataset, that is, a dataset that covers the whole spectrum of suitability values and a minimum sample size of at least 150 cases. Further research is needed to develop a method to estimate reliable confidence intervals. I expect the harmonization methodology proposed here to be of interest in other research areas (besides ecology) that deal with discrimination/classification problems.

AB Network analysis is a highly flexible statistical framework with a diversity of uses across both ecology and other fields of study. Recent developments in ecological-based network methods have created active research interest in areas such as animal behaviour, community ecology, and landscape connectivity. With the increasing availability of genetic data from wild populations, network analysis has become a viable and important method for the study of both between and within population genetics. However, to date there is a lack of cohesion in the methodology and terminology used in genetic networks, making it difficult for researchers to undertake network analysis or follow field-specific best practices. Here, we conducted a literature review of studies that use geneticbased networks to describe and analyse population structure, genetic connectivity, dispersal, and to understand individual level of genetic relatedness. We categorise studies as population-level networks and individual-based genetic networks, based on their node definition, and discuss the commonalities and differences between these approaches. Additionally, we present an overview of the current methods and software available for the construction and analysis of genetic networks. Lastly, we discuss how genetic networks can effectively contribute to the field of conservation biology, with particular focus on defining population structure/units, understanding genetic connectivity, dispersal, and detecting source/sink dynamics, as well as addressing how genetic networks can aid studies of individual or familial fitness and understanding population inbreeding and bottlenecks.

AB Exotic species invasions have profound effects on native ecosystems, with the ecological effects of non-native plants being especially pervasive. We investigated the impacts of a plant invasion on benthic invertebrate assemblages in intertidal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta, comparing benthic communities associated with exotic Spartina alterniflora against those associated with native plants (Tamarix chinensis, Suaeda salsa, and mudflat). Our study surprisingly found that the density, diversity, and richness of benthic invertebrates associated with S. alterniflora were higher than with native habitats. Multivariate analysis also revealed that the structure of benthic invertebrates in S. alterniflora habitats was different than in T. chinensis and mudflat habitats. The structure of invertebrates associated with the invasive S. alterniflora and native S. salsa was more similar, although the dominant species differed. Indicator species analyses indicated that each habitat was characterized by unique taxa. S. alterniflora invasion increased the beta diversity of the community, with the species turnover component being of most importance. Mollusks were most likely to be influenced by Spartina invasions. Given the extent of the S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Delta, altered benthic invertebrate communities will likely have important implications for the ecology of the intertidal wetland ecosystems and deserve increased attention.

AB Current land-use and climate change patterns lead to disruption in ecosystem services provisioning essential for human well-being. Actions representing alternatives to business-as-usual trend can reduce negative impacts, but their effectiveness across ecosystems, climatic zones and scales is unclear. Here, we analyse how land recovery and climate action can counteract adverse effects of current trends on nature and safeguard provisioning of ecosystem services. Using a meta-analysis approach, we compiled 410 estimates of how land recovery or climate action may alter impacts expected from business-as-usual trends. We show that both alternatives can reduce negative effects on several nature indicators. The magnitude of the effects, however, is context-dependent, revealing their potential complementarity. Land recovery showed highest benefits in terrestrial and freshwater systems in temperate zones and mostly acts at subnational scale. Contrastingly, climate action is more important in coastal and oceanic systems and in tropical regions, where benefits are larger on a regional to global scale. Our results show that land recovery and climate action will be imperative to reduce risks that would be imposed on nature by business-as-usual trends otherwise. We conclude that a better evaluation of which contexts are best suited for certain actions is a first step towards securing nature and the ecosystem services necessary to guarantee human well-being and the fulfilment of the sustainability agenda.

AB Understanding the genetic structure adopted by natural populations and its relation to environmental adaptation is critical for the success of restoration programs. We evaluated the genetic structure and temporal environmental niche dynamics of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) in 48 populations. The genetic evaluation was performed through amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) molecular markers. The maximum entropy method was used to model the past, present, and future environmental niches of the three clusters derived from the genetic analysis. The environmental niches of the three genetic clusters showed dynamic overlaps and isolations during the last interglacial and glacial maximum. The paleoclimatic events, which occurred during those periods, may have reinforced genetic exchange among populations and affected their genetic structure. Genetic clusters also presented different environmental niches in the present. Thus, they can be considered as three distinct ecotypes and restoration programs must be carried out using local germplasm from each environmental niche to increase their chance of success. Based on the environmental niches of the genetic clusters, changes are expected in the near and mid-century future. Therefore, climate change must be considered for species conservation management and future restoration programs.

TI Rewriting results sections in the language of evidence

DT Review
ID STATISTICS
AB Despite much criticism, black-or-white null-hypothesis significance testing with an arbitrary P-value cutoff still is the standard way to report scientific findings. One obstacle to progress is likely a lack of knowledge about suitable alternatives. Here, we suggest language of evidence that allows for a more nuanced approach to communicate scientific findings as a simple and intuitive alternative to statistical significance testing. We provide examples for rewriting results sections in research papers accordingly. Language of evidence has previously been suggested in medical statistics, and it is consistent with reporting approaches of international research networks, like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for example. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, ecology and evolution might benefit from adopting some of the 'good practices' that exist in other fields.

AB Alcohol use disorders are complex, multifactorial phenomena with a large footprint within the global burden of diseases. Here, we report the development of an accessible, two-choice self-administration zebrafish assay (SAZA) to study the neurobiology of addiction. Using this assay, we first demonstrated that, although zebrafish avoid higher concentrations of alcohol, they are attracted to low concentrations. Pre-exposure to alcohol did not change this relative preference, but acute exposure to an alcohol deterrent approved for human use decreased alcohol self-administration. A pigment mutant used in whole-brain imaging studies displayed a similar relative alcohol preference profile; however, mutants in CCSER1, a gene associated with alcohol dependence in human genetic studies, showed a reversal in relative preference. The presence of a biphasic response (hormesis) in zebrafish validated a key aspect of vertebrate responses to alcohol. SAZA adds a new dimension for discovering novel alcohol deterrents and studying the neurogenetics of addiction using the zebrafish.

AB This study analyzes the spatio-temporal dynamics of the drivers of forest expansion in the Iberian Peninsula for the periods 1987-2002-2017 through a 185 km-wide north-south Landsat scene transect. The analysis has considered a variety of biogeographical regions [0-3500 m.a.s.l, annual rainfalls 150-2200 mm] and 30 explanatory variables. A rigorous map production at 30 m resolution, including detailed filtering methods and uncertainty management at pixel scale, provided high-quality land cover maps. The main forest expansion trajectories were related to explanatory variables using boosted regression trees. Proximity to previous forests was a key common factor for forest encroachment in all forest types, with other factors being distance to the hydrographic network, temperature and precipitation for broadleaf deciduous forests (BDF), precipitation, temperature and solar radiation for broadleaf evergreen forests (BEF) and precipitation, distance to province capitals, and solar radiation for needleleaf evergreen forests (NEFs). Results also showed contrasting forest expansion trajectories and drivers per biogeographic region, with a high dynamism of grasslands towards new forest in the Eurosiberian and the mountainous Mediterranean regions, a high importance of croplands as land cover origin of new forest in the Mesomediterranean, and increasing importance over time of socioeconomic drivers (such as those employed in the industry sector and the utilized agricultural area) in the Supramediterranean region but the opposite pattern in the Southern Mesomediterranean. Lower precipitation rates favored new NEFs from shrublands in the Thermomediterraean region which, together with the Northern Mesomediterranean, exhibited the highest relative rates of new forests. These findings provide reliable insights to develop policies considering the ecological and social impacts of land abandonment and subsequent forest expansion.

AB The Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) is a medium-sized, carnivorous passerine, occurring throughout the western Palearctic. As with numerous other bird species, its numbers are declining, mainly due to anthropogenic factors. Therefore, revealing the population structure and genetic diversity is paramount in ensuring the survival of the species. However, until present, only mitochondrial DNA has been targeted to reveal the genetic structure of the species. These studies suggested a panmictic population structure. In this study, we employed next-generation sequencing of 88 Red-backed Shrikes from 11 countries and used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) to investigate the population structure. Even with such high-resolution DNA data, we found considerable genetic variability, but our results indicate no genetic structure in the Red-backed Shrike, suggesting a panmictic population. Migrant birds from Israel and Kuwait could not be attributed to breeding populations. Panmixia is the genetic legacy of the widespread and continuous distribution of the species, high locomotion capacities, and, most importantly, the numerous ice ages from the past few million years, which forced various populations to retract to refugia and expand their ranges several times, and to interbreed both in the glacial refugia and during warm periods in Eurasia.

AB Amphibian populations are sensitive to environmental temperatures and moisture, which vary with local weather conditions and may reach new norms and extremes as contemporary climate change progresses. Using long-term (11-16 years) mark-recapture data from 10 populations of the Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) from across its U.S. range, we addressed hypotheses about how demographic relationships to weather depend upon a population's position along climate gradients. We estimated the effect of seasonal weather on annual survival probability and recruitment rates both within populations and across the species' range from subalpine forests to semi-arid deserts. We calculated population-specific weather variables that captured seasonal temperature and precipitation between summer sampling events, both for periods when frogs were active (spring to fall) and inactive (winter). Across all populations, we marked 15,885 adult frogs, with 33% of frogs recaptured at least once. Population demography varied with seasonal weather across the species' range. Annual adult survival probability and recruitment rates of each population were influenced by a unique set of seasonal temperature and precipitation variables, particularly in winter and spring. Hence, adult survival varied with local conditions but, when analyzed across all populations, was predictable along a species-environment response curve associated with the timing of snowmelt and spring moisture. In contrast, recruitment rates for each population peaked at different values along an environmental gradient associated with the amount of snow during winter, and fall temperature and moisture levels, suggesting that recruitment may be responding to local conditions independently within each population. These findings highlight that sampling across the environmental (i.e., elevational and meteorological) gradients within a species range is necessary to predict species-level responses to regional climate change. This study also provides evidence of the importance of winter conditions on the demography of temperate amphibians, conditions that are already responding to climate change. Finally, this study further emphasizes that local context and spatiotemporal scale of inquiry remain paramount to understanding and potentially managing for climate effects on populations of amphibian species with broad geographic ranges.

AB Simple Summary Costa Rica is near malaria elimination. However, sporadic outbreaks still occur, and while control strategies have been focused on delivering efficient treatments for infected patients, an open question is whether control measures targeting the dominant vector, Anopheles albimanus, are appropriately designed given their ecology and distribution. Here, we illustrate the use of an ensemble species distribution model (SDM) as a tool to assess the potential exposure to An. albimanus in palm and pineapple plantations, and to also assess the potential involvement of this mosquito vector in transmission foci where entomological surveillance is not feasible. We found that both oil palm and pineapple plantations are very likely to harbor An. albimanus. By contrast, environments at the Crucitas open-pit gold mine, the epicenter of malaria transmission in 2018 and 2019, have low suitability for this mosquito species. Our results suggest that medium to high resolution SDMs can be used to plan vector control activities. Finally, we discuss the high suitability of oil palm and pineapple plantations for An. albimanus in reference to recently developed social science theory about the Plantationocene. In the absence of entomological information, tools for predicting Anopheles spp. presence can help evaluate the entomological risk of malaria transmission. Here, we illustrate how species distribution models (SDM) could quantify potential dominant vector species presence in malaria elimination settings. We fitted a 250 m resolution ensemble SDM for Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann. The ensemble SDM included predictions based on seven different algorithms, 110 occurrence records and 70 model projections. SDM covariates included nine environmental variables that were selected based on their importance from an original set of 28 layers that included remotely and spatially interpolated locally measured variables for the land surface of Costa Rica. Goodness of fit for the ensemble SDM was very high, with a minimum AUC of 0.79. We used the resulting ensemble SDM to evaluate differences in habitat suitability (HS) between commercial plantations and surrounding landscapes, finding a higher HS in pineapple and oil palm plantations, suggestive of An. albimanus presence, than in surrounding landscapes. The ensemble SDM suggested a low HS for An. albimanus at the presumed epicenter of malaria transmission during 2018-2019 in Costa Rica, yet this vector was likely present at the two main towns also affected by the epidemic. Our results illustrate how ensemble SDMs in malaria elimination settings can provide information that could help to improve vector surveillance and control.

ID BETA-DIVERSITY; COMPONENTS; MEANINGS
AB Variation in community composition and species turnover are different types of beta diversity, expressing nondirectional and directional changes, respectively. While directional changes (e.g. turnover) along geographic gradients can be studied in any direction depending on the hypothesis of interest to researchers, temporal changes can only be meaningfully studied from past to present. Although a wide variety of methods exist for partitioning variation and related community-level phenomena such as similarity, richness difference and nestedness, approaches evaluating species turnover along geographic or temporal gradients, based on an analogous conceptual framework, are rare. We therefore look into the possibilities for examining different aspects of directional changes along a gradient when presence-absence community data are available. Measures of community overlap, as well as species loss and gain from one sampling unit to another along a gradient are combined to define a variety of turnover and nestedness concepts and to derive functions for their quantification. Each concept represents an ecological phenomenon to be indicated (indicandum), whereas measures (indicators) quantify relevant properties of these concepts. The measures use the raw number of species as well as relativized forms in accordance with the well-known Jaccard and Sorensen indices. The main innovation is the development of new measures of directional community change. We demonstrate differences between traditional nondirectional and the new directional measures and use several examples to show that actual communities display directional responses to a particular ecological gradient. The new measures therefore reveal an uncovered aspect of community ecology.

AB Drought is a serious constraint to crop growth and production of important staple crops such as winter wheat and maize. Improved understanding of crops' response to drought can be incorporated into cropping system models to support crop breeding, crop and varietal selection and management decisions to minimize negative impacts. Plants may respond to drought through immediate stomatal regulation as well as possibly altering their morphological characteristics over longer periods. The degree and combination of these short- and long-term responses depends on the intensity and duration of drought as well as crop characteristics. However, field observational evidence for different crop types detailing these at short- and longer term responses and for different organizational levels is still limited. Here we examine the effects of various water supply treatments on short-term changes in leaf water potential (LWP) and gas exchange at the leaf level together with the seasonal changes in canopy photosynthesis, transpiration, and cumulative growth of winter wheat and maize based on field data collected in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Leaf and canopy gas exchange and cumulative growth was varied strongly with the duration and intensity of drought stress as well as growing stages. The longer-term morphological drought responses in winter wheat appeared to have a larger effect on regulating transpiration and assimilation rates than shorter-term responses of stomatal control had. Maize (grown in 2017 and 2018) exhibited different responses, with seasonal variations in minimum LWP and complete stomatal closure at LWP of between -1.6 and -2 MPa. While stomata closed with increasing drought, for maize, the physiological advantages of C-4 photosynthesis as well as morphological adjustments in leaf area size and leaf-rolling strongly determined crop growth and canopy gas exchange in the drought plots as compared with the irrigated plot. Observations highlight that improvements for soil-vegetation-atmosphere models in simulating gas exchange and crop growth should emphasize the dynamic reduction of leaf area under water stress, as well as stomatal regulation.

AB The use of ecohydrologically suitable microsites, such as sink patches (i.e. zones intercepting and infiltrating runoff) and nurse shrubs, have largely been proposed as tools to improve the establishment of late-successional trees in Mediterranean reclaimed landscapes. Nonetheless, this technique needs to be accurately tested along with the influence of seedling water-use strategy. To that purpose, we monitored the short- and mid-term (i.e. 4 and 8 years, respectively) influence of sink patches and nurse shrubs (Genista scorpius) on seedlings of two species with contrasted water-use strategies, Pinus nigra, a more drought avoider and isohydric species, and Quercus ilex, a more drought tolerant and anisohydric species. In the short term, G. scorpius shrubs enhanced the establishment of seedlings planted in shaded spots under its canopy. This positive interaction was more relevant for Q. ilex in drier years, while P. nigra was more facilitated in wetter years. Sink patches ameliorated the survival of both species, but only promoted greater growth during wetter years. P. nigra seedlings showed a high sensitivity to precipitation reduction. Their survival and growth were strongly constrained in dry years, resulting in a very high cumulative mortality at the end of the 8-year study period regardless of the microsite the seedlings were planted in. Q. ilex showed better seedling performance than P. nigra in the mid-term, keeping also the positive effects of suitable microsites on plant survival in the mid-term, after 8 years of plantation. Our results support the use of suitable microsites that ameliorate ecohydrological conditions as key spots for enhancing ecological succession in reclaimed mining sites, particularly the use of G. scorpius as nurse shrub for improving Q. ilex seedling establishment and growth. Our results also suggest that seedling functional strategy to cope with drought is a critical factor conditioning the overall plantation performance in the mid-term. Thus, seedling water-use strategy should constitute a key species selection criteria in future restoration programs focused on Mediterranean ecosystems, especially under climate change.

AB Dominance is important for access to resources. As dominance interactions are costly, individuals should be strategic in whom they interact with. One hypothesis is that individuals should direct costly interactions towards those closest in rank, as they have most to gain-in terms of attaining or maintaining dominance-from winning such interactions. Here, we show that male vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum), a gregarious species with steep dominance hierarchies, strategically express higher-cost aggressive interactions towards males occupying ranks immediately below themselves in their group's hierarchy. By contrast, lower-cost aggressive interactions are expressed towards group members further down the hierarchy. By directly evaluating differences in the strategic use of higher- and lower-cost aggressive interactions towards competitors, we show that individuals disproportionately use highest-cost interactions-such as chases-towards males found one to three ranks below themselves. Our results support the hypothesis that the costs associated with different interaction types can determine their expression in social groups with steep dominance hierarchies. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'.

AB Climate change mitigation scenarios that meet the Paris Agreement's objective of limiting global warming usually assume an important role for carbon dioxide removal and negative emissions technologies. Direct air capture (DAC) is a carbon dioxide removal technology which separates CO2 directly from the air using an engineered system. DAC can therefore be used alongside other negative emissions technologies, in principle, to mitigate CO2 emissions from a wide variety of sources, including those that are mobile and dispersed. The ultimate fate of the CO2, whether it is stored, reused, or utilised, along with choices related to the energy and materials inputs for a DAC process, dictates whether or not the overall process results in negative emissions. In recent years, DAC has undergone significant technical development, with commercial entities now operating in the market and prospects for significant upscale. Here we review the state-of-the-art to provide clear research challenges across the process technology, techno-economic and socio-political domains.

AB The sex of vertebrates is typically determined genetically, but reptile sex can also be determined by developmental temperature. In some reptiles, temperature interacts with genotype to reverse sex, potentially leading to transitions from a chromosomal to a temperature-dependent sex determining system. Transitions between such systems in nature are accelerated depending on the frequency and fitness of sex-reversed individuals. The Central Bearded Dragon, Pogona vitticeps, exhibits female heterogamety (ZZ/ZW) but can have its sex reversed from ZZ male to ZZ female by high incubation temperatures. The species exhibits sex-reversal in the wild and it has been suggested that climate change and fitness of sex-reversed individuals could be increasing the frequency of reversal within the species range. Transitions to temperature-dependent sex determination require low levels of dispersal and high (>50%) rates of sex-reversal. Here, we combine genotype-by-sequencing, identification of phenotypic and chromosomal sex, exhaustive field surveys, and radio telemetry to examine levels of genetic structure, rates of sex-reversal, movement, space use, and survival of P. vitticeps in a location previously identified as a hot spot for sex-reversal. We find that the species exhibits low levels of population structure (FST similar to 0.001) and a modest (similar to 17%) rate of sex-reversal, and that sex-reversed and nonsex-reversed females have similar survival and behavioural characteristics to each other. Overall, our data indicate this system is evolutionary stable, although we do not rule out the prospect of a more gradual transition in sex-determining mechanisms in the future in a more fragmented landscape and as global temperatures increase.

AB A fundamental question in neuroscience is what type of internal representation leads to complex, adaptive behavior. When faced with a deadline, individuals' behavior suggests that they represent the mean and the uncertainty of an internal timer to make nearoptimal, time-dependent decisions. Whether this ability relies on simple trial-and-error adjustments or whether it involves richer representations is unknown. Richer representations suggest a possibility of error monitoring, that is, the ability for an individual to assess its internal representation of the world and estimate discrepancy in the absence of external feedback. While rodents show timing behavior, whether they can represent and report temporal errors in their own produced duration on a single-trial basis is unknown. We designed a paradigm requiring rats to produce a target time interval and, subsequently, evaluate its error. Rats received a reward in a given location depending on the magnitude of their timing errors. During the test trials, rats had to choose a port corresponding to the error magnitude of their just-produced duration to receive a reward. High-choice accuracy demonstrates that rats kept track of the values of the timing variables on which they based their decision. Additionally, the rats kept a representation of the mapping between those timing values and the target value, as well as the history of the reinforcements. These findings demonstrate error-monitoring abilities in evaluating self-generated timing in rodents. Together, these findings suggest an explicit representation of produced duration and the possibility to evaluate its relation to the desired target duration.

AB Extreme drought is one of the key climatic drivers of tree mortality on a global scale. However, it remains unclear whether the drought-induced tree mortality will increase under nocturnal climate warming. Here we exposed seedlings of two wide-ranging subtropical tree species, Castanopsis sclerophylla and Schima superba, with contrasting stomatal regulation strategies to prolonged drought under ambient and elevated night-time temperature by 2 degrees C. We quantified the seedling survival time since drought treatment by measuring multiple leaf traits such as leaf gas exchange, predawn leaf water potential and water-use efficiency. The results showed that all seedlings in the ambient temperature died within 180 days and 167 days of drought for C. sclerophylla and S. superba, respectively. Night warming significantly shortened the survival time of C. sclerophylla, by 31 days, and S. superba by 28 days, under the drought treatment. A survival analysis further showed that seedlings under night warming suffered a 1.6 times greater mortality risk than those under ambient temperature. Further analyses revealed that night warming suppressed net leaf carbon gain in both species by increasing the nocturnal respiratory rate of S. superba across the first 120 days of drought and decreasing the photosynthetic rate of both species generally after 46 days of drought. These effects on net carbon gain were more pronounced in S. superba than C. sclerophylla. After 60 days of drought, night warming decreased the predawn leaf water potential and leaf water-use efficiency of C. sclerophylla but not S. superba. These contrasting responses are partially due to variations in stomatal control between the two species. These findings suggest that stomatal traits can regulate the response of leaf gas exchange and plant water-use to nocturnal warming during drought. This study indicates that nocturnal warming can accelerate tree mortality during drought. Night warming accelerates the mortality of two subtropical seedlings under drought. Night warming differently affects the drought response of leaf gas exchange and plant water-use between the two species due to species-specific stomatal morphological traits. Carbon metabolism changes and hydraulic damage play differential roles in driving night-warming impacts on the drought-induced mortality between the two species.

AB Background: People with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis require sputum smear monitoring at 2, 5, and 6 months to establish treatment outcomes. However, there is limited information about sputum smear monitoring in Uganda, similar to other developing countries. We examined factors associated with complete sputum smear monitoring among persons with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB aged >= 15 years in central Uganda.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed and abstracted data for persons with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB initiated on treatment between January 2017 and December 2019 across 11 large TB units in Masaka district in central Uganda. Complete sputum smear monitoring was measured as the receipt of three sputum smear microscopy tests at 2, 5, and 6 months of TB treatment. The data were summarized descriptively and the differences in the outcome with independent variables were examined using tests of statistical significance, namely the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test and the student's t-test. The factors independently associated with the outcome were established using the modified Poisson regression analysis with robust standard errors, reported as adjusted risk ratio (aRR) along with the 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results: A total of 416 participants were enrolled, with a mean age of 37.3 +/- 12.9 years. Of the participants, 290 (69.7) were males, 269 (64.7) were rural residents, and 128 (30.8%) had complete sputum smear monitoring. Urban residence (aRR, 1.45; 95% CI 1.12-1.90) and treatment under the community-based directly observed therapy short-course strategy (DOTS) (aRR, 1.91; 95% CI 1.25-2.92) were associated with a higher likelihood of complete sputum smear monitoring while TB and human immunodeficiency virus (TB/HIV) comorbidity (aRR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30-0.68) was associated with a lower likelihood of complete sputum smear monitoring.
   Conclusions: We found a low magnitude of complete sputum smear monitoring among persons with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB aged >= 15 years in central Uganda. Strategies to enhance the performance of sputum smear monitoring should target rural health facilities, strengthen TB/HIV collaboration and the implementation of community-based DOTS.

AB The genus Porphyra sensu lato (Bangiaceae, Rhodophyta), an important seaweed grown in aquaculture, is the most genetically diverse group of the Class Bangiophyceae, but has poorly understood genetic variability linked to complex evolutionary processes. Genetic studies in the last decades have largely focused on resolving gene phylogenies; however, there is little information on historical population biogeography, structure and gene flow in the Bangiaceae, probably due to their cryptic nature, chimerism and polyploidy, which render analyses challenging. This study aims to understand biogeographic population structure in the two abundant Porphyra species in the Northeast Atlantic: Porphyra dioica (a dioecious annual) and Porphyra linearis (protandrous hermaphroditic winter annual), occupying distinct niches (seasonality and position on the shore). Here, we present a large-scale biogeographic genetic analysis across their distribution in the Northeast Atlantic, using 10 microsatellites and cpDNA as genetic markers and integrating chimerism and polyploidy, including simulations considering alleles derived from different ploidy levels and/or from different genotypes within the chimeric blade. For P. linearis, both markers revealed strong genetic differentiation of north-central eastern Atlantic populations (from Iceland to the Basque region of Northeast Iberia) vs. southern populations (Galicia in Northwest Iberia, and Portugal), with higher genetic diversity in the south vs. a northern homogenous low diversity. For. P. dioica, microsatellite analyses also revealed two genetic regions, but with weaker differentiation, and cpDNA revealed little structure with all the haplotypes mixed across its distribution. The southern cluster in P. linearis also included introgressed individuals with cpDNA from P. dioica and a winter form of P. dioica occurred spatially intermixed with P. linearis. This third entity had a similar morphology and seasonality as P. linearis but genomes (either nuclear or chloroplast) from P. dioica. We hypothesize a northward colonization from southern Europe (where the ancestral populations reside and host most of the gene pool of these species). In P. linearis recently established populations colonized the north resulting in homogeneous low diversity, whereas for P. dioica the signature of this colonization is not as obvious due to hypothetical higher gene flow among populations, possibly linked to its reproductive biology and annual life history.

AB Background Sofosbuvir is converted to its active form, 007 triphosphate (007-TP), within cells. To date, the association between treatment adherence and 007-TP in dried blood spots (DBS) and factors that influence this relationship remain unknown. Objectives To examine relationships between adherence and 007-TP concentrations in DBS and identify factors that influence 007-TP in DBS. Methods Persons with HCV or HIV/HCV coinfection and self-reported drug and/or alcohol use were randomized to one of two technology-based approaches for monitoring 12 week adherence to once-daily ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. Convenience blood samples were collected every 2 weeks during treatment. 007-TP in DBS was quantified using LC/MS and analysed using mixed-effects models. Results A total of 337 observations were available from 58 participants (78% male; 21% black; 22% Hispanic/Latino; 26% cirrhotic; 78% HIV-coinfected). The mean half-life of 007-TP in DBS was 142 h (95% CI 127-156) and concentrations increased by 7.3% (95% CI 2.2-12.6) for every 10% increase in between-visit adherence. Geometric mean (95% CI) 007-TP concentrations in DBS were 301 (247-368), 544 (462-639) and 647 (571-723) fmol/punch by adherence categories of <= 50%, >50 to <= 80%, and >80%. Adherence, time on therapy, increasing age and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate were associated with higher 007-TP, whereas increased time since last dose, male sex, black race and higher BMI were associated with lower 007-TP. Conclusions 007-TP has an extended half-life in DBS and concentrations increased with adherence.

AB Symbolic play has long been considered a beneficial context for development. According to Cultural Learning theory, one reason for this is that symbolically-infused dialogical interactions constitute a zone of proximal development. However, the dynamics of caregiver-child interactions during symbolic play are still not fully understood. In the current study, we investigated informational exchange between fifty-two 24-month-old infants and their primary caregivers during symbolic play and a comparable, non-symbolic, functional play context. We coded over 11,000 utterances for whether participants had superior, equivalent, or inferior knowledge concerning the current conversational topic. Results showed that children were significantly more knowledgeable speakers and recipients in symbolic play, whereas the opposite was the case for caregivers, who were more knowledgeable in functional play. The results suggest that, despite its potential conceptual complexity, symbolic play may scaffold development because it facilitates infants' communicative success by promoting them to 'co-constructors of meaning'.

AB Aim The aim was to identify the primary drivers of compositional change in breeding bird assemblages over a 40-year period. Location Britain. Time period From 1970 to 2010. Major taxa studied Birds. Methods Using morphological trait measurements and a dataset of presence-absence data for British breeding birds surveyed in 10 km x 10 km hectads during two time periods, we calculated temporal taxonomic and functional beta diversity for each hectad alongside the change in species richness, mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) and mean pairwise distance (MPD). We also estimated potential drivers of beta diversity, including climatic and land-use and land-cover (LULC) change variables, elevation and assemblage species richness in 1970 (1970(rich)). We used random forest regressions to test which variables best explained compositional change in the assemblages. We also assessed spatial taxonomic and functional change by analysing multiple-site beta diversity and pairwise dissimilarities between time periods. Results Initial (1970) species richness was the most important predictor (highest importance score) across all models, with areas characterized by higher initial richness experiencing less assemblage change overall. The coordinates included to capture spatial autocorrelation in the data were also important predictors of change. Most climate and LULC variables had relatively low explanatory power; elevation and average temperature were the most influential. All metrics increased slightly with increasing elevation, except for species richness change and MPD, which decreased. Main conclusions The composition of British breeding bird assemblages changed substantially between 1970 and 2010. Spatial heterogeneity increased, both taxonomically and functionally. We show evidence that hectads with larger assemblages have been buffered from temporal diversity change and that those at higher elevations changed more in composition than those at lower elevations. Overall, coarse-resolution climate and LULC explained only small to moderate amounts of variation, suggesting that stochastic assembly change or finer-scale drivers might be drivers of temporal changes in assemblage composition.

AB Captive breeding programmes represent the most intensive type of ex situ population management for threatened species. One example is the Cuvier's gazelle programme that started in 1975 with only four founding individuals, and after more than four decades of management in captivity, a reintroduction effort was undertaken in Tunisia in 2016, to establish a population in an area historically included within its range. Here, we aim to determine the genetic consequences of this reintroduction event by assessing the genetic diversity of the founder stock as well as of their descendants. We present the first whole-genome sequencing dataset of 30 Cuvier's gazelles including captive-bred animals, animals born in Tunisia after a reintroduction and individuals from a genetically unrelated Moroccan population. Our analyses revealed no difference between the founder and the offspring cohorts in genome-wide heterozygosity and inbreeding levels, and in the amount and length of runs of homozygosity. The captive but unmanaged Moroccan gazelles have the lowest genetic diversity of all genomes analysed. Our findings demonstrate that the Cuvier's gazelle captive breeding programme can serve as source populations for future reintroductions of this species. We believe that this study can serve as a starting point for global applications of genomics to the conservation plan of this species.

AB Understanding the effects of landscape composition and configuration, climate, and topography on bird diversity is necessary to identify distribution drivers, potential impacts of land use changes, and future conservation strategies. We surveyed bird communities in a study area located in the Central Alps (Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, northeast Italy), by means of point counts and investigated taxonomic and functional diversity at two spatial scales along gradients of land use/land cover (LULC) intensity and elevation. We also explored how environmental variables influence bird traits and red-list categories. Models combining drivers of different types were highly supported, pointing towards synergetic effects of different types of environmental variables on bird communities. The model containing only LULC compositional variables was the most supported one among the single-group models: LULC composition plays a crucial role in shaping local biodiversity and hence bird communities, even across broad landscape gradients. Particularly relevant were wetlands, open habitats, agricultural mosaics made up of small habitat patches and settlements, ecotonal and structural elements in agricultural settings, and continuous forests. To conserve bird diversity in the Alps, planning and management practices promoting and maintaining small fields, structural elements, and a mosaic of different LULC types should be supported, while preserving continuous forests at the same time. Additionally, pastures, extensively used meadows, and wetlands are key to conservation. These strategies might mitigate the impacts of global change on bird diversity in the Alps and in other European mountain areas.

AB The present study is a full review of the non-native freshwater fish species introduced into Argentina and their relationship to the main environmental features and introduction vectors of each freshwater ecoregion. The total number of non-native freshwater fish species was compiled through a literature survey; information on spatial-temporal patterns of species records and invasion vectors was retrieved for all ten freshwater ecoregions of Argentina. Our survey revealed that 18-22 non-native fish species had been recorded up to 1999, and a total of 40 introduced fish species, of which 18 are invasive and five potentially invasive, had been registered in seven Argentinean ecoregions as of May 2020. According to georeferenced records, the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and common carp Cyprinus carpio were the non-native fish species with the greatest number of records and largest invaded areas, probably due to their species-specific ecological traits. Invasive fish species differed clearly between the Patagonia, Lower Parana, and Lower Uruguay ecoregions, probably because of a combination of the environmental conditions, structure of native assemblages, and invasion pathways in each ecoregion. Except for the recognized impact of non-native salmonids, the adverse effects of introduced fish species have been little studied, indicating the need for further research to clarify the role of ecological shifts triggered by the introduction and establishment of non-native fish species in Argentina. In contrast to the high diversity of aquatic species and freshwater environments, the spread and impact of invasive fish species in Argentina is little known, particularly compared with other South American countries.

AB Aim Alien species introduced into new ecosystems occasionally predate upon or outcompete native species. Land planarians (Geoplanidae) are a family of carnivorous Platyhelminthes among which several species are found outside their native range. Specifically, hammerhead flatworms originate from Asia and Madagascar but have now reached many new locations worldwide through the transport of exotic plants. Because they are predators of earthworms and snails, they are considered a potential threat to native ecosystems. In this context, to anticipate their potential impacts and to inform early preventative actions, it is necessary to know where these species could spread to in future, or where they might already be present but undetected. Location Worldwide. Methods Here, we used occurrence records from online databases and climatic and soil variables to model the potential distribution of five hammerhead flatworm species (Bipalium adventitium, B. kewense, B. pennsylvanicum, B. vagum and Diversibipalium multilineatum) that are known to occur outside their native range. Results We demonstrate that precipitation is an important factor determining their distribution, which is in accordance with their known affinity for humidity. We show that some areas have the potential to be invaded by all five species, including regions that are relatively spared so far. This includes the River Plate basin in South America, which already harbours a diverse fauna of native terrestrial flatworms and which appears to also be a potential hotspot for the establishment of alien hammerhead flatworms. According to scenarios of future climate change, two species (B. kewense and B. vagum) that currently have the largest observed global range are predicted to further increase their potential distribution. Main conclusions The results we report can be used to provide guidance for monitoring the potential sources of introduction of alien hammerhead flatworms in regions that are suitable, but which are not yet colonized.

AB Despite a rich history of botanical research, little is known about the distribution of genetic variation within New Zealand plant species. With a native vascular flora that consists of similar to 80% endemics, nearly one-half of which are threatened, there is a dire need for a better understanding of intraspecific diversity for individual plant species and of biogeographic patterns for the wider New Zealand flora. To these ends, we have investigated population genetic structure in the endemic root holoparasite, Dactylanthus taylorii (pua o te Reinga, Mystropetalaceae). A total of 235 individuals from 31 locations across the North Island of New Zealand (Te Ika-a-Maui, Aotearoa) were genotyped for a suite of nuclear microsatellite loci. Genotype data were analysed at the individual and population levels to assess genetic diversity within and among populations and to investigate the geographic distribution of genetic variation within the species. Population structure was assessed using Bayesian clustering, discriminant analysis of principal components, and a Neighbor-Net analysis. A hierarchical pattern of genetic diversity was revealed, with evidence for three broad geographic regional groupings (West, East, and Central Volcanic Plateau (CVP)). Upon further analysis, each of the three geographic groups further subdivide hierarchically into two or three genetic subgroups. Genetic diversity was found to be relatively high in this endangered species but varies considerably across populations. The distribution of genetic groups appears to have been influenced by past volcanic activity as the CVP group is largely coincident with a distinct tephra isopach from the 1.8 ka Taupo eruption and the West and East groups may have diverged due to recurring volcanic activity in the Central Volcanic Zone. The genetic structure resolved here provides important information for the management of D. taylorii specifically and for our understanding of New Zealand biogeography generally.

AB Cognitive aging researchers have been challenged with demonstrating age-related effects above and beyond global slowing ever since Cerella raised this issue in 1990. As the literature has made clear, this has indeed proved to be a difficult task and continues to plague the field. One way that researchers have attempted to test for disproportionate age differences across task conditions is by using Brinley plots, or plotting the mean response latencies of older adults against the mean latencies for younger adults. The simplicity and large proportion of variance accounted for by these models has led to the widespread use of Brinley plots over the years. However, as systematically tested here through eight cases of simulated data, it is clear that the Brinley technique is not well suited to either identify or display the underlying structure of datasets examining age-related differences in attentional control. Some of the problems with conventional Brinley plots can be resolved by using a modified Brinley plot that includes study-specific slopes linking trial types and a no-age-difference reference line. Multilevel models find all of the relevant effects, especially if applied to trial-level data, and have the advantage of incorporating study-level moderators that might account for slope heterogeneity. Ultimately, we encourage fellow cognitive aging researchers to access the code and data for this project on OSF () and employ the use of multilevel models over Brinley plots.

AB When resources are limited, mean fitness is constrained and competition can cause genes and phenotypes to enhance an individual's own fitness while reducing the fitness of their competitors. Negative social effects on fitness have the potential to constrain adaptation, but the interplay between ecological opportunity and social constraints on adaptation remains poorly studied in nature. Here, we tested for evidence of phenotypic social effects on annual fitness (survival and reproductive success) in a long-term study of wild North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) under conditions of both resource limitation and super-abundant food resources. When resources were limited, populations remained stable or declined, and there were strong negative social effects on annual survival and reproductive success. That is, mean fitness was constrained and individuals had lower fitness when other nearby individuals had higher fitness. In contrast, when food resources were super-abundant, populations grew and social constraints on reproductive success were greatly reduced or eliminated. Unlike reproductive success, social constraints on survival were not significantly reduced when food resources were super-abundant. These findings suggest resource-dependent social constraints on a component of fitness, which have important potential implications for evolution and adaptation.

AB Knowledge of the genetic structure and cryptic diversity is essential for the conservation of endangered species. We conducted a genetic survey of the federally endangered Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) sampled from its USA range in southern Florida. Florida bonneted bats are primarily found in four regions separated by approximately 100 to 250 km, including three western natural areas: Babcock Webb WMA (BW), Polk County (PC), and Collier County (CC) and one urban population on the east coast, Miami-Dade County (MD). We used 22 microsatellite loci and cytochrome b sequences to assess the extent of connectivity and levels of genetic diversity. Populations were highly differentiated at microsatellite loci (overall F-ST = 0.178) and model-based and ordination analyses showed that MD was the most distinct among pairwise comparisons. Regional populations were small (N-e < 100) with no evidence of inbreeding. Contemporary migration and historic gene flow suggested that regional populations have not frequently exchanged migrants, and thus the divergence among western regions was likely a result of genetic drift. Significantly, mitochondrial DNA revealed that haplotypes from MD were similar or shared with those recognized as Eumops ferox from Cuba and Jamaica, and divergent (1.5%) from the remainder of bonneted bats in Florida. Our data support the management of each of the four populations as distinct population segments, and that BW, PC and CC combined are on an independent evolutionary trajectory from bats in MD. Bonneted bats in Florida appear to harbor cryptic diversity that will require a reassessment of their taxonomy.

AB Land management practices can reduce the environmental impact of agricultural land use and production, improve productivity, and transform cropland into carbon sinks. In our study we assessed the biophysical and biogeochemical impacts and the potential contribution of cover crop practices to sustainable land use. We applied the process-based, global dynamic vegetation model LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) V. 5.0-tillage-cc with a modified representation of cover crops to simulate the growth of grasses on cropland in periods between two consecutive main crops' growing seasons for near-past climate and land use conditions. We quantified simulated responses of agroecosystem components to cover crop cultivation in comparison to bare-soil fallowing practices on global cropland for a period of 50 years. For cover crops with tillage, we obtained annual global median soil carbon sequestration rates of 0.52 and 0.48 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) for the first and last decades of the entire simulation period, respectively. We found that cover crops with tillage reduced annual nitrogen leaching rates from cropland soils by medians of 39 % and 54 % but also the productivity of the following main crop by an average of 1.6 % and 2 % for the 2 analyzed decades. The largest reductions in productivity were found for rice and modestly lowered ones for maize and wheat, whereas the soybean yield revealed an almost homogenously positive response to cover crop practices replacing bare-soil fallow periods. The obtained simulation results of cover crop with tillage practices exhibit a good ability of the model version to reproduce observed effects reported in other studies. Further, the results suggest that having no tillage is a suitable complementary practice to cover crops, enhancing soil carbon sequestration and the reduction in nitrogen leaching, while reducing potential trade-offs with the main-crop productivity due to their impacts on soil nitrogen and water dynamics. The spatial heterogeneity of simulated impacts of cover crops on the variables assessed here was related to the time period since the introduction of the management practice as well as to environmental and agronomic conditions of the cropland. This study supports findings of other studies, highlighting the substantial potential contribution of cover crop practices to the sustainable development of arable production.

AB The use of species distribution models (SDMs) has rapidly increased over the last decade, driven largely by increasing observational evidence of distributional shifts of terrestrial and aquatic populations. These models permit, for example, the quantification of range shifts, the estimation of species co-occurrence, and the association of habitat to species distribution and abundance. The increasing complexity of contemporary SDMs presents new challenges-as the choices among modeling options increase, it is essential to understand how these choices affect model outcomes. Using a combination of original analysis and literature review, we synthesize the effects of three common model choices in semi-parametric predictive process species distribution modeling: model structure, spatial extent of the data, and spatial scale of predictions. To illustrate the effects of these choices, we develop a case study centered around sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) distribution on the west coast of the USA. The three modeling choices represent decisions necessary in virtually all ecological applications of these methods, and are important because the consequences of these choices impact derived quantities of interest (e.g., estimates of population size and their management implications). Truncating the spatial extent of data near the observed range edge, or using a model that is misspecified in terms of covariates and spatial and spatiotemporal fields, led to bias in population biomass trends and mean distribution compared to estimates from models using the full dataset and appropriate model structure. In some cases, these suboptimal modeling decisions may be unavoidable, but understanding the tradeoffs of these choices and impacts on predictions is critical. We illustrate how seemingly small model choices, often made out of necessity or simplicity, can affect scientific advice informing management decisions-potentially leading to erroneous conclusions about changes in abundance or distribution and the precision of such estimates. For example, we show how incorrect decisions could cause overestimation of abundance, which could result in management advice resulting in overfishing. Based on these findings and literature gaps, we outline important frontiers in SDM development.

AB Climate change is expected to have a profound impact on species distributions, contracting suitable climate space. Biodiversity areas are important to mitigate these negative effects but are static by design and thus do not account for future projections of species distributions. The Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja has a broad range across lowland Neotropical forests and thus its distribution could be negatively affected by climate change when combined with current rates of habitat loss. To test this hypothesis, we use spatial point process models fitted with climatic, topographical and landcover covariates to identify the current distribution. We then project to 24 future climate scenarios, using three General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two emission scenarios between the years 2021 and 2100 averaged over four, 20-year periods. Our current model identified a core range across Amazonia and the Guiana Shield, with evergreen forest (71%), mean diurnal temperature range (13%) and elevation (6%) the most important predictors. Reclassifying the current model to a binary prediction estimated a range size of similar to 7.6 million km(2), with the Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) network covering 18% of habitat (similar to 1.4 million km(2)) within this range. By 2090, range size was predicted to decrease on average by 14.4% under a higher emissions scenario, and 7.3% under a lower emissions scenario. The IBA network would cover 14% less area under a higher emissions scenario, and 3.3% less distribution area under a lower emissions scenario by 2090. Southern Amazonia is predicted to have the greatest reduction in range size and subsequently highest loss of Harpy Eagle habitat within the IBA network. Our work demonstrates that the combination of climate change and subsequent habitat loss may result in substantial losses in distribution for this raptor across the southern edge of its range.

AB Multilevel regression mixtures involving both discrete latent classes and continuous random effects are an increasingly popular approach for accommodating nested data structures. However, their application has outpaced the development of effect size measures to aid model interpretation. In response, we provide a general framework of R-squared measures for multilevel regression mixtures with random effects as well as either classes only at level-1 (L1MIX), or classes only at level-2 (L2MIX), or classes at both levels (L1L2MIX). This work extends and unites a previous suite of R-squared measures for multilevel mixtures with latent classes but no random effects (Rights & Sterba, 2018) and a suite of R-squared measures for multilevel models with random effects but no latent classes (Rights & Sterba, 2019).The general framework provided here includes total and class-specific measures that each allow the researcher to distinguish among distinct sources of explained variance in the fitted model. We provide software for implementing these measures and provide two illustrative empirical examples.

AB Aim: Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a free Web-based spatial analysis platform that requires only a web browser and an Internet connection to programmatically access and analyse data from its multi-petabyte catalog of regularly updated satellite imagery (e.g. MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel) and other geospatial datasets. The high computing capacity of GEE can make computationally demanding analyses more accessible to researchers and practitioners, especially those with limited access to advanced computational resources. Here, we present a workflow in GEE to fit species distribution models, offering direct access to a multi-petabyte catalog of raster products to obtain estimates of habitat suitability.
   Innovation: We implemented a workflow for species distribution modelling in GEE that includes importing species occurrence data into the GEE platform, selecting and preparing predictor variables, and performing model fitting with spatial or temporal split-block cross-validation techniques. We present three case studies that demonstrate: (i) a baseline SDM workflow that produces informative model predictions, (ii) a workflow that accounts for temporal variability in predictor variables to study changes in habitat suitability over time and (iii) a complex and computationally demanding analysis incorporating thousands of satellite images for modelling habitat suitability at high spatial resolution.
   Main Conclusions: Our SDM workflow allows users to benefit from the high speed and performance of GEE without the need for significant computing infrastructure. This workflow may be especially beneficial to researchers in countries where computing power is limited, as SDMs frequently require the download, storage and processing of large raster datasets. We also discuss key limitations of implementing SDMs in GEE, such as user memory limits and the lack of high-level functions. We include a step-by-step guide for the general model workflow and for each of the case studies presented to facilitate its implementation.

AB The authors use US Breeding Bird Survey data to quantify the losses and gains in bird species richness that have not yet been realized owing to ecological time lags following past land use changes.
   Species extinctions and colonizations in response to land cover change often occur with time lags rather than instantaneously, leading to extinction debts and colonization credits. These debts and credits can lead to erroneous predictions of future biodiversity. Recent attempts to measure debts and credits have been limited to small geographical areas and have not considered multiple land cover types, or the directionality of land cover change. Here we quantify the relative contribution of past and current landscapes on the current effective number of species of 2,880 US bird communities, explicitly measuring the response of biodiversity to increases and decreases in five land cover types. We find that the current effective number of species is still largely explained by the past landscape composition (legacy effect), depending on the type, magnitude and directionality of recent land cover change. This legacy effect leads to widespread extinction debts and colonization credits. Specifically, we reveal debts across 52% of the United States, particularly in recently urbanized areas, and colonization credits in the remaining 48%, which are primarily associated with grassland decrease. We conclude that biodiversity policy targets risk becoming rapidly obsolete unless past landscapes are considered and debts and credits accounted for.

AB Climate change is one of the main drivers of species extinction in the twentyfirst-century. Here, we (1) quantify potential changes in species' bioclimatic area of habitat (BAH) of 135 native potential agroforestry species from the Brazilian flora, using two different climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) and dispersal scenarios, where species have no ability to disperse and reach new areas (non-dispersal) and where species can migrate within the estimated BAH (full dispersal) for 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. We then (2) assess the preliminary conservation status of each species based on IUCN criteria. Current and future potential habitats for species were predicted using MaxEnt, a machine-learning algorithm used to estimate species' probability distribution. Future climate is predicted to trigger a mean decline in BAH between 38.5-56.3% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 22.3-41.9% under the full dispersal scenario for 135 native potential agroforestry species. Additionally, we found that only 4.3% of the studied species could be threatened under the IUCN Red List criteria B1 and B2. However, when considering the predicted quantitative habitat loss due to climate change (A3c criterion) the percentages increased between 68.8-84.4% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 40.7-64.4% under the full dispersal scenario. To lessen such threats, we argue that encouraging the use of these species in rural and peri-urban agroecosystems are promising, complementary strategies for their long-term conservation.

AB Nitrogen deposition is recognized as one of the major threats to the ecosystem function of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). However, few studies have documented the gradient responses of plant species, functional groups, and communities in alpine grassland ecosystems to various levels of N deposition on the QTP. We applied eight linear mixed-effect models combing acidification, eutrophication, and phosphorus availability to explore if the responses of functional traits (particularly plant height and specific leaf area) of plants from dominant species to functional groups and whole communities in different types of grassland to nitrogen deposition were consistent with the same or different models. We found that the specific leaf area of Stipa capillata, non-forb, and community-weighted mean value in the alpine steppe were synchronous and related to acidification with nitrogen addition; the height of Stipa capillata, non-forb, and community-weighted mean value in the alpine steppe was synchronous and related to acidification, eutrophication, and phosphorus availability with nitrogen addition; the height and specific leaf area of Elymus breviaristatus to functional groups and community-weighted mean value in cultivated grasslands (CGs) were synchronous and related to acidification, eutrophication, and phosphorus availability with nitrogen addition. Most of the responses of functional traits of plants to acidification, eutrophication, and phosphorus availability associated with nitrogen deposition in the alpine steppe and the CG were synchronous, while only the response of the specific leaf area of forb functional groups to eutrophication associated with N deposition in the alpine steppe was asynchronous.

AB Developing economically viable, scalable, and sustainable technologies for the conversion of lignocellulosic polysaccharides to liquid fuels is widely seen as a centerpiece of the global bioeconomy, and a key part of a multi-pronged approach to achieve carbon neutrality. Here we identify technology challenges and opportunities to achieve this promise. An overview of feedstocks, processes and products indicates that (1) biorefining at a scale sufficient to meaningfully impact climate change will likely involve fuels as the primary products, chemicals and biomaterials as co-products, and lignocellulose as the preferred feedstock; (2) microbial processing of cellulosic biomass will likely occur in the presence of solids, rather than involving solids-free sugar syrups, giving rise to challenges and constraints distinctive to lignocellulose; (3) anaerobic processing involves much lower costs than aerobic processing, making it more promising for fuel production; and (4) anaerobic production at high yields and broth titers has to date been reported only for molecules with <= 4 carbons. Some anaerobic bacteria are substantially more effective at polysaccharide deconstruction than aerobic fungi. Processes based on these microbes have great potential for cost reduction but require substantial research-driven advances. A mechanistic, functional group approach to product tolerance and inhibition is presented, separation technologies applicable to different product classes are surveyed, and perspectives are offered on opportunities to decrease product inhibition and the cost of product recovery. Pathways and research opportunities are considered for chemo-catalytic conversion of anaerobic fermentation products to larger fuel molecules. Fuel properties are considered for a broad range of biologically-derived products in relation to their suitability for various transport applications. Strategic perspectives are presented drawing on these diverse topics and insights. For multiple compounding reasons, features of small molecules make it less expensive to produce them biologically compared to large molecules, and this is particularly true for production from lignocellulose. Yet the fuels the world would most value producing from lignocellulosic biomass to address climate stabilization are large molecules compatible with heavy-duty, difficult-to-electrify transport applications. Hybrid processes wherein lignocellulose is converted biologically to small molecule intermediates and then converted chemo-catalytically to larger fuel molecules are a promising approach to reconciling this discrepancy.

AB Polyploid speciation has played an important role in evolutionary history across the tree of life, yet there remain large gaps in our understanding of how polyploid species form and persist. Although systematic studies have been conducted in numerous polyploid complexes, recent advances in sequencing technology have demonstrated that conclusions from data-limited studies may be spurious and misleading. The North American gray treefrog complex, consisting of the diploid Hyla chrysoscelis and the tetraploid H. versicolor, has long been used as a model system in a variety of biological fields, yet all taxonomic studies to date were conducted with only a few loci from nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Here, we utilized anchored hybrid enrichment and high-throughput sequencing to capture hundreds of loci along with whole mitochondrial genomes to investigate the evolutionary history of this complex. We used several phylogenetic and population genetic methods, including coalescent simulations and testing of polyploid speciation models with approximate Bayesian computation, to determine that H. versicolor was most likely formed via autopolyploidization from a now extinct lineage of H. chrysoscelis. We also uncovered evidence of significant hybridization between diploids and tetraploids where they co-occur, and show that historical hybridization between these groups led to the re-formation of distinct polyploid lineages following the initial whole-genome duplication event. Our study indicates that a wide variety of methods and explicit model testing of polyploid histories can greatly facilitate efforts to uncover the evolutionary history of polyploid complexes.

AB Tree architecture shows large genotypic variability, but how this affects water-deficit responses is poorly understood. To assess the possibility of reaching ideotypes with adequate combinations of architectural and functional traits in the face of climate change, we combined high-throughput field phenotyping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on an apple tree (Malus domestica) core-collection. We used terrestrial light detection and ranging (T-LiDAR) scanning and airborne multispectral and thermal imagery to monitor tree architecture, canopy shape, light interception, vegetation indices and transpiration on 241 apple cultivars submitted to progressive field soil drying. GWAS was performed with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-by-SNP and multi-SNP methods. Large phenotypic and genetic variability was observed for all traits examined within the collection, especially canopy surface temperature in both well-watered and water deficit conditions, suggesting control of water loss was largely genotype-dependent. Robust genomic associations revealed independent genetic control for the architectural and functional traits. Screening associated genomic regions revealed candidate genes involved in relevant pathways for each trait. We show that multiple allelic combinations exist for all studied traits within this collection. This opens promising avenues to jointly optimize tree architecture, light interception and water use in breeding strategies. Genotypes carrying favourable alleles depending on environmental scenarios and production objectives could thus be targeted.

AB Epichloid endophytic fungi, vertically transmitted symbionts of grasses, can increase plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. Our aim was to identify ecophysiological mechanisms by which the endophyte Epichloe occultans confers drought tolerance to the annual grass Lolium multiflorum Lam. Endophyte-associated or endophyte-free plants were either well-watered or subjected to water deficit. We evaluated plant biomass, root length and nitrogen concentration, and we assessed intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) and its components net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, by carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of shoot tissues. Endophyte-free plants produced more biomass than endophyte-associated ones at field capacity, while water deficit strongly reduced endophyte-free plants biomass. As a result, both types of plants produced similar biomass under water restriction. Based on oxygen isotope composition of plant cellulose, stomatal conductance decreased with water deficit in both endophyte-associated and endophyte-free plants. Meanwhile, carbon isotope composition indicated that iWUE increased with water deficit only in endophyte-associated plants. Thus, the isotope data indicated that net photosynthesis decreased more strongly in endophyte-free plants under water deficit. Additionally, endophyte presence reduced root length but increased its hydraulic conductivity. In conclusion, endophytic fungi confer drought tolerance to the host grass by adjusting shoot and root physiology.

   complementizer; asyndetic complementation; semantic integration; clause

AB This paper examines a distinctive syntactic feature of (pre)classical Spanish: asyndetic complementation (without complementizer que 'that'). While many authors regard this construction as a stylistic variant which eventually declined (i.a., Giron 2005), so far no exhaustive morphosyntactic study of the phenomenon has been presented, as previous works either have focused on only one predicate (Blas Arroyo & Porcar Miralles 2016, 2018) or do not contain detailed quantitative data (Pountain 2015). Using evidence from richly annotated corpus data spanning between 1400 and 1799 (GITHE 2015), we adopt the diachronic probabilistic grammar framework (Szmrecsanyi 2013) by means of multifactorial statistical models, to identify the language-internal probabilistic constraints that regulated the que/o alternation, and to explore whether their relevance changed diachronically. The results indicate that asyndetic complementation is promoted in the domain of manipulation verbs (e.g., requests and commands) and, more generally, by the semantic and syntactic integration of events (Givon 2001a). Diachronically we observe that some of the effects strengthened over time, suggesting a syntactic specialization process, which might have eventually led to the restricted and marked use of the asyndeton in Modern Spanish.

AB Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important enzyme that serves as the first line of defense in the plant antioxidant system and removes reactive oxygen species (ROS) under adverse conditions. The SOD protein family is widely distributed in the plant kingdom and plays a significant role in plant growth and development. However, the comprehensive analysis of the SOD gene family has not been conducted in Cucurbitaceae. Subsequently, 43 SOD genes were identified from Cucurbitaceae species [Citrullus lanatus (watermelon), Cucurbita pepo (zucchini), Cucumis sativus (cucumber), Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd), Cucumis melo (melon)]. According to evolutionary analysis, SOD genes were divided into eight subfamilies (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII). The gene structure analysis exhibited that the SOD gene family had comparatively preserved exon/intron assembly and motif as well. Phylogenetic and structural analysis revealed the functional divergence of Cucurbitaceae SOD gene family. Furthermore, microRNAs 6 miRNAs were predicted targeting 3 LsiSOD genes. Gene ontology annotation outcomes confirm the role of LsiSODs under different stress stimuli, cellular oxidant detoxification processes, metal ion binding activities, SOD activity, and different cellular components. Promoter regions of the SOD family revealed that most cis-elements were involved in plant development, stress response, and plant hormones. Evaluation of the gene expression showed that most SOD genes were expressed in different tissues (root, flower, fruit, stem, and leaf). Finally, the expression profiles of eight LsiSOD genes analyzed by qRT-PCR suggested that these genetic reserves responded to drought, saline, heat, and cold stress. These findings laid the foundation for further study of the role of the SOD gene family in Cucurbitaceae. Also, they provided the potential for its use in the genetic improvement of Cucurbitaceae.

AB Knowledge on the potential suitability of tree species to the site is very important for forest management planning. Natural forest distribution provides a good reference for afforestation and forest restoration. In this study, we developed species distribution model (SDM) for 16 major tree species with 2,825 permanent sample plots with natural origin from Chinese National Forest Inventory data collected in Jilin Province using the Maxent model. Three types of environmental factors including bioclimate, soil and topography with a total of 33 variables were tested as the input. The values of area under the curve (AUC, one of the receiver operating characteristics of the Maxent model) in the training and test datasets were between 0.784 and 0.968, indicating that the prediction results were quite reliable. The environmental factors affecting the distribution of species were ranked in terms of their importance to the species distribution. Generally, the climatic factors had the greatest contribution, which included mean diurnal range, annual mean temperature, temperature annual range, and iosthermality. But the main environmental factors varied with tree species. Distribution suitability maps under current (1950 - 2000) and future climate scenarios (CCSM4-RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 during 2050) were produced for 16 major tree species in Jilin Province using the model developed. The predicted current and future ranges of habitat suitability of the 16 tree species are likely to be positively and negatively affected by future climate. Seven tree species were found to benefit from future climate including Betula costata, Fraxinus mandshurica, Juglans mandshurica, Phellodendron amurense, Populus ussuriensis, Quercus mongolica and Ulmus pumila; five tree species will experience decline in their suitable habitat including B. platyphylla, Tilia mongolica, Picea asperata, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus koraiensis; and four (Salix koreensis, Abies fabri, Pinus densiflora and Larix olgensis) showed the inconsistency under RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 scenarios. The maps of the habitat suitability can be used as a basis for afforestation and forest restoration in northeastern China. The SDMs could be a potential tool for forest management planning.

AB In tropical forests, large, old trees (LOTs) can be considered keystone structures for provisioning unique habitats such as decaying wood, roots, cavities, and epiphytes, including those that hold water (phytotelmata). These habitats may also be stratified in vertical space, for example, root structures occur at ground level and below, whereas epiphytes occur above-ground. Canopy habitat is utilized by a diversity of amphibians, but canopy habitat may only be viable in the wet season when epiphytes and surfaces are sufficiently saturated. Here, we examine how the provisioning of microhabitats and structures by LOTs influence the horizontal, vertical, and seasonal distribution patterns of phytotelmata-breeding poison frogs. We conducted ground-to-canopy surveys over 4 years, constituting 6 seasons, in Panama and used mark-recapture techniques on a population of the yellow-bellied poison frog, Andinobates fulguritus. We found that A. fulguritus migrated vertically, tracking seasonal rainfall, and displayed strong philopatry to individual trees. Furthermore, A. fulguritus almost exclusively inhabited the largest trees at the study location, which provided disproportionately high-quality microhabitats and epiphytes compared to other trees. LOTs, and specifically Anacardium excelsum at our site, appear to serve as keystone structures with high conservation value due to their provisioning of unique habitats. We conclude that the distribution of A. fulguritus is defined vertically by the stratification of arboreal microhabitat resources, horizontally by the presence of LOTs providing the resources, and temporally by the seasonal viability of the resources.

AB Environmental changes threaten insect pollinators, creating risks for agriculture and ecosystem stability. Despite their importance, we know little about how wild insects respond to environmental pressures. To understand the genomic bases of adaptation in an ecologically important pollinator, we analyzed genomes of Bombus terrestris bumblebees collected across Great Britain. We reveal extensive genetic diversity within this population, and strong signatures of recent adaptation throughout the genome affecting key processes including neurobiology and wing development. We also discover unusual features of the genome, including a region containing 53 genes that lacks genetic diversity in many bee species, and a horizontal gene transfer from a Wolbachia bacteria. Overall, the genetic diversity we observe and how it is distributed throughout the genome and the population should support the resilience of this important pollinator species to ongoing and future selective pressures. Applying our approach to more species should help understand how they can differ in their adaptive potential, and to develop conservation strategies for those most at risk.

AB Many terrestrial biosphere models depend on an understanding of the relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthesis. However, unlike the measurement of photosynthetic parameters, such as the maximum carboxylation capacity, where standard methods (e.g., CO2 response or AC(i) curves) are widely accepted, a consensus method for empirically measuring parameters representing stomatal response has not yet emerged. Most models of stomatal response to environment represent stomatal conductance as being bounded by a lower intercept parameter (g(0)), and linearly scaled based on a multivariate term described by the stomatal slope parameter (g(1)). Here we employ the widely used Unified Stomatal Optimization model, to test whether g(1) and g(0) parameters are impacted by the choice of measurement method, either on an intact branch or a cut branch segment stored in water. We measured paired stomatal response curves on intact and excised branches of a hybrid poplar clone (Populus deltoides Bartr. x Populus nigra L. OP367), measured twice over a diurnal period. We found that predawn branch excision did not significantly affect measured g(0) and g(1) when measured within 4 h of excision. Measurement in the afternoon resulted in significantly higher values of g(1) and lower values of g(0), with values changing by 55% and 56%, respectively. Excision combined with afternoon measurement resulted in a marked effect on parameter estimates, with g(1) increasing 89% from morning to afternoon and a 25% lower g(1) for cut branches than those measured in situ. We also show that in hybrid poplar the differences in parameter estimates obtained from plants measured under different conditions can directly impact models of canopy function, reducing modeled transpiration by 18% over a simulated 12.5-h period. Although these results are only for a single isohydric woody species, our findings suggest that stomatal optimality parameters may not remain constant throughout the day.

AB Aquaculture is a critical food source for the world's growing population, producing 52% of the aquatic animal products consumed. Marine aquaculture (mariculture) generates 37.5% of this production and 97% of the world's seaweed harvest. Mariculture products may offer a climate-friendly, high-protein food source, because they often have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints than do the equivalent products farmed on land. However, sustainable intensification of low-emissions mariculture is key to maintaining a low GHG footprint as production scales up to meet future demand. We examine the major GHG sources and carbon sinks associated with fed finfish, macroalgae and bivalve mariculture, and the factors influencing variability across sectors. We highlight knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for GHG emissions reductions and carbon storage, including accounting for interactions between mariculture operations and surrounding marine ecosystems. By linking the provision of maricultured products to GHG abatement opportunities, we can advance climate-friendly practices that generate sustainable environmental, social, and economic outcomes.

AB Sexual displays can be energetically taxing, power-limited tests of endurance that favour the vigorous. Therefore, these displays may reliably indicate the ability to pay the energetic costs of sustained motor performance. Field cricket calling song involves the repeated mechanical movement of wings to produce pulses of sound grouped into species-specific chirp patterns, often sustained for long periods across nights. We quantified variation and repeatability of cricket calling song phenotypes and determined how age and body size impacted this variation. All our experiments involved tightly controlled signalling environments, but there was a great deal of interindividual variation in behaviour. Although there were species differences, most traits associated with signalling vigour exhibited mean level declines with age and conditional repeatability (individual*age interactions). These results suggest that males differing in quality may differ in their ability to buffer themselves against age-related changes in signalling vigour. Furthermore, the repeatability of calling traits itself changed with age, declining slightly in some species but increasing in others. We also challenged motor performance by altering dietary carbohydrate and protein; we predicted that increased carbohydrate would enhance signalling vigour and increased protein would decrease it. Although diet influenced the probability of calling and time spent calling in a predictable manner, these effects were not profound. Our findings confirm the scope for sexual selection to act on motor performance and point to ways in which constraints and trade-offs may yield variation within and among species in how vigour is signalled.

This is especially the case when disturbances are localized within a population's spatial range, as variation in habitat use within a population can drastically alter the distribution of impacts. Here, we illustrate the potential for multilevel binomial models to generate spatial networks from capture-recapture data, a common data source used in wildlife studies to monitor population dynamics and habitat use. These spatial networks capture which regions of a population's spatial distribution share similar/dissimilar individual usage patterns, and can be especially useful for detecting structured habitat use within the population's spatial range. Using simulations and 18 years of capture-recapture data from St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE) beluga, we show that this approach can successfully estimate the magnitude of similarities/dissimilarities in individual usage patterns across sectors, and identify sectors that share similar individual usage patterns that differ from other sectors, that is, structured habitat use. In the case of SLE beluga, this method identified multiple clusters of individuals, each preferentially using restricted areas within their summer range of the SLE. Multilevel binomial models can be effective at estimating spatial structure in habitat use within wildlife populations sampled by capture-recapture of individuals, and can be especially useful when sampling effort is not evenly distributed. Our finding of a structured habitat use within the SLE beluga summer range has direct implications for estimating individual exposures to localized stressors, such as underwater noise from shipping or other activities.

AB Despite beetles (Coleoptera) representing most existing animal species, the ecological and biogeographical factors shaping their distribution are still unclear in many regions. We implemented state-of-the-art ecological niche models (ENMs) and niche overlap analysis to investigate climate-occurrence patterns for five flea beetle species of the genus Chaetocnema in South Africa (C. brincki, C. danielssoni, C. darwini, C. gahani, and C. natalensis). ENMs were fitted through Maxent and Random Forests, testing various parameterizations. For each species, tuned ENMs attaining good discrimination on spatially independent test data were selected to predict suitability across the study region and individuate its main climatic drivers. Percentage coverage of climatically suitable areas by seventeen Afrotropical vegetation formations was also computed. Predicted suitable areas do not extend far away from known presence localities, except for C. brincki and C. gahani in north-eastern South Africa. Temperate grasslands and shrublands cover most of suitable areas for C. brincki and C. gahani, along with warm temperate forests, as well as for C. danielssoni, in this case being followed by tropical flooded and swamp forests. Climatic suitability for C. darwini mainly relates to the Mediterranean grasslands and scrublands of the southern coastal region, while suitable areas for C. natalensis encompass various vegetation formations, coherently with its wide distribution. The environmental niche of C. danielssoni significantly overlaps with those of the wide-ranging C. darwini and C. natalensis, suggesting that historical factors, rather than low climatic tolerance, has determined its restricted distribution in the Western Cape Province. Maxent and Random Forests were confirmed to be of great help in disentangling the environment-occurrence relationships and in predicting suitability for the target species outside their known range, but they need to be properly tuned to perform at their best.

AB The influence of climate on the distribution of taxa has been extensively investigated in the last two decades through Habitat Suitability Models (HSMs). In this context, the Worldclim database represents an invaluable data source as it provides worldwide climate surfaces for both historical and future time horizons. Thousands of HSMs-based papers have been published taking advantage of Worldclim 1.4, the first online version of this repository. In 2017, Worldclim 2.1 was released. Here, we evaluated spatially explicit prediction mismatch at continental scale, focusing on Europe, between HSMs fitted using climate surfaces from the two Worldclim versions (between-version differences). To this aim, we simulated occurrence probability and presence-absence across Europe of four virtual species (VS) with differing climate-occurrence relationships. For each VS, we fitted HSMs upon uncorrelated bioclimatic variables derived from each Worldclim version at three grid resolutions. For each factor combination, HSMs attaining sufficient discrimination performance on spatially independent test data were projected across Europe under current conditions and various future scenarios, and importance scores of the single variables were computed. HSMs failed in accurately retrieving the simulated climate-occurrence relationships for the climate-tolerant VS and the one occurring under a narrow combination of climatic conditions. Under current climate, noticeable between-version prediction mismatch emerged across most of Europe for these two VSs, whose simulated suitability mainly depended upon diurnal or yearly variability in temperature; differently, between-version differences were more clustered toward areas showing extreme values, like mountainous massifs or southern regions, for VSs responding to average temperature and precipitation trends. Under future climate, the chosen emission scenarios and Global Climate Models did not evidently influence between-version prediction discrepancies, while grid resolution synergistically interacted with VSs' niche characteristics in determining extent of such differences. Our findings could help in re-evaluating previous biodiversity-related works relying on geographical predictions from Worldclim-based HSMs.

AB Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services for urban dwellers. However, forest water use for these benefits has become one of the critical concerns in dryland regions where water is limited. Negative forest water use impacts could be reduced by selecting tree species with low rates of transpiration. However, the possible changes of urban tree transpiration and its biophysical controls are still unclear. This study monitored the sap flow of a 58-year-old Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) plantation in a semiarid urban environment of northern China. Soil moisture played an important role in stand transpiration (E-c). E-c had a strong positive relationship with vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and solar radiation (R-s) when soil water was sufficient. In addition, the sensitivity of leaf stomata to VPD was not related to leaf and branch water potential. Under soil water stress, E-c was significantly reduced by 63.1% (p < 0.001) and was weakly related to VPD and R-s. Canopy conductance (g(c)) was reduced (p < 0.001) by 74.3% due to leaf stomatal closure, and the sensitivity of leaf stomata to VPD was significantly increased (p < 0.05) with increasing leaf and branch water potential. Wind speed had no significant effects on E-c. P. tabulaeformis tended to be isohydric with a relatively constant midday leaf water potential (i.e. -2.46 to -2.92 MPa) and strong stomatal regulation as a function of soil water stress. However, slopes (0.53-0.56) of the linear relationship between m (dg(c)/dlnVPD) and reference canopy conductance were significantly lower than the widely recognized 0.6 (p < 0.001). Therefore, urban tree transpiration drivers and forest impacts need to be clarified to better understand the proper tradeoff between water consumption and ecological services for urban areas.

AB Simple Summary Fish present astonishing diversity, comprising more species than the combined total of all other vertebrates. Here, we integrated cytogenetic and genomic data to investigate how the evolution of multiple sex chromosomes together with allopatry is linked to genetic diversity and speciation in the fish species Erythrinus erythrinus. We hypothesized that the presence of multiple sex chromosomes has contributed to the genetic differentiation of populations, which could have potentially accelerated speciation. Diversity found in Neotropical freshwater fish is remarkable. It can even hinder a proper delimitation of many species, with the wolf fish Erythrinus erythrinus (Teleostei, Characiformes) being a notable example. This nominal species shows remarkable intra-specific variation, with extensive karyotype diversity found among populations in terms of different diploid chromosome numbers (2n), karyotype compositions and sex chromosome systems. Here, we analyzed three distinct populations (one of them cytogenetically investigated for the first time) that differed in terms of their chromosomal features (termed karyomorphs) and by the presence or absence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. We combined cytogenetics with genomic approaches to investigate how the evolution of multiple sex chromosomes together with allopatry is linked to genetic diversity and speciation. The results indicated the presence of high genetic differentiation among populations both from cytogenetic and genomic aspects, with long-distance allopatry potentially being the main agent of genetic divergence. One population showed a neo-X1X2Y sexual chromosome system and we hypothesize that this system is associated with enhanced inter-population genetic differentiation which could have potentially accelerated speciation compared to the effect of allopatry alone.

AB The degradation of soil fertility and quality due to rapid industrialization and human activities has stimulated interest in the rehabilitation of low-fertility soils to sustainably improve crop yield. In this regard, biochar has emerged as an effective multi-beneficial additive that can be used as a medium for the amelioration of soil properties and plant growth. The current review highlights the methods and conditions for biochar production and the effects of pyrolysis temperature, feedstock type, and retention time on the physicochemical properties of biochar. We also discuss the impact of biochar as a soil amendment with respect to enhancing soil physical (e.g., surface area, porosity, ion exchange, and water-holding capacity) and chemical (e.g., pH, nutrient exchange, functional groups, and carbon sequestration) properties, improving the soil microbiome for increased plant nutrient uptake and growth, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing infectious diseases in plants, and facilitating the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils. The possible mechanisms for biochar-induced amelioration of soil and plant characteristics are also described, and we consider the challenges associated with biochar utilization. The findings discussed in this review support the feasibility of expending the application of biochar to improve degraded soils in industrial and saline-alkali regions, thereby increasing the usable amount of cultivated soil. Future research should include long-term field experiments and studies on biochar production and environmental risk management to optimize biochar performance for specific soil remediation purposes.

AB Germany 2050: For the first time Germany reached a balance between its sources of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere and newly created anthropogenic sinks. This backcasting study presents a fictional future in which this goal was achieved by avoiding (similar to 645 Mt CO2), reducing (similar to 50 Mt CO2) and removing (similar to 60 Mt CO2) carbon emissions. This meant substantial transformation of the energy system, increasing energy efficiency, sector coupling, and electrification, energy storage solutions including synthetic energy carriers, sector-specific solutions for industry, transport, and agriculture, as well as natural-sink enhancement and technological carbon dioxide options. All of the above was necessary to achieve a net-zero CO2 system for Germany by 2050.
   Plain Language Summary Here a net-zero-2050 Germany is envisioned by combining analysis from an energy-system model with insights into approaches that allow for a higher carbon circularity in the German system, and first results from assessments of national carbon dioxide removal potentials. A back-casting perspective is applied on how net-zero Germany could look like in 2050. We are looking back from 2050, and analyzing how Germany for the first time reached a balance between its sources of CO2 to the atmosphere and the anthropogenic sinks created. This would consider full decarbonization in the entire energy sector and being entirely emission-free by 2050 within three priorities identified as being the most useful strategies for achieving net-zero: (a) Avoiding- (b) Reducing- (c) Removing emissions. This work is a collaboration of interdisciplinary scientists with the Net-Zero-2050 cluster of the Helmholtz Climate Initiative HI-CAM.

AB Nurseries play an important role providing trees for a variety of managed environments including urban forests. The diversity of urban forests and forest restoration projects are influenced by nursery species availability, and as such, there is a need to better understand tree species diversity at nurseries. We collected tree species lists from 75 nurseries throughout New Zealand, which were used to describe species richness (alpha diversity) and to examine similarity in the composition of native and non-native species assemblages among nurseries (beta diversity) at three spatial scales: island, region, city. Together, the nurseries grew 863 species, 174 of which were native to New Zealand, from 312 genera and 130 families. Nurseries grew significantly more non-native species (mu = 63.5, sigma = 60.6) than native species on average (mu = 31.7, sigma = 22.7) (t = 2.99, df = 48.45, p = 0.004). Beta diversity for native and non-native tree species were only significantly different at the scale of cities or regions, not at the larger scale of islands. Few species were grown in all cities or all regions and the majority of those that were common were native species. In contrast, non-native species dominated the unique species at all spatial scales, (i.e., species uniquely grown in one city, region, or island). By quantifying tree species diversity in New Zealand's nurseries, this research provides a basis to better understand the influence that nurseries have on urban and peri-urban tree diversity, and ultimately how that diversity impacts resilience and the provision of ecosystem services.

AB Reintroductions may produce populations that suffer from decreasing genetic diversity due to isolation, genetic drift and inbreeding if not assisted by careful management. To assess the genetic outcomes of reintroductions in large carnivores, we used the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) as a case study, which was the subject of several reintroduction attempts over the last 50 years. Although some restocking actions initially appeared successful, lynx recovery has stagnated in recent years. To reveal potential genetic causes of slow lynx recovery in Europe, we examined genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity and inbreeding using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all six successfully reintroduced populations in central Europe, as well as twelve natural populations across Europe and Asia. All reintroduced populations showed lower genetic diversity and elevated levels of inbreeding compared to source and other natural populations. Recent inbreeding is prevalent in all reintroduced populations with varying degrees of severity; the most severe cases are those with the lowest number of founding individuals. Interestingly, we found evidence of lower genetic diversity and recent inbreeding in the source population for five reintroduced populations, begging the question if individuals taken from these source populations can safeguard sufficient genetic diversity for future reintroductions. Given the observed genetic consequences, we advocate for standardized regular genomic assessment of source and target populations as well as individuals prior to release. Our study provides compelling evidence for the serious consequences of founder population size on the genetic diversity of reintroduced large carnivore populations, which has broad implications for their conservation.

AB The inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance, which reduces their efficacy. The education of undergraduates is likely to influence their practices. Assessing awareness is critical in the general effort to confront the spread of antibiotic resistance. This cross-sectional investigation was carried out using the questionnaire "Antibiotic resistance: Multi-country public awareness" developed by the World Health Organization. Students from different backgrounds at the Central University participated in the study (n = 733). The survey comprised five sections: demographics, knowledge, usage, sources of information, and attitudes. The rate of correct answers was 64.88%; differences were detected between programs of study (p < 0.001); effect size analysis showed that these differences cannot be considered large. Individuals from applied sciences scored higher than their counterparts from social studies. Mostly, interviewees were knowledgeable about usage, but mistakenly associated antibiotics with conditions such as cold/flu or viral illnesses; also, they associated antibiotic resistance with the patient and not with bacteria. Despite these misconceptions, positive attitudes were registered overall, and students generally adhered to common practices. They cited doctors/nurses and teachers as sources of information. As a consequence, it is recommended to develop courses that address deficient knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance, especially for individuals affiliated to social disciplines.

AB Rhodanobacter species dominate in the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) subsurface environments contaminated with acids, nitrate, metal radionuclides, and other heavy metals. To uncover the genomic features underlying adaptations to these mixed-waste environments and to guide genetic tool development, we sequenced the whole genomes of eight Rhodanobacter strains isolated from the ORR site. The genome sizes ranged from 3.9 to 4.2 Mb harboring 3,695 to 4,035 protein-coding genes and GC contents approximately 67%. Seven strains were classified as R. denitrificans and one strain, FW510-R12, as R. thiooxydans based on full length 16S rRNA sequences. According to gene annotation, the top two Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COGs) with high pan-genome expansion rates (Pan/Core gene ratio) were "replication, recombination and repair" and "defense mechanisms." The denitrifying genes had high DNA homologies except the predicted protein structure variances in NosZ. In contrast, heavy metal resistance genes were diverse with between 7 to 34% of them were located in genomic islands, and these results suggested origins from horizontal gene transfer. Analysis of the methylation patterns in four strains revealed the unique 5mC methylation motifs. Most orthologs (78%) had ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) less than one when compared to the type strain 2APBS1, suggesting the prevalence of negative selection. Overall, the results provide evidence for the important roles of horizontal gene transfer and negative selection in genomic adaptation at the contaminated field site. The complex restriction-modification system genes and the unique methylation motifs in Rhodanobacter strains suggest the potential recalcitrance to genetic manipulation.
   IMPORTANCE Despite the dominance of Rhodanobacter species in the subsurface of the contaminated Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) site, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying their adaptions to the various stressors present at ORR. Recently, multiple Rhodanobacter strains have been isolated from the ORR groundwater samples from several wells with varying geochemical properties. Using Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore sequencing platforms, we obtained the whole genome sequences of eight Rhodanobacter strains. Comparison of the whole genomes demonstrated the genetic diversity, and analysis of the long nanopore reads revealed the heterogeneity of methylation patterns in strains isolated from the same well. Although all strains contained a complete set of denitrifying genes, the predicted tertiary structures of NosZ differed. The sequence comparison results demonstrate the important roles of horizontal gene transfer and negative selection in adaptation. In addition, these strains may be recalcitrant to genetic manipulation due to the complex restriction-modification systems and methylations.

AB Anthropogenic land transformation is a consequence of human population growth and the associated agricultural, residential, and industrial needs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of anthropogenic activity and human-mediated land transformation on capture/recapture frequencies, species richness, and diversity of native small mammal community assemblages in the Magaliesberg Biosphere, North West province, South Africa. Five anthropogenically transformed land-use types were investigated: an animal rehabilitation and ecotourism center, an agricultural farmstead, a residential farmstead, a mine-adjacent agricultural farmstead, and a protected nature conservancy. We used live traps to sample small mammals during the dry and wet seasons over three consecutive years and compared population numbers and species composition across study sites and seasons. Capture/recapture frequencies differed significantly between sites and seasons, with the highest capture frequencies recorded at the agricultural and residential farmsteads. Species richness and diversity were highest at the residential and mine-adjacent farmsteads, both of which experienced intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance throughout the sampling period. The study shows that while natural and protected landscapes with low levels of disturbance are preferred, transformed landscapes can also be managed effectively to benefit native small mammal populations by regulating the frequency and intensity of human-mediated activities.

AB Migraine is one of the leading causes of years lived with disability and considered to be a major global health concern. Pharmacological preventive treatment often causes side effects that limit the adherence to longer-term treatment regimens. Both experimental and clinical evidence suggests that positive expectations can modulate pain and analgesic treatment effects. However, the role of expectations in migraine prophylactic treatment has not systematically been investigated. Here, we examined the influence of treatment expectation before commencing pharmacological preventive treatment on its efficacy and tolerability in N = 134 episodic (30%) and chronic migraine (70%) patients in a prospective, longitudinal observational study over the course of 6 months. The migraine prophylaxis reduced the number of headache and migraine days with acceptable tolerability. Positive treatment expectation was associated with a generally lower number of headache and migraine days and a stronger reduction in headache days over the course of the treatment in chronic but not in episodic migraine patients. Moreover, patients with prior treatment showed a stronger reduction in headache days with higher expectation as compared to patients without prior experience. Our results underscore the relevance of further exploring the role of treatment expectation and its systematic modulation in patients with migraine and other pain conditions.

AB Wetland bird species have been declining in population size worldwide as climate warming and land-use change affect their suitable habitats. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to predict changes in range dynamics for 64 non-passerine wetland birds breeding in Europe, including range size, position of centroid, and margins. We fitted the SDMs with data collected for the first European Breeding Bird Atlas and climate and land-use data to predict distributional changes over a century (the 1970s-2070s). The predicted annual changes were then compared to observed annual changes in range size and range centroid over a time period of 30 years using data from the second European Breeding Bird Atlas. Our models successfully predicted ca. 75% of the 64 bird species to contract their breeding range in the future, while the remaining species (mostly southerly breeding species) were predicted to expand their breeding ranges northward. The northern margins of southerly species and southern margins of northerly species, both, predicted to shift northward. Predicted changes in range size and shifts in range centroids were broadly positively associated with the observed changes, although some species deviated markedly from the predictions. The predicted average shift in core distributions was ca. 5 km yr(-1) towards the north (5% northeast, 45% north, and 40% northwest), compared to a slower observed average shift of ca. 3.9 km yr(-1). Predicted changes in range centroids were generally larger than observed changes, which suggests that bird distribution changes may lag behind environmental changes leading to 'climate debt'. We suggest that predictions of SDMs should be viewed as qualitative rather than quantitative outcomes, indicating that care should be taken concerning single species. Still, our results highlight the urgent need for management actions such as wetland creation and restoration to improve wetland birds' resilience to the expected environmental changes in the future.

AB Coilia grayii is the anadromous form of anchovy that is distributed in the East and South China Seas. It is a common fish species in the estuarine area of the Pearl River. Nevertheless, freshwater populations appear upstream in the Pearl River, but the migratory pathway has been mostly impeded by dam construction. Behavioral differences and constrained habitat within tributaries are suspected of promoting genetic divergence in these populations. In this study, we investigated the migratory behavior and genetic divergence of six populations of C. grayii fragmented by dams based on the otolith strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca) ratio, mitochondrial DNA, and microsatellite genotyping. All populations were in freshwater with low Sr/Ca ratios, except the estuarine population (Humen population) hatched in brackish water. Reduced nucleotide diversity corresponding to distance was observed. Populations from distant hydrological regions exhibited a decline in genetic diversity and a significant difference with the remaining populations after fitting the isolation by distance model. Pairwise fixation indices confirmed these results and moderate and significant differentiation was found between Hengxian site and downstream sites. Furthermore, STRUCTURE analyses revealed that all separated populations exhibited an admixed phylogenetic pattern except for individuals from the Hengxian locality. The upstream sites showed significantly increased resistance to gene flow from the estuarine population because of isolation by the dam. The results of the neutrality test and Bayesian skyline plots demonstrated complex demography-individuals' experienced historical expansion and partial upper-dam populations had recently undergone a colonization, forming a new genetic structure. Accordingly, this study demonstrates differences in the migration pattern and genetic differentiation of C. grayii as a consequence of demographic history and current processes (habitat fragmentation and colonization).

AB Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are crucial calcium ions (Ca2+) sensors in plants with important roles in signal transduction, plant growth, development, and stress responses. Here, we identified 24 genes encoding CDPKs in Dendrobium officinale using genome-wide analysis. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes formed four groups, with similar structures in the same group. The gene expression patterns following hormone treatments and yeast two-hybrid of homologous CDPK gene pairs with Rbohs showed differences, indicating functional divergence between homologous genes. In addition, the rapid accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and stomatal closure was observed in response to salicylic acid (SA)/jasmonic acid (JA) stress. Our data showed that CDPK9-2 and CDPK20-4 interacted with Rboh D and Rboh H, respectively, and were implicated in the generation of H2O2 and regulation of the stomatal aperture in response to salicylic acid/jasmonic acid treatment. We believe these results can provide a foundation for the functional divergence of homologous genes in D. officinale.

AB Objective Personality involves both trait and state components, personal goals serving a crucial regulatory function for the expression of personality states. The present study investigates the dynamic interplay between conscientiousness-related goals, conscientious personality states, and trait conscientiousness. Method A sample of 244 community participants responded to a baseline survey (T1), a 5-times-a-day Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) for 15 days, and a post-EMA survey (T2). Results Pre-registered multilevel analyses indicated significant contemporaneous positive and negative associations between momentary conscientious and unconscientious goals and state conscientiousness, respectively. Cross-lagged associations also emerged, with goals predicting future states of conscientiousness. A latent growth model was fitted on a subsample of participants (N = 159). Results indicated that change in trait conscientiousness from T1 to T2 was explained by growth in conscientiousness-related goals during the EMA phase, with a mediating effect of growth in state conscientiousness. Conclusions Overall, the results corroborate the importance of goals for modeling contemporaneous and cross-lagged personality dynamics, both in short and longer timeframes.

AB Genetic structure and phenotypic variation among populations are affected by both geographic distance and environmental variation across species' distributions. Understanding the relative contributions of isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE) is important for elucidating population dynamics across habitats and ecological gradients. In this study, we compared phenotypic and genetic variation among Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris) populations from 10 sites encompassing an elevational gradient from low-elevation desert scrub in Death Valley (285 a.s.l.) to high-elevation meadows in the White Mountains of the Sierra Nevada of California (greater than 3000 m a.s.l.). Using a ddRAD data set of 28,474 SNPs aligned to a high-quality reference genome, we compared genetic structure with elevational, environmental, and spatial distance to quantify how different aspects of the landscape drive genomic and phenotypic differentiation in Horned Larks. We found larger-bodied birds were associated with sites that had less seasonality and higher annual precipitation, and longer spurs occurred in soils with more clay and silt content, less sand, and finer fragments. Larks have large neo-sex chromosomes, and we found that associations with elevation and environmental variation were much stronger among neo-sex chromosomes compared to autosomes. Furthermore, we found that putative chromosomal translocations, fusions, and inversions were associated with elevation and may underlie local adaptation across an elevational gradient in Horned Larks. Our results suggest that genetic variation in Horned Larks is affected more by IBD than IBE, but specific phenotypes and genomic regions-particually on neo-sex chromosomes-bear stronger associations with the environment.

AB Synopsis For many animals, the juvenile stage of life can be particularly perilous. Once independent, immature animals must often complete the same basic survival functions as adults despite smaller body size and other growth-related limits on performance. Because, by definition, juveniles have yet to reproduce, we should expect strong selection for mechanisms to offset these ontogenetic limitations, allowing individuals to reach reproductive adulthood and maintain Darwinian fitness. We use an integrated ontogenetic dataset on morphology, locomotor performance, and longevity in wild cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus, Allen 1848) to test the hypothesis that prey animals are under selective pressure to maximize juvenile performance. We predicted that (1) juveniles would accelerate more quickly than adults, allowing them to reach adult-like escape speeds, and (2) juveniles with greater levels of performance should survive for longer durations in the wild, thus increasing their reproductive potential. Using high-speed video and force platform measurements, we quantified burst acceleration, escape speed, and mechanical power production in 38 wild-caught S. floridanus (26 juveniles, 12 adults; all rabbits >1 kg in body mass were designated to be adults, based on published growth curves and evidence of epiphyseal fusion). A subsample of 22 rabbits (15 juveniles, 7 adults) was fitted with radio-telemetry collars for documenting survivorship in the wild. We found that acceleration and escape speed peaked in the late juvenile period in S. floridanus, at an age range that coincides with a period of pronounced demographic attrition in wild populations. Differences in mass-specific mechanical power production explained similar to 75% of the variation in acceleration across the dataset, indicating that juvenile rabbits outpace adults by producing more power per unit body mass. We found a positive, though non-significant, association between peak escape speed and survivorship duration in the wild, suggesting a complex relationship between locomotor performance and fitness in growing S. floridanus.

AB Adaptive genetic diversity is a key factor in conservation planning as it relates to the evolutionary potential of populations and their responses to environmental change. Developments in landscape genomics have fostered a proliferation of tests for selection that aim to identify candidate adaptive markers in natural populations. However, these tests rely on different assumptions and may produce contrasting results. Here we applied six tests for selection in a range-wide genomic scan of an Iberian amphibian, Pelobates cultripes, which shows spatially structured genetic variation across its range, encompassing different bioclimatic zones. As a cursory scan for selection, one test identified candidate markers that describe a pattern of putatively adaptive genetic variation, highlighting coastal Atlantic localities as exhibiting putatively non-neutral patterns of genetic variation. While generalized genomic scans for selection in non-model species have limitations, exploratory searches can highlight areas to guide subsequent hypothesis-driven studies and conservation efforts.

AB The present study examined the effects of a four-week physical activity (PA) programme on employees' general affective well-being the acute effects of fitness and stretching sessions on momentary affective states. Participants were divided between an experimental (n = 54) and a comparison group (n = 57). After one month, only employees in the experimental group increased their general affective well-being. Moreover, momentary positive affective states were significantly higher after PA sessions, especially after fitness sessions. For both activities, momentary negative affect significantly decreased after PA sessions, with a larger reduction in the levels of high-activated unpleasant affect. In the short and middle terms, brief PA programmes seem relevant to enhance employees' affective well-being. PA programme characteristics are finally discussed.

AB Detecting occupied sites of rare species, and estimating the probability that all occupied sites are known within a given area, are desired outcomes for many ecological or conservation projects. Examples include managing all occupied sites of a threatened species or eradicating an emerging invader. Occupied sites may remain undetected because (1) sites where the species potentially occurs had not been searched, and (2) the species could have been overlooked in the searched sites. For rare species, available data are typically scant, making it difficult to predict sites where the species probably occurs or to estimate detection probability in the searched sites. Using the critically endangered Rose's mountain toadlet (Capensibufo rosei), known from only two localities, we outline an iterative process aimed at estimating the probability that any unknown occupied sites remain and maximizing the chance of finding them. This includes fitting a species distribution model to guide sampling effort, testing model accuracy and sampling efficacy using the occurrence of more common proxy species, and estimating detection probability using sites of known presence. The final estimate of the probability that all occupied sites were found incorporates the uncertainties of uneven distribution, relative area searched, and detection probability. Our results show that very few occupied sites of C. rosei are likely to remain undetected. We also show that the probability of an undetected occupied site remaining will always be high for large unsearched areas of potential occurrence, but can be low for smaller areas intended for targeted management interventions. Our approach is especially useful for assessing uncertainty in species occurrences, planning the required search effort needed to reduce probability of unknown occurrence to desired levels, and identifying priority areas for further searches or management interventions.

AB Coastal marine ecosystems are currently being exposed to climate change at a much faster rate than many other ecosystems, with coastal species being exposed to multiple stressors. Cephalopod mollusks play a pivotal role in marine trophic webs, and most are "keystone" species due to their influence on ecosystem dynamics. In this study, we characterized the global patterns of coastal cephalopod diversity and present, for the first time, a global forecast of potential changes in richness, mean body size, and assemblage composition (i.e., species replacement, nestedness, and combinations of both) for 161 coastal cephalopod species under climate change, using an ensemble of ecological niche models (ENMs) for an end of the century mitigation scenario. We have shown that, for the baseline period, coastal cephalopod diversity is higher in the Central Indo-Pacific area and that body size patterns follow the temperature-size rule, with larger animals occurring at higher latitudes. The end-century projections of habitat suitability show a different picture, with 96% of cephalopod species predicted to experience range contraction and 15% completely losing their environmental space. Nestedness is projected to be the main effect of species compositional change. Maximum body size is projected to increase in 44% of the pixels and decrease in 37%. Regarding fisheries, the projected changes are more favorable to the countries at higher latitudes, although the search for refugia of smaller tropical species might potentially lead to a mitigation of the negative effects of climate change in these areas, as measured by the total capture (ton). While the model has limitations, our findings reflect major climatic drivers of change and highlight the idea that even though cephalopod species seem good candidates to replace overexploited fish stocks in the near future, they may not have the environmental space to do so.

AB Investigating the spatial distribution of genetic and phenotypic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape diversity in natural systems. We characterized patterns of genetic and phenotypic diversity to learn about drivers of colour-pattern diversification in red-eyed treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) in Costa Rica. Along the Pacific coast, red-eyed treefrogs have conspicuous leg colour patterning that transitions from orange in the north to purple in the south. We measured phenotypic variation of frogs, with increased sampling at sites where the orange-to-purple transition occurs. At the transition zone, we discovered the co-occurrence of multiple colour-pattern morphs. To explore possible causes of this variation, we generated a single nucleotide polymorphism data set to analyse population genetic structure, measure genetic diversity and infer the processes that mediate genotype-phenotype dynamics. We investigated how patterns of genetic relatedness correspond to individual measures of colour pattern along the coast, including testing for the role of hybridization in geographic regions where orange and purple phenotypic groups co-occur. We found no evidence that colour-pattern polymorphism in the transition zone arose through recent hybridization. Instead, a strong pattern of genetic isolation by distance indicates that colour-pattern variation was either retained through other processes such as ancestral colour polymorphisms or ancient secondary contact, or else it was generated by novel mutations. We found that phenotype changes along the Pacific coast more than would be expected based on genetic divergence and geographic distance alone. Combined, our results suggest the possibility of selective pressures acting on colour pattern at a small geographic scale.

AB Inferring the genomic basis of local adaptation is a long-standing goal of evolutionary biology. Beyond its fundamental evolutionary implications, such knowledge can guide conservation decisions for populations of conservation and management concern. Here, we investigated the genomic basis of local adaptation in the Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) across its entire North American range. We hypothesized that extensive spatial variation in environmental conditions and the species' homing behaviour may promote the establishment of local adaptation. We genotyped 7829 individuals representing 217 sampling locations at more than 100,000 high-quality RADseq loci to investigate how recombination might affect the detection of loci putatively under selection and took advantage of the precise description of the demographic history of the species from our previous work to draw accurate population genomic inferences about local adaptation. The results indicated that genetic differentiation scans and genetic-environment association analyses were both significantly affected by variation in recombination rate as low recombination regions displayed an increased number of outliers. By taking these confounding factors into consideration, we revealed that migration distance was the primary selective factor driving local adaptation and partial parallel divergence among distant populations. Moreover, we identified several candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with long-distance migration and altitude including a gene known to be involved in adaptation to altitude in other species. The evolutionary implications of our findings are discussed along with conservation applications.

AB Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) is used widely to evaluate dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA). However, the validity of TCD-determined dCA remains unknown because TCD is only capable of measuring blood velocity and thus only provides an index as opposed to true blood flow. To test the validity of TCD-determined dCA, in nine healthy subjects, dCA was evaluated by transfer function analysis (TFA) using cerebral blood flow (CBF) or TCD-measured cerebral blood velocity during a perturbation that induces reductions in TCD-determined dCA, lower body negative pressure (LBNP) at two different stages: LBNP - 15 mmHg and - 50 mmHg. Internal carotid artery blood flow (ICA Q) was assessed as an index of CBF using duplex Doppler ultrasound. The TFA low frequency (LF) normalized gain (ngain) calculated using ICA Q increased during LBNP at - 50 mmHg (LBNP50) from rest (P = 0.005) and LBNP at - 15 mmHg (LBNP15) (P = 0.015), indicating an impaired dCA. These responses were the same as those obtained using TCD-measured cerebral blood velocity (from rest and LBNP15; P = 0.001 and P = 0.015). In addition, the ICA Q-determined TFA LF ngain from rest to LBNP50 was significantly correlated with TCD-determined TFA LF ngain (r = 0.460, P = 0.016) despite a low intraclass correlation coefficient. Moreover, in the Bland-Altman analysis, the difference in the TFA LF ngains determined by blood flow and velocity was within the margin of error, indicating that the two measurement methods can be interpreted as equivalent. These findings suggest that TCD-determined dCA can be representative of actual dCA evaluated with CBF.

AB The cottids (Cottidae) are a taxonomically diverse and ecologically important component of many marine and freshwater ecosystems. Despite recent breakthroughs in long-read sequencing, high quality genomic resources are still limited for studies of ecological and evolutionary processes in cottids. Here, we generated a high-quality, chromosome-scale genome assembly (521.26 Mb) of the catadromous roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus Heckel) with a contig N50 of 2.93 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 24.06 Mb. Approximately 21.97% of the genome was composed of repetitive elements. A total of 21,872 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 19,900 genes (90.98%) were functionally annotated. Phylogenetic analysis supported the validity of Scorpaenoidei and Cottioidei as two suborders of the Perciformes. Chromosome-scale collinearity analyses identified four chromosome fusions leading to the reduction of chromosome number in T. fasciatus. Gene families related to cell apoptosis and cell death were expanded and those related to immune system were contracted, suggesting that these gene families might be relevant to a host of phenotypic differences between T. fasciatus and other teleosts. Gene families associated with osmoregulation were also expanded, which might be associated with its catadromous life history. A total of 50 aging-associated genes were found to be under positive selection, which might be associated with the short lifespan of T. fasciatus. The high-quality genome assembly and annotation will promote researches into the evolution of catadromous life history and short lifespan for T. fasciatus and facilitate comparative genomic studies of cottids in the near future.

AB Understanding the effects of random versus niche-based processes on biodiversity patterns is a central theme in ecology, and an important tool for predicting effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity. We investigated the predictive power of random processes to explain species richness and species dissimilarity of amphibian assemblages in a fragmented tropical landscape of the Atlantic Forest of South America. We analyzed a large database of amphibian abundance and occupancy, sampled in 21 forest fragments ranging in size from 1.9 to 619 ha. We compared observed species richness and species dissimilarity with the outcomes of two null (random placement) models: 1- the traditional Coleman's area-based model and 2- an abundance-based model (based on the number of individuals observed in each fragment). We applied these models for all species combined, and separately for forest-dependent and habitat-generalist species. The abundance-based model fitted the observed species richness data better than the area-based model for all species, forest-dependent species, and generalist species. The area-based and the abundance-based models were also able to significantly explain species dissimilarity for all species and for generalists, but not for forest dependent species. The traditional area-based model assigned too many individuals to large fragments, thus failing to accurately explain species richness within patches across the landscape. Although niche-based processes may be important to structuring the regional pool of species in fragmented landscapes, our results suggest that part of the variation in species richness and species dissimilarity can be successfully explained by random placement models, especially for generalist species. Evaluating which factors cause variation in the number of individuals among patches should be a focus in future studies aiming to understand biodiversity patterns in fragmented landscapes.

AB Background The ability of overstory tree species to regenerate successfully is important for the preservation of tree species diversity and its associated flora and fauna. This study investigated forest regeneration dynamics in the Cat Ba National Park, a biodiversity hotspot in Vietnam. Data was collected from 90 sample plots (500 m(2)) and 450 sub-sample plots (25 m(2)) in regional limestone forests. We evaluated the regeneration status of tree species by developing five ratios relating overstory and regeneration richness and diversity. By examining the effect of environmental factors on these ratios, we aimed to identify the main drivers for maintaining tree species diversity or for potential diversity gaps between the regeneration and the overstory layer. Our results can help to increase the understanding of regeneration patterns in tropical forests of Southeast Asia and to develop successful conservation strategies. Results We found 97 tree species in the regeneration layer compared to 136 species in the overstory layer. The average regeneration density was 3764 +/- 1601 per ha. Around 70% of the overstory tree species generated offspring. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, only 36% of threatened tree species were found in the regeneration layer. A principal component analysis provided evidence that the regeneration of tree species was slightly negatively correlated to terrain factors (percentage of rock surface, slope) and soil properties (cation exchange capacity, pH, humus content, soil moisture, soil depth). Contrary to our expectations, traces of human impact and the prevailing light conditions (total site factor, gap fraction, openness, indirect site factor, direct site factor) had no influence on regeneration density and composition, probably due to the small gradient in light availability. Conclusion We conclude that the tree species richness in Cat Ba National Park appears to be declining at present. We suggest similar investigations in other biodiversity hotspots to learn whether the observed trend is a global phenomenon. In any case, a conservation strategy for the threatened tree species in the Cat Ba National Park needs to be developed if tree species diversity is to be maintained.

AB Persistent and severe drought induced by global climate change causes tree mortality mainly due to the hydraulic imbalance of conduit systems, but the magnitude of injury may be species dependent. A water-exclusion experiment was carried out on seedlings of two tree species with distinct characteristics, i.e., Fraxinus mandshurica and Larix gmelinii to examine hydraulic responses of leaf, stem, and root to drought stress. The two species displayed different hydraulic strategies and related traits in response to drought stress. L. gmelinii reduced its leaf hydraulic conductance by quick stomatal closure and a slow decline in leaf water potential, with a more isohydric stomatal regulation to maintain its water status. In contrast, F. mandshurica was more anisohydric with a negative stomatal safety margin, exhibiting strong resistance to embolism in stem and leaf-stem segmentation of hydraulic vulnerability to preserve the hydraulic integrity of stem. These differences in hydraulic behaviors and traits between the two species in response to drought stress provide a potential mechanism for their co-existence in temperate forests, including which in the forest modeling would improve our prediction of tree growth and distribution under future climate change.

AB Multilevel societies (MLSs), where social levels are hierarchically nested within each other, are considered one of the most complex forms of animal societies. Although thought to mainly occurs in mammals, it is suggested that MLSs could be under-detected in birds. Here, we propose that the emergence of MLSs could be common in cooperatively breeding birds, as both systems are favoured by similar ecological and social drivers. We first investigate this proposition by systematically comparing evidence for multilevel social structure in cooperative and non-cooperative birds in Australia and New Zealand, a global hotspot for cooperative breeding. We then analyse non-breeding social networks of cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) to reveal their structured multilevel society, with three hierarchical social levels that are stable across years. Our results confirm recent predictions that MLSs are likely to be widespread in birds and suggest that these societies could be particularly common in cooperatively breeding birds.

AB Tandem duplicated genes are common features of genomes, but the phenotypic consequences of their origins are not well understood. It is not known whether a simple doubling of gene expression should be expected, or else some other expression outcome. This study describes an experimental framework using engineered deletions to assess any contribution of locally acting cis- and globally acting trans-regulatory factors to expression interactions of particular tandem duplicated genes. Acsx1L (CG6300) and Acsx1R (CG11659) are tandem duplicates of a putative acyl-CoA synthetase gene found in Drosophila melanogaster. Experimental deletions of the duplicated segments were used to investigate whether the presence of 1 tandem duplicated block influences the expression of its neighbor. Acsx1L, the gene in the left block, shows much higher expression than either its duplicate Acsx1R or the single Acsx1 in Drosophila simulans. Acsx1L expression decreases drastically upon deleting the right-hand duplicated block. Crosses among wildtype and deletion strains show that high tandem expression is primarily due to cis-acting interactions between the duplicated blocks. No effect of these genes on cuticular hydrocarbons was detected. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the duplication rose to fixation in D. melanogaster and has been subject to extensive gene conversion. Some strains actually carry 3 tandem copies, yet strains with 3 Acsx1s do not have higher expression levels than strains with 2. Surveys of tandem duplicate expression have typically not found the expected 2-fold increase in expression. This study suggests that cis-regulatory interactions between duplicated blocks could be responsible for this trend.

AB Premise Most of the Paleotropical flora widely distributed in the Western Palearctic became extinct during the Mio-Pliocene as a result of global geoclimatic changes. A few elements from this Cenozoic flora are believed to remain as relicts in Macaronesia, forming part of the laurel forests. Although the origins of the present species assembly are known to be heterogeneous, it is unclear whether some species should be considered climatic relicts with conserved niches. An ideal group for studying such relict characteristics is a Miocene lineage of Carex sect. Rhynchocystis (Cyperaceae), which comprises four species distributed in mainland Palearctic and Macaronesia. Methods We reconstructed the current and past environmental spaces for extant mainland and Macaronesian species, as well as for Pliocene fossils. We also studied the bioclimatic niche evolution. Species distribution modeling and ensemble small modeling were performed to assess the potential distribution over time. Results Climatic niche analyses and distribution modeling revealed that the ecological requirements of Macaronesian species did not overlap with those of either mainland species or with the Pliocene fossils. Conversely, the niches of mainland species displayed significant similarity and equivalence. Conclusions Macaronesian species are not climatic relicts from the Paleotropical flora, but instead seem to have changed the ecological niche of their ancestors. By contrast, despite their ancient divergence (Late Miocene), mainland C. pendula and C. agastachys show conserved niches, with competitive exclusion likely shaping their mostly allopatric ranges.

AB The crop wild relative Fragaria nilgerrensis is adapted to a variety of diverse habitats across its native range in China. Thus, discoveries made in this species could serve as a useful guide in the development of new superior strawberry cultivars that are resilient to new or variable environments. However, the genetic diversity and genetic architecture of traits in this species underlying important adaptive traits remain poorly understood. Here, we used whole-genome resequencing data from 193 F. nilgerrensis individuals spanning the distribution range in China to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure and genomic basis of local adaptation. We identified four genetic groups, with the western group located in Hengduan Mountains exhibiting the highest genetic diversity. Redundancy analysis suggested that both environment and geographic variables shaped a significant proportion of the genomic variation. Our analyses revealed that the environmental difference explains more of the observed genetic variation than geographic distance. This suggests that adaptation to distinct habitats, which present a unique combination of abiotic factors, likely drove genetic differentiation. Lastly, by implementing selective sweep scans and genome-environment association analysis throughout the genome, we identified the genetic variation associated with local adaptation and investigated the functions of putative candidate genes in F. nilgerrensis.

AB The goal of this paper is to determine the association between traveling to engage in sex work in another country and recent access to HIV testing among substance-using female sex workers (FSWs) in the Mexico-Guatemala border region. From 2012 to 2015, through modified time-location sampling and peer referral, 255 FSWs were recruited at Mexico's southern border. Participants completed questionnaires on sociodemographics, migration and mobility experiences, work environment factors, and substance use. A conceptual framework, as depicted by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), guided our analysis. Crude and adjusted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationships between mobility experiences and HIV testing in the past year. Overall HIV testing was low (41%); after considering relevant covariates (i.e., interaction with health services and organizations, and sex work characteristics) traveling to engage in sex work in another country was found to be positively associated with HIV testing in the past year. Future efforts need to consider voluntary and non-stigmatizing prevention HIV services and focus on reaching out to less mobile women.

AB The method of Outcalt et al., based on work developed originally by Hurst, is re-examined to evaluate its efficacy in delineating changes in trends and identifying regime shifts in climatic-related time series. This technique is based on the concept of the normalized rescaled running sum where temporal changes in the Hurst exponent can be used to identify climatic trends from one regime to another as each regime has a characteristic distribution that differs from the statistical characteristics of the complete time series. An examination of the temporal change in the amplitude of the normalized rescaled running sum can be used as a method to identify these regime changes, which may be either real (i.e., a true climatic shift) or induced (i.e., through a change in measurement bias, station location, or other nonclimatic influence). Examples shown here focus on examining time series of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Arctic thaw depth, the Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent, treeflow data from Lees Ferry (AZ), North Atlantic tropical cyclone frequency, and central England air temperatures.

AB The inventory of the carbon (C) pools in Africa's ecosystems is not well documented, although it is crucial to support climate mitigation policies. We quantified the C stocks in plant biomass, woody necromass, litter and soil (0-30 and 30-100 cm) for the five main land uses - forest, tree plantation, young and adult palm groves, croplands - of Ferralsols on the Allada plateau in southeast Benin. Forests have the highest total C stocks (389 +/- 54 Mg C ha(-1)) compared with other land uses (222 +/- 33, 154 +/- 6, 105 +/- 2, 77 +/- 3 Mg C ha(-1) in tree plantations, adult palm groves, young palm groves and croplands, respectively). The C stocks are higher in the biomass than in the soil (0-100 cm), e.g. in the forest, stocks were 279 +/- 54 Mg C ha(-1) in the biomass versus 83 +/- 2 Mg C ha(-1) in the soil. Differences of soil C stocks between land uses are low (approximate to 28 Mg C ha(-1)) and concentrated in topsoils. The structure and species diversity of the forest partly explained the variability and the high C biomass compared to tree plantations. Type of forest and plantations is important to consider in conserving C stocks in landscapes.

AB Background: Deciduous and sub-deciduous tropical forests are distinguished by their floristic diversity, their emarkable concentration of endemic species, high turnover, and low species similarity.
   Questions: What is the alpha and beta diversity of the woody plant species of the deciduous and sub-deciduous tropical forest in Sierra de Vallejo?
   Study site and dates: Sierra de Vallejo, which is part of the Natural Resources Protection Area, Sierra de Vallejo-Rio Ameca, Nayarit-Jalisco; August 2017 to May 2018.
   Methods: 15 transects (0.1 ha) were established, identifying each woody plant with diameter at the breast height (DBH)>= 3 cm. Alpha diversity was analyzed considering true diversity based on the effective number of species and abundance range curves. Beta diversity was analyzed with similarity, turnover and nestedness.
   Results: We counted 1,556 individuals belonging to 45 families, 99 genera, and 126 species, 22 species endemic to Mexico, one species endemic to the region, 84 native and four exotics. Sites were characterized by low observed species richness (13-37 species), high variation in abundance (44-229 individuals), low true diversity (q0, 18-49 species), high turnover (91-96 %), low nestedness (0.9-1 %) and low similarity (8 %).
   Conclusions: The floristic diversity values show the importance of preserving the greatest number of areas with tropical forest in Sierra de Vallejo, reinforcing the conservation and management strategies of this type of forest within this Natural Protected Area of Natural Resources.

AB Background The sequencing of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome has been a methodological challenge for many years owing to its large size (15.5 Gb), repeat content, and hexaploidy. Many initiatives aiming at obtaining a reference genome of cultivar Chinese Spring have been launched in the past years and it was achieved in 2018 as the result of a huge effort to combine short-read sequencing with many other resources. Reference-quality genome assemblies were then produced for other accessions, but the rapid evolution of sequencing technologies offers opportunities to reach high-quality standards at lower cost.
   Results Here, we report on an optimized procedure based on long reads produced on the Oxford Nanopore Technology PromethION device to assemble the genome of the French bread wheat cultivar Renan.
   Conclusions We provide the most contiguous chromosome-scale assembly of a bread wheat genome to date. Coupled with an annotation based on RNA-sequencing data, this resource will be valuable for the crop community and will facilitate the rapid selection of agronomically important traits. We also provide a framework to generate high-quality assemblies of complex genomes using ONT.

AB Characterizing metagenomes via kmer-based, database-dependent taxonomic classification has yielded key insights into underlying microbiome dynamics. However, novel approaches are needed to track community dynamics and genomic flux within metagenomes, particularly in response to perturbations. We describe KOMB, a novel method for tracking genome level dynamics within microbiomes. KOMB utilizes K-core decomposition to identify Structural variations (SVs), specifically, population-level Copy Number Variation (CNV) within microbiomes. K-core decomposition partitions the graph into shells containing nodes of induced degree at least K, yielding reduced computational complexity compared to prior approaches. Through validation on a synthetic community, we show that KOMB recovers and profiles repetitive genomic regions in the sample. KOMB is shown to identify functionally-important regions in Human Microbiome Project datasets, and was used to analyze longitudinal data and identify keystone taxa in Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) samples. In summary, KOMB represents a novel graph based, taxonomy-oblivious, and reference-free approach for tracking CNV within microbiomes.

TI Soil carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation: Mineralization
   kinetics of organic inputs as an overlooked limitation

AB Over the last few years, the question of whether soil carbon sequestration could contribute significantly to climate change mitigation has been the object of numerous debates. All of these debates so far appear to have entirely overlooked a crucial aspect of the question. It concerns the short-term mineralization kinetics of fresh organic matter added to soils, which is occasionally alluded to in the literature, but is almost always subsumed in a broader modelling context. In the present article, we first summarise what is currently known about the kinetics of mineralization of plant residues added to soils, and about its modelling in the long run. We then argue that in the short run, this microbially-mediated process has important practical consequences that cannot be ignored. Specifically, since at least 90% of plant residues added to soils to increase their carbon content over the long term are mineralized relatively rapidly and are released as CO2 to the atmosphere, farmers would have to apply to their fields 10 times more organic carbon annually than what they would eventually expect to sequester. Over time, because of a well-known sink saturation effect, the multiplier may even rise significantly above 10, up to a point when no net carbon sequestration takes place any longer. The requirement to add many times more carbon than what one aims to sequester makes it practically impossible to add sufficient amounts of crop residues to soils to have a lasting, non-negligible effect on climate change. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that raising the organic matter content of soils is desirable for other reasons, in particular guaranteeing that soils will be able to keep fulfilling essential functions and services in spite of fast-changing environmental conditions.

AB Fertilization of hybrid poplar (HP) plantations with papermill by-products is a promising solution to improve soil fertility and nutrient availability, increase plantation productivity, and provide added value to these materials that would otherwise be incinerated or sent to the landfill. We assessed the growth and foliar nutrition of a HP clone (Populus xcanadensis x Populus maximowiczii) at six plantation sites aged 3-5 years in southern Quebec, Canada. Sites received a fertilization treatment consisting of a mixture of papermill biosolids (120 to 140 t center dot ha-1, depending on site) and lime mud (10 to 15 t center dot ha-1) before being planted, or no fertilization (control). Tree growth was significantly improved by fertilization, with fertilized trees showing a mean annual height increment of 1.3 m (all-site mean; SD = 0.2), compared with 0.5 m (SD = 0.4) for unfertilized trees. Foliar calcium and magnesium increased following fertilization and levels met optimal thresholds at all sites, whereas nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium concentrations also increased, but nutritional deficiencies remained for these elements at several sites. Our results confirm the benefits of fertilizing hybrid poplars with papermill by-products, but they also indicate that adjustments in application rates or type of by-products could be made to fully satisfy nutritional requirements and thus optimize tree growth.

AB A critical step of genome sequence analysis is the mapping of sequenced DNA fragments (i.e., reads) collected from an individual to a known linear reference genome sequence (i.e., sequence-to-sequence mapping). Recent works replace the linear reference sequence with a graph-based representation of the reference genome, which captures the genetic variations and diversity across many individuals in a population. Mapping reads to the graph-based reference genome (i.e., sequence-to-graph mapping) results in notable quality improvements in genome analysis. Unfortunately, while sequence-to-sequence mapping is well studied with many available tools and accelerators, sequence-to-graph mapping is a more difficult computational problem, with a much smaller number of practical software tools currently available.
   We analyze two state-of-the-art sequence-to-graph mapping tools and reveal four key issues. We find that there is a pressing need to have a specialized, high-performance, scalable, and low-cost algorithm/hardware co-design that alleviates bottlenecks in both the seeding and alignment steps of sequence-to-graph mapping. Since sequence-to-sequence mapping can be treated as a special case of sequence-to-graph mapping, we aim to design an accelerator that is efficient for both linear and graph-based read mapping.
   To this end, we propose SeGraM, a universal algorithm/hardware co-designed genomic mapping accelerator that can effectively and efficiently support both sequence-to-graph mapping and sequence-to-sequence mapping, for both short and long reads. To our knowledge, SeGraM is the first algorithm/hardware co-design for accelerating sequence-to-graph mapping. SeGraM consists of two main components: (1) MinSeed, the first minimizer-based seeding accelerator, which finds the candidate locations in a given genome graph; and (2) BitAlign, the first bitvector-based sequence-to-graph alignment accelerator, which performs alignment between a given read and the subgraph identified by MinSeed. We couple SeGraM with high-bandwidth memory to exploit low latency and highly-parallel memory access, which alleviates the memory bottleneck.
   We demonstrate that SeGraM provides significant improvements for multiple steps of the sequence-to-graph (i.e., S2G) and sequence-to-sequence (i.e., S2S) mapping pipelines. First, SeGraM outperforms state-of-the-art S2G mapping tools by 5.9x/3.9x and 106x/-742x for long and short reads, respectively, while reducing power consumption by 4.1x/4.4x and 3.0x/3.2x. Second, BitAlign outperforms a state-of-the-art S2G alignment tool by 41x-539x and three S2S alignment accelerators by 1.2x-4.8x. We conclude that SeGraM is a high-performance and low-cost universal genomics mapping accelerator that efficiently supports both sequence-to-graph and sequence-to-sequence mapping pipelines.

AB Introduction: The effects of habitat transformation have been widely studied and the effects are well-known at different levels of biological organization. However, few studies have focused on responses to this process at the level of multiple taxa in diverse taxonomic and functional groups. Objective: Determine the variations in taxonomic and functional diversity of ants, butterflies, and dung beetles, at a spatial and temporal level in a landscape mosaic of the ecoregion of the Colombian foothills. Methods: We assessed amount of natural habitat and landscape composition in four types of vegetation, during the highest and lowest rain periods. We collected butterflies with hand nets and used baited pitfall traps for dung beetles and ants. Results: Habitat loss positively affected ant and butterfly species richness, and negatively affected dung beetles. The abundance of ants and butterflies had a positive effect on the dominance of species in the transformed veg-etation, for dung beetles the abundance was negatively affected by the absence of canopy cover. Habitat loss had no negative effect on functional diversity as there is no difference between natural and transformed vegetation. Conclusions: The amount of habitat, habitat connectivity and different types of vegetation cover were impor-tant factors in the maintenance of insect diversity in the modified ecosystems of foothills of the Colombian Orinoquia. The lack of a common spatial and temporal pattern shows that studies of multiple insect taxa should be carried out for biodiversity monitoring and conservation processes.

AB Background: Several epidemiological studies report a negative association between Cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Objective: To characterize the trajectories of memory loss in individuals with early amnestic cognitive impairment with and without history of previous cancer.
   Methods: Cognitive deterioration was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or MoCA-Memory Index Score (MoCA-MIS) biannually in subjects with early amnestic cognitive impairment followed-up retrospectively from 2007 to 2021. History of Cancerwas obtained from clinical records. Simple linear regressions of MoCA-MIS scores were calculated for each subject and analyzed with K-means cluster analysis to identify subgroups with different cognitive decline trajectories. chi(2) and t tests were used for descriptive categorical and continuous variables and mixed multiple linear regressions to determine cognitive decline covariates.
   Results: Analysis of the trajectory of cognitive decline in 141 subjects with early amnestic cognitive impairment identified two subgroups: Fast (n = 60) and Slow (n = 81) progressors. At baseline Fast progressors had better MoCA-MIS (p < 0.001) and functionality (CDR p = 0.02, AD8 p = 0.05), took less anti-dementia medications (p = 0.005), and had higher depression rates (p = 0.02). Interestingly, Fast progressors slowed their speed of memory decline (from 1.6 to 1.1 MoCA-MIS points/year) and global cognitive decline (from 2.0 to 1.4 total MoCA points/year) when Cancer history was present.
   Conclusion: Two trajectories of amnestic cognitive decline were identified, possibly derived from different neurophysiopathologies or clinical stages. This study suggests that a history of previous Cancer slows down amnestic cognitive decline, specifically in a subgroup of subjects with depression at baseline and accelerated deterioration at follow-up.

TI THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL IN CANADA

DT Article
ID CAPTURE; SEQUESTRATION; FUTURE
AB Recent assessments of progress on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions suggest that efforts to reduce emissions are well below what is necessary to meet current global targets of 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models include significant amounts of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere as necessary to meet the 2 degrees Celsius target. The models assume the availability of CDR technologies to contribute to climate goals, but significant uncertainties remain regarding the efficacy, costs, scalability, environmental impacts, and broader public acceptability of these technologies. In Canada, CDR technologies are a crucial element of Canada's long-term climate strategy towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Still, little to no national policy attention has been paid to researching, assessing, and implementing CDR measures, including the necessary legal framework in which these technologies would operate.
   This article provides an overview of Canada's existing legal framework that will apply to various CDR methods as they are developed. It examines the legal framework as it may apply to CDR measures collectively (particularly in consideration of how these technologies will be treated in Canada's broader climate framework), and individually. It aims to take stock of existing federal and provincial rules and assess the potential gaps that will need to begin to be addressed as Canada develops CDR capacities.

AB Ecological niche models (ENMs) are often used to investigate how climatic variables from known occurrence records can estimate potential species range distribution. Although climate-based ENMs provide critical baseline information, the inclusion of non-climatic predictors related to vegetation cover might generate more realistic scenarios. This assumption is particularly relevant for species with life-history traits related to forest habitats and sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we developed ENMs for 36 Atlantic Forest endemic birds considering two sets of predictor variables: (i) climatic variables only and (ii) climatic variables combined with the percentage of remaining native vegetation. We hypothesized that the inclusion of native vegetation data would decrease the potential range distribution of forest-dependent species by limiting their occurrence in regions harboring small areas of native vegetation habitats, despite otherwise favorable climatic conditions. We also expected that habitat restriction in the climate-vegetation models would be more pronounced for highly forest-dependent birds. The inclusion of vegetation data in the modeling procedures restricted the final distribution ranges of 22 out of 36 modeled species, while the 14 remaining presented an expansion of their ranges. We observed that species with high and medium forest dependency showed higher restriction in range size predictions between predictor sets than species with low forest dependency, which showed no alteration or range expansion. Overall, our results suggest that ENMs based on climatic and landscape variables may be a useful tool for conservationists to better understand the dynamic of bird species distributions in threatened and highly fragmented regions such as the Atlantic Forest hotspot.(c) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Cie circumflex accent ncia Ecol ogica e Conservacao.

AB Twitter is widely used by software developers. But how effective are tweets at promoting open source projects? How could one use Twitter to increase a project's popularity or attract new contributors? In this paper we report on a mixed-methods empirical study of 44,544 tweets containing links to 2,370 open-source GitHub repositories, looking for evidence of causal effects of these tweets on the projects attracting new GitHub stars and contributors, as well as characterizing the high-impact tweets, the people likely being attracted by them, and how they differ from contributors attracted otherwise. Among others, we find that tweets have a statistically significant and practically sizable effect on obtaining new stars and a small average effect on attracting new contributors. The popularity, content of the tweet, as well as the identity of tweet authors all affect the scale of the attraction effect. In addition, our qualitative analysis suggests that forming an active Twitter community for an open source project plays an important role in attracting new committers via tweets. We also report that developers who are new to GitHub or have a long history of Twitter usage but few tweets posted are most likely to be attracted as contributors to the repositories mentioned by tweets. Our work contributes to the literature on open source sustainability.

AB A B S T R A C T The quality of the surrounding landscape matrix often determines the biodiversity pattern of the remain-ing natural habitat fragments. Dispersal of organisms depends mostly on species traits related to mobility and the contrast between the habitat fragment and the matrix. Therefore, variation in species com-position among fragments, i.e. beta-diversity, can also be affected by matrix quality. In our study, we focused on structurally complex forest steppe fragments in Central Europe for revealing the effects of fragment size and matrix quality. We investigated 18 fragments along a gradient ranging in size from 0.2 to 6 ha, and embedded in a gradient of changing matrix quality. We collected data on plants, spiders and ants in three different habitat types: natural forest and steppe parts of the forest steppe fragments and in the directly neighboring dominant element of the landscape matrix, being pine plantations. Species turnover (beta diversity) was higher for steppes than for forests indicating a higher degree of isolation for steppes. Increasing matrix quality decreased plant species richness in small fragments. The low dis-persal between fragments prevents the displacement of poor competitors by stronger competitors and promotes the coexistence of species. Matrix quality positively affected spider richness independently of fragment size, but had no effect on ants. These differences among taxa highlight the complexity of the effects of landscape structure, and calls for a situation-specific optimization of landscape management in nature conservation. For our particular situation, the findings provide evidence that improving matrix quality would help preserving the threatened forest steppe biota.(c) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecol ogica e Conservacao.

AB Read mapping is a fundamental step in many genomics applications. It is used to identify potential matches and differences between fragments (called reads) of a sequenced genome and an already known genome (called a reference genome). Read mapping is costly because it needs to perform approximate string matching (ASM) on large amounts of data. To address the computational challenges in genome analysis, many prior works propose various approaches such as accurate filters that select the reads within a dataset of genomic reads (called a read set) that must undergo expensive computation, efficient heuristics, and hardware acceleration. While effective at reducing the amount of expensive computation, all such approaches still require the costly movement of a large amount of data from storage to the rest of the system, which can significantly lower the end-to-end performance of read mapping in conventional and emerging genomics systems.
   We propose GenStore, the first in-storage processing system designed for genome sequence analysis that greatly reduces both data movement and computational overheads of genome sequence analysis by exploiting low-cost and accurate in-storage filters. GenStore leverages hardware/software co-design to address the challenges of in-storage processing, supporting reads with 1) different properties such as read lengths and error rates, which highly depend on the sequencing technology, and 2) different degrees of genetic variation compared to the reference genome, which highly depends on the genomes that are being compared. Through rigorous analysis of read mapping processes of reads with different properties and degrees of genetic variation, we meticulously design low-cost hardware accelerators and data/computation flows inside a NAND flashbased solid-state drive (SSD). Our evaluation using a wide range of real genomic datasets shows that GenStore, when implemented in three modern NAND flash-based SSDs, significantly improves the read mapping performance of state-of-the-art software (hardware) baselines by 2.07-6.05x (1.52-3.32x) for read sets with high similarity to the reference genome and 1.45-33.63x (2.70-19.2x) for read sets with low similarity to the reference genome.

AB Simple Summary Although wind energy provides valuable environmental and economic benefits, it has unintended negative consequences for wildlife, particularly birds and bats that collide with the rotating blades. In North America, for example, there are increasing concerns that wind turbines threaten the persistence of populations of migratory tree-roosting bats, such as the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus). Because it is not possible to monitor population sizes for these solitary and cryptic species using traditional techniques, we must rely on other methods, such as acoustic and genetic monitoring, to provide information regarding population status and trends. Using these approaches, we can build a weight of evidence to assess whether mortality associated with wind turbines is sustainable and determine if and when mitigation measures should be implemented to reduce wind turbine mortality. To this end, we recommend that acoustic data be collected using the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) protocols, and that genetic diversity be monitored at repeated time intervals to document species trends. There are no short-term measures to resolve population-level questions for migratory tree-roosting bats. Nonetheless, we discuss opportunities for relatively short-term investments that will lead to long-term success in reducing uncertainty for these species. Wind turbine-related mortality may pose a population-level threat for migratory tree-roosting bats, such as the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) in North America. These species are dispersed within their range, making it impractical to estimate census populations size using traditional survey methods. Nonetheless, understanding population size and trends is essential for evaluating and mitigating risk from wind turbine mortality. Using various sampling techniques, including systematic acoustic sampling and genetic analyses, we argue that building a weight of evidence regarding bat population status and trends is possible to (1) assess the sustainability of mortality associated with wind turbines; (2) determine the level of mitigation required; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures to ensure population viability for these species. Long-term, systematic data collection remains the most viable option for reducing uncertainty regarding population trends for migratory tree-roosting bats. We recommend collecting acoustic data using the statistically robust North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) protocols and that genetic diversity is monitored at repeated time intervals to show species trends. There are no short-term actions to resolve these population-level questions; however, we discuss opportunities for relatively short-term investments that will lead to long-term success in reducing uncertainty.

AB Long-term habitat shifts in marine fishes under climate change have been discussed over the last few decades. However, there is still a limited understanding of how fish distribution and biodiversity patterns will change in the offshore areas of China over time. In the present study, the potential distributions of 21 important marine fishes under current conditions and two climate change scenarios up to the 2050 s were projected using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. The predicted habitat shifts were further used to observe how future environmental changes would affect communities. By the 2050 s, nine out of 21 fish species may have reduced habitats, which were considered as potential loser species in adapting to climate change, while the other 12 fish species were considered as winner species. The habitats of 20 species were predicted to move northward, with a mean habitat centroid shifting distance from 110 to 206.5 km. A novel discovery is that the Yangtze River Estuary is probably a geographical barrier for the northward migration of some species. An asymmetry in the habitat range shift was observed within the study region, wherein the leading edge moved 1 degrees faster than the trailing edge. The Beibu Gulf, Pearl River Estuary, Southwest Taiwan Strait, and Yangtze River Estuary were identified as fish refuges, indicating that large river estuaries and upwelling systems may have positive effects on reducing the vulnerability of biological communities to climate change. At the community level, species richness would be reduced at lower latitudes, while it would be increased at higher latitudes, and species turnover was the main component of temporal beta diversity. Our study provides an informative outlook on the impact of climate change on the distribution and biodiversity of marine fish species in China, supporting the adaptive conservation and management of fish habitats.

AB Appropriate modeling methods and feature selection algorithms must be selected to improve the accuracy of early and mid-term remote sensing detection of wheat stripe rust. In the current study, we explored the effectiveness of the random forest (RF) algorithm combined with the extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) method for early and mid-term wheat stripe rust detection based on the vegetation indices extracted from canopy level hyperspectral measurements. Initially, 21 vegetation indices that were related to the early and mid-term winter wheat stripe rust were calculated on the basis of canopy level hyperspectral reflectance. Subsequently, the optimal vegetation index combination for disease detection was determined using correlation analysis (CA) combined with RF algorithms. Then, the disease severity detection model of early and mid-term winter wheat stripe rust was constructed using XGBoost method based on the optimal vegetation index combination. For the evaluation and comparison of the initial results, three commonly used classification methods, namely, RF, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector machine (SVM), were utilized. The vegetation index combinations determined by the single CA algorithm were also used to construct detection models. Compared with the detection models based on the vegetation index combination obtained using the single CA algorithm, the overall accuracy of the four detection models based on the optimal vegetation index combination based on CA combined with RF algorithms increased by 16.1% (XGBoost), 9.7% (RF), 8.1% (SVM), and 8.1% (BPNN). Among the eight models, the XGBoost detection model based on the optimal vegetation index combination using CA combined with RF algorithms, CA-RF-XGBoost, achieved the highest overall accuracy of 87.1% and the highest kappa coefficient of 0.798. Our results indicate that the RF combined with XGBoost can improve the detection accuracy of early and mid-term winter wheat stripe rust effectively at canopy scale.

AB We analyzed the impact of mountain roads on patterns of species richness and community dissimilarity along elevation gradients with linear mixed-effects models, assessed how non-native/annual species modified these patterns of diversity, and explored changes in the effects of road on plant diversity along topographic gradients through the generalized additive model (GAM). Data analysis showed that (i) species richness for all, native and perennial species was unimodal relative to elevation and peaked at middle elevations; these patterns were modified by colonization of non-native and annual species favored by roads; (ii) mountain roads homogenized community compositions by selective extinction of native perennial species and to a lesser extent by colonization of annuals, rather than by colonization of non-native species; roads did not affect beta diversity response to elevation gradient; and (iii) mountain roads only contributed 8.98 % plant diversity at the landscape level; species richness was affected more by roads than by beta diversity. Montane ecosystems showed strong resilience to the influence of road the at landscape level. We suggest that new roads be planned and constructed on northeast-facing slopes and at lower elevations in order to minimize negative impacts on native plant diversity.

AB Interpretation of complex effects and models can be one of the most challenging and important aspects of quantitative data analysis. The present study tackles this issue for moderation effects, including random slope effects, for multilevel models. To demonstrate the generalization of these procedures beyond the basic multilevel model, the multilevel logistic regression model is used. A moderation effect may be useful when a researcher would like to assess how a particular relationship differs for different groups or different levels of a moderator variable. When the moderator under consideration is a random effect, a random slope model arises. The random slope model has various applications; for example, when observations are nested within individuals comprising a longitudinal design, a random slopes model can be used to assess individual growth trajectories for the subjects in the study. However, these useful effects may be particularly difficult to interpret substantively. Therefore, the present study suggests a method combining the traditional aspects of plotting moderation effects with quantities of interest (QI) computation. Specific suggestions and examples, including R syntax, for associated data visualizations are provided.

AB Land application of biochar as a soil amendment can be an effective strategy for reducing nutrient leaching while providing simultaneous benefits to soil health. However, biochar effects on soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics in biochar-amended soils are poorly understood, particularly in Florida sandy soils receiving fertilizers. This study evaluated the effects of different biochar materials (particle size of 0.1 mm produced from pine (Pinus spp.) wood vs. similar to 0.5-2 mm produced from fescue (Festuca arundinaceaSchreb.) grass, herein referred as "powder" and "coarse" biochar, respectively) and their application methods (surface vs. incorporated) on N and P leaching from soils amended with inorganic fertilizer or biosolids. Biochar materials were either mixed throughout columns of soil or surface applied at a 1% (w/w) rate. Columns were periodically leached over 6 mo to attain 138 ml (equivalent to similar to 1 pore volume) of drainage in each event (total of similar to 16 pore volume of leachate). Biochar materials exhibited modest affinity to retain ammonium (NH4+) but showed no ability to sorb nitrate (NO3-). Powder biochar incorporated throughout the soil reduced cumulative NH4-N, NO3-N, and total N mass leached (average of 25% reduction) relative to control (no biochar) treatments. Biochar materials acted as P sources and were ineffective in reducing leachate P. Biosolids generally resulted in significant lower risk of N and P leaching than inorganic fertilizer. Results suggested biochar ability to retain N and P in soils varies with biochar source, application method, and nutrient source. Biochar type and application method affected N and P dynamics in biosolids or inorganic fertilizer-amended soils, but understanding the mechanisms requires additional study.

AB Large and densely sampled sensor datasets can contain a range of complex stochastic structures that are difficult to accommodate in conventional linear models. This can confound attempts to build a more complete picture of an animal's behavior by aggregating information across multiple asynchronous sensor platforms. The Livestock Informatics Toolkit (LIT) has been developed in R to better facilitate knowledge discovery of complex behavioral patterns across Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) data streams using novel unsupervised machine learning and information theoretic approaches. The utility of this analytical pipeline is demonstrated using data from a 6-month feed trial conducted on a closed herd of 185 mix-parity organic dairy cows. Insights into the tradeoffs between behaviors in time budgets acquired from ear tag accelerometer records were improved by augmenting conventional hierarchical clustering techniques with a novel simulation-based approach designed to mimic the complex error structures of sensor data. These simulations were then repurposed to compress the information in this data stream into robust empirically-determined encodings using a novel pruning algorithm. Nonparametric and semiparametric tests using mutual and pointwise information subsequently revealed complex nonlinear associations between encodings of overall time budgets and the order that cows entered the parlor to be milked.

AB The South Brazilian grasslands (Campos Sulinos) form the dominant vegetation in southern Brazil. They are species-rich ecosystems that occur under distinct geomorphological and climatic conditions but spatial variation of plant species diversity remains understudied. Here, we present a detailed description of plant communities across the region. Our data were obtained in 1080 plots, representing well-preserved grasslands in different ecological systems. Apart from describing alpha and beta diversity, we investigated the relations of plant communities with environmental features. We identified 759 plant species and found clear differences in community composition across the region. Northern and Southern highland grasslands, humid and dry coastal grasslands and the mesic Pampa grassland were clearly distinct, related to climatic and edaphic features. While species abundance distribution was markedly uneven, local species richness was high, above 20 species/m(2), especially in the highlands and in mesic Pampa sites, on shallow soils. The predominant component of beta diversity was species turnover, which suggests that a network of well-conserved grasslands distributed across the region would be the best strategy to protect plant diversity. Our results establish regionalized reference values for richness and diversity that can be useful for initiatives of restoration and conservation of these grasslands.

AB Measurement of carbon isotope discrimination in berry juice at maturity (delta C-13) provides an integrated assessment of vine water status and water use efficiency (WUE) during the period of berry ripening, and when collected over multiple seasons, can provide an indication of drought stress responses. Berry juice delta C-13 measurements were carried out on 48 different varieties planted in a common garden experiment in Bordeaux, France from 2014 through 2020 and found important differences across this large panel of varieties. Cluster analysis showed that delta C-13 values are likely affected by the differing phenology of each variety, resulting in berry ripening of different varieties taking place under different conditions of soil water availability within the same year. Accounting for these phenological differences, the cluster analysis created a classification of varieties that corresponds well to our current empirical understanding of their relative drought tolerance. In addition, using measurements of predawn and midday leaf water potential measurements collected over four seasons on a subset of six varieties, a hydroscape approach was used to develop a list of metrics indicative of the sensitivity of stomatal regulation to water stress (i.e. an/isohydric behaviour). Key hydroscape metrics were also found to be well correlated with some delta(1)3C metrics. A variety's water potential regulation as characterized by a minimum critical leaf water potential as determined from hydroscapes was strongly correlated to delta C-13 values under well-watered conditions, suggesting that the latter may be a useful indicator of drought stress response.

AB Snake venoms represent a danger to human health, but also a gold mine of bioactive proteins that can be harnessed for drug discovery purposes. The evolution of snakes and their venom has been studied for decades, particularly via traditional morphological and basic genetic methods alongside venom proteomics. However, while the field of genomics has matured rapidly over the past 2 decades, owing to the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, snake genomics remains in its infancy. Here, we provide an overview of the state of the art in snake genomics and discuss its potential implications for studying venom evolution and toxinology. On the basis of current knowledge, gene duplication and positive selection are key mechanisms in the neofunctionalization of snake venom proteins. This makes snake venoms important evolutionary drivers that explain the remarkable venom diversification and adaptive variation observed in these reptiles. Gene duplication and neofunctionalization have also generated a large number of repeat sequences in snake genomes that pose a significant challenge to DNA sequencing, resulting in the need for substantial computational resources and longer sequencing read length for high-quality genome assembly. Fortunately, owing to constantly improving sequencing technologies and computational tools, we are now able to explore the molecular mechanisms of snake venom evolution in unprecedented detail. Such novel insights have the potential to affect the design and development of antivenoms and possibly other drugs, as well as provide new fundamental knowledge on snake biology and evolution.

AB Studies aimed at mitigating environmental impacts have received attention in recent years. The use of biochar obtained from the pyrolysis is an alternative for the recovery of organic materials that usually are directly discarded in the environment. Biochar has the potential to recover nutrients from wastewater, and in the latter case, the reuse or recycling of biochar as a controlled-release fertilizer could be an option. However, the adsorption characteristics of the ions into different biochars have not been known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ions adsorption in biochar derived from discarded potatoes, as well as to make physical and chemical characterization of the produced materials. The biochar derived from discarded potatoes was produced by pyrolysis at 450 degrees C under an N2 atmosphere. In order to define its ionic profile, the adsorption of HnPO4(3-n)-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+ was tested in pure biochar, as well as adsorption of HnPO4(3-n)- in biochar after it was doped with Al3+. The desorption of these ions was tested by washing with deionized water, and the KCl (1.0 mol.L-1)and Mehlich-1 extractors. In absolute values, the adsorption order of the ions was Al3+ (in acid pH value) = Ca2+ > Al3+ > HnPO4(3-n)- (biochar doped with Al3+) > Mg2+ > HnPO4(3-n)- (biochar without doping). The adsorption of HnPO4(3-n)- was positively influenced by the doping of biochar with Al3+. The biochar has preferential characteristics for cations adsorption, and the doping process can aid in adsorption of anions.

AB Predictive studies play a crucial role in the study of biological invasions of terrestrial plants under possible climate change scenarios. Invasive species are recognized for their ability to modify soil mi-crobial communities and influence ecosystem dynamics. Here, we focused on six species of allelopathic flowering plantsdAilanthus altissima, Casuarina equisetifolia, Centaurea stoebe ssp. micranthos, Dioscorea bulbifera, Lantana camara, and Schinus terebinthifoliadthat are invasive in North America and examined their potential to spread further during projected climate change. We used Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict future suitable areas for these species in North America under several proposed future climate models. ENMEval and Maxent were used to develop SDMs, estimate current distributions, and predict future areas of suitable climate for each species. Areas with the greatest predicted suitable climate in the future include the northeastern and the coastal northwestern regions of North America. Range size estimations demonstrate the possibility of extreme range loss for these invasives in the southeastern United States, while new areas may become suitable in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. These findings show an overall northward shift of suitable climate during the next few decades, given projected changes in temperature and precipitation. Our results can be utilized to analyze potential shifts in the distribution of these invasive species and may aid in the development of conservation and management plans to target and control dissemination in areas at higher risk for potential future invasion by these allelopathic species.

AB The alpine grasslands of Kashmir Himalaya act as a treasure house of floristic biodiversity. They have remained largely unstudied because of their remoteness and inaccessibility. It is imperative to have quantitative studies of these areas to allow the long-term monitoring of flora in these fragile ecosystems. During the present study, nutrient analysis and species diversity of some alpine grasslands were investigated. Electroconductivity (EC) of the soils ranged between 0.12 and 0.33 (dSm(-1)). With an increase in altitude and precipitation and a decrease in temperature, soil pH and available macro-nutrients (OC, N, P, K) show a considerable decrease. Sixty-six plant species belonging to twenty-nine families and fifty-one genera were reported with members predominantly from the Asteraceae, Rosaceae and Plantaginaceae families. Seven species were common to all study areas and Renyi diversity profiles showed that Kongwattan was the most diverse followed by Poshpathri and Yousmarg. The results of the Sorensen beta diversity index showed a relatively lower dissimilarity index among the three studied alpine sites. In the majority of the growth forms, growth initiation was recorded in April, whereas senescence occurred in September. The highest bloom was seen in June-July. The plant species exhibited a greater variability in their phenophases under different environmental conditions and altitudinal gradients. Plants were more vigorous at lower altitudes and showed rapid response to the prevailing conditions. Stoloniferous forbs and tussock forming graminoids such as Sibbaldia cuneata, Trifolium repens, Plantago major, Trifolium pratense, Poa compressa, Poa angustifolia, and Plantago lanceolata showed a greater importance value index (IVI). The sedentary system of livestock rearing at Yousmarg resulted in the decreased density of the palatable species. This study allowed us to conclude that direct knowledge of soil nutrient composition and species diversity in alpine ecosystems can enhance conservation and ensure better management practices over a period of time.

AB In many organisms, cytochrome P450 enzymes are the primary detoxifying enzymes. Enhanced P450 activity can be mediated by the emergence of new genes, increased transcription due to mutations in the promoter regions, changes in enzyme structures and functions due to mutations in protein-coding regions, or changes in post-translational modifications; all of these changes are subject to insecticide selection pressure. Multiple signalling pathways and key effector molecules are involved in the regulation of insect P450s. Increased P450 activity is a key mechanism inducing insect resistance. Hence, downregulation of selected P450s is a promising strategy to overcome this resistance. Insect P450 inhibitors that act as insecticide synergists, RNA interference to induce P450 gene silencing, and the use of transgenic insects and crops are examples of strategies utilized to overcome resistance. This article reviews the latest advances in studies related to insect P450s-mediated agrochemical resistance, with focuses on the regulatory mechanisms and associated pest management strategies. Future investigations on the comprehensive regulatory pathways of P450-mediated detoxification, identification of key effectors, and downregulation strategies for P450s will ecologically, economically, and practically improve pest management.

AB Simple Summary Pomacea canaliculata is one of the 100 worst invasive alien species in the world, causing significant effects and harm to native species, ecological environment, human health, and social economy. In this study, we used species distribution modeling (SDM) methods to predict the potential distribution of P. canaliculata in China and found that with climate change, there would be a trend of expanding and moving northward in the future. Pomacea canaliculata is one of the 100 worst invasive alien species in the world, which has significant effects and harm to native species, ecological environment, human health, and social economy. Climate change is one of the major causes of species range shifts. With recent climate change, the distribution of P. canaliculata has shifted northward. Understanding the potential distribution under current and future climate conditions will aid in the management of the risk of its invasion and spread. Here, we used species distribution modeling (SDM) methods to predict the potential distribution of P. canaliculata in China, and the jackknife test was used to assess the importance of environmental variables for modeling. Our study found that precipitation of the warmest quarter and maximum temperature in the coldest months played important roles in the distribution of P. canaliculata. With global warming, there will be a trend of expansion and northward movement in the future. This study could provide recommendations for the management and prevention of snail invasion and expansion.

AB 1. Climate warming and subsequent landscape transformations result in rapid ecological change in Arctic freshwaters. Here we provide a synthesis of the diversity of benthic diatoms, plankton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fish in Arctic freshwaters.
   2. We developed a multi-organism measure of alpha diversity to characterise circumpolar spatial patterns and their environmental correlates, and we assessed ecoregion-level beta diversity for all organism groups across the Arctic.
   3. Alpha diversity was lowest at high latitudes and elevations and where dispersal barriers exist. Diversity was positively related to temperature, and both temperature and connectivity limited diversity on high latitude islands. Beta diversity was highly variable among ecoregions for most organism groups, ranging from 0 (complete similarity) to 1 (complete dissimilarity). The high degree of dissimilarity within many ecoregions illustrates the uniqueness of many Arctic freshwater communities.
   4. Northward range expansion of freshwater taxa into Arctic regions may lead to increased competition for cold-stenothermic and cold-adapted species, and ultimately lead to the extinction of unique Arctic species. Societal responses to predicted impacts include: (1) actions to improve detection of changes (e.g., harmonised monitoring, remote sensing) and engagement with Arctic residents and Indigenous Peoples; and (2) actions to reduce the impact of unwanted changes (e.g., reductions of CO2 emissions, action against the spread of invasive species).
   5. Current Arctic freshwater monitoring shows large gaps in spatial coverage, while time series data are scarce. Arctic countries should develop an intensified, long-term monitoring programme with routine reporting. Such an approach will allow detection of long-term changes in water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services of Arctic freshwaters.

AB Amphibians are declining globally and while many factors are contributing to this decline, habitat loss and degradation caused by climate and land use changes are among the most critical. Habitat degradation and increased interspecific competition are both concerns for long-term viability of the federally-threatened Cheat Mountain salamander (Plethodon nettingi) which is endemic to high elevations in West Virginia. In this study, we quantified the impacts of linear habitat fragmentation (i.e., a linear forest clearing for creation of a ski slope) on local colonization and extinction probabilities in adjacent forested habitat for the Cheat Mountain salamander and two co-occurring competitor species, eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) and Wehrle's salamander (Plethodon wehrlei). We also quantified long-term changes in total occupancy of the species within the high elevation study area. We surveyed the salamander community annually from 1988 to 2021 using diurnal natural cover object searches at 43 plots, with 1988 representing three years following linear habitat fragmentation. For each species, we used dynamic occupancy models to identify and model influential covariates for initial occupancy, colonization, extinction, and detection probability. We found that distance to fragmentation was positively correlated with colonization probability for Cheat Mountain salamanders, indicating negative edge effects of the linear forest clearing. Distance to fragmentation was negatively correlated with colonization probability for eastern red-backed salamanders, potentially indicating this species benefited from increased solar radiation or reduced competition from Cheat Mountain salamanders. Predicted occupancy of eastern red-backed salamanders and Wehrle's salamanders increased over the 34 year monitoring period, indicating potential for increased competitive interactions. Our study suggests that extensive linear habitat fragmentation could result in degraded habitat for Cheat Mountain salamanders in the adjacent forest, and that potential for interactions with competitor species is increasing in high elevation forest stands.

AB This is the first Europe-wide comprehensive assessment of the climatological and physiological information recorded by hydrogen isotope ratios in tree-ring cellulose (delta H-2(c)) based on a unique collection of annually resolved 100-year tree-ring records of two genera (Pinus and Quercus) from 17 sites (36 degrees N to 68 degrees N). We observed that the high-frequency climate signals in the delta H-2(c) chronologies were weaker than those recorded in carbon (delta C-13(c)) and oxygen isotope signals (delta O-18(c)) but similar to the tree-ring width ones (TRW). The delta H-2(c) climate signal strength varied across the continent and was stronger and more consistent for Pinus than for Quercus. For both genera, years with extremely dry summer conditions caused a significant H-2-enrichment in tree-ring cellulose.
   The delta H-2(c) inter-annual variability was strongly site-specific, as a result of the imprinting of climate and hydrology, hut also physiological mechanisms and tree growth. To differentiate between environmental and physiological signals in delta H-2(c), we investigated its relationships with delta O-18(c) and TRW. We found significant negative relationships between delta H-2(c), and TRW (7 sites), and positive ones between delta H-2(c) and delta O-18(c) (10 sites). The strength of these relationships was nonlincarly related to temperature and precipitation. Mechanistic delta H-2(c) models performed well for both genera at continental scale simulating average values, but they failed on capturing year-to-year delta H-2(c) variations. Our results suggest that the information recorded by delta H-2(c) is significantly different from that of delta O-18(c,) and has a stronger physiological component independent from climate, possibly related to the use of carbohydrate reserves for growth. Advancements in the understanding of H-2-fractionations and their relationships with climate, physiology, and species-specific traits are needed to improve the modelling and interpretation accuracy of delta H-2(c). Such advancements could lead to new insights into trees' carbon allocation mechanisms, and responses to abiotic and biotic stress conditions.

Two essential questions thus remain poorly addressed: how does dosage sensitivity, imposed by stoichiometry in protein complexes or by X chromosome dosage compensation, affect the emergence of complete duplicate genes? Do introns facilitate intergenic and intragenic chimaerism as predicted by the theory of exon shuffling? Here, we analysed new data for Drosophila and public data for humans, to characterize polymorphic duplicate genes with respect to dosage, exon-intron structures and allele frequencies. We found that complete duplicate genes are under dosage constraint induced by protein stoichiometry but potentially tolerated by X chromosome dosage compensation. We also found that in the intron-rich human genome, gene fusions and intragenic duplications extensively use intronic breakpoints generating in-frame proteins, in accordance with the theory of exon shuffling. Finally, we found that only a small proportion of complete or partial duplicates are at high frequencies, indicating the deleterious nature of dosage or gene structural changes. Altogether, we demonstrate how mechanistic factors including dosage sensitivity and exon-intron structure shape the short-term functional consequences of gene duplication.
   Polymorphic duplicate genes are important early stages of duplicate gene evolution. Here, the authors characterize polymorphic gene duplicates with respect to dosage, exon-intron structures and allele frequencies for Drosophila and humans.

AB Although plant clonality is an important reproductive strategy complementing seed reproduction, their interrelationship is seldom studied. We evaluated how plant clonality, together with plant economics spectrum and architectural constraints, affect the generative reproduction characteristics of co-existing grassland species. For this purpose, we collected data on seed number, seed mass and seed yield (seed mass x seed number) per shoot of 56 herbaceous species from temperate grasslands in the White Carpathian Mts. (SE Czech Republic).
   Clonality had a weaker effect on seed traits than leaf economics and plant architecture. Metamer size showed the strongest relationship to seed number per shoot, while leaf dry matter content and canopy height were the most important factors affecting average seed mass in the studied species. Seed yield was affected by both leaf nitrogen and metamer size but only for plants with long lived shoots (di- and polycyclic). The negative correlation between seed mass and seed number per shoot for our dataset was confirmed.
   Our study did not support the idea that clonality is the most important factor affecting seed production in grassland species and pointed out complex relationships of coordinated traits in coexisting species.

AB The coordination of plant leaf water potential (psi(L)) regulation and xylem vulnerability to embolism is fundamental for understanding the tradeoffs between carbon uptake and risk of hydraulic damage. There is a general consensus that trees with vulnerable xylem more conservatively regulate psi(L) than plants with resistant xylem. We evaluated if this paradigm applied to three important eastern US temperate tree species, Quercus alba L., Acer saccharum Marsh. and Liriodendron tulipifera L., by synthesizing 1600 psi(L) observations, 122 xylem embolism curves and xylem anatomical measurements across 10 forests spanning pronounced hydroclimatological gradients and ages. We found that, unexpectedly, the species with the most vulnerable xylem (Q. alba) regulated psi(L) less strictly than the other species. This relationship was found across all sites, such that coordination among traits was largely unaffected by climate and stand age. Quercus species are perceived to be among the most drought tolerant temperate US forest species; however, our results suggest their relatively loose psi(L) regulation in response to hydrologic stress occurs with a substantial hydraulic cost that may expose them to novel risks in a more drought-prone future.

AB Assessing and mapping ecosystem services (ES) became an integral part of coastal and marine management practices. hence, quantitative and validated approaches are lacking, especially to address future conditions. The objective of this study is to apply further existing and develop new methodological frameworks to quantitatively assess and map the current and future supply of 3 ES in the coastal zone of Lithuania: coastal flood protection, nutrient regulation, and maintenance of nurse!) , conditions. For coastal flood ES modelling, 2 time periods (1990 and 2018) and 4 scenarios (A0, A1 A2, A3 - based on future socio-economic changes in Lithuania) were analysed. The coastal flood protection ES model was validated (r(2) = 0.30) using tree cover density. The results showed spatial differences among the analysed periods but no statistical differences. High supply areas are located in the southern coastal area, while the central part displays a low supply. For nutrient regulation and maintenance of nursery conditions, 7 time periods were analysed: a historical period and 6 scenarios based on Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 and 3 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. The nutrient regulation ES model was validated (r(2) = 0.85) using in situ nutrient. Statistical differences were observed for this ES, but a similar spatial distribution of high and low supply areas. A decrease in the supply was observed comparing the historical period and future scenarios. Maintenance of nursery conditions was validated (r(2) = 0.72) based on the protection status of the coastal zone. Results show no statistical differences and similar spatial patterns among the periods. Rocky and sandbank areas show a high supply for this ES. Limitations of our work are mainly related to the resolution of the utilised indicators. Nevertheless, the information obtained from our models can support spatial planning and decision-making processes.

AB Reducing tillage frequency and intensity and returning crop residues to the soil are two agricultural management practices to increase soil organic carbon (SOC). Timing and rates of nitrogen fertilizer, coupled with tillage methods and residue incorporation, can also influence nitrous oxide emissions. In this study, we used measured data from a long term (23 years) tillage and residue management experiment, under intensive grain corn production, together with the DNDC (DeNitrification-DeComposition) process-based model, to ascertain the most effective fertilizer and tillage management practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching, and increase soil carbon stocks. The field experiment consisted of no-till [NT], reduced [RT], and conventional tillage [CT], with and without corn residue return. After calibration and validation, using field observed data, the DNDC model was run with 108 management scenarios (six N application rates, spring single N fertilization, spring split N fertilization and fall fertilization, three tillage practices and two residue-return options). N application rate was predicted to be a significant driver for corn yield, SOC sequestration, N2O emissions and nitrate leaching, indicating the need to identify a critical N rate to both optimize production and achieve sustainability goals. Split (vs. single) N application did not significantly affect corn yield, nitrate leaching, N2O emissions or SOC, while fall fertilization should be avoided due to greater nitrate leaching and higher N2O emissions as well as lower crop yield. Although stimulating N2O emissions, both NT and residue return are recommended for their ability to enhance SOC stocks. Results of this study can be used for policy development regarding carbon sequestration and GHG emissions for intensive grain cropping systems in the humid regions of North America.

AB Orestias ascotanensis (Cyprinodontidae) is a teleost pupfish endemic to springs feeding into the Ascotan saltpan in the Chilean Altiplano (3,700 m.a.s.l.) and represents an opportunity to study adaptations to high-altitude aquatic environments. We have de novo assembled the genome of O. ascotanensis at high coverage. Comparative analysis of the O. ascotanensis genome showed an overall process of contraction, including loss of genes related to Gprotein signaling, chemotaxis and signal transduction, while there was expansion of gene families associated with microtubule-based movement and protein ubiquitination. We identified 818 genes under positive selection, many of which are involved in DNA repair. Additionally, we identified novel and conserved microRNAs expressed in O. ascotanensis and its closely-related species, Orestias gloriae. Our analysis suggests that positive selection and expansion of genes that preserve genome stability are a potential adaptive mechanism to cope with the increased solar UV radiation to which high-altitude animals are exposed to.

AB Understanding ecological impacts of bottom-based clam aquaculture can improve its management. In this study, taxonomic and functional macrofaunal assemblage were evaluated for two clam farms located in Laizhou Bay, China. Beta diversity and factors potentially regulating the dissimilarity of macrofauna were estimated. Both taxonomic and functional composition of macrofauna showed large differences between the clam farm and the control area. Functional dissimilarity within the clam farms was found to be nestedness and negatively correlated to local clam abundance. Additionally, the cultured clam enhanced the functional richness but made the macrofaunal assemblage more fragile against species or function loss. This effect would increase with clam abundance, which highlights the importance of identifying optimal clam culture intensity in developing a bottombased clam aquaculture program.

AB Background To set up successful conservation measures, detailed knowledge on the dispersal and colonization capacities of the focal species and connectivity between populations is of high relevance. We developed species-specific nuclear microsatellite molecular markers for the grayling (Hipparchia semele), a butterfly endemic to Europe and of growing conservation concern in North-West Europe, and report on its population genetics, in a fragmented, anthropogenic landscape in Belgium. Our study included samples from 23 different locations nested in two regions and additional historical samples from two locations. We assessed contemporary, long-distance dispersal based on genetic assignment tests and investigated the effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on the population genetic structure and genetic variation using data of nine microsatellite loci. Results Detected dispersal events covered remarkably long distances, which were up to ten times larger than previously reported colonisation distances, with the longest movement recorded in this study even exceeding 100 km. However, observed frequencies of long-distance dispersal were low. Our results point to the consequences of the strong population decline of the last decades, with evidence of inbreeding for several of the recently sampled populations and low estimates of effective population sizes (Ne) (ranging from 20 to 54 individuals). Conclusions Our study shows low frequencies of long-distance dispersal, which is unable to prevent inbreeding in most of the local populations. We discuss the significance for species conservation including future translocation events and discuss appropriate conservation strategies to maintain viable grayling (meta) populations in highly fragmented, anthropogenic landscapes.

AB Host switching allows parasites to expand their niches. However, successful switching may require suites of adaptations and also may decrease performance on the old host. As a result, reductions in gene flow accompany many host switches, driving speciation. Because host switches tend to be rapid, it is difficult to study them in real-time, and their demographic parameters remain poorly understood. As a result, fundamental factors that control subsequent parasite evolution, such as the size of the switching population or the extent of immigration from the original host, remain largely unknown. To shed light on the host switching process, we explored how host switches occur in independent host shifts by two ectoparasitic honey bee mites (Varroa destructor and V. jacobsoni). Both switched to the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) after being brought into contact with their ancestral host (Apis cerana), similar to 70 and similar to 12 years ago, respectively. Varroa destructor subsequently caused worldwide collapses of honey bee populations. Using whole-genome sequencing on 63 mites collected in their native ranges from both the ancestral and novel hosts, we were able to reconstruct the known temporal dynamics of the switch. We further found multiple previously undiscovered mitochondrial lineages on the novel host, along with the genetic equivalent of tens of individuals that were involved in the initial host switch. Despite being greatly reduced, some gene flow remains between mites adapted to different hosts. Our findings suggest that while reproductive isolation may facilitate the fixation of traits beneficial for exploiting the new host, ongoing genetic exchange may allow genetic amelioration of inbreeding effects.

AB Climate change is driving evolutionary and plastic responses in populations, but predicting these responses remains challenging. Studies that combine experimental evolution with ancestor-descendant comparisons allow assessment of the causes, parallelism, and adaptive nature of evolutionary responses, although such studies remain rare, particularly in a climate change context. Here, we created experimental populations of Brassica rapa derived from the same natural population and exposed these replicated populations to experimental drought or watered conditions for four generations. We then grew ancestors and descendants concurrently, following the resurrection approach. Experimental populations under drought showed rapid evolution of earlier flowering time and increased specific leaf area, consistent with a drought escape strategy and observations in natural populations. Evolutionary shifts followed the direction of selection and increased fitness under drought, indicative of adaptive evolution. Evolution to drought also occurred largely in parallel among replicate populations. Further, traits showed phenotypic plasticity to drought, but the direction and effect size of plasticity varied. Our results demonstrate parallel evolution to experimental drought, suggesting that evolution to strong, consistent selection may be predictable. Broadly, our study demonstrates the utility of combining experimental evolution with the resurrection approach to investigate responses to climate change.

AB Biochar has been proposed as a promising negative CO2 emission technology to mitigate future climate change with the additional benefit of increasing agricultural production. However, the spatial responses of soil organic carbon (SOC) to biochar addition in cropland are still uncertain, and the economic feasibility of large-scale biochar implementation remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the response of SOC to biochar addition using 389 paired field measurements. The results show that biochar addition significantly increased SOC by 45.8% on average with large regional variations. Using a random forest model trained with soil, climate, biotic, biochar, and management factors, we found that the response of SOC to biochar addition was mainly dependent on biochar application rates, initial SOC, edaphic (e.g., pH), and climatic (e.g., mean annual precipitation) variables. Combined with the predicted SOC changes to biochar addition on the global cropland, we assessed the revenue of the biochar system based on the current and potential pyrolysis plants in the world using the life-cycle analysis. Net revenue of the currently existing 144 pyrolysis plants increases with larger plant capacity and higher carbon price. Potential revenue of building new plants is high in regions like America and Europe but low in regions with infertile soil, low crop residues availability, and inconvenient transportation. The global CO2 removal of biochar application is 6.6 Tg CO(2)e (CO2 equivalent) year(-1) with a net revenue of $ 177 million dollars at a carbon price of $ 50 t(-1) CO2 for current pyrolysis plants with a biomass-processing capacity of 20,000 t year(-1). Our study provides a full economic assessment of idealized biochar addition scenarios and identifies the locations with maximal potential revenues with new pyrolysis plants.

AB The island syndrome hypothesis (ISH) stipulates that, as a result of local selection pressures and restricted gene flow, individuals from island populations should differ from individuals within mainland populations. Specifically, island populations are predicted to contain individuals that are larger, less aggressive, more sociable, and that invest more in their offspring. To date, tests of the ISH have mainly compared oceanic islands to continental sites, and rarely smaller spatial scales such as inland watersheds. Here, using a novel set of genome-wide SNP markers in wild deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) we conducted a genomic assessment of predictions underlying the ISH in an inland riverine island system: analysing island-mainland population structure, and quantifying heritability of phenotypes thought to underlie the ISH. We found clear genomic differentiation between the island and mainland populations and moderate to high marker-based heritability estimates for overall variation in traits previously found to differ in line with the ISH between mainland and island locations. F-ST outlier analyses highlighted 12 loci associated with differentiation between mainland and island populations. Together these results suggest that the island populations examined are on independent evolutionary trajectories, the traits considered have a genetic basis (rather than phenotypic variation being solely due to phenotypic plasticity). Coupled with the previous results showing significant phenotypic differentiation between the island and mainland groups in this system, this study suggests that the ISH can hold even on a small spatial scale.

AB Language sometimes requires tracking the same participant in different thematic roles across multiple visual events (e.g., The girl that another girl pushed chased a third girl). To better understand how vision and language interact in role tracking, participants described videos of multiple randomly moving circles where two push events were presented. A circle might have the same role in both push events (e.g., agent) or different roles (e.g., agent of one push and patient of other push). The first three studies found higher production accuracy for the same role conditions compared to the different role conditions across different linguistic structure manipulations. The last three studies compared a featural account, where role information was associated with particular circles, or a relational account, where role information was encoded with particular push events. These studies found no interference between different roles, contrary to the predictions of the featural account. The foil was manipulated in these studies to increase the saliency of the second push and it was found that this changed the accuracy in describing the first push. The results suggest that language-related thematic role processing uses a relational representation that can encode multiple events.

AB The study of insular populations was key in the development of evolutionary theory. The successful colonisation of an island depends on the geographic context, and specific characteristics of the organism and the island, but also on stochastic processes. As a result, apparently identical islands may harbour populations with contrasting histories. Here, we use whole genome sequences of 65 barn owls to investigate the patterns of inbreeding and genetic diversity of insular populations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We focus on Crete and Cyprus, islands with similar size, climate and distance to mainland, that provide natural replicates for a comparative analysis of the impacts of microevolutionary processes on isolated populations. We show that barn owl populations from each island have a separate origin, Crete being genetically more similar to other Greek islands and mainland Greece, and Cyprus more similar to the Levant. Further, our data show that their respective demographic histories following colonisation were also distinct. On the one hand, Crete harbours a small population and maintains very low levels of gene flow with neighbouring populations. This has resulted in low genetic diversity, strong genetic drift, increased relatedness in the population and remote inbreeding. Cyprus, on the other hand, appears to maintain enough gene flow with the mainland to avoid such an outcome. Our study provides a comparative population genomic analysis of the effects of neutral processes on a classical island-mainland model system. It provides empirical evidence for the role of stochastic processes in determining the fate of diverging isolated populations.

AB Predictions of how vegetation responds to spatial and temporal differences in climate rely on established links with plant functional traits and vegetation types that can be encoded into Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. Individual traits have been linked to climate at species level and at community level within regions. However, a recent global assessment of aggregated community level traits found unexpectedly weak links with macroclimate, bringing into question broadscale trait-climate associations and implicating local-scale environmental differences in the filtering of communities. To further evaluate patterns in light of these somewhat contra-dictory results, we quantified the power of macro-environmental variables to explain aggregated plant community traits, taking advantage of new trait data for leaf area, plant height and seed mass combined with a national survey that records cover-abundance using consistent methods for a large number of plots across Australia. In contrast to the global study, we found that abundance-weighted community mean and variance of leaf area and maximum height were correlated with macroclimate. Height and leaf area were highest in wet (especially warm, wet) environments, with actual evapotranspiration explaining 30% of variation in leaf area and 26% in maximum height. Seed mass was weakly related to environment, with no variable explaining more than 5% of variance. Considering all three traits together in a redundancy analysis, the complete set of environmental variables explained 43% of variation in site-mean traits and 29% of within-site trait variance. While significant trait variation remains unexplained, the trait-environment relationships reported here suggest climatically-driven filtering plays a strong role in assembling these vegetation communities. Regional assessments using standardised species abundances can therefore be used to predict aspects of vegetation function. Our quantification of plant community trait patterns along macroclimatic gradients at continental scale thereby contributes a much-needed functional basis for Australian vegetation.

AB In tropical ecosystems, habitat degradation and fragmentation are some of the most important drivers of biodiversity loss. In Colombia, the Magdalena River basin is home to a megadiverse wildlife community, which has been historically exposed to pervasive habitat loss and fragmentation. Within a long-term project on the conservation of critically endangered brown spider monkeys (Ateles hybridus), we signed conservation agreements with local landowners to protect the remaining forests and reconnect them through restoration corridors. We established 10 corridors within a matrix of pastures used for cattle-ranching which reconnect approximately 1,000 ha of forests. We planted trees in 2016/2017 and 2020, established 24 vegetation plots (10 x 10 m) to measure their structure and composition, and compared them with six vegetation plots (50 x 2 m) in forest fragments. We installed camera traps to evaluate the effectiveness of corridors as potential pathways for terrestrial vertebrates in a fragmented landscape. Overall, forest structure differed between young corridors (1 year) and both older corridors (5 years) and forests; older corridors had no structural differences with forest fragments. Throughout this preliminary survey, 21 out of 32 species of vertebrates that have been recorded in forests used the corridors, including apex predators and other large birds and mammals. This study provides initial data supporting the use of corridors as a strategy to reconnect wildlife in isolated forest fragments in heavily fragmented landscapes, as well as the establishment of effective corridors that reconnect forest-dwelling species in relatively short periods of time (<5 years).

AB We evaluated the influence of metal accumulation on the oxidative status [lipid peroxidation (LPO) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC)] and carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in host and symbionts of the coral Mussismilia harttii and the hydrocoral Millepora alcicornis collected in Abrolhos Reef Banks (Northeast Brazil), potentially impacted by a major mine dam rupture. Considering metal levels measured in reefs worldwide, Abrolhos corals had higher Fe and Mn levels than expected for preserved offshore reefs. Increasing concentrations of arsenic (As), chromium (Cr) and manganese (Mn) drove inhibition of CA and increased oxidative damage in the hydrocoral M. alcicornis. The impairment of enzymatic activity in the symbiotic algae of M. alcicornis may be related to the oxidative stress condition. The hydrocoral M. alcicornis was more affected by metals than the coral M. harttii, which did not show the expected CA inhibition after metal exposure. Our results suggest that CA activity can be applied as a complementary biomarker to evaluate the physiological impacts of environmental metal contamination in reefs. Also, the metal levels and biochemical biomarkers reported in the present study may provide reference data to monitor the health of reefs impacted by a relevant dam rupture.

ID CUMULATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BUDGETS; TARGETS
AB The concept of net-zero carbon emissions has emerged from physical climate science. However, it is operationalized through social, political and economic systems. We identify seven attributes of net zero, which are important to make it a successful framework for climate action. The seven attributes highlight the urgency of emission reductions, which need to be front-loaded, and of coverage of all emission sources, including currently difficult ones. The attributes emphasize the need for social and environmental integrity. This means carbon dioxide removals should be used cautiously and the use of carbon offsets should be regulated effectively. Net zero must be aligned with broader sustainable development objectives, which implies an equitable net-zero transition, socio-ecological sustainability and the pursuit of broad economic opportunities.
   Net-zero emissions is more than a concept of physical climate science. It is implemented in social, political and economic contexts. This Perspective proposes seven attributes that are critical for the practical and effective implementation of net zero.

AB For the sea otter (Enhydra lutris), genetic population structure is an area of research that has not received significant attention, especially in Southwest Alaska where that distinct population segment has been listed as threatened since 2005 pursuant to the U.S. Endangered Species Act. In this study, 501 samples from 14 locations from Prince William Sound, Alaska to the Commander Islands in Russia were analyzed for variation at 13 microsatellite loci. Our results indicate a high degree of genetic divergence among the 14 locations (F-ST = 0.120) with gene flow conforming to the isolation by distance (IBD) model (r(2) = 0.491, p < .05). The 14 sampling locations formed six geographic associations in clustering and ordination analyses that likely correspond to remnant population lineages: (1) Southcentral Alaska, (2) Kodiak and North Alaska Peninsula, (3) South Alaska Peninsula and Bristol Bay, (4) Eastern Aleutian, (5) Western Aleutian, and (6) the Commander Islands. Except for South Alaska Peninsula and Bristol Bay, these clusters closely agree with previously defined stock and management unit boundaries. Our results reveal significant genetic population structure and are generally congruent with current management strategies for the threatened Southwest Alaska distinct population segment.

AB This study has developed a new ensemble model and tested another ensemble model for flood susceptibility mapping in the Middle Ganga Plain (MGP). The results of these two models have been quantitatively compared for performance analysis in zoning flood susceptible areas of low altitudinal range, humid subtropical fluvial floodplain environment of the Middle Ganga Plain (MGP). This part of the MGP, which is in the central Ganga River Basin (GRB), is experiencing worse floods in the changing climatic scenario causing an increased level of loss of life and property. The MGP experiencing monsoonal subtropical humid climate, active tectonics induced ground subsidence, increasing population, and shifting landuse/landcover trends and pattern, is the best natural laboratory to test all the susceptibility prediction genre of models to achieve the choice of best performing model with the constant number of input parameters for this type of topoclimatic environmental setting. This will help in achieving the goal of model universality, i.e., finding out the best performing susceptibility prediction model for this type of topoclimatic setting with the similar number and type of input variables. Based on the highly accurate flood inventory and using 12 flood predictors (FPs) (selected using field experience of the study area and literature survey), two machine learning (ML) ensemble models developed by bagging frequency ratio (FR) and evidential belief function (EBF) with classification and regression tree (CART), CART-FR and CART-EBF, were applied for flood susceptibility zonation mapping. Flood and non-flood points randomly generated using flood inventory have been apportioned in 70:30 ratio for training and validation of the ensembles. Based on the evaluation performance using threshold-independent evaluation statistic, area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, 14 threshold-dependent evaluation metrices, and seed cell area index (SCAI) meant for assessing different aspects of ensembles, the study suggests that CART-EBF (AUC(SR) = 0.843; AUC(PR) = 0.819) was a better performant than CART-FR (AUC(SR) = 0.828; AUC(PR) = 0.802). The variability in performances of these novel-advanced ensembles and their comparison with results of other published models espouse the need of testing these as well as other genres of susceptibility models in other topoclimatic environments also. Results of this study are important for natural hazard managers and can be used to compute the damages through risk analysis.

AB Droughts increasingly threaten the world's forests and their potential to mitigate climate change. In 2018-2019, Central European forests were hit by two consecutive hotter drought years, an unprecedented phenomenon that is likely to occur more frequently with climate change. Here, we examine tree growth and physiological stress responses (increase in carbon isotope composition; Delta delta C-13) to this consecutive drought based on tree rings of dominant tree species in a Central European floodplain forest. Tree growth was not reduced for most species in 2018, indicating that water supply in floodplain forests can partly buffer meteorological water deficits. Drought stress responses in 2018 were comparable to former single drought years but the hotter drought in 2018 induced drought legacies in tree growth while former droughts did not. We observed strong decreases in tree growth and increases in Delta delta C-13 across all tree species in 2019, which are likely driven by the cumulative stress both consecutive hotter droughts exerted. Our results show that consecutive hotter droughts pose a novel threat to forests under climate change, even in forest ecosystems with comparably high levels of water supply.

AB Polyploidy plays an important role in the evolution of eukaryotes, especially for flowering plants. Many of ecologically or agronomically important plant or crop species are polyploids, including sycamore maple (tetraploid), the world second and third largest food crops wheat (hexaploid) and potato (tetraploid) as well as economically important aquaculture animals such as Atlantic salmon and trout. The next generation sequencing data enables to allocate genotype at a sequence variant site, known as genotyping by sequencing (GBS). GBS has stimulated enormous interests in population based genomics studies in almost all diploid and many polyploid organisms. DNA sequence polymorphisms are codominant and thus fully informative about the underlying genotype at the polymorphic site, making GBS a straightforward task in diploids. However, sequence data may usually be uninformative in polyploid species, making GBS a far more challenging task in polyploids. This paper presents novel and rigorous statistical methods for predicting the number of sequence reads needed to ensure accurate GBS at a polymorphic site bared by the reads in polyploids and shows that a dozen of reads can ensure a probability of 95% to recover all constituent alleles of any tetraploid genotype but several hundreds of reads are needed to accurately uncover the genotype with probability confidence of 90%, subverting the proposition of GBS using low coverage sequence data in the literature. The theoretical prediction was tested by use of RAD-seq data from tetraploid potato cultivars. The paper provides polyploid experimentalists with theoretical guides and methods for designing and conducting their sequence-based studies.

AB Understanding stomatal regulation during drought is essential to correctly predict vegetation-atmosphere fluxes. Stomatal optimization models posit that stomata maximize the carbon gain relative to a penalty caused by water loss, such as xylem cavitation. However, a mechanism that allows the stomata to behave optimally is unknown. Here, we introduce a model of stomatal regulation that results in similar stomatal behaviour without presupposing an optimality principle. By contrast, the proposed model explains stomatal closure based on a well-known component of stomatal regulation: abscisic acid (ABA). The ABA level depends on its production rate, which is assumed to increase with declining leaf water potential, and on its degradation rate, which is assumed to increase with assimilation rate. Our model predicts that stomata open until the ratio of leaf water potential to assimilation rate, proportional to ABA level, is at a minimum. As a prerequisite, the model simulates soil-plant hydraulics and leaf photosynthesis under varying environmental conditions. The model predicts that in wet soils and at low vapour pressure deficit (VPD), when there is no water limitation, stomatal closure is controlled by the relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. In dry soils or at high VPD, when the soil hydraulic conductivity limits the water supply, stomatal closure is triggered by the sharp decline in leaf water potential as transpiration rate increases. Being adaptive to changing soil and atmospheric conditions, the proposed model can explain how plants are enabled to avoid critical water potentials during drought for varying soil properties and atmospheric conditions.

AB Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry holdings commonly spreads through animal trade, and poultry production and health-associated vehicle (PPHaV) movement. To effectively control the spread of disease, it is essential that the contact structure via those movements among farms is thoroughly explored. However, few attempts have been made to scrutinize PPHaV movement compared to poultry trade. Therefore, our study aimed to elucidate the role of PPHaV movement on HPAI transmission. We performed network analysis using PPHaV movement data based on a global positioning system, with phylogenetic information of the isolates during the 2016-2017 HPAI H5N6 epidemic in the Republic of Korea. Moreover, the contribution of PPHaV movement to the spread of HPAI was estimated by Bayesian modeling. The network analysis revealed that there was the relationship between phylogenetic clusters and the contact network via PPHaV movement. Furthermore, the similarity of farm poultry species and the shared integrators between inter-linked infected premises (IPs) were associated with ties within the same phylogenetic clusters. Additionally, PPHaV movement among phylogenetically clustered IPs was estimated to contribute to approximately 30% of HPAI H5N6 infections in IPs on average. This study provides insight into how HPAI spread via PPHaV movement and scientific basis for control strategies.

AB Extreme climatic events that are expected under global warming expose forest ecosystems to drought stress, which may affect the growth and productivity. We assessed intra-annual growth responses of trees to soil water content in species belonging to different functional groups of tree-ring porosity. We pose the hypothesis that species with contrasting carbon allocation strategies, which emerge from different relationships between wood traits and canopy architecture, display divergent growth responses to drought. We selected two diffuse-porous species (Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis) and two ring-porous species (Quercus rubra and Fraxinus americana) from the mixed forest of Quebec (Canada). We measured anatomical wood traits and canopy architecture in eight individuals per species and assessed tree growth sensitivity to water balance during 2008-2017 using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Stem elongation in diffuse-porous species mainly depended upon the total number of ramifications and hydraulic diameter of the tree-ring vessels. In ring-porous species, stem elongation mainly depended upon the productivity of the current year, i.e., number of vessels and basal area increment. Diffuse-porous and ring-porous species had similar responses to soil water balance. The effect of soil water balance on tree growth changed during the growing season. In April, decreasing soil temperature linked to wet conditions could explain the negative relationship between SPEI and tree growth. In late spring, greater water availability affected carbon partitioning, by promoting the formation of larger xylem vessels in both functional groups. Results suggest that timings and duration of drought events affect meristem growth and carbon allocation in both functional groups. Drought induces the formation of fewer xylem vessels in ring-porous species, and smaller xylem vessels in diffuse-porous species, the latter being also prone to a decline in stem elongation due to a reduced number of ramifications. Indeed, stem elongation of diffuse-porous species is influenced by environmental conditions of the previous year, which determine the total number of ramifications during the current year. Drought responses in different functional groups are thus characterized by different drivers, express contrasting levels of resistance or resilience, but finally result in an overall similar loss of productivity.

AB Objectives Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is becoming a progressively less frequent mechanical complication of myocardial infarction (MI). However, this event is still associated with high operative mortality. We aimed to describe the trends and the risk factors associated with surgical VSD repair outcomes and to provide a clinical benchmark for percutaneous VSD closure strategies. Methods Using the UK National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit database, we identified 1010 patients undergoing surgical VSD repair from 1996 to 2018. The primary outcome was operative mortality. Mixed-model, multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with operative mortality taking into account the variation related to the centre, the surgeon and the year of the operation. Results Both the number of surgical VSD repair and the mortality rate did not change significantly over the 23-year timeframe. Operative mortality was 38.9% overall and was higher when patients were operated within the first 6 h (75%) or the first 24 h (61.3%) from the index MI. Risk factors associated with higher odds of mortality were early surgery, older age, cardiogenic shock, renal failure, previous percutaneous coronary intervention and urgent/emergent operations. Moreover, the mortality rate was similar among patients undergoing isolated VSD repair and VSD repaired combined with surgical coronary revascularization alone or with concomitant mitral valve procedures. Conclusions Post MI VSD remains a dreaded mechanical complication characterized by high surgical operative mortality. A delayed operation, whenever possible, appears to be the most beneficial strategy to reduce mortality.

AB Vulnerability to xylem cavitation is a strong predictor of drought-induced damage in forest communities. However, biotic features of the community itself can influence water availability at the individual tree-level, thereby modifying patterns of drought damage. Using an experimental forest in Tasmania, Australia, we determined the vulnerability to cavitation (leaf P-50) of four tree species and assessed the drought-induced canopy damage of 2944 6-yr-old trees after an extreme natural drought episode. We examined how individual damage was related to their size and the density and species identity of neighbouring trees. The two co-occurring dominant tree species, Eucalyptus delegatensis and Eucalyptus regnans, were the most vulnerable to drought-induced xylem cavitation and both species suffered significantly greater damage than neighbouring, subdominant species Pomaderris apetala and Acacia dealbata. While the two eucalypts had similar leaf P-50 values, E. delegatensis suffered significantly greater damage, which was strongly related to the density of neighbouring P. apetala. Damage in E. regnans was less impacted by neighbouring plants and smaller trees of both eucalypts sustained significantly more damage than larger trees. Our findings demonstrate that natural drought damage is influenced by individual plant physiology as well as the composition, physiology and density of the surrounding stand.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used in ecology to predict species occurrence probability and how species are geographically distributed. Here, we propose innovative predictive factors to efficiently integrate information on connectivity into SDMs, a key element of population dynamics strongly influencing how species are distributed across seascapes. We also quantify the influence of species-specific connectivity estimates (i.e., larval dispersal vs. adult movement) on the marine-based SDMs outcomes. For illustration, seascape connectivity was modeled for two common, yet contrasting, marine species occurring in southeast Australian waters, the purple sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma, and the Australasian snapper, Chrysophrys auratus. Our models illustrate how different species-specific larval dispersal and adult movement can be efficiently accommodated. We used network-based centrality metrics to compute patch-level importance values and include these metrics in the group of predictors of correlative SDMs. We employed boosted regression trees (BRT) to fit our models, calculating the predictive performance, comparing spatial predictions and evaluating the relative influence of connectivity-based metrics among other predictors. Network-based metrics provide a flexible tool to quantify seascape connectivity that can be efficiently incorporated into SDMs. Connectivity across larval and adult stages was found to contribute to SDMs predictions and model performance was not negatively influenced from including these connectivity measures. Degree centrality, quantifying incoming and outgoing connections with habitat patches, was the most influential centrality metric. Pairwise interactions between predictors revealed that the species were predominantly found around hubs of connectivity and in warm, high-oxygenated, shallow waters. Additional research is needed to quantify the complex role that habitat network structure and temporal dynamics may have on SDM spatial predictions and explanatory power.

AB Forest harvest residue is a low-competitive biomass feedstock that is usually left to decay on site after forestry operations. Its removal and pyrolytic conversion to biochar is seen as an opportunity to reduce terrestrial CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change. The mitigation effect of biochar is, however, ultimately dependent on the availability of the biomass feedstock, thus CO2 removal of biochar needs to be assessed in relation to the capacity to supply biochar systems with biomass feedstocks over prolonged time scales, relevant for dimate mitigation. In the present study we used an assembly of empirical models to forecast the effects of harvest residue removal on soil C storage and the technical capacity of biochar to mitigate national-scale emissions over the century, using Norway as a case study for boreal conditions. We estimate the mitigation potential to vary between 0.41 and 0.78 Tg CO2 equivalents yr(-1), of which 79% could be attributed to increased soil C stock and 21% to the coproduction of bioenergy. These values correspond to 9-17% of the emissions of the Norwegian agricultural sector and to 0.8-15% of the total national emission. This illustrates that deployment of biochar from forest harvest residues in countries with a large forestry sector, relative to economy and population size, is likely to have a relatively small contribution to national emission reduction targets but may have a large effect on agricultural emission and commitments. Strategies for biochar deployment need to consider that biochar's mitigation effect is limited by the feedstock supply which needs to be critically assessed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pleistocene environmental changes are generally assumed to have dramatically affected species' demography via changes in habitat availability, but this is challenging to investigate due to our limited knowledge of how Pleistocene ecosystems changed through time. Here, we tracked changes in shallow marine habitat availability resulting from Pleistocene sea level fluctuations throughout the last glacial cycle (120-14 thousand years ago; kya) and assessed correlations with past changes in genetic diversity inferred from genome-wide SNPs, obtained via ddRAD sequencing, in Caribbean hawksbill turtles, which feed in coral reefs commonly found in shallow tropical waters. We found sea level regression resulted in an average 75% reduction in shallow marine habitat availability during the last glacial cycle. Changes in shallow marine habitat availability correlated strongly with past changes in hawksbill turtle genetic diversity, which gradually declined to -1/4th of present-day levels during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 26-19 kya). Shallow marine habitat availability and genetic diversity rapidly increased after the LGM, signifying a population expansion in response to warming environmental conditions. Our results suggest a positive correlation between Pleistocene environmental changes, habitat availability and species' demography, and that demographic changes in hawksbill turtles were potentially driven by feeding habitat availability. However, we also identified challenges associated with disentangling the potential environmental drivers of past demographic changes, which highlights the need for integrative approaches. Our conclusions underline the role of habitat availability on species' demography and biodiversity, and that the consequences of ongoing habitat loss should not be underestimated.

AB Functional diversity (FD), the diversity of organism attributes that relates to their interactions with the abiotic and biotic environment, has been increasingly used for the last two decades in ecology, biogeography and conservation. Yet, FD has many facets and their estimations are not standardized nor embedded in a single tool. mFD (multifaceted functional diversity) is an R package that uses matrices of species assemblages and species trait values as building blocks to compute most FD indices. mFD is firstly based on two functions allowing the user to summarize trait and assemblage data. Then it calculates trait-based distances between species pairs, informs the user whether species have to be clustered into functional entities and finally computes multidimensional functional space. To let the user choose the most appropriate functional space for computing multidimensional functional diversity indices, two mFD functions allow assessing and illustrating the quality of each functional space. Next, mFD provides 6 core functions to calculate 16 existing FD indices based on trait-based distances, functional entities or species position in a functional space. The mFD package also provides graphical functions based on the ggplot library to illustrate FD values through customizable and high-resolution plots of species distribution among functional entities or in a multidimensional space. All functions include internal validation processes to check for errors in data formatting which return detailed error messages. To facilitate the use of mFD framework, we built an associated website hosting five tutorials illustrating the use of all the functions step by step.

AB Use of untreated municipal wastewater (WW) contains toxic trace elements that pose a serious threat to the soilplant-human continuum. The use of biochar (BC) is a promising approach to minimize trace element induced toxicity in the ecosystem. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of BC derived from wheat straw and iron oxide nanoparticles doped biochar (IO-BC) to reduce trace element buildup in soil and plants that consequently affect tomato plant growth and physiological activity under WW irrigation. The BC and IO-BC were applied at four levels (0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5%) in WW irrigated soils. The results indicated that the addition of WW + BC and WW + IO-BC resulted in significant reduction in trace element mobility in soil. Interestingly, the application of WW + IO-BC (1.5%) was more effective in reducing trace element mobility and bioavailability in soil by 78% (As), 58% (Cr), 46% (Pb) and 50% (Cd) compared to WW irrigation, and thus reduced trace element accumulation and toxicity in plants. Results revealed that WW irrigation negatively affected tomato growth, fruit yield, physiology and antioxidative response. Addition of WW + BC and WW + IO-BC ameliorated the oxidative stress (up to 65% and 58% in H2O2 and MDA) and increased plant tolerance (up to 49% in POD and APX activity). The risk indices also showed minimum human health risk (H1 < 1) from tomato after the addition of BC or IO-BC in WW irrigated soils. It is concluded that IO-BC addition in WW irrigated soil could assist in reducing trace elements accumulation and toxicity in tomato and associated human health risks.

TI Community similarity and species overlap between habitats provide
   insight into the deep reef refuge hypothesis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTRAPOLATION;
   BIODIVERSITY; RAREFACTION; DISTINCT
AB The deep reef refuge hypothesis (DRRH) postulates that mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) may provide a refuge for shallow coral reefs (SCRs). Understanding this process is an important conservation tool given increasing threats to coral reefs. To establish a better framework to analyze the DRRH, we analyzed stony coral communities in American Samoa across MCEs and SCRs to describe the community similarity and species overlap to test the foundational assumption of the DRRH. We suggest a different approach to determine species as depth specialists or generalists that changes the conceptual role of MCEs and emphasizes their importance in conservation planning regardless of their role as a refuge or not. This further encourages a reconsideration of a broader framework for the DRRH. We found 12 species of corals exclusively on MCEs and 183 exclusively on SCRs with another 63 species overlapping between depth zones. Of these, 19 appear to have the greatest potential to serve as reseeding species. Two additional species are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, Acropora speciosa and Fimbriaphyllia paradivisa categorized as an occasional deep specialist and a deep exclusive species, respectively. Based on the community distinctiveness and minimal species overlap of SCR and MCE communities, we propose a broader framework by evaluating species overlap across coral reef habitats. This provides an opportunity to consider the opposite of the DRRH where SCRs support MCEs.

AB Green roofs can improve ecosystem services in cities; however, this depends on appropriate plant selection. For stormwater management, plants should have high water use to maximize retention and also survive dry periods. Plants adapted to wetter habitats develop "fast" traits for growth, whereas plants from drier habitats develop "slow" traits to conserve water use and survive drought. Therefore, we hypothesized that (1) plants with fast traits would have greater water use, (2) plants with slow traits would have greater drought tolerance, (3) fast-slow traits would be consistent across the plant, and (4) fast plants with greater water use could avoid drought stress. We evaluated 14 green roof species in a glasshouse experiment under well-watered (WW) and water-deficit (WD) conditions to determine relationships between fast-slow traits, water use, and drought resistance. Traits measured were shoot dry mass, specific leaf area (SLA), root mass fraction (RMF), and specific root length (SRL). Daily evapotranspiration per shoot dry mass was used to describe water use. Drought resistance was represented by (1) days to stomatal closure; (2) cumulative ET before stomatal closure; and (3) degree of iso-anisohydry (difference between midday leaf water potential (psi(MD)) of WW and WD plants; Delta psi(MD)). Plants with greater water use had fast aboveground traits (greater shoot biomass and SLA). Plants with slow traits had greater drought tolerance as plants with lower shoot dry mass closed their stomata later under WD, and plants with greater root allocation were more anisohydric. Fast-slow traits were not consistent across the plant. Although SLA and SRL were positively related, SRL was not related to water use or drought resistance. Shoot dry mass was inversely related to SLA and had a stronger influence on stomatal closure. Though plants with greater water use under well-watered conditions closed their stomates earlier to avoid drought stress, they were not more isohydric (smaller increment psi(MD)) and did not necessarily use more water under WD. Fast aboveground traits can be used to select green roof plants with high water use that avoid drought stress to optimize rainfall retention without jeopardizing drought survival. This will facilitate rapid plant selection using trait information from online databases.

AB Invasive predators can strongly affect native populations. If alien predator pressure is strong enough, it can induce anti-predator responses, including phenotypic plasticity of exposed individuals and local adaptations of impacted populations. Furthermore, maternal investment is an additional pathway that could provide resources and improve performance in the presence of alien predators. We investigated the potential responses to an alien predator crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in a threatened frog (Rana latastei) by combining field observations with laboratory measurements of embryo development rate, to assess the importance of parental investment, origin and exposure to the crayfish cues. We detected a strong variation in parental investment amongst frog populations, but this variation was not related to the invasion status of the site of origin, suggesting that mothers did not modulate parental investment in relation to the presence of alien predators. However, cues of the invasive crayfish elicited plastic responses in clutches and tadpoles development: embryos developed faster when exposed to the predator. Furthermore, embryos from invaded sites reached Gosner's development stage 25 faster than those from non-invaded sites. This ontogenetic shift can be interpreted as a local adaptation to the alien predator and suggests that frogs are able to recognise the predatory risk. If these plastic responses and local adaptation are effective escape strategies against the invasive predator, they may improve the persistence of native frog populations.

AB The leaf of a deciduous species completes its life cycle in a few months. During leaf maturation, osmolyte accumulation leads to a significant reduction of the turgor loss point (psi(TLP)), a known marker for stomatal closure. Here we exposed two grapevine cultivars to drought at three different times during the growing season to explore if the seasonal decrease in leaf psi(TLP) influences the stomatal response to drought. The results showed a significant seasonal shift in the response of stomatal conductance to stem water potential (g(s)similar to psi(stem)), demonstrating that grapevines become increasingly tolerant to low psi(stem) as the season progresses in coordination with the decrease in psi(TLP). We also used the SurEau hydraulic model to demonstrate a direct link between osmotic adjustment and the plasticity of g(s)similar to psi(stem). To understand the possible advantages of g(s)similar to psi(stem) plasticity, we incorporated a seasonally dynamic leaf osmotic potential into the model that simulated stomatal conductance under several water availabilities and climatic scenarios. The model demonstrated that a seasonally dynamic stomatal closure threshold results in trade-offs: it reduces the time to turgor loss under sustained long-term drought, but increases overall gas exchange particularly under seasonal shifts in temperature and stochastic water availability. A projected hotter future is expected to lower the increase in gas exchange that plants gain from the seasonal shift in g(s)similar to psi(stem). These findings show that accounting for dynamic stomatal regulation is critical for understanding drought tolerance.

AB The ever-expanding availability and evolution of microscopy tools has enabled ground-breaking discoveries in neurobiology, particularly with respect to the analysis of cell-type density and distribution. Widespread implementation of many of the elegant image processing tools available continues to be impeded by the lack of complete workflows that span from experimental design, labeling techniques, and analysis workflows, to statistical methods and data presentation. Additionally, it is important to consider open science principles (e.g., open-source software and tools, user-friendliness, simplicity, and accessibility). In the present methodological article, we provide a compendium of resources and a FIJI-ImageJ-based workflow aimed at improving the quantification of cell density in mouse brain samples using semi-automated open-science-based methods. Our proposed framework spans from principles and best practices of experimental design, histological and immunofluorescence staining, and microscopy imaging to recommendations for statistical analysis and data presentation. To validate our approach, we quantified neuronal density in the mouse barrel cortex using antibodies against pan-neuronal and interneuron markers. This framework is intended to be simple and yet flexible, such that it can be adapted to suit distinct project needs. The guidelines, tips, and proposed methodology outlined here, will support researchers of wide-ranging experience levels and areas of focus in neuroscience research.

AB Scientists need to compare the support for models based on observed phenomena. The main goal of the evidential paradigm is to quantify the strength of evidence in the data for a reference model relative to an alternative model. This is done via an evidence function, such as Delta SIC, an estimator of the sample size scaled difference of divergences between the generating mechanism and the competing models. To use evidence, either for decision making or as a guide to the accumulation of knowledge, an understanding of the uncertainty in the evidence is needed. This uncertainty is well characterized by the standard statistical theory of estimation. Unfortunately, the standard theory breaks down if the models are misspecified, as is commonly the case in scientific studies. We develop non-parametric bootstrap methodologies for estimating the sampling distribution of the evidence estimator under model misspecification. This sampling distribution allows us to determine how secure we are in our evidential statement. We characterize this uncertainty in the strength of evidence with two different types of confidence intervals, which we term "global" and "local." We discuss how evidence uncertainty can be used to improve scientific inference and illustrate this with a reanalysis of the model identification problem in a prominent landscape ecology study using structural equations.

AB Understanding the processes and mechanisms that promote lineage divergence is a central goal in evolutionary biology. For instance, studies investigating the spatial distribution of genomic variation often highlight biogeographic barriers underpinning geographic isolation or patterns of isolation by environment and isolation by distance that can also lead to lineage divergence. However, the patterns and processes that shape genomic variation and drive lineage divergence may be taxon-specific, even across closely related taxa co-occurring within the same biogeographic region. Here, we use molecular data in the form of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) to infer the evolutionary relationships and population genomic structure of the Eastern Pinesnake complex (Pituophis melanoleucus)-a polytypic wide-ranging species that occupies much of the Eastern Nearctic. In addition to inferring evolutionary relationships, population genomic structure and gene flow, we also test relationships between genomic diversity and putative barriers to dispersal, environmental variation, and geographic distance. We present results that reveal shallow population genomic structure and ongoing gene flow, despite an extensive geographic range that transcends geographic features found to reduce gene flow among many taxa, including other squamate reptiles within the Eastern Nearctic. Further, our results indicate that the observed genomic diversity is spatially distributed as a pattern of isolation by distance and suggest that the current subspecific taxonomy do not adhere to independent lineages, but, rather, show a significant amount of admixture across the entire P. melanoleucus range.

AB Many animals live in groups and interact with each other, creating an organized collective structure. Social network analysis (SNA) is a statistical tool that aids in revealing and understanding the organized patterns of shared social connections between individuals in groups. Surprisingly, the application of SNA revealed that Drosophila melanogaster, previously considered a solitary organism, displays group dynamics and that the structure of group life is inherited. Although the number of studies investigating Drosophila social networks is currently limited, they address a wide array of questions that have only begun to capture the details of group level behavior in this insect. Here, we aim to review these studies, comparing their respective scopes and the methods used, to draw parallels between them and the broader body of knowledge available. For example, we highlight how despite methodological differences, there are similarities across studies investigating the effects of social isolation on social network dynamics. Finally, this review aims to generate hypotheses and predictions that inspire future research in the emerging field of Drosophila social networks.

AB Background Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes that can render their hosts resistant to various beta-lactam antibiotics. CTX-M-type enzymes are the most prevalent ESBLs and the main cause of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae. The number of described CTX-M types is continuously rising, currently comprising over 240 variants. During routine screening we identified a novel bla(CTX-M) gene. Objectives To characterize a novel bla(CTX-M) variant harboured by a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate of sequence type ST354. Methods Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using broth microdilution. Genome and plasmid sequences were reconstructed using short- and long-read sequencing. The novel bla(CTX-M) locus was analysed using long-read and Sanger sequencing. Plasmid polymorphisms were determined in silico on a single plasmid molecule level. Results The novel bla(CTX-M-243) allele was discovered alongside a nearly identical bla(CTX-M-104)-containing gene array on a 219 kbp IncHI2A plasmid. CTX-M-243 differed from CTX-M-104 by only one amino acid substitution (N109S). Ultra-deep (2300-fold coverage) long-read sequencing revealed dynamic scaling of the bla(CTX-M) genetic contexts from one to five copies. Further antibiotic resistance genes such as bla(TEM-1) also exhibited sequence heterogeneity but were stable in copy number. Conclusions We identified the novel ESBL gene bla(CTX-M-243) and illustrate a dynamic system of varying bla(CTX-M) copy numbers. Our results highlight the constant emergence of new CTX-M family enzymes and demonstrate a potential evolutionary platform to generate novel ESBL variants and possibly other antibiotic resistance genes.

AB Simple Summary Individuals of a polyphagous species, such as Anastrepha obliqua, that plague different host plants, present differences at the genome level; these differences are associated with adaptive processes related to the exploitation of the resource and can lead to speciation in sympatry, first with the formation of host races. In this studio, we used pooled RAD-seq to assess genomic differentiation and population structure in sympatric populations of Anastepha obliqua that infest three different host plants. The results obtained support the effect of host plants on genomic differentiation in populations of the species A. obliqua. We identified a small group of candidate genes that could be under divergent selection, a product of the selective pressure mediated by the host plants. Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is an important pest in the neotropical region. It is considered a polyphagous insect, meaning it infests plants of different taxonomic families and readily colonizes new host plants. The change to new hosts can lead to diversification and the formation of host races. Previous studies investigating the effect of host plants on population structure and selection in Anastrepha obliqua have focused on the use of data from the mitochondrial DNA sequence and microsatellite markers of nuclear DNA, and there are no analyses at the genomic level. To better understand this issue, we used a pooled restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (pooled RAD-seq) approach to assess genomic differentiation and population structure across sympatric populations of Anastrepha obliqua that infest three host plants-Spondias purpurea (red mombin), Mangifera indica (mango) of the family Anacardiaceae and Averrhoa carambola (carambola) of the family Oxalidaceae-in sympatric populations of the species Anastrepha obliqua of Inter-Andean Valley of the Cauca River in southwestern Colombia. Our results show genomic differentiation of populations from carambola compared to mango and red mombin populations, but the genetic structure was mainly established by geography rather than by the host plant. On the other hand, we identified 54 SNPs in 23 sequences significantly associated with the use of the host plant. Of these 23 sequences, we identified 17 candidate genes and nine protein families, of which four protein families are involved in the nutrition of these flies. Future studies should investigate the adaptive processes undergone by phytophagous insects in the Neotropics, using fruit flies as a model and state-of-the-art molecular tools.

AB We use binomial kriging to model the spatial distribution of myiasis by three species namely Chrysomya bezziana, Wohlfahrtia magnifica and Lucilia cuprina in the livestock of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Traditional species distribution models are usually based on assumption of independence of observations. Species data often come in presence-only form for which background points are generated based on some covariates using statistical and machine learning techniques such as MaxEnt. We assume a symmetric binomial distribution based on the principle of maximum entropy in order to decide the number of pseudo-absences. Our results showed that the spatial models fitted very well and prediction distributions were estimated with excellent accuracy. Moreover kriging maps were more accurate as most of the non-spatial variation has been picked up by external drift with higher values of the sensitivity focusing partial AUC for all the three species. Land-use-land-cover was a common factor significantly affecting spatial distribution of all the three species suggesting that for established species anthropogenic factors such as land use become a strong determinant of their spatial distribution. Our results also revealed that for invading species like W. magnifica elevation acts as a barrier to species dispersal and therefore is more limiting to distribution. Furthermore the higher overall prediction accuracy demonstrated that our models performed well in predicting the distributions of the three species, which would lead to better understanding and management of the larval infestation.

AB Globally, amphibian species are experiencing declines at an alarming rate largely due to habitat loss, disease, and climate change. Species with limited distributions are at an elevated risk of a significant decline and extinction because of the inability to avoid and recover from these impacts. Long-term management plans are critical for conservation of species with small ranges; however, the knowledge required to develop effective plans is absent from the literature for many species. The distribution of the Pigeon Mountain Salamander, Plethodon petraeus, is restricted to roughly 17 km along the eastern flank of Pigeon Mountain in northwest Georgia, USA. Consequently, P. petraeus is highly vulnerable to the impacts associated with amphibian declines, a fact that placed the salamander on the list of rare and protected species in Georgia. The distribution of P. petraeus is highly correlated with patchily distributed rocky outcrops, which provide a tangible management habitat target. The development of an effective, long-term management plan requires an understanding of genetic population structure, gene flow, and habitat use patterns. We identified polymorphic cross-amplified microsatellites to determine how genetic diversity is structured across the distribution. Population genetic analyses revealed four distinct populations across the known range of P. petraeus and significant isolation-by-distance genetic structuring.

AB Mutations that cause structural variation are important sources of genetic variation upon which other evolutionary forces can act, however, they are difficult to observe and therefore few direct estimates of their rate and spectrum are available. Understanding mutation rate evolution, however, requires adding to the limited number of species for which direct estimates are available, quantifying levels of intraspecific variation in mutation rates, and assessing whether rate estimates co-vary across types of mutation. Here, we report structural variation-causing mutation rates (svcMRs) for six categories of mutations (short insertions and deletions, long deletions and duplications, and deletions and duplications at copy number variable sites) from nine genotypes of Daphnia magna collected from three populations in Finland, Germany, and Israel using a mutation accumulation approach. Based on whole-genome sequence data and validated using simulations, we find svcMRs are high (two orders of magnitude higher than base substitution mutation rates measured in the same lineages), highly variable among populations, and uncorrelated across categories of mutation. Furthermore, to assess the impact of scvMRs on the genome, we calculated rates while adjusting for the lengths of events and ran simulations to determine if the mutations occur in genic regions more or less frequently than expected by chance. Our results pose a challenge to most prevailing theories aimed at explaining the evolution of the mutation rate, underscoring the importance of obtaining additional mutation rate estimates in more genotypes, for more types of mutation, in more species, in order to improve our future understanding of mutation rates, their variation, and their evolution.

AB Polyploidization plays a key role in plant evolution, but the forces driving the fate of homoeologs in polyploid genomes, i.e., paralogs resulting from a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event, remain to be elucidated. Here, we present a chromosome-scale genome assembly of tetraploid scarlet sage (Salvia splendens), one of the most diverse ornamental plants. We found evidence for three WGD events following an older WGD event shared by most eudicots (the gamma event). A comprehensive, spatiotemporal, genome-wide analysis of homoeologs from the most recent WGD unveiled expression asymmetries, which could be associated with genomic rearrangements, transposable element proximity discrepancies, coding sequence variation, selection pressure, and transcription factor binding site differences. The observed differences between homoeologs may reflect the first step toward sub- and/or neofunctionalization. This assembly provides a powerful tool for understanding WGD and gene and genome evolution and is useful in developing functional genomics and genetic engineering strategies for scarlet sage and other Lamiaceae species.

AB Human-induced climate- and land-use change have been affecting biogeographical and biodiversity patterns for the past two centuries all over the globe, resulting in increased extinction and biotic homogenization rates. High mountain ecosystems are more sensitive to these changes, which have led to physiological and phenological shifts, as well as to ecosystem processes' deformation. Glacial relicts, such as arctic-alpine taxa, are sensitive indicators of the effects of global warming and their rear-edge populations could include warm-adapted genotypes that might prove-conservation-wise-useful in an era of unprecedented climate regimes. Despite the ongoing thermophilization in European and Mediterranean summits, it still remains unknown how past and future climate-change might affect the distributional patterns of the glacial relict, arctic-alpine taxa occurring in Greece, their European southernmost distributional limit. Using species distribution models, we investigated the impacts of past and future climate changes on the arctic-alpine taxa occurring in Greece and identified the areas comprising arctic-alpine biodiversity hotspots in Greece. Most of these species will be faced with severe range reductions in the near future, despite their innate resilience to a multitude of threats, while the species richness hotspots will experience both altitudinal and latitudinal shifts. Being long-lived perennials means that there might be an extinction-debt present in these taxa, and a prolonged stability phase could be masking the deleterious effects of climate change on them. Several ex situ conservation measures (e.g., seed collection, population augmentation) should be taken to preserve the southernmost populations of these rare arctic-alpine taxa and a better understanding of their population genetics is urgently needed.

   OUTCOMES; QUALITY; SKILLS; TEXT
AB Little quantitative research has explored which clinician skills and behaviors facilitate communication. Mutual understanding is especially challenging when patients have limited health literacy (HL). Two strategies hypothesized to improve communication include matching the complexity of language to patients' HL ("universal tailoring"); or always using simple language ("universal precautions"). Through computational linguistic analysis of 237,126 email exchanges between dyads of 1094 physicians and 4331 English-speaking patients, we assessed matching (concordance/discordance) between physicians' linguistic complexity and patients' HL, and classified physicians' communication strategies. Among low HL patients, discordance was associated with poor understanding (P = 0.046). Physicians' "universal tailoring" strategy was associated with better understanding for all patients (P = 0.01), while "universal precautions" was not. There was an interaction between concordance and communication strategy (P = 0.021): The combination of dyadic concordance and "universal tailoring" eliminated HL-related disparities. Physicians' ability to adapt communication to match their patients' HL promotes shared understanding and equity. The 'Precision Medicine' construct should be expanded to include the domain of 'Precision Communication.'

AB Carbon storage (CS) is essential in mitigating atmospheric CO2 levels, but crop production (CP) contributes to food supply. Land management requires understanding the trade-offs between these important, but conflicting, ecosystem services. We studied land use-based strategies to identify the optimal balance between the two, in particular investigating the role of agricultural intensification. We calibrated a statistical model that linked land cover, land use, climate, and biophysical variables to CS and CP in France at 10 km by 10 km resolution. We designed four optimization scenarios: maximisation at the country scale of (1) CS; (2) CP; (3) joint optimization of CS and CP; (4) same as (3) but with minimization of total energy input. The mono-objective scenarios, (1) and (2), enhanced one ecosystem service while decreasing the other. In scenario (3), both ecosystem services were increased at the same time (+ 2.1% for CS and + 9.6% for CP) with a land sparing approach (decrease and intensification of annual crops and increased forest). In scenario (4), the minimization of energy input resulted in less of an increased in both ecosystem services compared to scenario (3): + 1% for CS and + 1.5% for CP. This scenario promoted a land sharing strategy with enhancement of heterogeneous agricultural land. The good performance of the land sparing approach comes at the cost of a high energy use; on the contrary, the land sharing approach allows improvements that, although more modest, come with energy input minimization. As a vast body of literature stresses the biodiversity conservation value and the positive social impacts of land sharing approach, we argue that scenario (4) is more sustainable.

AB All animals must select sites to rest and may spend a large portion of their lives doing so. Despite the importance of this period in their daily activity budget, we lack information about rest/roost ecology for most animals, including the imperiled lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus; hereafter "LEPC"). Therefore, we sought to identify how landcover, anthropogenic features, and human policy (i.e., presence of the Conservation Reserve Program [CRP]) influenced roost site selection and movement patterns of the LEPC. From March to May 2013-2015, we captured and fitted GPS transmitters to 106 LEPCs (n = 72 males; n = 34 females) within Beaver County, Oklahoma and recorded two nocturnal locations per 24-hour period, annually. We used discrete choice models and generalized linear mixed effects models to determine how vegetation cover, CRP patches, and anthropogenic features influenced roost site selection and movements to roosting sites, respectively. We found that roost sites were closer to CRP, leks, and croplands than would be expected at random. Conversely, roost sites were located farther away from shortgrass prairie, roads, and transmission lines than expected. The probability of a LEPC roosting in a location increased by 15% and 4.5% for every 36-meter decrease in distance to a CRP patch and distance to their lek of capture, respectively. Similarly, individuals roosting in CRP patches would travel shorter distances to get to roost sites if their last diurnal location was near CRP. Bird's movements to roosts in CRP were 1.4 times shorter for every meter decrease in the distance of their last diurnal location to a CRP patch, indicating that individuals modify their movement based on CRP presence. Our results indicate that CRP is influential to roosting ecology of the LEPC within this region and may be meeting critical cover requirements.

AB Understanding how species have adapted and responded to past climate provides insights into the present geographical distribution and may improve predictions of how biotic communities will respond to future climate change. Therefore, estimating the distribution and potentially suitable habitats is essential for conserving sensitive species such as Garuga forrestii W.W.Sm., a tree species endemic to China. The potential climatic zones of G. forrestii were modelled in MaxEnt software using 24 geographic points and nine environmental variables for the current and future (2050 and 2070) conditions under two climate representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios. The resulting ecological niche models (ENMs) demonstrated adequate internal assessment metrics, with all AUC and TSS values being >0.79 and a pROC of >1.534. Our results also showed that the distribution of G. forrestii was primarily influenced by temperature seasonality (% contribution = 12%), elevation (% contribution = 27.5%), and precipitation of the wettest month (% contribution = 35.6%). Our findings also indicated that G. forrestii might occupy an area of 309,516.2 km(2) in southwestern China. We note that the species has a potential distribution in three provinces, including Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangxi. A significant decline in species range is observed under the future worst case of high-emissions scenario (RCP8.5), with about 19.5% and 20% in 2050 and 2070, respectively. Similarly, higher elevations shift northward to southern parts of Sichuan province in 2050 and 2070. Thus, this study helps highlight the vulnerability of the species, response to future climate and provides an insight to assess habitat suitability for conservation management.

AB Simple Summary One of the basic conditions of animal welfare is good health. While social behaviors have many benefits for group-living animals, they also play a role in disease transmission. This is especially true in primate species, like bonobos, who have complex social dynamics, which can facilitate disease transmission. Bonobos are also more susceptible to human disease variants due to their close genetic relatedness and are therefore at higher risk of infection in captivity due to closer proximity to humans. Therefore, investigation whether an individual's characteristics, like sex, age, or social-network position increase disease risk provides information that can be used for future management decisions to improve general animal welfare. To do so, we monitored the occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms during one winter season in a relatively large group of 20 zoo-housed bonobos. We found that individuals that were more central in the social network had higher chances of contracting respiratory disease and that males were more likely to get infected than females. These results indicate that for bonobos, social behavior and sex influence the risk of contracting respiratory disease, two factors that can be taken into account when managing fission-fusion dynamics during disease outbreaks in this zoo-housed species. Infectious diseases can be considered a threat to animal welfare and are commonly spread through both direct and indirect social interactions with conspecifics. This is especially true for species with complex social lives, like primates. While several studies have investigated the impact of sociality on disease risk in primates, only a handful have focused on respiratory disease, despite it being a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both wild and captive populations and thus an important threat to primate welfare. Therefore, we examined the role of social-network position on the occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms during one winter season in a relatively large group of 20 zoo-housed bonobos with managed fission-fusion dynamics. We found that within the proximity network, symptoms were more likely to occur in individuals with higher betweenness centrality, which are individuals that form bridges between different parts of the network. Symptoms were also more likely to occur in males than in females, independent of their social-network position. Taken together, these results highlight a combined role of close proximity and sex in increased risk of attracting respiratory disease, two factors that can be taken into account for further welfare management of the species.

AB Cell cycle regulation that plays a pivotal role during organism growth and development is primarily driven by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and Cyclins. Although CDK and Cyclin genes have been characterized in some animals, the studies of CDK and Cyclin families in molluscs, the ancient bilaterian groups with high morphological diversity, is still in its infancy. In this study, we identified and characterized 95 CDK genes and 114 Cyclin genes in seven representative species of molluscs, including Octopus bimaculoides, Pomacea canaliculata, Biomphalaria glabrata, Lottia gigantea, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, Crassostrea gigas and Aplysia californica. Genes in CDK and Cyclin families were grouped into eight and 15 subfamilies by phylogenetic analysis, respectively. It should be noted that duplication of CDK9 gene was detected in P. canaliculate, L. gigantea and M. yessoensis genomes, which has never been recorded in animals. It is speculated that duplication may be the main course of expansion of the CDK9 subfamily in the three molluscs, which also sheds new light on the function of CDK9. In addition, Cyclin B is the largest subfamily among the Cyclin family in the seven molluscs, with the average of three genes. Our findings are helpful in better understanding CDK and Cyclin function and evolution in molluscs.

AB Background Polyploidy, especially allopolyploidy, which entails merging divergent genomes via hybridization and whole-genome duplication (WGD), is a major route to speciation in plants. The duplication among the parental genomes (subgenomes) often leads to one subgenome becoming dominant over the other(s), resulting in subgenome asymmetry in gene content and expression. Polyploid wheats are allopolyploids with most genes present in two (tetraploid) or three (hexaploid) functional copies, which commonly show subgenome expression asymmetry. It is unknown whether a similar subgenome asymmetry exists during translation. We aim to address this key biological question and explore the major contributing factors to subgenome translation asymmetry. Results Here, we obtain the first tetraploid wheat translatome and reveal that subgenome expression asymmetry exists at the translational level. We further perform in vivo RNA structure profiling to obtain the wheat RNA structure landscape and find that mRNA structure has a strong impact on translation, independent of GC content. We discover a previously uncharacterized contribution of RNA structure in subgenome translation asymmetry. We identify 3564 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) across the transcriptomes between the two tetraploid wheat subgenomes, which induce large RNA structure disparities. These SNVs are highly conserved within durum wheat cultivars but are divergent in both domesticated and wild emmer wheat. Conclusions We successfully determine both the translatome and in vivo RNA structurome in tetraploid wheat. We reveal that RNA structure serves as an important modulator of translational subgenome expression asymmetry in polyploids. Our work provides a new perspective for molecular breeding of major polyploid crops.

AB Area of habitat (AOH) is defined as the "habitat available to a species, that is, habitat within its range" and is calculated by subtracting areas of unsuitable land cover and elevation from the range. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Habitats Classification Scheme provides information on species habitat associations, and typically unvalidated expert opinion is used to match habitat to land-cover classes, which generates a source of uncertainty in AOH maps. We developed a data-driven method to translate IUCN habitat classes to land cover based on point locality data for 6986 species of terrestrial mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles. We extracted the land-cover class at each point locality and matched it to the IUCN habitat class or classes assigned to each species occurring there. Then, we modeled each land-cover class as a function of IUCN habitat with (SSG, using) logistic regression models. The resulting odds ratios were used to assess the strength of the association between each habitat and land-cover class. We then compared the performance of our data-driven model with those from a published translation table based on expert knowledge. We calculated the association between habitat classes and land-cover classes as a continuous variable, but to map AOH as binary presence or absence, it was necessary to apply a threshold of association. This threshold can be chosen by the user according to the required balance between omission and commission errors. Some habitats (e.g., forest and desert) were assigned to land-cover classes with more confidence than others (e.g., wetlands and artificial). The data-driven translation model and expert knowledge performed equally well, but the model provided greater standardization, objectivity, and repeatability. Furthermore, our approach allowed greater flexibility in the use of the results and uncertainty to be quantified. Our model can be modified for regional examinations and different taxonomic groups.

AB Background Misinterpretations of the p-value in null-hypothesis statistical testing are common. We aimed to determine the implications of observed p-values in critical care randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods We included three cohorts of published RCTs: Adult-RCTs reporting a mortality outcome, Pediatric-RCTs reporting a mortality outcome, and recent Consecutive-RCTs reporting p-value <=.10 in six higher-impact journals. We recorded descriptive information from RCTs. Reverse Bayesian implications of obtained p-values were calculated, reported as percentages with inter-quartile ranges. Results Obtained p-value was <=.005 in 11/216 (5.1%) Adult-RCTs, 2/120 (1.7%) Pediatric-RCTs, and 37/90 (41.1%) Consecutive-RCTs. An obtained p-value .05-.0051 had high False Positive Rates; in Adult-RCTs, minimum (assuming prior probability of the alternative hypothesis was 50%) and realistic (assuming prior probability of the alternative hypothesis was 10%) False Positive Rates were 16.7% [11.2, 21.8] and 64.3% [53.2, 71.4]. An obtained p-value <=.005 had lower False Positive Rates; in Adult-RCTs the realistic False Positive Rate was 7.7% [7.7, 16.0]. The realistic probability of the alternative hypothesis for obtained p-value .05-.0051 (ie, Positive Predictive Value) was 28.0% [24.1, 34.8], 30.6% [27.7, 48.5], 29.3% [24.3, 41.0], and 32.7% [24.1, 43.5] for Adult-RCTs, Pediatric-RCTs, Consecutive-RCTs primary and secondary outcome, respectively. The maximum Positive Predictive Value for p-value category .05-.0051 was median 77.8%, 79.8%, 78.8%, and 81.4% respectively. To have maximum or realistic Positive Predictive Value >90% or >80%, RCTs needed to have obtained p-value <=.005. The credibility of p-value .05-.0051 findings were easy to challenge, and the credibility to rule-out an effect with p-value >.05 to .10 was low. The probability that a replication study would obtain p-value <=.05 did not approach 90% unless the obtained p-value was <=.005. Conclusions Unless the obtained p-value was <=.005, the False Positive Rate was high, and the Positive Predictive Value and probability of replication of "statistically significant" findings were low.

AB Amendment of biochar into mineral soils has been reported a promising strategy for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas mitigation due to its high stability. Currently, most studies on the stability of biochar are mainly focused on the assessment methods and influencing factors. The assessment methods include qualitative evalu-ation of physical and chemical properties, and utilization of kinetic mineralization models on the basis of labora-tory incubation. As a result, these assessment methods are difficult to accurately reflect the real impact of the interaction between biochar and environmental factors. This article reviews the existing assessment methods, influencing factors, and the impact of environmental aging on the stability of biochar. It is found that under the influence of environmental factors, existing assessment methods are likely to overestimate the stability of bio -char in mineral soils. Therefore, more emphases should be laid on the analyses of the deficiencies in the existing assessment methods on the stability of biochar in the consideration of practical applications. Long-term field ex-periment is strongly recommended to establish a more accurate assessment model on biochar stability for the evaluation of its carbon sequestration potential in mineral soils.

AB Tailoring agricultural practices to enhance the soil carbon (C) stock is seen as a promising mitigation tactic to offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in croplands. Tea plantations are not only the important part of economic industry but also one of the crucial agricultural sources of non-carbon dioxide emissions. Although many studies have measured GHG emissions from tea plantations, it remains unknown about the effect of knowledge-based mitigation options on the entire C budget from Chinese rapidly expanding tea plantations. Thus, we carried out a 2-year field trial to provide an insight into the influence of organic fertilizer substitution for synthetic fertilizer and biochar amendment on net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), net greenhouse gas budget (NGB), and yield-scaled greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) from a subtropical tea plantation. Results showed that when averaged a 2-year experimental period, both full organic substitution and biochar amendment contributed significantly to the increment in NECB, mainly due to the enhanced soil organic C content in the tea field. Compared with the conventional farm practice, the application of full organic substitution can induce a 52% decrease in both NGB and GHGI. Regardless of fertilizer type, both NGB and GHGI were negative and 2.4 times lower in the treatments with biochar amendment relative to the control. In addition to their roles in maintaining soil health and alleviating soil acidification, our results suggest that organic fertilizer substitution and biochar addition may achieve low carbon development for tea plantations. Our findings will inform efforts to implement and evaluate these tailored mitigation options in tea plantations at a national scale.

AB Horizon scanning is increasingly used in conservation to systematically explore emerging policy and management issues. We present the results of a horizon scan of issues likely to impact management of Canadian protected and conserved areas over the next 5-10 years. Eighty-eight individuals participated, representing a broad community of academics, government and nongovernment organizations, and foundations, including policymakers and managers of protected and conserved areas. This community initially identified 187 issues, which were subsequently triaged to 15 horizon issues by a group of 33 experts using a modified Delphi technique. Results were organized under four broad categories: (i) emerging effects of climate change in protected and conserved areas design, planning, and management (i.e., large-scale ecosystem changes, species translocation, fire regimes, ecological integrity, and snow patterns); (ii) Indigenous governance and knowledge systems (i.e., Indigenous governance and Indigenous knowledge and Western science); (iii) integrated conservation approaches across landscapes and seascapes (i.e., connectivity conservation, integrating ecosystem values and services, freshwater planning); and (iv) early responses to emerging cumulative, underestimated, and novel threats (i.e., management of cumulative impacts, declining insect biomass, increasing anthropogenic noise, synthetic biology). Overall, the scan identified several emerging issues that require immediate attention to effectively reduce threats, respond to opportunities, and enhance preparedness and capacity to react.

AB The population of short-beaked common dolphins Delphinus delphis of the Bay of Biscay (northeast Atlantic) has been subjected to potentially dangerous levels of bycatch since the 1990s. As the phenomenon intensifies, it represents a potent threat to the population. Here, we investigated the relationship between bycatch mortality and oceanographic processes. We assumed that oceanographic processes spatiotemporally structure the availability and aggregation of prey, creating areas prone to attract both common dolphins and fish targeted by fisheries. We used 2 datasets from 2012 to 2019: oceanographic data resulting from a circulation model and mortality data inferred from strandings. The latter allows location of mortality areas and quantification of the intensity of mortality events at sea. We fitted a series of spatiotemporal hierarchical Bayesian models using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA). Results provided first insights on how bycatch of common dolphins in the Bay of Biscay might be related to key seasonal and dynamic oceanographic features. We showed that from a statistical predictive point of view, the monthly trend of 2019 bycatch mortality could be predicted with few oceanographic covariates. This study highlights how gaining knowledge about environmental influences on interactions between short-beaked common dolphins and fisheries could have great conservation and management value. Identified relationships with oceanographic covariates were complex, as expected given the dynamic aspects of oceanographic processes, dolphins and fisheries distributions. Further research focusing on smaller time scales is needed to elucidate proximal drivers of common dolphin bycatch in the Bay of Biscay.

AB The evolution of an obligate parasitic lifestyle often leads to the reduction of morphological and physiological traits, which may be accompanied by loss of genes and functions. Slave-making ants are social parasites that exploit the work force of closely related ant species for social behaviors such as brood care and foraging. Recent divergence between these social parasites and their hosts enables comparative studies of gene family evolution. We sequenced the genomes of eight ant species, representing three independent origins of ant slavery. During the evolution of eusociality, chemoreceptor genes multiplied due to the importance of chemical communication in insect societies. We investigated the evolutionary fate of these chemoreceptors and found that slave-making ant genomes harbored only half as many gustatory receptors as their hosts', potentially mirroring the outsourcing of foraging tasks to host workers. In addition, parasites had fewer odorant receptors and their loss shows striking patterns of convergence across independent origins of parasitism, in particular in orthologs often implicated in sociality like the 9-exon odorant receptors. These convergent losses represent a rare case of convergent molecular evolution at the level of individual genes. Thus, evolution can operate in a way that is both repeatable and reversible when independent ant lineages lose important social traits during the transition to a parasitic lifestyle.

AB The effectiveness of behavioural interventions in conservation often depends on local resource users' underlying social interactions. However, it remains unclear to what extent differences in related topics of information shared between resource users can alter network structure-holding implications for information flows and the spread of behaviours. Here, we explore the differences in nine subtopics of fishing information related to the planned expansion of a community co-management scheme aiming to reduce sea turtle bycatch at a small-scale fishery in Peru. We show that the general network structure detailing information sharing about sea turtle bycatch is dissimilar from other fishing information sharing. Specifically, no significant degree assortativity (degree homophily) was identified, and the variance in node eccentricity was lower than expected under our null models. We also demonstrate that patterns of information sharing between fishers related to sea turtle bycatch are more similar to information sharing about fishing regulations, and vessel technology and maintenance, than to information sharing about weather, fishing activity, finances and crew management. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing information-sharing networks in contexts directly relevant to the desired intervention and demonstrate the identification of social contexts that might be more or less appropriate for information sharing related to planned conservation actions.

AB Scots pine is one of the most widely occurring pines, but future projections suggest a large reduction in its range, mostly at the southern European limits. A significant part of its range is located in the Caucasus, a global hot-spot of diversity. Pine forests are an important reservoir of biodiversity and endemism in this region. We explored demographic and biogeographical processes that shaped the genetic diversity of Scots pine in the Caucasus ecoregion and its probable future distribution under different climate scenarios. We found that the high genetic variability of the Caucasian populations mirrors a complex glacial and postglacial history that had a unique evolutionary trajectory compared to the main range in Europe. Scots pine currently grows under a broad spectrum of climatic conditions in the Caucasus, which implies high adaptive potential in the past. However, the current genetic resources of Scots pine are under high pressure from climate change. From our predictions, over 90% of the current distribution of Scots pine may be lost in this century. By threatening the stability of the forest ecosystems, this would dramatically affect the biodiversity of the Caucasus hot-spot.

AB Aim We investigated taxonomic and functional beta diversity of bird communities inhabiting Mediterranean olive groves subject to either intensive or low-intensity management of the ground cover and located in landscapes with different degrees of complexity. Location Andalusia, southern Spain. Methods We partitioned taxonomic and functional beta diversity into its two additive components, turnover and nestedness. We also explored the contributions of single sites to overall beta diversity (LCBD) and separated the effects of species replacement (turnover) and richness difference (nestedness) in order to identify ecologically unique sites-keystone communities-within the metacommunity. In a further step, we employed abundance- and functional-based indicator species analyses to characterize bird assemblages. Results Taxonomic beta diversity increased with landscape complexity. Although both taxonomic and functional differences among assemblages were driven mainly by species replacement (regardless of management or landscape type), the contribution of trait replacement to the total functional beta diversity was much lower, suggesting that species performing similar functions replace each other between sites. There were no differences in LCBD between management types or categories of landscape complexity, but the contributions of sites to beta diversity decreased as the percentage cover of olive groves increased. Species richness was also important in explaining variation in LCBD as species-poor sites tended to contribute the most to the local-to-regional beta diversity. However, some farms displayed high values of LCBD due to the existence of a high replacement component, indicating that some species recorded in these sites were scarce elsewhere. The indicator species analyses revealed that the woodchat shrike Lanius senator may constitute an excellent indicator of biodiversity in this agro-forestry system. Main conclusions Our results show that agricultural expansion promotes biotic homogenization and exemplify how the identification of both keystone species and communities can represent a powerful tool for the management of anthropized landscapes.

AB The assessment of the genetic structuring of biodiversity is crucial for management and conservation. This is particularly critical for widely distributed and highly mobile deep-water teleosts, such as hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae). This species is significant to Maori people and supports the largest commercial fishery in New Zealand, but uncertainty about its stock structure presents a challenge for management. Here, we apply a comprehensive genomic analysis to shed light on the demographic structure of this species by (1) assembling the genome, (2) generating a catalogue of genome-wide SNPs to infer the stock structure and (3) identifying regions of the genome under selection. The final genome assembly used short and long reads and is near complete, representing 93.8% of BUSCO genes, and consisting of 566 contigs totalling 501 Mb. Whole-genome re-sequencing of 510 hoki sampled from 14 locations around New Zealand and Australia, at a read depth greater than 10x, produced 227,490 filtered SNPs. Analyses of these SNPs were able to resolve the stock structure of hoki into two genetically and geographically distinct clusters, one including the Australian and the other one all New Zealand locations, indicating genetic exchange between these regions is limited. Location differences within New Zealand samples were much more subtle (global F-ST = 0.0006), and while small and significant differences could be detected, they did not conclusively identify additional substructures. Ten putative adaptive SNPs were detected within the New Zealand samples, but these also did not geographically partition the dataset further. Contemporary and historical N-e estimation suggest the current New Zealand population of hoki is large yet declining. Overall, our study provides the first genomic resources for hoki and provides detailed insights into the fine-scale population genetic structure to inform the management of this species.

AB Neotropical diversification by the Andean uplift is typically addressed on a large evolutionary scale (e.g., speciation), even though many species are still distributed in both sides of the mountains. The three parallel mountain ranges in the northern Andes (Colombia) impose a major geographical barrier to species' migration from South to Central America. How important these barriers are for conspecific diversification of cross-Andean species such as the leaf-cutting ants remains largely unknown. To answer this question, we studied the mtCOI gene of Atta cephalotes, the most widely distributed leaf-cutting ant species. Our hierarchical analyses evidenced substantial genetic structure among regions and populations, suggesting a more complex biogeographical history of Andean populations than previously thought. These mountains seem to isolate Central American and Western Colombian populations from the rest of A. cephalotes in South America. Population and migration modeling are consistent with the origin of this species in South America and a major role of the Eastern cordillera as a geographical barrier to historical gene flow, restricting dispersion from north to south. These findings provide insights into the role of the Andean uplift as barrier to gene flow in species of leaf-cutting ants. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB The fast expansion of the global seaweed aquaculture industry has created an interest in translocating seedlings cultivated from wild type brood stock. However, such translocations must be applied with caution as introduced cultivars can reduce genetic structure and diversity of wild populations. An understanding of the genetic structure and connectivity of target species is required to guide decision making around aquaculture translocation activities. In this study we used 14 microsatellite loci in a three-level hierarchical sampling design to analyze the genetic structure and connectivity of the native kelp Ecklonia radiata across 12 sites among four geographic regions (Northland, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, and Wellington) in the North Island of New Zealand. Our aim was to provide guidance for translocation of cultivars to prevent the introduction of locally absent genotypes of E. radiata. Strong genetic structure and low geneflow were observed at all hierarchical levels, indicating the presence of multiple genetically distinct sub-populations. On a regional scale, high genetic differentiation was found between the Wellington region and the other three regions (F-ST = 0.407-0.545), and within regions most sites were significantly different (measured by pairwise F-ST) with high relatedness found between individuals within sites (mean 28.2% +/- 0.7 SE). Bayesian modeling and redundancy analysis showed a high degree of genetic clustering and indicate that ocean currents and other factors that have resulted in biogeographical breaks along the coast are likely to be the main factors shaping genetic structure and connectivity of E. radiata on the North Island, rather than isolation by distance. Based on these findings, we recommend that that cultivars of E. radiata should not be translocated outside their area of origin to avoid introducing locally absent genotypes to local sub-populations.

AB Background Considering wild inter-populational phenotypic differentiation can facilitate domestication and subsequent production of new species. However, comparing all populations across a species range to identify those exhibiting suitable key traits for aquaculture (KTA; i.e. important for domestication and subsequent production) expressions is not feasible. Therefore, proxies highlighting inter-populational divergences in KTA are needed. The use of such proxies would allow to identify, prior to bioassays, the wild population pairs which are likely to present differentiations in KTA expressions in aquaculture conditions. Here, we assessed the relevance of three alternative proxies: (i) genetic distance, (ii) habitat divergence, and (iii) geographic/hydrologic distances. We performed this evaluation on seven allopatric populations of Perca fluviatilis for which divergences in KTA had already been shown. Results We showed differences in the correlation degree between the alternative proxy-based and KTA-based distance matrices, with the genetic proxy being correlated to the highest number of KTA. However, no proxy was correlated to all inter-populational divergences in KTA. Conclusion For future domestication trials, we suggest using a multi-proxy assessment along with a prioritisation strategy to identify population pairs which are of interest for further evaluation in bioassays.

AB Understanding the factors and mechanisms shaping differences in species composition across space and time (beta-diversity) in human-modified landscapes has key ecological and applied implications. This topic is, however, challenging because landscape disturbance can promote either decreases (biotic homogenization) or increases (biotic differentiation) in beta-diversity. We assessed temporal differences in intersite beta-diversity of medium-bodied and large-bodied mammals in the fragmented Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. We hypothesized that, given the relatively short history of land-use changes in the region, and the gain and loss of some species caused by landscape spatial changes, beta-diversity would increase through time, especially its nestedness component. We estimated beta-diversity between 24 forest sites (22 forest patches and two continuous forest sites) in 2011 and 2017 to assess whether beta-diversity is decreasing or increasing in the region, and calculated its turnover and nestedness components to understand the mechanisms responsible for changes in beta-diversity, separately assessing mammal groups with different body mass, feeding guild, and habitat specialization. We then related such temporal changes in beta-diversity to temporal changes in five landscape variables (forest cover, matrix openness, number of patches, edge density and interpatch distance) to identify the landscape drivers of beta-diversity. In contrast with our expectations, beta-diversity decreased over time, suggesting an ongoing biotic homogenization process. This pattern was mostly driven by a decrease in species turnover in all mammal groups, especially in landscapes with decreasing forest cover and increasing forested matrices. Although the nestedness component showed a three-fold increase through time, species turnover was 22 and six times higher than nestedness in 2011 and 2017, respectively. The decreased turnover appears to be driven by an increase in dispersal (i.e., spillover) of native species among patches. The prevalence of species turnover over nestedness indicates that different forest sites have a fairly distinct subset of species (i.e., high complementarity in species composition). Therefore, conserving all remaining forest patches and increasing forest cover is of utmost importance to effectively maintain beta-diversity and conserve the total diversity (gamma) of mammal assemblages in this Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot.

AB Tree mortality during global-change-type drought is usually attributed to xylem dysfunction, but as climate change increases the frequency of extreme heat events, it is necessary to better understand the interactive role of heat stress. We hypothesized that some drought-stressed plants paradoxically open stomata in heatwaves to prevent leaves from critically overheating. We experimentally imposed heat (>40 degrees C) and drought stress onto 20 broadleaf evergreen tree/shrub species in a glasshouse study. Most well-watered plants avoided lethal overheating, but drought exacerbated thermal damage during heatwaves. Thermal safety margins (TSM) quantifying the difference between leaf surface temperature and leaf critical temperature, where photosynthesis is disrupted, identified species vulnerability to heatwaves. Several mechanisms contributed to high heat tolerance and avoidance of damaging leaf temperatures-small leaf size, low leaf osmotic potential, high leaf mass per area (i.e., thick, dense leaves), high transpirational capacity, and access to water. Water-stressed plants had smaller TSM, greater crown dieback, and a fundamentally different stomatal heatwave response relative to well-watered plants. On average, well-watered plants closed stomata and decreased stomatal conductance (g(s)) during the heatwave, but droughted plants did not. Plant species with low g(s), either due to isohydric stomatal behavior under water deficit or inherently low transpirational capacity, opened stomata and increased g(s) under high temperatures. The current paradigm maintains that stomata close before hydraulic thresholds are surpassed, but our results suggest that isohydric species may dramatically increase g(s) (over sixfold increases) even past their leaf turgor loss point. By actively increasing water loss at high temperatures, plants can be driven toward mortality thresholds more rapidly than has been previously recognized. The inclusion of TSM and responses to heat stress could improve our ability to predict the vulnerability of different tree species to future droughts.

AB Context Prioritising is likely to differ depending on the species considered for connectivity assessments, leading to a lack of consensual decisions for territorial planning. Objectives The objective was to assess the relevance of identifying priority areas for connectivity for groups of species based on common dispersal abilities. We aimed to assess the impact of target groups choices on predicted priority areas. Method The study was located at the Thau Lagoon territory to demonstrate the methodological approach. Ecological niche modelling was used to quantify species resistance and to identify suitable habitat patches. We coupled the least-cost path methodology with circuit theory to assess species connectivity. We classified connectivity from high to low levels and averaged the results by dispersal groups. Results We found important differences in identified priority areas between groups with dissimilar dispersal abilities, with little overlap between highly connected areas. We identified a gap between the level of protection of low dispersal species and highly connected areas. We found mismatches between existing corridors and connectivity in low dispersal species, and a greater impact in areas of expected urban sprawl projects on favourably connected areas for species with high dispersal capabilities. Conclusion We have demonstrated that a diversity of dispersal capacity ranges must be accounted for in order to identify ecological corridors in programmes that aim to restore habitat connectivity at territorial levels. Our findings are oriented to support the decisions of planning initiatives, at both local and regional scale.

AB Premise: When divergent lineages come into secondary contact, reproductive isolation may be incomplete, thus providing an opportunity to investigate how speciation is manifested in the genome. The Louisiana Irises (Iris, series Hexagonae) comprise a group of three or more ecologically and reproductively divergent lineages that can produce hybrids where they come into contact. We estimated standing genetic variation to understand the current distribution of population structure in the Louisiana Irises.
   Methods: We used genotyping-by-sequencing techniques to sample the genomes of Louisiana Iris species across their ranges. We sampled 20 populations (n = 632 individuals) across 11,249 loci and used Entropy and PCA models to assess population genetic data.
   Results: We discovered evidence for interspecific gene flow in parts of the range. Our analysis revealed patterns of population structure at odds with widely accepted nominal taxonomy. We discovered undescribed hybrid populations, designated as belonging to the I. brevicaulis lineage. Iris nelsonii shared significant ancestry with only one of the purported parent species, I. fulva, evidence inconsistent with a hybrid origin.
   Conclusions: This study provides several key findings important to the investigation of standing genetic variation in the Louisiana Iris species complex. Compared to the other nominal species, I. brevicaulis contains a large amount of genetic diversity. In addition, we discovered a previously unknown hybrid zone between I. brevicaulis and I. hexagona along the Texas coast. Finally, our results do not support the long-standing hypothesis that I. nelsonii has mixed ancestry from three parental taxa.

AB Whether animals breed in the group they are born in influences how they form extended family groups. Whether females stay often depends on properties such as presence of older relatives, including mothers. Using long-term wild house mouse data, we track groups and which group females bred in. Most stayed, but leaving did not reduce breeding success. Presence of mother, who generally stayed, did lead to earlier breeding. This might be a key advantage to remaining to breed.
   Whether females breed in their natal group is an important factor in the evolution of extended families in animal sociality. Breeding in natal groups comes with costs and benefits, depending on group size and presence of older relatives, including mothers. Studying the consequences of breeding in the natal versus another group provides insight into the decisions and trade-offs governing the formation and structure of family groups. We investigated the family dynamics of a population of free-ranging commensal house mice. Using dynamic community detection on long-term datasets, we determined which females first bred in their natal group. We then looked at how this influenced breeding success. We found most females (77%) exhibited strong philopatry, breeding in their natal groups. Breeding elsewhere was only somewhat predictable at very large and very small group sizes. Despite their philopatric preference, breeding elsewhere made no difference in how quickly and successfully a female bred. However, presence of their mother did lead females to breed sooner when born during high breeding activity, when competition over reproduction is high. Based on these results, potential loss of reproductive success from leaving the natal group does not seem to be the main driver of philopatry in female house mice. The effect of the presence of mothers suggests that benefiting from established social connections promotes breeding in the natal group. Mothers providing benefits also implies a lack of conflict between generations, which will be important for the development of stable social groups.

AB In face of global changes, projecting and mapping biodiversity changes are of critical importance to support management and conservation measures of marine ecosystems. Despite the development of a wide variety of ecosystem models capable of integrating an increasing number of ecological processes, most projections of climate-induced changes in marine biodiversity are based on species distribution models (SDMs). These correlative models present a significant advantage when the lack of knowledge on the species physiology is counterbalanced by the availability of relevant environmental variables over the species geographical range. However, correlative SDMs neglect intra- and inter-specific interactions and thereby can lead to biased projections of changes in biodiversity distribution. To evaluate the influence of trophic interactions on projections of species richness and assemblage composition under climate change scenarios, we compared biodiversity projections derived from an ensemble of different SDMs to projections derived from a hybrid model coupling SDMs and a multispecies trophic model in the Mediterranean Sea. Our results show that accounting for trophic interactions modifies projections of future biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, SDMs tended to overestimate the gains and underestimate the losses of species richness by the end of the 21st century, with marked local differences in projections, both in terms of magnitude and trend, in some biodiversity hotspots. In both SDMs and hybrid approaches, nestedness with gains in species richness was the main pattern driving dissimilarity between present and future fish and macro-invertebrate species assemblages at the Mediterranean basin scale. However, at local scale, we highlighted some differences in the relative contribution of nestedness vs replacement in driving dissimilarity. Our results call for the development of integrated modelling tools that can mechanistically consider multiple biotic and abiotic drivers to improve projections of future marine biodiversity.

AB There is a growing demand for ecological restoration using suitable seeds following international standards or national legal demands for local seed-sourcing. However, before selecting the appropriate geographic origin of seeds, it is vital to explore taxonomic complexity related to the focal taxa. We used ddRAD-seq to screen genomic diversity within Carex bigelowii s.lat. focussing on Norway. This species complex is considered a candidate for seeding, but presents considerable morphological, ecological, and genetic variation. The genetic structure of 132 individuals of C. bigelowii s.lat., including Carex nigra as an outgroup, was explored using ordinations, clustering analyses, and a genetic barrier algorithm. Two highly divergent clusters were evident, supporting the recognition of two taxonomic units "C. dacica" and C. bigelowii "subsp. bigelowii". Previously defined seed-sourcing regions for C. bigelowii s.lat. did not consider the known taxonomic complexity, and therefore interpreted the overall genetic structure as seed-sourcing regions, not taxa. We estimated genetic neighborhood sizes within each taxon to be 100-150 km and 300 km, respectively, indicating species-specific delimitations of local seed-sourcing regions. Frequent hybrids, local genetic distinctiveness, and suggested ecotypes add complexity to the discussed seed-sourcing regions. Our results show how genomic screening of diversity and structure in a species complex can alleviate the taxonomic impediment, inform practical questions, and legal requirements related to seed-sourcing, and together with traditional taxonomic work provide necessary information for a sound management of biodiversity.

SO PEDIATRIC RESEARCH

ID HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; TIME RATE; APNEA
AB Obese youth with sleep-disordered breathing are treated with positive airway pressure to improve sleep and cardiovascular status. While improvements in sleep parameters have been confirmed, a study by Katz et al. showed no major improvement in ambulatory blood pressure. The aim of this ancillary study was to analyze short-term blood pressure variability, following positive airway pressure treatment, as a more sensitive marker of cardiovascular health. We analyzed 24-h blood pressure variability data in 17 children, taken at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. These data were derived from an already published prospective, multicenter cohort study conducted in 27 youth (8-16 years) with obesity who were prescribed 1-year of positive airway pressure for moderate-severe sleep-disordered breathing. Significant decreases were found in 24 h systolic blood pressure (p = 0.040) and nighttime diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.041) average real variability, and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.035) weighted standard deviation. Significant decreases were noted in nighttime diastolic blood pressure time rate variability (p = 0.007). Positive airway pressure treatment resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure variability, suggesting a clinically significant improvement of sympathetic nerve activity in youth with obesity and sleep-disordered breathing. Impact Cardiovascular variability, as measured by blood pressure variability, is improved in children following positive airway pressure treatment. Our novel findings of improved blood pressure time rate variability are the first described in the pediatric literature. Future studies aimed at analyzing target organ damage in this patient population will allow for a better understanding as to whether alterations in blood pressure variability translate to decreasing target organ damage in children, as seen in adults.

AB Both abiotic environmental conditions and variation in social environment are known to impact the acquisition of sexual signals. However, the influences of abiotic environmental and social factors are rarely compared to each other. Here we test the relative importance of these factors in determining whether and when male red-backed fairy-wrens, Malurus melanocephalus, moult into ornamented breeding plumage, a known sexual signal. One-year-old male red-backed fairy-wrens vary in whether or not they acquire ornamentation, whereas males age 2 years and older vary in their timing of ornament acquisition. It is unclear whether these processes are determined by the same or different factors, and we examined both events using a combination of long-term breeding records and nonbreeding social networks. We found that 1-year-old males that paired prior to the start of the breeding season were more likely to acquire ornamented plumage, but rainfall did not influence whether 1-year-old males acquired ornamented plumage. Thus, for young individuals, social cues appear to play a larger role than abiotic environmental factors in determining ornament acquisition. For older males, timing of ornamented plumage acquisition was constrained by rainfall, with drier nonbreeding seasons leading to poorer physiological condition and later moult dates. Thus, sexual signal variation in older males appears to be a condition-dependent trait, driven by abiotic environmental and physiological factors rather than social cues. These findings reveal that factors influencing sexual signal expression can vary with age when age classes exhibit different forms of signal variation. Our results suggest that social environment may drive sexual signal variation in young individuals, whereas abiotic environmental variation may drive sexual signal variation in older individuals.

AB Macauba palm [Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart.] is a perennial oil, it stands out for having several characteristics of commercial interest, mainly for producing oil for biodiesel, it has high oil productivity, about 2.5 to 4.5 L center dot year(-1). Despite its great potential, o its cultivation is carried out mainly in an extractive way, so the domestication and breeding programs has been incipient. The study hypothesis is that macauba populations collected in different locations have sufficient genetic variability to initiate a breeding program. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the genetic diversity and population structure of macauba palm genotypes by using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in order to reveal genetic diversity and distribution of genetic variation within and between populations and use the genetic information obtained to assist breeding strategies. Leaf tissues were collected from 566 macauba plants belonging to the Embrapa Cerrados Active Germplasm Bank, composed of genotypes from five states in Brazil: Minas Gerais, Goias, Para, Sao Paulo, and Distrito Federal. Molecular variance analysis estimated, the genetic diversity parameters, the population structure and principal coordinate analysis. The genetic diversity is higher within than between populations. The results provided by PCoA and STRUCTURE were in agreement and indicated that the evaluated genotypes can be grouped into two groups. Genetic diversity parameters reveal the presence of inbreeding and a low number of heterozygotes, evidencing that the reproduction system of the species is mixed. The information revealed of the genotypes using SNP markers will be important for future studies using genome-wide selection and genomic association to develop cultivars of macauba with desirable traits, such as high yield of fruits and oil production.

AB The northward expansion of round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) in the Mediterranean Sea, together with declines and fluctuations in biomass and landings of European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) observed in recent decades, may suggest potential inter-specific competition in the pelagic domain. The coexistence of sympatric zooplanktivorous fish species might therefore be exposed in part to trophic niche overlap and competition for food. Combining visual diet characterization under the microscope with DNA metabarcoding from stomach contents of fish collected in spring results show that predation on relatively large krill is equally important for sardinella than for the other two niche overlapping species. Furthermore, an important overlap is found in their isotopic niche, especially with anchovy, using nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotopes in muscle tissue. In fact, the three fish species are able to feed effectively in the whole prey size spectrum available during the sampled season, from the smallest diatoms and copepods to the larger prey (i.e., decapods and euphausiids), including fish larvae. Moreover, effective predation upon other large prey like siphonophores, which is observed only when multi-proxy analyses in stomach contents are applied, might also be relevant in the diet of sardinella. The overlapping diet composition in spring, together with the effective use of food resource by sardinella, can be of special interest in potential future scenarios with warmer water temperature leading to lower zooplankton and/or higher jellyfish availability, where sardinella may take advantage over other species due to its feeding plasticity.

AB The Patagonia region encompasses pristine ecosystems developed under cold climates. The effect of global warming in the region has not been fully assessed. The objective of this study was to identify susceptible areas to an increase in temperature affecting soil organic carbon mineralization and therefore carbon dioxide emissions. Soil carbon stocks were inferred from land use data obtained from the regional inventory, and regional temperatures were analyzed using Terra moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer images in PCI-Geomatica and Idrisi-Selva softwares. Temperature data (monthly, 2000-2012) were classified as: below 1 degrees C, 1-4 degrees C, > 4-10 degrees C, >10-20 degrees C and > 20 degrees C. Areas of fragility to soil C mineralization were classified according to the potential response of soil biological activity to the temperature (at 4 degrees C threshold). The classes analyzed were classified as Fragile-1, being colder and more responsive than Fragile-2 and Fragile-3 categories. Areas of first concern fragility to carbon decomposition occupied around 145,750 ha, representing about 1% of the natural ecosystems of the region. Over 60% of these areas are covered by peatlands. Projections indicate that these fragile ecosystems will be subjected to temperature increases of 1.0 to 1.5 degrees C in the medium term and to 1.5 to 2.0 degrees C in the long term, respectively, in the scenario RCP-4.5 of climate change. Under a more severe scenario (RCP-8.5), temperatures will rise + 0.5 degrees C over the RCP-4.5. The information provided here will address future research and support policy making decisions for the region.

AB Plants are frequently exposed to prolonged and intense drought events. To survive, species must implement strategies to overcome progressive drought while maintaining sufficient resources to sustain the recovery of functions. Our objective was to understand how stress rate development modulates energy reserves and affects the recovery process. Grenache Vitis vinifera cultivar was exposed to either fast-developing drought (within few days; FDD), typical of pot experiments, or slow-developing drought (few weeks, SDD), more typical for natural conditions. FDD was characterized by fast (2-3 days) stomatal closure in response to increased stress level, high abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in xylem sap (>400 mu g L-1) without the substantial changes associated with stem priming for recovery (no accumulation of sugar or drop in xylem sap pH). In contrast, SDD was characterized by gradual stomatal closure, low ABA accumulation (<100 mu g L-1) and changes that primed the stem for recovery (xylem sap acidification from 6 to 5.5 pH and sugar accumulation from 1 to 3 g L-1). Despite FDD and SDD demonstrating similar trends over time in the recovery of stomatal conductance, they differed in their sensitivity to xylem ABA. Grenache showed near-isohydric and near-anisohydric behavior depending on the rate of drought progression, gauging the risk between hydraulic integrity and photosynthetic gain. The isohydry observed during FDD could potentially provide protection from large sudden swings in tension, while transitioning to anisohydry during SDD could prioritize the maintenance of photosynthetic activity over hydraulic security.

AB Genes that have no homologous sequences with other species are called lineage-specific genes (LSGs), are common in living organisms, and have an important role in the generation of new functions, adaptive evolution and phenotypic alteration of species. Camellia sinensis var. sinensis (CSS) is one of the most widely distributed cultivars for quality green tea production. The rich catechins in tea have antioxidant, free radical elimination, fat loss and cancer prevention potential. To further understand the evolution and utilize the function of LSGs in tea, we performed a comparative genomics approach to identify Camellia-specific genes (CSGs). Our result reveals that 1701 CSGs were identified specific to CSS, accounting for 3.37% of all protein-coding genes. The majority of CSGs (57.08%) were generated by gene duplication, and the time of duplication occurrence coincide with the time of two genome-wide replication (WGD) events that happened in CSS genome. Gene structure analysis revealed that CSGs have shorter gene lengths, fewer exons, higher GC content and higher isoelectric point. Gene expression analysis showed that CSG had more tissue-specific expression compared to evolutionary conserved genes (ECs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) showed that 18 CSGs are mainly associated with catechin synthesis-related pathways, including phenylalanine biosynthesis, biosynthesis of amino acids, pentose phosphate pathway, photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Besides, we found that the expression of three CSGs (CSS0030246, CSS0002298, and CSS0030939) was significantly down-regulated in response to both types of stresses (salt and drought). Our study first systematically identified LSGs in CSS, and comprehensively analyzed the features and potential functions of CSGs. We also identified key candidate genes, which will provide valuable assistance for further studies on catechin synthesis and provide a molecular basis for the excavation of excellent germplasm resources.

AB Small, isolated populations present a challenge for conservation. The dueling effects of selection and drift in a limited pool of genetic diversity make the responses of small populations to environmental perturbations erratic and difficult to predict. This is particularly true at the edge of a species range, where populations often persist at the limits of their environmental tolerances. Populations of cisco, Coregonus artedi, in inland lakes have experienced numerous extirpations along the southern edge of their range in recent decades, which are thought to result from environmental degradation and loss of cold, well-oxygenated habitat as lakes warm. Yet, cisco extirpations do not show a clear latitudinal pattern, suggesting that local environmental factors and potentially local adaptation may influence resilience. Here, we used genomic tools to investigate the nature of this pattern of resilience. We used restriction site-associated DNA capture (Rapture) sequencing to survey genomic diversity and differentiation in southern inland lake cisco populations and compared the frequency of deleterious mutations that potentially influence fitness across lakes. We also examined haplotype diversity in a region of the major histocompatibility complex involved in stress and immune system response. We correlated these metrics to spatial and environmental factors including latitude, lake size, and measures of oxythermal habitat and found significant relationships between genetic metrics and broad and local factors. High levels of genetic differentiation among populations were punctuated by a phylogeographic break and residual patterns of isolation-by-distance. Although the prevalence of deleterious mutations and inbreeding coefficients was significantly correlated with latitude, neutral and non-neutral genetic diversity were most strongly correlated with lake surface area. Notably, differences among lakes in the availability of estimated oxythermal habitat left no clear population genomic signature. Our results shed light on the complex dynamics influencing these isolated populations and provide valuable information for their conservation.

AB Understanding facial signals in humans and other species is crucial for understanding the evolution, complexity, and function of the face as a communication tool. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) enables researchers to measure facial movements accurately, but we currently lack tools to reliably analyse data and efficiently communicate results. Network analysis can provide a way to use the information encoded in FACS datasets: by treating individual AUs (the smallest units of facial movements) as nodes in a network and their co-occurrence as connections, we can analyse and visualise differences in the use of combinations of AUs in different conditions. Here, we present 'NetFACS', a statistical package that uses occurrence probabilities and resampling methods to answer questions about the use of AUs, AU combinations, and the facial communication system as a whole in humans and non-human animals. Using highly stereotyped facial signals as an example, we illustrate some of the current functionalities of NetFACS. We show that very few AUs are specific to certain stereotypical contexts; that AUs are not used independently from each other; that graph-level properties of stereotypical signals differ; and that clusters of AUs allow us to reconstruct facial signals, even when blind to the underlying conditions. The flexibility and widespread use of network analysis allows us to move away from studying facial signals as stereotyped expressions, and towards a dynamic and differentiated approach to facial communication.

AB Advances in data-logging technologies have provided a way to monitor the movement of individual animals at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. When used in conjunction with social network analyses, these data can provide deep insight into the structure and dynamics of animal social systems. Emergence of these new technologies demands concomitant progress in workflows to translate data streams from automated systems to social networks, based on biologically relevant metrics. Here we outline key considerations for constructing social networks from automated telemetry data. We highlight the need for paying particular attention to the spatial arrangement of receiver stations with respect to the ecology of study system and developing appropriate criteria for quantifying associations. We provide a case study for constructing social networks from automated telemetry data collected over 1 month during a study of acorn woodpeckers Melanerpes formicivorus, a cooperatively breeding bird. The data consisted of detections of known birds near receiver stations placed within core areas of group territories. We use this system to demonstrate how to build social networks to investigate biological questions about patterns of associations between group members and territory visitors across the landscape.

AB Forest ecosystems are increasingly challenged by extreme events, for example, drought, storms, pest attacks, and fungal pathogen outbreaks, causing severe ecological and economic losses. Understanding the genetic basis of adaptive traits in tree species is of key importance to preserve forest ecosystems, as genetic variation in a trait (i.e., heritability) determines its potential for human-mediated or evolutionary change. Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), a conifer widely distributed in southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa, grows under contrasted environmental conditions promoting local adaptation. Genetic variation at adaptive phenotypes, including height, spring phenology, and susceptibility to two fungal pathogens (Diplodia sapinea and Armillaria ostoyae) and an insect pest (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), was assessed in a range-wide clonal common garden of maritime pine. Broad-sense heritability was significant for height (0.219), spring phenology (0.165-0.310), and pathogen susceptibility (necrosis length caused by D. sapinea, 0.152; and by A. ostoyae, 0.021, measured on inoculated, excised branches under controlled conditions), but not for pine processionary moth incidence in the common garden. The correlations of trait variation among populations revealed contrasting trends for pathogen susceptibility to D. sapinea and A. ostoyae with respect to height. Taller trees showed longer necrosis length caused by D. sapinea while shorter trees were more affected by A. ostoyae. Moreover, maritime pine populations from areas with high summer temperatures and frequent droughts were less susceptible to D. sapinea but more susceptible to A. ostoyae. Finally, an association study using 4227 genome-wide SNPs revealed several loci significantly associated with each trait (range of 3-26), including a possibly disease-induced translation initiation factor, eIF-5, associated with needle discoloration caused by D. sapinea. This study provides important insights to develop genetic conservation and breeding strategies integrating species responses to biotic stressors.

AB It is conventionally assumed that conserved pathways evolve slowly with little participation of gene evolution. Nevertheless, it has been recently observed that young genes can take over fundamental functions in essential biological processes, for example, development and reproduction. It is unclear how newly duplicated genes are integrated into ancestral networks and reshape the conserved pathways of important functions. Here, we investigated origination and function of two autosomal genes that evolved recently in Drosophila: Poseidon and Zeus, which were created by RNA-based duplications from the X-linked CAF40, a subunit of the conserved CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex involved in posttranscriptional and translational regulation. Knockdown and knockout assays show that the two genes quickly evolved critically important functions in viability and male fertility. Moreover, our transcriptome analysis demonstrates that the three genes have a broad and distinct effect in the expression of hundreds of genes, with almost half of the differentially expressed genes being perturbed exclusively by one paralog, but not the others. Co-immunoprecipitation and tethering assays show that the CAF40 paralog Poseidon maintains the ability to interact with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and might act in posttranscriptional mRNA regulation. The rapid gene evolution in the ancient posttranscriptional and translational regulatory system may be driven by evolution of sex chromosomes to compensate for the meiotic X chromosomal inactivation (MXCI) in Drosophila.

AB Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) has become an important tool during the COVID-19 pandemic, however the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater treatment plant influent (WWTP) and cases in the community is not welldefined. We report here the development of a national WBE program across 28 WWTPs serving 50% of the population of Scotland, including large conurbations, as well as low-density rural and remote island communities. For each WWTP catchment area, we quantified spatial and temporal relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and COVID-19 cases. Daily WWTP SARS-CoV-2 influent viral RNA load, calculated using daily influent flow rates, had the strongest correlation (rho > 0.9) with COVID-19 cases within a catchment. As the incidence of COVID19 cases within a community increased, a linear relationship emerged between cases and influent viral RNA load. There were significant differences between WWTPs in their capacity to predict case numbers based on influent viral RNA load, with the limit of detection ranging from 25 cases for larger plants to a single case in smaller plants. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load can be used to predict the number of cases detected in the WWTP catchment area, with a clear statistically significant relationship observed above site-specific case thresholds.

AB The process responsible for the formation of genetically distinct populations associated with different host species is known as host-associated differentiation (HAD). Many insect parasites of plants have been shown to exhibit HAD but there have been fewer studies of HAD in parasites of vertebrate animals. Previous to this study, HAD has been documented in at least three species of ticks. The American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (Acari: Ixodidae) was chosen as the focal species for this study due to its importance as the vector of tularemia and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Previous population genetic studies of this tick found the existence of various haplotypes but the tick's host origins were unknown. In this study, ticks were collected from 15 vertebrate host species to test for HAD using single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs). In total, 136 individual D. variabilis ticks were sequenced using ddRADseq. Genomic evidence was found to point to D. variabilis exhibiting HAD on eight different hosts. A STRUCTURE analysis showed that the highest posterior probability was obtained with a population size of eight and these populations correlated with host species. Pairwise F-ST values were as high as 0.622 and indicated a range of genetic distinction between host groups. In addition, ticks collected from the vegetation appeared as one homogenous distinct genotype suggesting the existence of nidicolous (nest dwelling) and non-nidicolous genotypes. The identification of host race formation occurring in this animal parasite has implications for the understanding of D. variabilis pathogen transmission and targeted control efforts because genetically distinct populations can differ in traits relevant to these applications.

AB The Antarctic green alga Chlamydomonas sp. UWO241 is an obligate psychrophile that thrives in the cold (4-6 degrees C) but is unable to survive at temperatures >= 18 degrees C. Little is known how exposure to heat affects its physiology or whether it mounts a heat stress response in a manner comparable to mesophiles. Here, we dissect the responses of UWO241 to temperature stress by examining its growth, primary metabolome and transcriptome under steady-state low temperature and heat stress conditions. In comparison with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, UWO241 constitutively accumulates metabolites and proteins commonly considered as stress markers, including soluble sugars, antioxidants, polyamines, and heat shock proteins to ensure efficient protein folding at low temperatures. We propose that this results from life at extreme conditions. A shift from 4 degrees C to a non-permissive temperature of 24 degrees C alters the UWO241 primary metabolome and transcriptome, but growth of UWO241 at higher permissive temperatures (10 and 15 degrees C) does not provide enhanced heat protection. UWO241 also fails to induce the accumulation of HSPs when exposed to heat, suggesting that it has lost the ability to fine-tune its heat stress response. Our work adds to the growing body of research on temperature stress in psychrophiles, many of which are threatened by climate change.

AB Social animals face daily challenges to fulfil feeding, resting and social needs. In vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, females are the core of the social group, in which relationships are mainly established and maintained through grooming. However, social relationships are not necessarily mutual or driven by the same interests. In a complex and diverse social environment, individuals may benefit from the ability to adapt their manoeuvring to different pressures. We experimentally manipulated the activity budget of two adult females (fed subjects) per group in four wild groups to investigate activity budgets, grooming behaviour variation and the implications for possible changes in social interactions. Specifically, we provisioned food to one fed subject at a time for 2 weeks (treatment), evaluated changes in their grooming behaviour before, during and after being fed, and compared their behaviour with that of the remaining adult females in the group (nonfed subjects) over the same period. In the provisioning phase, the fed subjects decreased feeding time, but increased resting and social time. We found that fed subjects increased their grooming strength and ratio of grooming given to received and showed preferences to groom existing partners, kin and adult females. Moreover, we found no carryover effect of provisioning on grooming strength after the treatment terminated. Our results demonstrate rapid social behaviour plasticity following manipulation of ecological conditions for specific female individuals, allowing for flexible shifts in grooming patterns that hint at Machiavellian-like adjustments that may help achieve social benefits through, at least partially, restructuring their social network when experimentally released from daily feeding obligations.

AB Additive partitioning of species diversity is a valuable approach for quantifying the spatial patterns of biodiversity sampled in hierarchically scaled studies. This approach may provide key insights into vegetation community restoration following terrestrial ecosystems degradation in different climatic conditions. The scale-dependence of plant diversity in relation to different plant functional groups (e.g., herbaceous and woody) is still little understood. This research aims to investigate the influence of management options (protected vs. non-protected) and climatic conditions (semiarid vs. Mediterranean) on different components of diversity in both herbaceous and woody species derived from local and regional scales (i.e., plot and site, respectively). In the studied areas, a total of 64 plots (1000 m(2)) at local scale and 128 micro-plots (1 m(2)) among 16 sites at regional scale were selected for sampling the woody and herbaceous species data, respectively, by using a hierarchical sampling design. Diversity components of local (alpha 1, beta 1) and regional (alpha 2, beta 2) scales were extracted according to additive partitioning method. Differences in diversity component (alpha 1, alpha 21, beta 1 and beta 2) and floristic composition between management options and climatic conditions were evaluated using GLMM and DCA. The results indicate that all components of total species (both herbaceous and woody) diversity (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2) were significantly influenced by management options (p < 0.05) with greater values in the protected areas than the non-protected areas. However, the climatic conditions only had significant effects on beta 2, with greater values in the Mediterranean compared to semi-arid areas. Moreover, the separate analysis of herbaceous and woody species indicated that management options have a greater significant effect on different diversity components compared to the climatic condition. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that floristic variations along the axes are strongly affected by management in both climatic conditions. This indicates that protection measures mostly increased plant species diversity at the local and regional scales, which is independent of the climatic condition.

AB The software program STRUCTURE is one of the most cited tools for determining population structure. To infer the optimal number of clusters from STRUCTURE output, the Delta K method is often applied. However, a recent study relying on simulated microsatellite data suggested that this method has a downward bias in its estimation of K and is sensitive to uneven sampling. If this finding holds for empirical data sets, conclusions about the scale of gene flow may have to be revised for a large number of studies. To determine the impact of method choice, we applied recently described estimators of K to re-estimate genetic structure in 41 empirical microsatellite data sets; 15 from a broad range of taxa and 26 from one phylogenetic group, coral. We compared alternative estimates of K (Puechmaille statistics) with traditional (Delta K and posterior probability) estimates and found widespread disagreement of estimators across data sets. Thus, one estimator alone is insufficient for determining the optimal number of clusters; this was regardless of study organism or evenness of sampling scheme. Subsequent analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) did not necessarily clarify which clustering solution was best. To better infer population structure, we suggest a combination of visual inspection of STRUCTURE plots and calculation of the alternative estimators at various thresholds in addition to Delta K. Disagreement between traditional and recent estimators may have important biological implications, such as previously unrecognized population structure, as was the case for many studies reanalysed here.

AB Climate change risk assessments are essential for the successful conservation and management of species under future climates. However, many management plans fail to include such assessments when evaluating threats to species or ecological communities. Species distribution models (SDMs) are versatile tools that can estimate species exposure to shifts in climate, but they lack information on the response capacity of species to climate change. Functional traits can be used in conjunction with SDMs to understand aspects of species biology that would suggest sensitivity to climate change. We illustrate how exposure to climate change and sensitivity of species based on their traits can be combined to generate predictions of climate change risk in four species listed as threatened (under state and federal legislation) and four unlisted plant species from the endemic Australian genus Persoonia (Proteaceae). We develop distribution models for each species using two emissions scenarios and assess four traits and two range metrics that are recognized as limiting factors in four potential climate change responses (reproduction, movement capability, habitat specialization, and spatial coverage) to assess the sensitivity of these eight species to climate change. Listed and unlisted species varied in niche breadth, environmental envelopes, and the percent contribution of variables to the model building process. Our models project a significant decline in habitat suitability under future climates at current occurrence locations for all species, and a 32-95% reduction in the total area (km2) of suitable habitat for all species by 2060, with significantly greater decline under the higher emissions scenario. Seven out of the eight species assessed ranked high for overall climate sensitivity therefore listing status may be a poor indicator of climate change risk to plant species. This has important implications for the continued focus on threatened taxa in conservation planning, particularly for hyper-diverse groups like plants and invertebrates where a species listing status is influenced by an oftenslow progress towards comprehensive assessments of threat status.

AB Domestication of teleost fish is a recent development, and in most cases started less than 50 years ago. Shedding light on the genomic changes in key economic traits during the domestication process can provide crucial insights into the evolutionary processes involved and help inform selective breeding programmes. Here we report on the recent domestication of a native marine teleost species in New Zealand, the Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus). Specifically, we use genome-wide data from a three-generation pedigree of this species to uncover genetic signatures of domestication selection for growth. Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) was used to generate genome-wide SNP data from a three-generation pedigree to calculate generation-wide averages of FST between every generation pair. The level of differentiation between generations was further investigated using ADMIXTURE analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). After that, genome scans using Bayescan, LFMM and XP-EHH were applied to identify SNP variants under putative selection following selection for growth. Finally, genes near candidate SNP variants were annotated to gain functional insights. Analysis showed that between generations FST values slightly increased as generational time increased. The extent of these changes was small, and both ADMIXTURE analysis and PCA were unable to form clear clusters. Genome scans revealed a number of SNP outliers, indicative of selection, of which a small number overlapped across analyses methods and populations. Genes of interest within proximity of putative selective SNPs were related to biological functions, and revealed an association with growth, immunity, neural development and behaviour, and tumour repression. Even though few genes overlapped between outlier SNP methods, gene functionalities showed greater overlap between methods. While the genetic changes observed were small in most cases, a number of outlier SNPs could be identified, of which some were found by more than one method. Multiple outlier SNPs appeared to be predominately linked to gene functionalities that modulate growth and survival. Ultimately, the results help to shed light on the genomic changes occurring during the early stages of domestication selection in teleost fish species such as snapper, and will provide useful candidates for the ongoing selective breeding in the future of this and related species.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the congruence of adolescent- and therapist-rated therapeutic alliance, and to explore which rating or combination of ratings would predict treatment outcome or premature termination. We also studied whether the alliance changes over the course of treatment and if the change is related to the outcome or dropout. This study comprised 58 adolescents clinically referred for psychotherapeutic interventions. The alliance (Working Alliance Inventory, patient/therapist ratings) and treatment outcomes (Beck Depression Inventory, Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure) were measured at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. The alliance did not change significantly over the course of therapy, but adolescent and therapist ratings did not correlate. Low values in the early assessment of adolescent-rated alliance and discrepancy between the ratings were significant predictors of undesirable treatment outcome. Weak adolescent- or therapist-rated alliance later in treatment and change for the worse in adolescent-rated alliance was associated with treatment dropout. As adolescent-rated alliance predicts treatment outcome better than therapist-rated alliance, therapists should frequently use assessments of therapeutic relationship within the therapy and pay attention if the adolescent feels the alliance is weakening or his/her evaluation is contrary to the therapist's.

AB Organisms modify their geographical distributions in response to changes in environmental conditions, or modify their affinity to such conditions, to avoid extinction. This study explored the altitudinal shift of Abies pinsapo Boiss. in the Baetic System. We analysed the potential distribution of the realised and reproductive niches of A. pinsapo populations in the Ronda Mountains (Southern Spain) by using species distribution models (SDMs) for two life stages within the current populations. Then, we calculated the species' potential altitudinal shifts and identified the areas in which the processes of persistence and migration predominated. The realised and reproductive niches of A. pinsapo are different to one another, which may indicate a displacement in its altitudinal distribution owing to changes in the climatic conditions of the Ronda Mountains. The most unfavourable conditions for the species indicate a trailing edge (~110 m) at the lower limit of its distribution and a leading edge (~55 m) at the upper limit. Even though the differences in the altitudinal shifts between the trailing and leading edges will not cause the populations to become extinct in the short term, they may threaten their viability if the conditions that are producing the contraction at the lower limit persist in the long term.

AB This study evaluated the CO2 sequestration potential with combustion ashes in the aqueous phase. The aim was to provide a cost-effective carbon sequestration method for combustion unit operators (flue gas cleaning) or biogas producers (biogas upgrading). Therefore, two separate test series were executed to identify the carbonation efficiency (CE) of bottom wood ash (1) at different mixing ratios with water in batch experiments and (2) under dynamic flow conditions. It was furthermore evaluated whether subsequent use of the carbonated wood ash for soil amendment could be possible and whether the process water could be passed into the sewage. The batch test series showed that different mixing ratios of wood ash and water had an influence on the CE. The flow series showed that the mean CE varied between approximately 14% and 17%. Thus, the ash proved to be suitable for carbonation processes. The process water was dischargeable, and the carbonated wood ash has potential for chalking, as no legal thresholds were exceeded. Therefore, wood ash carbonation could be used as a low-tech CO2 sequestration technology. Compared to existing energy consuming and cost intensive carbon capture and storage technologies, sequestration with ash could be beneficial, as it represents a low-tech approach.

AB Due to the imperfect fidelity of DNA replication, somatic cells acquire DNA mutations at each division which record their lineage history. Microsatellites, tandem repeats of DNA nucleotide motifs, mutate more frequently than other genomic regions and by observing microsatellite lengths in single cells and implementing suitable inference procedures, the cell lineage tree of an organism can be reconstructed. Due to recent advances in single cell Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and the phylogenetic methods used to infer lineage trees, this work investigates which computational approaches best exploit the lineage information found in single cell NGS data. We simulated trees representing cell division with mutating microsatellites, and tested a range of available phylogenetic algorithms to reconstruct cell lineage. We found that distance-based approaches are fast and accurate with fully observed data. However, Maximum Parsimony and the computationally intensive probabilistic methods are more robust to missing data and therefore better suited to reconstructing cell lineage from NGS datasets. We also investigated how robust reconstruction algorithms are to different tree topologies and mutation generation models. Our results show that the flexibility of Maximum Parsimony and the probabilistic approaches mean they can be adapted to allow good reconstruction across a range of biologically relevant scenarios.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a fundamental tool for evaluating the environmental and energy load of a production cycle. Its application to renewable energy production systems offers the possibility of identifying the environmental benefits of such processes-especially those related to the by-products of production processes (i.e., digestion or biochar). Biochar has received worldwide interest because of its potential uses in bioenergy production, due to its coproducts (bio-oil and syngas), as well as in global warming mitigation, sustainable agriculture, pollutant removal, and other uses. Biochar production and use of soil is a strategy for carbon sequestration that could contribute to the reduction of emissions, providing simultaneous benefits to soil and opportunities for bioenergy generation. However, to confirm all of biochar's benefits, it is necessary to characterize the environmental and energy loads of the production cycle. In this work, soil carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emissions, use of fertilizers, and use of water for irrigation have been considered in the biochar's LCA, where the latter is used as a soil conditioner. Primary data taken from experiments and prior studies, as well as open-source available databases, were combined to evaluate the environmental impacts of energy production from biomass, as well as the biochar life cycle, including pre- and post-conversion processes. From the found results, it can be deduced that the use of gasification production of energy and biochar is an attractive strategy for mitigating the environmental impacts analyzed here-especially climate change, with a net decrease of about -8.3 x 10(3) kg CO2 eq. Finally, this study highlighted strategic research developments that combine the specific characteristics of biochar and soil that need to be amended.

AB Sensor technologies, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), produce huge amounts of data by tracking animal locations with high temporal resolution. Due to this high resolution, all animals show at least some co-occurrences, and the pure presence or absence of co-occurrences is not satisfactory for social network construction. Further, tracked animal contacts contain noise due to measurement errors or random co-occurrences. To identify significant associations, null models are commonly used, but the determination of an appropriate null model for GNSS data by maintaining the autocorrelation of tracks is challenging, and the construction is time and memory consuming. Bioinformaticians encounter phylogenetic background and random noise on sequencing data. They estimate this noise directly on the data by using the average product correction procedure, a method applied to information-theoretic measures. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) data of heifers in a pasture, we performed a proof of concept that this approach can be transferred to animal science for social network construction. The approach outputs stable results for up to 30% missing data points, and the predicted associations were in line with those of the null models. The effect of different distance thresholds for contact definition was marginal, but animal activity strongly affected the network structure.

AB Mammals are important components of biodiversity that have been drastically and rapidly impacted by climate change, habitat loss, and anthropogenic pressure. Understanding key species distribution to optimize conservation targets is both urgent and necessary to reverse the current biodiversity crisis. Herein, we applied habitat suitability models for a key Neotropical forest ungulate, the white-lipped peccary (WLP Tayassu pecari), to investigate the effects of climate and landscape modifications on its distribution, which has been drastically reduced in Brazil. We used 318 primary records of WLP to derive habitat suitability maps across Brazil. Our models included bioclimatic, topographic, landscape, and human influence predictors in two modelling approaches. Models including all categories of predictors obtained the highest predictive ability and showed prevalence of suitable areas in forested regions of the country, covering 49% of the Brazilian territory. Filtering out small forest fragments (<2050 ha) reduced the suitable area by 5%, with a further reduction of 4% that was caused by deforestation until 2020, therefore until 2020, the species has suffered a reduction of similar to 60% from its historical range in Brazil. Of the 40% of the Brazilian territory suitable to WLP, only 12% is protected. In the Atlantic Forest, only half of all protected areas have suitable habitat for WLP and even less in Pantanal (44%), Cerrado (14%) and Caatinga (7%). In a second modelling approach, mapping the areas with suitable climate and those with suitable landscapes separately, allowed us to identify four categories of conservation values, and showed that only 17% of the Brazilian territory has both high landscape and climatic suitability for WLP. Our models can help inform complementary conservation management strategies and actions that could be essential in slowing down and possibly reversing current trends of population and geographic range reductions for the species, thereby averting a possible future collapse of forest ecosystem functioning in the Neotropical region.

AB Internal water storage in the stem provides additional water for transpiration and photosynthesis and thus ensures tree hydraulic safety and growth under stressed conditions. Comprehensive understandings in elevationand species-specific patterns of stem water relations and the underlying mechanism could shed light on the physiological foundation of forest conservation and management in the montane area. Here, stem radius variations of co-occurring Larix principis-rupprechtii and Picea meyeri were monitored at three sites of different elevations (2200 m, 2400 m, and 2600 m a.s.L.) in 2018 and 2019 using point dendrometers. The seasonal cycle was divided into four periods: spring rehydration, summer growth, autumn contraction, and winter dormancy. Tree water deficit-induced stem shrinkage (TWD) during the summer growth and daily stem cycles in each period were extracted and compared between species and among elevations, and their responses to environmental factors were determined. The results showed an elevational trend for averaged TWD in L. principis-rupprechtii instead of P. meyeri. TWD in both tree species had a closer relationship with vapor pressure deficit (VPD), while the TWD showed piecewise changes with species-specific differences as the VPD increased. The daily amplitude of L. principis-rupprechtii was smaller than that of P. meyeri in periods of winter dormancy and spring rehydration, however, the comparison was opposite during summer growth and autumn contraction. Furthermore, the daily amplitude of L. principis-rupprechtii and P. meyeri had different responses to the air and soil hydrothermal conditions in different periods over the year. Our study highlights interspecific water-use behaviors between larch and spruce, indicating their contrasting responses to a global increase in drought stress, especially in low elevations.

AB Within-group competition over food resources can be a major cost of social living. In the wild, foragers are confronted with social (e.g. hierarchical rank) and ecological (e.g. food availability and distribution) challenges that affect their foraging decisions and feeding success. Exhibiting prosocial behaviours, such as tolerance at feeding sites, can benefit group members by developing affiliative social relationships, enhancing access to resources and maximizing fitness. We examined social tolerance at feeding sites in Callithrix jacchus, a cooperatively breeding primate species. We investigated the set of social (rank, age and sex) and ecological (food availability) factors that influence the structure and dynamics of within-group foraging association networks. We designed and conducted an experimental field study of four wild groups of common marmosets in which we controlled food distribution (concentrated or scattered) and productivity (high, medium or low food rewards). Then, we used social network analyses to assess the number and strength of foraging associations among group members, their effects on individual food consumption, and whether recent experiences with conspecifics during foraging affected subsequent associations. Overall, common marmoset foraging association networks were cohesive, as group members jointly occupied feeding sites. The number and strength of associations varied depending on the ecological context. Associations were stronger during conditions in which food was concentrated at a single site. Individuals obtained greater access to food resources when sharing a feeding site with conspecifics, but once a food item was obtained, the forager moved to a nearby tree and consumed it away from others. Additionally, the strength of previous foraging associations and subsequent levels of social tolerance at feeding sites were positively related, a relationship compatible with the ability of memorizing associations over time and recalling the information in future decision-making. In sum, marmosets adjusted their partner choices and the strength of foraging associations in response to food availability. They exhibited increased social tolerance at feeding sites during conditions in which opportunities for contest competition were expected to be greatest. These cooperative breeding primates appear to mutually benefit by maintaining cohesive and strong affiliative relationships, and by increasing opportunities for coordinated behaviour and offspring survival.

AB Few studies have examined the social behaviors of solitary animals, due to the rarity of observing interactions in the wild. We demonstrate how animal telemetry can be used to characterize individual social environments among a wild population of estuarine crocodiles. We discovered that crocodiles were more social than previously thought, where an individual's sex, degree of site-fidelity and proximity to the mating season influenced the degree of spatial overlap between potential mates and conspecifics.
   Examining the social behaviors of solitary species can be challenging due to the rarity in which interactions occur and the large and often inaccessible areas which these animals inhabit. As shared space-use is a prerequisite for the expression of social behaviors, we can gain insights into the social environments of solitary species by examining the degree of spatial overlap between individuals. Over a 10-year period, we examined how spatial overlap amongst 105 estuarine crocodiles Crocodylus porosus was influenced by season, sex, and movement tactic. We discovered that crocodiles displayed highly consistent spatial overlaps with conspecifics between months and across years. Furthermore, male crocodiles that exhibited a greater degree of site fidelity displayed more stable social environments, while females and males that were less site-attached had more dynamic social environments with spatial overlaps between conspecifics peaking during the mating season. Our results demonstrate how long-term tracking of multiple individuals within the same population can be used to quantify the spatial structure and social environment of cryptic and solitary species.

AB Chalcophaps is a morphologically conserved genus of ground-walking doves distributed from India to mainland China, south to Australia, and across the western Pacific to Vanuatu. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of this genus using DNA sequence data from two nuclear genes and one mitochondrial gene, sampled from throughout the geographic range of Chalcophaps. We find support for three major evolutionary lineages in our phylogenetic reconstruction, each corresponding to the three currently recognized Chalcophaps species. Despite this general concordance, we identify discordant mitochondrial and nuclear ancestries in the subspecies C. longirostris timorensis, raising further questions about the evolutionary history of this Timor endemic population. Within each of the three species, we find evidence for isolation by distance or hierarchical population structure, indicating an important role for geography in the diversification of this genus. Despite being distributed broadly across a highly fragmented geographic region known as a hotspot for avian diversification, the Chalcophaps doves show modest levels of phenotypic and genetic diversity, a pattern potentially explained by strong population connectivity owing to high overwater dispersal capability.

AB Plant response to soil and atmospheric water stresses is the dominant control of Dryland ecosystem functions, affecting water resources, ecosystem stability and biodiversity. The link between water stresses and plant water status is regulated by plant hydraulics, of which the corresponding impact on plant water use and the susceptibility of Dryland ecosystems remains under-explored. We used a plant hydraulic model to describe hydraulic states and water flux of two species (Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima) in desert riparian ecosystems. We optimized hydraulic parameters and tested the model using observed physiological states and ecosystem water flux. The optimized model was used to evaluate plant hydraulic sensitivity, tree mortality risk, and evapotranspiration under a wide range of water stress scenarios. The model captures the observed leaf water potential, sap-flow and ecosystem evapotranspiration. Our scenario analysis demonstrates that hydraulic sensitivities generally reduce as the water stresses intensify. The results highlight a strong coupled impact of the co-occurrence of soil and atmospheric water stresses on restricting ecosystem water flux and intensifying mortality risk. The assessment of multiple aspects of eco-physiological functions and the stress scenario analysis of desert riparian ecosystems will contribute to a better prediction of ecosystem functions and facilitate resource management under future climate.

AB Permutation tests are widely used to test null hypotheses with animal social network data, but suffer from high rates of type I and II error when the permutations do not properly simulate the intended null hypothesis. Two common types of permutations each have limitations. Pre-network (or datastream) permutations can be used to control 'nuisance effects' like spatial, temporal or sampling biases, but only when the null hypothesis assumes random social structure. Node (or node-label) permutation tests can test null hypotheses that include nonrandom social structure, but only when nuisance effects do not shape the observed network. We demonstrate one possible solution addressing these limitations: using pre-network permutations to adjust the values for each node or edge before conducting a node permutation test. We conduct a range of simulations to estimate error rates caused by confounding effects of social or non-social structure in the raw data. Regressions on simulated datasets suggest that this 'double permutation' approach is less likely to produce elevated error rates relative to using only node permutations, pre-network permutations or node permutations with simple covariates, which all exhibit elevated type I errors under at least one set of simulated conditions. For example, in scenarios where type I error rates from pre-network permutation tests exceed 30%, the error rates from double permutation remain at 5%. The double permutation procedure provides one potential solution to issues arising from elevated type I and type II error rates when testing null hypotheses with social network data. We also discuss alternative approaches that can provide robust inference, including fitting mixed effects models, restricted node permutations, testing multiple null hypotheses and splitting large datasets to generate replicated networks. Finally, we highlight ways that uncertainty can be explicitly considered and carried through the analysis.

AB Species confined to naturally fragmented habitats may exhibit intrinsic population complexity which may challenge interpretations of species response to anthropogenic landscape transformation. In South Africa, where native forests are naturally fragmented, forest-dependent birds have undergone range declines since 1992, most notably among insectivores. These insectivores appear sensitive to the quality of natural matrix habitats, and it is unknown whether transformation of the landscape matrix has disrupted gene flow in these species. We undertook a landscape genetics study of four forest-dependent insectivorous songbirds across southeast South Africa. Microsatellite data were used to conduct a priori optimization of landscape resistance surfaces (land cover, rivers and dams, and elevation) using cost-distances along least-cost pathway (LCP), and resistance distances (IBR). We detected pronounced declines in effective population sizes over the past two centuries for the endemic forest specialist Cossypha dichroa and Batis capensis, alongside recent gene flow disruption in B. capensis, C. dichroa and Pogonocichla stellata. Landscape resistance modelling showed both native forest and dense thicket configuration facilitates gene flow in P. stellata, B. capensis and C. dichroa. Facultative dispersal of P. stellata through dense thicket likely aided resilience against historic landscape transformation, whereas combined forest-thicket degradation adversely affected the forest generalist B. capensis. By contrast, Phylloscopus ruficapilla appears least reliant upon landscape features to maintain gene flow and was least impacted by anthropogenic landscape transformation. Collectively, gene flow in all four species is improved at lower elevations, along river valleys, and riparian corridors- where native forest and dense thicket better persist. Consistent outperformance of LCP over IBR land-cover models for P. stellata, B. capensis and C. dichroa demonstrates the benefits of wildlife corridors for South African forest-dependent bird conservation, to ameliorate the extinction debts from past and present anthropogenic forest exploitation.

AB Increasing frequency and severity of drought events is posing risks to trees' health, including those planted in urban settlements. Drought-induced decline of urban trees negatively affects ecosystem services of urban green spaces and implies cost for maintenance and removal of plants. We aimed at identifying physiological traits that can explain and predict the species-specific vulnerability to climate change in urban habitats. We assessed the relationships between long-term risk of decline of different tree species in a medium-sized town and their key indicators of drought stress tolerance, i.e. turgor loss point (TLP) and vulnerability to xylem embolism (P-50). Starting from 2012, the study area experienced several summer seasons with positive anomalies of temperature and negative anomalies of precipitation. This trend was coupled with increasing percentages of urban trees showing signs of crown die-back and mortality. The species-specific risk of decline was higher for species with less negative TLP and P-50 values. The relationship between species-specific risk of climate change-induced decline of urban trees and key physiological indicators of drought tolerance confirms findings obtained in natural forests and highlights that TLP and P-50 are useful indicators for species selection for tree plantation in towns, to mitigate negative impacts of climate change.

AB Time is running out to limit further devastating losses of biodiversity and nature's contributions to humans. Addressing this crisis requires accurate predictions about which species and ecosystems are most at risk to ensure efficient use of limited conservation and management resources. We review existing biodiversity projection models and discover problematic gaps. Current models usually cannot easily be reconfigured for other species or systems, omit key biological processes, and cannot accommodate feedbacks with Earth system dynamics. To fill these gaps, we envision an adaptable, accessible, and universal biodiversity modeling platform that can project essential biodiversity variables, explore the implications of divergent socioeconomic scenarios, and compare conservation and management strategies. We design a roadmap for implementing this vision and demonstrate that building this biodiversity forecasting platform is possible and practical.

AB Background Historical and ecological processes shape patterns of genetic diversity in plant species. Colonization to new environments and geographical landscape features determine, amongst other factors, genetic diversity within- and differentiation between-populations. We analyse the genetic diversity and population structure of Calibrachoa heterophylla to infer the influence of abiotic landscape features on the level of gene flow in this coastal species of the South Atlantic Coastal Plain. Results The C. heterophylla populations located on early-deposited coastal plain regions show higher genetic diversity than those closer to the sea. The genetic differentiation follows a pattern of isolation-by-distance. Landscape features, such as water bodies and wind corridors, and geographical distances equally explain the observed genetic differentiation, whereas the precipitation seasonality exhibits a strong signal for isolation-by-environment in marginal populations. The estimated levels of gene flow suggest that marginal populations had restricted immigration rates enhancing differentiation. Conclusions Topographical features related to coastal plain deposition history influence population differentiation in C. heterophylla. Gene flow is mainly restricted to nearby populations and facilitated by wind fields, albeit without any apparent influence of large water bodies. Furthermore, differential rainfall regimes in marginal populations seem to promote genetic differentiation.

AB Aim Genetic diversity is a major determinant for the capacity of species to persist and adapt to their environments. Unravelling the factors affecting genetic differentiation is crucial to understand how genetic diversity is shaped and species may react to changing environments. We investigated the drivers of genetic differentiation and their interplay with the evolutionary history in a wild pea to test how those may have affected the distribution of genetic diversity. Location Mediterranean basin, western Asia. Taxon Pisum sativum (Fabaceae). Methods We employed restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing of a collection of 81 wild pea samples. The influence of environmental factors on genetic differentiation was tested by estimating the association of these factors and genetic variation using gradient forest analysis. Stairwayplots were used to estimate past effective population sizes and clines of allele frequencies were analysed to detect past expansion patterns. Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with environmental variables was tested to find signatures of local adaptation. Results The effect of the tested factors influencing genetic differentiation was variable among genetic clusters. Climate predictors were most important in all clusters. Land cover was more important in clusters from areas strongly influenced by human land use. We found statistically significant associations of 3623 SNPs with environmental variables. Most of these SNPs were correlated with latitude followed by temperature. Wild peas went through a genetic bottleneck during the last glacial period followed by population recovery. The detected range expansion patterns suggested an eastward range expansion of the European cluster to Turkey and thereof southwards and eastwards. Main conclusion Drivers of genetic differentiation do not act in a uniform manner within a species. The distribution of genetic variation and the processes affecting this distribution have to be viewed in the context of the hierarchical structure of genetic variation and the environment of its entities to understand how genetic diversity was shaped and may change in the future.

AB Background: A One Health approach requires integrative research to elucidate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the environment and the risks it poses to human health. Research on this topic involves experts from diverse backgrounds and professions. Shortcomings exist in terms of consistent, complete, and transparent reporting in many environmental studies. Standardized reporting will improve the quality of scientific papers, enable meta-analyses and enhance the communication among different experts. In this study, we aimed to generate a consensus of reporting standards for AMR research in wastewater and related aquatic environments.
   Methods: Based on a risk of bias assessment of the literature in a systematic review, we proposed a set of study quality indicators. We then used a multistep modified Delphi consensus to develop the EMBRACE-WATERS statement (rEporting antiMicroBial ResistAnCE in WATERS), a checklist of recommendations for reporting in studies of AMR in wastewater and related aquatic environments.
   Findings: Consensus was achieved among a multidisciplinary panel of twenty-one experts in three steps. The developed EMBRACE-WATERS statement incorporates 21 items. Each item contains essential elements of high-quality reporting and is followed by an explanation of their rationale and a reporting-example. The EMBRACE-WATERS statement is primarily intended to be used by investigators to ensure transparent and comprehensive reporting of their studies. It can also guide peer-reviewers and editors in evaluation of manuscripts on AMR in the aquatic environment. This statement is not intended to be used to guide investigators on the methodology of their research.
   Interpretation: We are hopeful that this statement will improve the reporting quality of future studies of AMR in wastewater and related aquatic environments. Its uptake would generate a common language to be used among researchers from different disciplines, thus advancing the One Health approach towards understanding AMR spread across aquatic environments. Similar initiatives are needed in other areas of One Health research.

AB Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) on cropland has been proposed as a climate change mitigation strategy to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere, which in particular is needed to achieve the targets proposed in the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in atmospheric temperature to well below 2 degrees C. We analyze the historical evolution and future development of cropland SOC using the global process-based biophysical model LPJmL, which was recently extended by a detailed representation of tillage practices and residue management (version 5.0-tillage2). We find that model results for historical global estimates for SOC stocks are at the upper end of available literature, with similar to 2650 Pg C of SOC stored globally in the year 2018, similar to 170 Pg C of which is stored in cropland soils. In future projections, assuming no further changes in current cropland patterns and under four different management assumptions with two different climate forcings, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, results suggest that agricultural SOC stocks decline in all scenarios, as the decomposition of SOC outweighs the increase in carbon inputs into the soil from altered management practices. Different climate change scenarios, as well as assumptions on tillage management, play a minor role in explaining differences in SOC stocks. The choice of tillage practice explains between 0.2 % and 1.3 % of total cropland SOC stock change in the year 2100. Future dynamics in cropland SOC are most strongly controlled by residue management: whether residues are left on the field or harvested. We find that on current cropland, global cropland SOC stocks decline until the end of the century by only 1.0 % to 1.4 % if residue retention management systems are generally applied and by 26.7 % to 27.3 % in the case of residue harvest. For different climatic regions, increases in cropland SOC can only be found for tropical dry, warm temperate moist, and warm temperate dry regions in management systems that retain residues.

AB Classifying the diverse ways that plants respond to hydrologic stress into generalizable 'water-use strategies' has long been an eco-physiological research goal. While many schemes for describing water-use strategies have proven to be quite useful, they are also associated with uncertainties regarding their theoretical basis and their connection to plant carbon and water relations. In this review, we discuss the factors that shape plant water stress responses and assess the approaches used to classify a plant's water-use strategy, paying particular attention to the popular but controversial concept of a continuum from isohydry to anisohydry. A generalizable and predictive framework for assessing plant water-use strategies has been historically elusive, yet recent advances in plant physiology and hydraulics provide the field with a way past these obstacles. Specifically, we promote the idea that many metrics that quantify water-use strategies are highly dynamic and emergent from the interaction between plant traits and environmental conditions, and that this complexity has historically hindered the development of a generalizable water-use strategy framework. This idea is explored using a plant hydraulics model to identify: (a) distinct temporal phases in plant hydraulic regulation during drought that underpin dynamic water-use responses, and (b) how variation in both traits and environmental forcings can significantly alter common metrics used to characterize plant water-use strategies. This modelling exercise can bridge the divide between various conceptualizations of water-use strategies and provide targeted hypotheses to advance the understanding and quantification of plant water status regulation across spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we describe research frontiers that are necessary to improve the predictive capacity of the plant water-use strategy concept, including further investigation into the below-ground determinants of plant water relations, targeted data collection efforts and the potential to scale these concepts from individuals to whole regions.

AB We point out problems with the article Productivity beyond density: A critique of management models for reindeer pastoralism in Norway by Marin and co-workers published in Pastoralism in 2020. In our opinion, there are several misleading claims about the governance of the reindeer pastoralist system in Norway, the Roros model for herd management and density dependence in reindeer herds in their article. We point out the errors in their empirical re-evaluation of previous work on the relationship between reindeer densities and the productivity and slaughter weights in herds. These errors have a significant bearing on their conclusions. We agree that weather variability has a substantial impact on reindeer body mass growth, fecundity and survival, but disagree with Marin et al. when they argue that reindeer densities are of minor importance for reindeer productivity and animal welfare.

AB The southeastern United States is home to some of the richest biodiversity in the world. Over the last 200 years, however, rapid industrialization and urbanization have threatened many natural areas, including freshwater habitats. River impoundments have also rapidly altered freshwater habitats, often resulting in species extirpation or extinction. The Coosa River in Alabama experienced one of the largest faunal declines in modern history after impoundment, making it an ideal system for studying how invertebrate species are affected by reservoir creation. One such species, the Rough Hornsnail, Pleurocera foremani, is an endangered freshwater snail in the family Pleuroceridae. We sampled all known localities of P foremani and used 2bRAD-seq to measure genetic diversity. We assessed riverscape genomic patterns across the current range of P foremani and measured gene flow within and between impoundments. We also investigated the degree to which P foremani displays an isolation by distance pattern and conforms to broad hypotheses that have been put forth for population genetics of riverine species like the Mighty Headwater Hypothesis that predicts greater genetic diversity in headwater reaches compared with mainstem populations. Like most other freshwater species, a pattern of isolation by distance was observed in P foremani. We also found that Coosa River dams are a barrier to gene flow, and genetic fragmentation of P foremani is likely to increase. However, gene flow appeared common within reservoirs and tributaries. Additionally, we found that spatial genetic structure of P foremani deviates from what is expected under the Mighty Headwaters Hypothesis, adding to a growing body of research suggesting that the majority of genetic diversity in low-dispersing gastropods is found in mainstem populations.

AB The information about what one can see and what other people can see from different viewpoints is important. There are circumstances in which adults and children make systematic errors when predicting what is visible from their own or others' viewpoints. This happens for example when reasoning about mirrors. We explored differences among three developmental groups: young adults (N=60) typically developing children (N=30); and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N=30). We used an illustration of a top-down view of a room with a mirror on a wall (Room Observer and Mirror Perspective test: ROMP). Participants selected (circled on paper) which objects behind the observer in the room were visible, reflected from the mirror and from a given position (viewpoint). For half of each group, the observer in the room was described as a teddy bear; for the other half, it was described as a child. Overall, there were many errors in all groups, which we separate in errors of ignoring the viewpoint (same response to all three locations) and inversion errors (choosing objects on the left instead of the right or vice versa). In addition to the overall task difficulty, the ASD group made relatively more mistakes of ignoring the viewpoint compared to the other groups and underestimated how many objects were visible in the teddy bear condition that is when the viewpoint was an inanimate object. We suggest that this is related to a delay in theory of mind (ToM) development.

AB Many low-carbon scenarios rely on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to meet decarbonization goals. The feasibility of large-scale CDR deployment is highly uncertain, and existing scenarios have been criticized for overreliance on CDR. We conduct an expert survey on the feasible potential for CDR via bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture and afforestation. We use the survey results to represent uncertainty in future CDR availability and explore the implications in an integrated assessment model. Stochastic optimization demonstrates that uncertainty in future CDR availability provides a strong rationale to increase near-term rates of decarbonization. In scenarios with high CDR uncertainty, emissions are reduced by an additional 10 GtCO(2)e in 2030 compared with scenarios with no consideration of CDR uncertainty. This highlights the urgent need to increase ambition contained in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for 2030, to get the world on track to deliver 1.5 degrees C and to hedge against an uncertain future CDR potential.

AB Human face-to-face communication is multimodal: it comprises speech as well as visual cues, such as articulatory and limb gestures. In the current study, we assess how iconic gestures and mouth movements influence audiovisual word recognition. We presented video clips of an actress uttering single words accompanied, or not, by more or less informative iconic gestures. For each word we also measured the informativeness of the mouth movements from a separate lipreading task. We manipulated whether gestures were congruent or incongruent with the speech, and whether the words were audible or noise vocoded. The task was to decide whether the speech from the video matched a previously seen picture. We found that congruent iconic gestures aided word recognition, especially in the noise-vocoded condition, and the effect was larger (in terms of reaction times) for more informative gestures. Moreover, more informative mouth movements facilitated performance in challenging listening conditions when the speech was accompanied by gestures (either congruent or incongruent) suggesting an enhancement when both cues are present relative to just one. We also observed (a trend) that more informative mouth movements speeded up word recognition across clarity conditions, but only when the gestures were absent. We conclude that listeners use and dynamically weight the informativeness of gestures and mouth movements available during face-to-face communication.

AB The shell morphologies of the freshwater mussel species Pleurobema clava (federally endangered) and Pleurobema oviforme (species of concern) are similar, causing considerable taxonomic confusion between the two species over the last 100 years. While P. clava was historically widespread throughout the Ohio River basin and tributaries to the lower Laurentian Great Lakes, P. oviforme was confined to the Tennessee and the upper Cumberland River basins. We used two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes, 13 novel nuclear DNA microsatellite markers, and shell morphometrics to help resolve this taxonomic confusion. Evidence for a single species was apparent in phylogenetic analyses of each mtDNA gene, revealing monophyletic relationships with minimal differentiation and shared haplotypes. Analyses of microsatellites showed significant genetic structuring, with four main genetic clusters detected, respectively, in the upper Ohio River basin, the lower Ohio River and Great Lakes, and upper Tennessee River basin, and a fourth genetic cluster, which included geographically intermediate populations in the Ohio and Tennessee river basins. While principal components analysis (PCA) of morphometric variables (i.e., length, height, width, and weight) showed significant differences in shell shape, only 3% of the variance in shell shape was explained by nominal species. Using Linear Discriminant and Random Forest (RF) analyses, correct classification rates for the two species' shell forms were 65.5% and 83.2%, respectively. Random Forest classification rates for some populations were higher; for example, for North Fork Holston (HOLS), it was >90%. While nuclear DNA and shell morphology indicate that the HOLS population is strongly differentiated, perhaps indicative of cryptic biodiversity, we consider the presence of a single widespread species the most likely biological scenario for many of the investigated populations based on our mtDNA dataset. However, additional sampling of P. oviforme populations at nuclear loci is needed to corroborate this finding.

AB Whole genome sequencing is instrumental for the study of genome variation in natural populations, delivering important knowledge on genomic modifications and potential targets of natural selection at the population level. Large dormant eggbanks of aquatic invertebrates such as the keystone herbivore Daphnia, a microcrustacean widespread in freshwater ecosystems, provide detailed sedimentary archives to study genomic processes over centuries. To overcome the problem of limited DNA amounts in single Daphnia dormant eggs, we developed an optimized workflow for whole genome amplification (WGA), yielding sufficient amounts of DNA for downstream whole genome sequencing of individual historical eggs, including polyploid lineages. We compare two WGA kits, applied to recently produced Daphnia magna dormant eggs from laboratory cultures, and to historical dormant eggs of Daphnia pulicaria collected from Arctic lake sediment between 10 and 300 years old. Resulting genome coverage breadth in most samples was similar to 70%, including those from >100-year-old isolates. Sequence read distribution was highly correlated among samples amplified with the same kit, but less correlated between kits. Despite this, a high percentage of genomic positions with single nucleotide polymorphisms in one or more samples (maximum of 74% between kits, and 97% within kits) were recovered at a depth required for genotyping. As a by-product of sequencing we obtained 100% coverage of the mitochondrial genomes even from the oldest isolates (similar to 300 years). The mitochondrial DNA provides an additional source for evolutionary studies of these populations. We provide an optimized workflow for WGA followed by whole genome sequencing including steps to minimize exogenous DNA.

AB Understanding how species ranges shift as climates rapidly change informs us how to effectively conserve vulnerable species. Species distribution models (SDMs) are an important method for examining these range shifts. The tools for performing SDMs are ever improving. Here, we present the megaSDM R package. This package facilitates realistic spatiotemporal SDM analyses by incorporating dispersal probabilities, creating time-step maps of range change dynamics and efficiently handling large datasets and computationally intensive environmental subsampling techniques. Provided a list of species and environmental data, megaSDM synthesizes GIS processing, subsampling methods, MaxEnt modelling, dispersal rate restrictions and additional statistical tools to create a variety of outputs for each species, time period and climate scenario requested. For each of these, megaSDM generates a series of distribution maps and outputs visual representations of statistical data. megaSDM offers several advantages over other commonly used SDM tools. First, many of the functions in megaSDM natively implement parallelization, enabling the package to handle large amounts of data efficiently without the need for additional coding. megaSDM also implements environmental subsampling of occurrences, making the technique broadly available in a way that was not possible before due to computational considerations. Uniquely, megaSDM generates maps showing the expansion and contraction of a species range across all considered time periods (time-maps), and constrains both presence/absence and continuous suitability maps of species ranges according to species-specific dispersal constraints. The user can then directly compare non-dispersal and dispersal-limited distribution predictions. This paper discusses the unique features and highlights of megaSDM, describes the structure of the package and demonstrates the package's features and the model flow through examples.

AB Hybridization is among the evolutionary mechanisms most frequently hypothesized to drive the success of invasive species, in part because hybrids are common in invasive populations. One explanation for this pattern is that biological invasions coincide with a change in selection pressures that limit hybridization in the native range. To investigate this possibility, we studied the introduction of the brown anole (Anolis sagrei) in the southeastern United States. We find that native populations are highly genetically structured. In contrast, all invasive populations show evidence of hybridization among native-range lineages. Temporal sampling in the invasive range spanning 15 y showed that invasive genetic structure has stabilized, indicating that large-scale contemporary gene flow is limited among invasive populations and that hybrid ancestry is maintained. Additionally, our results are consistent with hybrid persistence in invasive populations resulting from changes in natural selection that occurred during invasion. Specifically, we identify a large-effect X chromosome locus associated with variation in limb length, a well-known adaptive trait in anoles, and show that this locus is often under selection in the native range, but rarely so in the invasive range. Moreover, we find that the effect size of alleles at this locus on limb length is much reduced in hybrids among divergent lineages, consistent with epistatic interactions. Thus, in the native range, epistasis manifested in hybrids can strengthen extrinsic postmating isolation. Together, our findings show how a change in natural selection can contribute to an increase in hybridization in invasive populations.

AB Previous research on the effects of word-level factors on lexical acquisition has shown that frequency and concreteness are most important. Here, we investigate CDI data from 1,030 Dutch children, collected with the short form of the Dutch CDI, to address (i) how word-level factors predict lexical acquisition, once child-level factors are controlled, (ii) whether effects of these word-level factors vary with word class and age, and (iii) whether any interactions with age are due to differences in receptive vocabulary. Mixed-effects regressions yielded effects of frequency and concreteness, but not of word class and phonological factors (e.g., word length, neighborhood density). The effect of frequency was stronger for nouns than predicates. The effects of frequency and concreteness decreased with age, and were not explained by differences in vocabulary knowledge. These findings extend earlier results to Dutch, and indicate that effects of age are not due to increases in vocabulary knowledge.

AB Key message Diffuse-porous Acer saccharum and ring-porous Carya ovata exhibit opposing isohydry and anisohydry, respectively, but physiological responses of four other species indicate a spectrum of hydraulic behaviors among co-existing mature temperate trees. Temperate forests maintain a high species abundance, yet we do not fully understand how co-existing temperate tree species differentially respond to water stress. The iso/anisohydric spectrum provides a framework for contextualizing and comparing hydraulic behavior. Using this framework, we wanted to understand how hydraulic behavior differs between several mature canopy-dominant tree species in a temperate deciduous forest. We assessed multiple hydraulic parameters across the 2019 growing season in three diffuse-porous species (Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Platanus occidentalis) and three ring-porous species (Quercus alba, Quercus rubra, and Carya ovata). We measured sap flux and leaf water potential, along with soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit over the growing season. We also collected pre-dawn leaf water potential measurements in July in addition to the mid-day measurements. Our data reveal a range of hydraulic behaviors from isohydric Acer saccharum at one end of the continuum, to anisohydric Carya ovata at the other end, with the other four species exhibiting intermediate hydraulic behaviors between these two "extremes". The range of hydraulic behaviors exhibited among co-existing temperate tree species suggests multiple strategies for coping with water stress within a single forest. Defining species-specific strategies will be important for predicting how the structure and composition of temperate forests may respond to changes in climate, particularly water availability.

AB Many ecosystems are grazed by livestock or large, wild herbivores and exist as mosaics of different vegetation communities. Changing grazing could have an impact on heterogeneity as well as on composition. A long-term, large-scale grazing experiment that maintained existing low-intensity sheep grazing, tripled it, removed it and partially substituted sheep grazing by cattle grazing was set up on a mosaic of upland vegetation types. The impact of changing grazing regimes was assessed in terms of changes in temporal and spatial species and functional beta diversity. Removal of grazing had the highest impact on species replacement, whilst increased grazing was closest to maintaining the original species complement. Wet heath and Molina mire had the lowest turnover, but wet heath showed the highest changes in unidirectional abundance as it contained species capable of increasing in abundance in response to changing grazing intensity. Agrostis-Festuca and Nardus grasslands displayed the highest level of balanced species replacement reflecting their more dynamic vegetation. In functional terms, there was no clear separation of communities based on their grazing preference, all were relatively resistant to change but Nardus grassland was the most resistant to the removal of grazing. The increased offtake associated with increased grazing led to a degree of homogenisation as grazing tolerant species associated with preferred communities increased in the unpreferred ones. Decisions about grazing management of the uplands involve many trade-offs, and this study identified potential trade-offs between stability and homogenisation to add to existing ones on the biodiversity of different groups of species and on ecosystem services.

AB Applications of multilevel models (MLMs) with three or more levels have increased alongside expanding software capability and dataset availability. Though researchers often express interest in R-squared measures as effect sizes for MLMs, R-squareds previously proposed for MLMs with three or more levels cover a limited subset of choices for how to quantify explained variance in these models. Additionally, analytic relationships between total and level-specific versions of MLM R-squared measures have not been clarified, despite such relationships becoming increasingly important to understand when there are more levels. Furthermore, the impact of predictor centering strategy on R-squared computation and interpretation has not been explicated for MLMs with any number of levels. To fill these gaps, we extend the Rights and Sterba two-level MLM R-squared framework to three or more levels, providing a general set of measures that includes preexisting three-level measures as special cases and yields additional results not obtainable from existing measures. We mathematically and pedagogically relate total and level-specific R-squareds, and show how all total and level-specific R-squared measures in our framework can be computed under any centering strategy. Finally, we provide and empirically demonstrate software (available in the r2mlm R package) to compute measures and graphically depict results.

AB Non-human primates show an impressive behavioral diversity, both across and within species. However, the factors explaining intra-specific behavioral variation across groups and individuals are yet understudied. Here, we aimed to assess how group size and living conditions (i.e., captive, semi-free-ranging, wild) are linked to behavioral variation in 5 groups of Barbary macaques (N=137 individuals). In each group, we collected observational data on the time individuals spent in social interactions and on the group dominance style, along with experimental data on social tolerance over food and neophobia. Our results showed that differences in group size predicted differences in the time spent in social interactions, with smaller groups spending a higher proportion of time in close spatial proximity, but a lower proportion of time grooming. Moreover, group size predicted variation in dominance style, with smaller groups being more despotic. Social tolerance was affected by both group size and living conditions, being higher in smaller groups and in groups living in less natural conditions. Finally, individual characteristics also explained variation in social tolerance and neophobia, with socially integrated individuals having higher access to food sources, and higher-ranking ones being more neophobic. Overall, our results support the view that intra-specific variation is a crucial aspect in primate social behavior and call for more comparative studies to better understand the sources of within-species variation.

AB Hydrological disconnection in intermittent rivers is known to increase beta-diversity by limiting the dispersal of species and decreasing environmental similarity between sites. Knowledge of the mechanisms driving variation within and between local communities helps elucidate the role of environmental and spatial processes responsible for community composition at multiple scales in intermittent rivers. In this study, we investigated the spatial and environmental patterns of zooplankton beta-diversity in an intermittent river in a semiarid region in Brazil. We hypothesized that (1) the zooplankton metacommunity is determined primarily by turnover, and (2) the structure of the zooplankton metacommunity is more heavily influenced by environmental than spatial factors. Our samples yielded 46 taxa of rotifers and cladocerans. beta-taxonomic diversity was high, with a predominance of turnover compared with nestedness. The partitioning analysis showed that environmental and spatial processes had a significant influence on the distribution of zooplankton species, but the former had the greatest explanatory power. In the redundancy analysis, high values of temperature, oxygen and submersed macrophytes were significantly correlated with species variation. The observed beta-diversity values closely reflected the turnover pattern, whereas Cladocera and Rotifera diverged between predictive processes. Our results highlight the importance of adopting appropriate conservation measures for intermittent river networks as a whole.

AB In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the genetic variance-covariance matrix, G, and the vector of directional selection gradients, beta, are key parameters for predicting multivariate selection responses and genetic constraints. Historically, investigations of G and beta have not overlapped with those dissecting the genetic basis of quantitative traits. Thus, it remains unknown whether these parameters reflect pleiotropic effects at individual loci. Here, we integrate multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) with G and beta estimation in a well-studied system of multivariate constraint: sexual selection on male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in Drosophila serrata. In a panel of wild-derived re-sequenced lines, we augment genome-based restricted maximum likelihood to estimate G alongside multivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects, detecting 532 significant associations from 1 652 276 SNPs. Constraint was evident, with beta lying in a direction of G with low evolvability. Interestingly, minor frequency alleles typically increased male CHC-attractiveness suggesting opposing natural selection on beta. SNP effects were significantly misaligned with the major eigenvector of G, g(max), but well aligned to the second and third eigenvectors g(2) and g(3). We discuss potential factors leading to these varied results including multivariate stabilizing selection and mutational bias. Our framework may be useful as researchers increasingly access genomic methods to study multivariate selection responses in wild populations.

AB Few biodiversity indicators are available that reflect the state of broad-sense biodiversity-rather than of particular taxa-at fine spatial and temporal resolution. One such indicator, the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII), estimates how the average abundance of the native terrestrial species in a region compares with their abundances in the absence of pronounced human impacts. We produced annual maps of modelled BII at 30-arc-second resolution (roughly 1 km at the equator) across tropical and subtropical forested biomes, by combining annual data on land use, human population density and road networks, and statistical models of how these variables affect overall abundance and compositional similarity of plants, fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. Across tropical and subtropical biomes, BII fell by an average of 1.9 percentage points between 2001 and 2012, with 81 countries seeing an average reduction and 43 an average increase; the extent of primary forest fell by 3.9% over the same period. We did not find strong relationships between changes in BII and countries' rates of economic growth over the same period; however, limitations in mapping BII in plantation forests may hinder our ability to identify these relationships. This is the first time temporal change in BII has been estimated across such a large region.

AB During autoscopic phenomena, people perceive a double of themselves in extrapersonal space. Such clinical allocentric self-experiences sometimes co-occur with auditory hallucinations, yet experimental setups to induce similar illusions in healthy participants have generally neglected acoustic cues. We investigated whether feeling the presence of an auditory double could be provoked experimentally by recording healthy participants' own versus another person's voice and movements using binaural headphones from an egocentric (the participants' own) and an allocentric (a dummy head located elsewhere) perspective. When hearing themselves allocentrically, participants reported feeling a self-identified presence extracorporeally, an arguably distinct quality of autoscopy. Our results suggest that participants without hallucinatory experiences localized their own voice closer to themselves compared to that of another person. Explorative findings suggest that distinct patterns for hallucinators should be further investigated. This study suggests a successful induction of the feeling of an acoustic doppelganger, bridging clinical phenomena and experimental work.

AB Chondrichthyan species (sharks, rays, skates, and chimeras) are a class of high ecological, economic, and cultural significance, and yet they are the most threatened taxa in the marine environment. The creation of reference chromosome-length genome assemblies allows for conservation genomics methods, such as population and ecological genomics, to be utilized. Despite being greatly threatened and of great importance in maintaining ecosystem function, chondrichthyan species have been repeatedly absent from conservation-based genome sequencing projects. Less than 1% of these species have a genome sequence, despite their almost 50% either threatened or Data Deficient conservation status. Most notably, there are seven orders within this class without any genome representation. In this review, we identify gaps in chondrichthyan genomic resources and demonstrate how the lack of genomic resources for this major taxonomic class is limiting the conservation of these already difficult to conserve species. We highlight other applications for chondrichthyans genomics, such as evolutionary and developmental biology. Likely, the mismatching sampling protocols and limited computational skills and communication between fields have been preventing the integration of marine and molecular sciences. Here, we propose that this field is in dire need to move forward quickly to increase protection for marine species and ecosystems through improved collaboration between marine, molecular, and computer sciences.

AB Spartina alterniflora is a perennial herb native to the American Atlantic coast and is the dominant plant in coastal intertidal wetlands. Since its introduction to China in 1979, it has quickly spread along the coast and has caused various hazards. To control the further spread of S. alterniflora in China, we first reconstructed the history of the spread of S. alterniflora in its invasion and origin countries. We found that S. alterniflora spreads from the central coast to both sides of the coast in China, while it spreads from the west coast to the east coast in America. Furthermore, by comparing 19 environmental variables of S. alterniflora in its invasion and origin countries, it was found that S. alterniflora is more and more adaptable to the high temperature and dry environment in the invasion country. Finally, we predicted the suitable areas for this species in China and America using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and ArcGIS. Overall, through analysis on the dynamic and trend of environmental characteristics during the invasion of S. alterniflora and predicting its suitable area in the invasion area, it guides preventing its reintroduction and preventing its further spread of the species has been found. It has reference significance for studying other similar alien plants and essential enlightening relevance to its invasion and spread in similar areas.

AB Islands are well-known as particular and vulnerable ecosystems with evolutionary histories, environmental characteristics, and original communities different from those of continents. On the contrary, urban environments are recent, artificial, and structurally similar among distant regions. To assess the relative importance of regional and local processes on urban biota, we chose two urban environments, i.e., one on the mainland and another on an island in the same ecoregion. We asked whether the urbanization process affects the avian biodiversity of the ISLAND in the same way as in the continent. We defined an urban gradient with three levels of building density, namely, patches of native vegetation (remnant woodlands in the urban matrix), medium density urbanized areas that maintain vegetation along the streets and gardens, and residential areas with less vegetation cover and higher building density. In each geographical locality, we selected three sites (replicates) for each level of the urban gradient and did bird surveys. We found two times as many species in the urban landscape of the continent (69) as on the island (35), with the analogous richness decrease along the gradient in both regions. Species similarity was higher between urbanized sites of both regions compared with the similarity between woodlands and urbanized sites, showing that urban matrix filters similar species of each pool regionally. Individual species responded to urban structure in different ways. We found 32% of bird species were urban exploiters, 48% urban tolerant, and 20% urban avoiders in both regions. However, some species showed different frequencies of occurrence on the island and the continent. Species turnover contributed more than richness differences to species dissimilarity along the urban gradient on the continent. Contrarily, the nestedness component (i.e., species being a strict subset of the species at a richer site) was higher on the island. We concluded that the negative impact of highly urbanized areas on birds was stronger on the island than on the continent. Our results may help to assess the implications of beta-diversity loss, especially on islands.

AB In the last few decades, there has been much research regarding the importance of social prestige in shaping the social structure of small-scale societies. While recent studies show that social prestige may have important health consequences, little is known about the extent to which prestige translates into actual in-person interactions and proximity, even though the level of integration into such real-life social networks has been shown to have important health consequences. Here, we determine the extent to which two different domains of social prestige, popularity (being perceived as a friend by others), and hunting reputation (being perceived as a good hunter), translate into GPS-derived in- and out-of-camp proximity networks in a group of egalitarian hunter-gatherer men, the Hadza. We show that popularity and hunting reputation differ in the extent to which they are translated into time spent physically close to each other. Moreover, our findings suggest that in-camp proximity networks, which are commonly applied in studies of small-scale societies, do not show the full picture of Hadza men's social preferences. While men are in camp, neither popularity nor hunting reputation is associated with being central in the proximity network; however, when out of camp, Hadza men who are popular are more integrated in the proximity networks while men with better hunting reputations are less integrated. Overall, our findings suggest that, to fully understand social preferences among hunter-gatherers, both in-camp and out-of-camp proximity networks should be considered.
   Although there has been much research on the effect of both social integration and social status on wellbeing, little is known how these two social domains are related to each other. In this study we show that, among Hadza hunter-gatherer men, being integrated in social networks is more indicative of popularity as a friend than of hunting reputation. This challenges the idea that social prestige based on hunting reputation is vital in building coalitions.

AB Fire is among the major forces shaping patterns in nature. Although sometimes it is only acknowledged for its destructive power, it was one of the evolutionary drivers that produced present-day species and biome distributions, being inextricably linked to fire-prone ecosystems such as grasslands. Knowing how fire influences grassland biodiversity is therefore fundamental to conserve it. Here we analyzed the taxonomic and functional structure of grassland plant communities from Southern Brazil under different post-fire successional stages. We sampled 12 sites that were fire-suppressed for varying amounts of time (3 to 300 months), categorized in three post-fire stages: freshly-burnt (FB), intermediate-burnt (IB), and old-burnt (OB). We compared these stages regarding taxonomic composition, species richness, diversity (partitioned in different spatial components), and functional composition (based on plant life forms and metabolism). We sampled 307 plant species from 52 families. Species richness was lower in the OB stage, and did not differ between FB and IB stages. Species composition was markedly different between stages. Forty-five percent of the sampled species were exclusive to one post-fire stage, and only 23% were shared among them. Old-burnt sites share only up to 5% species with other stages and concentrated most of the trees and tussocks. Because long-term fire suppression allowed for the entry of different floristic elements in the community, taxonomic diversity (beta and gamma levels) was higher in old-burnt sites. Our results provide empirical evidence that fire suppression is likely to shift the fire-prone grasslands from Southern Brazil towards different ecosystem states. However, whether this process is leading towards a closed forest system or to a different system with coexisting grassland and forest elements, remains an open question. The sharp floristic differences and exclusive species in the different post-fire stages reinforce the need to include fire in the conservation framework for fire-prone grasslands.

AB The Florida Everglades is a vast and iconic wetland ecosystem in the southern United States that has undergone dramatic changes from habitat degradation, development encroachment, and water impoundment. Starting in the past few decades, large restoration projects have been undertaken to restore the landscape, including improving conditions for threatened and imperiled taxa. One focus of restoration has been the marl prairie ecosystem, where the federally endangered Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow (Ammospiza maritima mirabilis; CSSS) resides. The CSSS is endemic to the Everglades where populations have been steadily declining, signaling the importance of decision support tools for natural resource managers for evaluating water management and restoration scenarios. Here we developed an ensemble logistic regression, combining a frequentist and Bayesian approach, to model CSSS presence and measure how environmental factors such as hydrometrics, fire occurrence, and vegetation structure impact CSSS habitat suitability. This is the first analysis to quantitatively assess the interdependent relationships between a broad range of environmental factors and CSSS presence across the landscape. Our results show that the probability of CSSS presence was highest in areas with dry conditions, hydroperiods between 80 and 120 days, percentages of canopy cover and woody vegetation less than 10%, and more than six years post-fire where 75% or more of the area was burned. Because the frequentist and Bayesian models had nearly identical spatial outputs with the Bayesian model having slightly higher validation metrics, we used the Bayesian approach as our final model (EverSparrow). The results from our analysis can provide a valuable decision support tool as natural resource managers work to restore the Everglades landscape.

AB The Lindholm rock lizard, Darevskia lindholmi, is the only member of the genus Darevskia whose range is restricted solely to Europe, representing a local endemism found only in the Crimean Mountains. In our study, we investigated the cytochrome b gene (mtDNA) of 101 D. lindholmi sequences from 65 Crimean localities, representing its entire range. We found that D. lindholmi is highly genetically structured, and its range is divided into populations belonging to three mitochondrial lineages. The Lindholm rock lizard populations inhabiting the middle part of the Crimean Mountains (further referred to as the Central lineage) are sharply differentiated from the other two lineages (the Common and the Southwestern lineages), which are present in most of the species range. The genetic distance between the Central lineage and the other two taken together is 4.6%, according to our results, suggesting that the divergence occurred during the Early Pleistocene. The narrowly distributed Southwestern lineage and the widespread Common lineage, on the other hand, are differentiated by 1%. Field observations on the representatives of the main evolutionary groups show that their ecology is also different: the Central lineage is a mesophilic and cold-resistant form, while the other two closely related lineages are more xerophilic and thermophilic. Results of the potential ranges modeling and ecological niche analysis confirm that the genetic lineages occupy different niches of the Crimea. Furthermore, the area of inhabitation of the Central lineage splits the western and eastern parts of the Common lineage range, while the Southwestern lineage is restricted along the coast of the southwestern coast of the peninsula. The long-term co-existence of deeply divergent sister mitochondrial lineages in a relatively small (circa 7,000 km(2)) isolated mountain system serves as a mesocosm for understanding the speciation process. Our data suggest that the Central lineage warrants further taxonomic investigation.

AB The role of soils in the global carbon cycle and in reducing GHG emissions from agriculture has been increasingly acknowledged. The '4 per 1000' (4p1000) initiative has become a prominent action plan for climate change mitigation and achieve food security through an annual increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks by 0.4%, (i.e. 4 parts per thousand per year). However, the feasibility of the 4p1000 scenario and, more generally, the capacity of individual countries to implement soil carbon sequestration (SCS) measures remain highly uncertain. Here, we evaluated country-specific SCS potentials of agricultural land for 24 countries in Europe. Based on a detailed survey of available literature, we estimate that between 0.1% and 27% of the agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can potentially be compensated by SCS annually within the next decades. Measures varied widely across countries, indicating differences in country-specific environmental conditions and agricultural practices. None of the countries' SCS potential reached the aspirational goal of the 4p1000 initiative, suggesting that in order to achieve this goal, a wider range of measures and implementation pathways need to be explored. Yet, SCS potentials exceeded those from previous pan-European modelling scenarios, underpinning the general need to include national/regional knowledge and expertise to improve estimates of SCS potentials. The complexity of the chosen SCS measurement approaches between countries ranked from tier 1 to tier 3 and included the effect of different controlling factors, suggesting that methodological improvements and standardization of SCS accounting are urgently required. Standardization should include the assessment of key controlling factors such as realistic areas, technical and practical feasibility, trade-offs with other GHG and climate change. Our analysis suggests that country-specific knowledge and SCS estimates together with improved data sharing and harmonization are crucial to better quantify the role of soils in offsetting anthropogenic GHG emissions at global level.

AB Quantifying fish species diversity in rich tropical marine environments remains challenging. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a promising tool to face this challenge through the filtering, amplification, and sequencing of DNA traces from water samples. However, because eDNA concentration is low in marine environments, the reliability of eDNA to detect species diversity can be limited. Using an eDNA metabarcoding approach to identify fish Molecular Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) with a single 12S marker, we aimed to assess how the number of sampling replicates and filtered water volume affect biodiversity estimates. We used a paired sampling design of 30 L per replicate on 68 reef transects from 8 sites in 3 tropical regions. We quantified local and regional sampling variability by comparing MOTU richness, compositional turnover, and compositional nestedness. We found strong turnover of MOTUs between replicated pairs of samples undertaken in the same location, time, and conditions. Paired samples contained non-overlapping assemblages rather than subsets of one another. As a result, non-saturated localized diversity accumulation curves suggest that even 6 replicates (180 L) in the same location can underestimate local diversity (for an area <1 km). However, sampling regional diversity using similar to 25 replicates in variable locations (often covering 10 s of km) often saturated biodiversity accumulation curves. Our results demonstrate variability of diversity estimates possibly arising from heterogeneous distribution of eDNA in seawater, highly skewed frequencies of eDNA traces per MOTU, in addition to variability in eDNA processing. This high compositional variability has consequences for using eDNA to monitor temporal and spatial biodiversity changes in local assemblages. Avoiding false-negative detections in future biomonitoring efforts requires increasing replicates or sampled water volume to better inform management of marine biodiversity using eDNA.

AB Aim: Drastic changes in fire regimes are altering plant communities, inspiring ecologists to better understand the relationship between fire and plant species diversity. We examined the impact of a 90,000-ha wildfire on woody plant species diversity in an arid mountain range in southern Arizona, USA. We tested recent fire-diversity hypotheses by addressing the impacts on diversity of fire severity, fire variability, historical fire regimes, and topography.
   Location: Chiricahua National Monument, Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona, USA, part of the Sky Islands of the US-Mexico borderlands.
   Taxon: Woody plant species.
   Methods: We sampled woody plant diversity in 138 plots before (2002-2003) and after (2017-2018) the 2011 Horseshoe Two Fire in three vegetation types and across fire severity and topographic gradients. We calculated gamma, alpha, and beta diversity and examined changes over time in burned versus unburned plots and the shapes of the relationships of diversity with fire severity and topography.
   Results: Alpha species richness declined, and beta and gamma diversity increased in burned but not unburned plots. Fire-induced enhancement of gamma diversity was confined to low fire severity plots. Alpha diversity did not exhibit a clear continuous relationship with fire severity. Beta diversity was enhanced by variation in fire severity among plots and increased with fire severity up to very high severity, where it declined slightly.
   Main Conclusions: The results reject the intermediate disturbance hypothesis for alpha diversity but weakly support it for gamma diversity. Spatial variation in fire severity promoted variation among plant assemblages, supporting the pyrodiversity hypothesis. Long-term drought probably amplified fire-driven diversity changes. Despite the apparent benign impact of the fire on diversity, the replacement of two large conifer species with a suite of drought-tolerant shrubs signals the potential loss of functional diversity, a pattern that may warrant restoration efforts to retain these important compositional elements.

AB Seabirds, particularly Procellariiformes, are highly mobile organisms with a great capacity for long dispersal, though simultaneously showing high philopatry, two conflicting life-history traits that may lead to contrasted patterns of genetic population structure. Landmasses were suggested to explain differentiation patterns observed in seabirds, but philopatry, isolation by distance, segregation between breeding and nonbreeding zones, and oceanographic conditions (sea surface temperatures) may also contribute to differentiation patterns. To our knowledge, no study has simultaneously contrasted the multiple factors contributing to the diversification of seabird species, especially in the gray zone of speciation. We conducted a multilocus phylogeographic study on a widespread seabird species complex, the little shearwater complex, showing highly homogeneous morphology, which led to considerable taxonomic debate. We sequenced three mitochondrial and six nuclear markers on all extant populations from the Atlantic (lherminieri) and Indian Oceans (bailloni), that is, five nominal lineages from 13 populations, along with one population from the eastern Pacific Ocean (representing the dichrous lineage). We found sharp differentiation among populations separated by the African continent with both mitochondrial and nuclear markers, while only mitochondrial markers allowed characterizing the five nominal lineages. No differentiation could be detected within these five lineages, questioning the strong level of philopatry showed by these shearwaters. Finally, we propose that Atlantic populations likely originated from the Indian Ocean. Within the Atlantic, a stepping-stone process accounts for the current distribution. Based on our divergence time estimates, we suggest that the observed pattern of differentiation mostly resulted from historical and current variation in sea surface temperatures.

AB Metabarcoding technologies for soil fungal DNA pools have enabled to capture the diversity of fungal community and the agreement of their beta-diversity with plant beta-diversity. However, processes underlying the synchrony of the aboveground-belowground biodiversity is still unclear. By using partitioning methods for plant beta-diversity, this study explored the process driving synchrony in tundra ecosystems, in which drastic vegetation shifts are observed with climate warming. Our methods based on Baselga's partitioning enabled the division of plant beta-diversity into two phenomena and three functional components. Correlation of fungal beta-diversity with the components of plant beta-diversity showed that the spatial replacement of fungi was promoted by plant species turnover, in particular, plant species turnover with functional exchange. In addition, spatial variety of graminoid or forbs species, rather than shrubs, enhanced fungal beta-diversity. These results suggest the importance of small-scale factors such as plant-fungal interactions or local environments modified by plants for the fungal community assemblage. The process-based understanding of community dynamics of plants and fungi allows us to predict the ongoing shrub encroachment in the Arctic region, which could weaken the aboveground-belowground synchrony.

AB Regression modeling is a workhorse of statistical ecology that allows to find relationships between a response variable and a set of explanatory variables. Despite being one of the fundamental statistical ideas in ecological curricula, regression modeling can be complex and subtle. This paper is intended as an applied protocol to help students understand the data, select the most appropriate models, verify assumptions, and interpret the output. Basic ecological questions are tackled using data from a fictional series, "Fantastic beasts and where to find them," with the aim to show how statistical thinking can foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in ecology, from the formulation of hypotheses to the interpretation of results.

AB Understanding how wetland plant communities are organized in different ecosystems and spatial scales is essential to support conservation. Studies that have addressed this primary need, however, are exceptionally scarce. Here, we compared the diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) and composition of herbaceous and woody communities (treated separately and jointly) in ponds, streambanks and riverbanks in the upper Uruguay River Basin, southern Brazil. Results showed that each wetland ecosystem exhibited unique community patterns, depending on the plant group, data property (e.g., presence-absence or abundance), and community parameter. All ecosystem types had exclusive species, beta diversity explained by high rates of species turnover and balanced variation in abundance components, and particular floristic composition, revealing that each wetland type and site contributes fundamentally to the overall wetland plant diversity. These findings indicate that safeguarding wetland plant diversity depends on the adoption of holistic conservation measures.

AB Subsoil carbon is generally older and decomposes more slowly than topsoil carbon. It has, therefore, been suggested that carbon stocks could be increased by burying carbon-rich topsoil at depth to slow its decomposition. This has been supported by recent experiments that showed that buried topsoil carbon indeed decomposed more slowly, but the mechanisms causing the reduction have not yet been identified. We investigated three theoretical mechanisms that may explain reduced decomposition rates at depth: (1) lower soil-temperature variability, (2) lower oxygen concentrations/redox potential and (3) less priming (biological synergy). Temperature variability decreases with soil depth. As decomposition rates vary non-linearly with temperature, reduced temperature variability should, therefore, reduce annual decomposition rates. However, detailed simulations showed that it changed annual decomposition rates by only a few percent. Maximal decomposition rates also require adequate oxygen, but our simulations showed that oxygen diffusion rates would need to be reduced 1000 to 10 000-fold compared to the topsoil for it to protect buried soil carbon. Oxygen limitation is, therefore, likely to be confined to soils that are water-logged for extended periods. Priming (or biological synergy) is assumed to be the stimulation of decomposition rates by the availability of labile organic carbon. Our simulations showed that lower labile carbon inputs could reduce priming and potentially preserve up to half of buried carbon for centuries. If experimental work can further substantiate the role of this mechanism, carbon burial at depth could become a practical and useful climate-change mitigation option.

AB Little is known about the effects of habitat fragmentation on the patterns of genetic diversity and genetic connectivity of species in the remaining tropical forests of Southeast Asia. This is particularly evident in Cebu, a Philippine island that has a long history of deforestation and has lost nearly all of its forest cover. To begin filling this gap, data from 13 microsatellite loci developed for Tetrastigma loheri (Vitaceae), a common vine species in Philippine forests, were used to study patterns of genetic diversity and genetic connectivity for the four largest of the remaining forest areas in Cebu. Evidence of relatively high levels of inbreeding was found in all four areas, despite no evidence of low genetic diversity. The four areas are genetically differentiated, suggesting low genetic connectivity. The presence of inbreeding and low genetic connectivity in a commonly encountered species such as T. loheri in Cebu suggests that the impact of habitat fragmentation is likely greater on rare plant species with more restricted distributions in Cebu. Conservation recommendations for the remaining forest areas in Cebu include the establishment of steppingstone corridors between nearby areas to improve the movement of pollinators and seed dispersers among them.

   Africa; wildlife management
ID CONSERVATION
AB Rhino species use their horns in social interactions but also when accessing resources, rubbing and in interspecific defence. The current poaching crisis has seen southern white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum simum) increasingly dehorned as a conservation management practise, but few studies have evaluated whether the procedure has any behavioural effects. This study sought to document and describe horn-contingent behaviours during resource access, wallowing and rubbing in freeranging white rhinos and establish whether dehorning, also known as horn trimming, impacts on their frequency or function. Data were collected through camera trapping and field observations at two sites in South Africa. The results provide no evidence that dehorning disrupts digging behaviours during mineral consumption or wallowing and suggests that dehorning is unlikely to have a strong biological impact on resource access. Furthermore, the frequency of horn-rubbing behaviours did not appear to be influenced by levels of horn growth. This suggests the procedure has a limited impact on these aspects of the species' ecology and provides support that dehorning can be employed as a management tool to reduce poaching in freeranging populations of white rhino.

AB Elevation and anthropopression are important factors affecting terrestrial water bear dynamics. In the present study, we characterize the taxonomic composition, diversity, and community structure of tardigrades along an elevational gradient with different anthropopression in Alturas de Boniato, Santiago de Cuba. Samples were collected in four sampling sites and all tardigrades were extracted. Alpha diversity indices were calculated. Hierarchical community organization was determined and variation among sampling sites was calculated using the Jaccard index for beta diversity. Some variables that influenced composition and taxon diversity were also evaluated. A total of 413 tardigrades belonging to seven taxa and five eggs were found. The most abundant taxa were Paramacrobiotus sp., Macrobiotus sp. and Milnesium sp. 1. Differences between sampling sites were largely due to turnover, especially at the higher-elevation sites. Nesting characterized the lower-elevation sites. The variables that had the greatest influence on species composition were anthropopression and a mixture of various macro-and microenvironmental variables.

AB Understanding population structure is important for predicting the outcomes of anthropogenic development, harvest, and environmental change on the abundance of fisheries species. Logically, the use of several data sources is best for delineating population structure, but combining across data types adds extra challenges as results can be incongruent. Here, genetic and environmental markers were used to test hypotheses about population structure in a collection of 523 tropical inshore finfish (Lutjanus johnii) across northern Australia from.. locations. Redundancy analyses (RDA) were used to statistically test for correlations among data sources providing a basis for reconciliation and insights into ecological and evolutionary processes. Genomic data (10349 SNP loci) revealed low, but significant genetic divergence (max F-ST 0.0402) between 16 locations. A total of 12 putative contiguous biological stocks were proposed whose distributions were correlated with IMCRA bioregions but not to existing regions used formanagement of the fishery. RDA showed a significant correlation between environmental markers (otolith chemistry and parasite abundances) and SNP genotype in two of three region-wide analyses supporting the proposed stock structure, and suggesting that L. johnii may be locally adapted to the heterogeneous environment. These findings are significant for the conservation of the commercially and recreationally important L. johnii and can be used to guide future fisheries management actions.

AB Populus has a wide ecogeographical range spanning the Northern Hemisphere, and interspecific hybrids are common. Populus tomentosa Carr. is widely distributed and cultivated in the eastern region of Asia, where it plays multiple important roles in forestry, agriculture, conservation, and urban horticulture. Reference genomes are available for several Populus species, however, our goals were to produce a very high quality de novo chromosome-level genome assembly in P. tomentosa genome that could serve as a reference for evolutionary and ecological studies of hybrid speciation throughout the genus. Here, combining long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding, we present a high-quality, haplotype-resolved genome assembly. The genome size was 740.2 Mb, with a contig N50 size of 5.47 Mb and a scaffold N50 size of 46.68 Mb, consisting of 38 chromosomes, as expected with the known diploid chromosome number (2n = 2x = 38). A total of 59,124 protein-coding genes were identified. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that P. tomentosa is comprised of two distinct subgenomes, which we deomonstrate is likely to have resulted from hybridization between Populus adenopoda as the female parent and Populus alba var. pyramidalis as the male parent, with an origin of approximately 3.93 Ma. Although highly colinear, significant structural variation was found between the two subgenomes. Our study provides a valuable resource for ecological genetics and forest biotechnology.

AB Ageing is a natural process causing alterations in the neuromuscular system, which contributes to reduced quality of life. Motor unit (MU) contributes to weakness, but the mechanisms underlying reduced firing rates are unclear. Persistent inward currents (PICs) are crucial for initiation, gain control and maintenance of motoneuron firing, and are directly proportional to the level of monoaminergic input. Since concentrations of monoamines (i.e. serotonin and noradrenaline) are reduced with age, we sought to determine if estimates of PICs are reduced in older (>60 years old) compared to younger adults (<35 years old). We decomposed MU spike trains from high-density surface electromyography over the biceps and triceps brachii during isometric ramp contractions to 20% of maximum. Estimates of PICs (Delta Frequency; or simply Delta F) were computed using the paired MU analysis technique. Regardless of the muscle, peak firing rates of older adults were reduced by similar to 1.6 pulses per second (pps) (P = 0.0292), and Delta F was reduced by similar to 1.9 pps (P < 0.0001), compared to younger adults. We further found that age predicted Delta F in older adults (P = 0.0261), resulting in a reduction of similar to 1 pps per decade, but there was no relationship in younger adults (P = 0.9637). These findings suggest that PICs are reduced in the upper limbs of older adults during submaximal isometric contractions. Reduced PIC magnitude represents one plausible mechanism for reduced firing rates and function in older individuals, but further work is required to understand the implications in other muscles and during a variety of motor tasks. Key points Persistent inward currents play an important role in the neural control of human movement and are influenced by neuromodulation via monoamines originating in the brainstem. During ageing, motor unit firing rates are reduced, and there is deterioration of brainstem nuclei, which may reduce persistent inward currents in alpha motoneurons. Here we show that estimates of persistent inward currents (Delta F) of both elbow flexor and extensor motor units are reduced in older adults. Estimates of persistent inward currents have a negative relationship with age in the older adults, but not in the young. This novel mechanism may play a role in the alteration of motor firing rates that occurs with ageing, which may have consequences for motor control.

AB Aim The ongoing global change makes landscape planning and management of ecological corridors crucial to preserve biodiversity. We propose a workflow optimizing the use of different data sources to convert ecological niche models (ENMs) into landscape-focused species distribution models (SDMs), using these latter to compute ecological corridors. We infer corridors connecting present occurrence localities to future climatic refugia as well as to localities where extinct populations occurred. Also, a continuous connectivity change index is proposed to assess current-future differences. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our workflow to conservation, assessing the capability of established protected areas to preserve ecological corridors. Location Europe. Methods As case study to illustrate our framework, we use a database comprising occurrence localities of Vipera ursinii, one of the most endangered European reptiles. We obtain weighted SDMs for each of the four V. ursinii subspecies by coupling climate-based ENMs with standardized occurrence frequencies along land use and altitude gradients through weighted averaging in GIS. We calculate current and future landscape connectivity for each subspecies based on the corresponding weighted SDM. We compare predictive performance of "traditional" ENMs, including climate, land use and topography as predictors and weighted SDMs. Results Weighted SDMs outperform ENMs, according to Boyce index. SDMs are used to infer connectivity, predicted to decrease in all future scenarios for V. ursinii, and assess where connections may favour movements of individuals to, for example, future suitable areas. Generally, protected areas are predicted to cover low-connectivity territories. Main conclusions The proposed "couple-and-weigh" approach could represent a helpful tool to investigate biogeography, conservation and landscape planning topics, as it permits to capitalize on occurrence records and accessible environmental predictors by narrowing the target species' potential distribution, estimated within "traditional" ENMs, to the realized one through post-modelling GIS analyses, which in turn improves estimation of friction maps used to infer connectivity.

AB Aim To compare the climate change mitigation benefits of nature-based solutions for management of municipal green waste with conventional management. Methods This study analyzed the carbon footprint of managing one ton of municipal green waste (MGW) in Lima Peru under 4 different scenarios: 1) Final disposal in authorized landfill, 2) Final disposal in informal landfill, 3) composting and 4) biochar production using a low-cost, low tech Kon-Tiki reactor. Results The results demonstrate the very clear potential for climate change mitigation from biochar production using low tech and therefore accessible technology in a typical developing world context. The carbon footprint of producing biochar was lower than for composting and biochar and compost both had carbon footprints significantly lower than landfilling. Conclusion We argue that the standards used by nascent platforms for trading carbon removal credits generated by biochar should relax the technology requirement to favor engagement and participation of small-scale market participants in low-income countries. Waste management in the developing world presents significant challenges but often starts from a very low base which means there is large potential for reducing emissions, as well as for sequestering carbon.

AB Genome-wide association studies provide good opportunities for studying the genetic basis of adaptive traits in wild populations. Yet, previous studies often failed to identify major effect genes. In this study, we used high-density single nucleotide polymorphism and individual fitness data from a wild non-model species. Using a whole-genome approach, we identified the MC1R gene as the sole causal gene underlying Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus fur colour. Further, we showed the adaptive importance of fur colour genotypes through measures of fitness that link ecological and evolutionary processes. We found a tendency for blue foxes that are heterozygous at the fur colour locus to have higher fitness than homozygous white foxes. The effect of genotype on fitness was independent of winter duration but varied with prey availability, with the strongest effect in years of increasing rodent populations. MC1R is located in a genomic region with high gene density, and we discuss the potential for indirect selection through linkage and pleiotropy. Our study shows that whole-genome analyses can be successfully applied to wild species and identify major effect genes underlying adaptive traits. Furthermore, we show how this approach can be used to identify knowledge gaps in our understanding of interactions between ecology and evolution.

AB Chile is one of the top carrageenan producers worldwide, and Sarcopeltis (ex Gigartina) skottsbergii one of the topmost exploited carrageenophytes from the wild in the world. Total yield, gel strength and viscosity from two contrasting environments Calbuco and Ancud (Inner and Outer Sea, Chile) were estimated monthly in approximately 2 years for this species. While carrageenan yields did not show differences between localities, gametophytes in spring-summer had 15% higher, compared to tetrasporophytes. Sizes (frond surface) normally did not affect carrageenan yields. Gametophytes showed clear differences in gel strength between seasons, but not between localities, with maximum peaks during winter-spring months in Calbuco and autumn-winter months in Ancud. Seasonal variations in viscosity were also significant. While gametophyte viscosity did not exceed 120 cPs, tetrasporophytes reached 1400 cPs in Calbuco and 1000 cPs in Ancud. More remarkably, a positive correlation between viscosity and gel strength was found in S. skottsbergii gametophytes, which is significantly different between both localities. These results suggest that selective harvesting in spring-summer should be preferred to optimize cost-benefit of harvesting activities and subsequent carrageenan productivity.

AB Plant communities influence the composition of local fungi, and this has been verified in different biomes around the world. The analysis of the litter structure in a forest reserve in the Amazon has shown that floristic diversity and substrate morphology affect fungal diversity at different scales. Our results revealed that the alpha diversity of the fungi was positively correlated with the substrate quality in the litter, while beta diversity showed differences within and among the floristic groups identified in the reserve. In addition to litter morphology, some soil physicochemical variables were considered as predictors, of which only the soil pH affected the fungal richness. Therefore, our results support the hypotheses that: 1) plant identity and substrate deposition time in soil have an effect on microbial communities, and 2) a greater leaf diversity correlates to increased fungal variety.

AB Root water uptake (RWU) strategies shape climate-vegetation feedbacks and ecosystem productivity. A fundamental relationship between RWU strategies and evolutionary histories (phylogeny) of trees, however, remains poorly understood. Establishing a phylogenetic basis for tree RWU, particularly groundwater use, could improve their representation in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) that are crucial for understanding hydrologic and ecosystem responses to climate perturbations. We explored possible phylogenetic bases for tree RWU using two independent data sets: (a) observed root and local groundwater depths representing 502 tree species, and (b) groundwater, soil, and xylem water isotopic evidence for groundwater uptake representing 412 species. Maximum rooting depths (RDMAX), the ratio between RDMAX and mean water table depth (WT) (RDMAX/WT), and isotopic evidence of groundwater uptake showed significant phylogenetic signals, suggesting that tree RWU strategies are more similar among closely related species. Our findings may be used to parameterize species-level RWU in TBMs, particularly for data-poor regions.

AB Mitigation of CO2 is a very popular research currently, it is ultimately beneficial to find new ways that are sustainable, low cost and gas emission friendly. Therefore, with biochar's characteristics and properties it has great potential to be used as a CO2 capture and storage media. The objectives of reducing palm waste by using the low-cost, sustainable method for reducing and storing CO2, characterize the DPL biochar through FTIR, XRD, SEM, EDX, and then evaluate the efficiency of the date palm leaf waste biochar in adsorbing CO2 through the Gas-Solid analyzer technology. Date palm leaf was set in pyrolysis process at 500 degrees C peak at a 10 degrees C per min rate for 5 h. The peaks of maximum intensity are approximately 1000 to 1500 cm(-1); two peaks are approximately 1110 and 1600 cm(-1) as the transition rises when the peaks are wider and shorter. Carbonyls, Alkenes, Alkynes, and others were found in feature groups, but the maximum area with O-H and C-H bonds and vibration picks is reduced and nearly non-existent. Biochar showed porous and heterogeneous structures with various magnifications, which give a greater amount of surface for adsorption. XRD analysis indicated that cellulose could progressively be decreased. The weighing of each component was 83.56% for Carbon, 12.43% for Oxygen, 1.12% for Potassium, 1.64% for Calcium, 0,83% for Phosphorus and 0.4% for Magnesium. The presence of these metals gives a strong CO2 attraction. The area value was found to have been approximately 3.117, reflecting the total CO2 obtained by the date palm leaf biochar. This shows that 300 gr of DPL biochar have been consumed by just one third of CO2. Date palm leaf of biochar's shows a carbon dioxide adsorption efficiency of 20% and measured CO2 adsorption per g of biochar DPL of 0.017 g at 500 degrees C pyrolysis temperature and conditions set.

AB The soil carbon (C) stock, comprising soil organic C (SOC) and soil inorganic C (SIC) and being the largest reservoir of the terrestrial biosphere, is a critical part of the global C cycle. Soil has been a source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) since the dawn of settled agriculture about 10 millenia ago. Soils of agricultural ecosystems are depleted of their SOC stocks and the magnitude of depletion is greater in those prone to accelerated erosion by water and wind and other degradation processes. Adoption of judicious land use and science-based management practices can lead to re-carbonization of depleted soils and make them a sink for atmospheric C. Soils in humid climates have potential to increase storage of SOC and those in arid and semiarid climates have potential to store both SOC and SIC. Payments to land managers for sequestration of C in soil, based on credible measurement of changes in soil C stocks at farm or landscape levels, are also important for promoting adoption of recommended land use and management practices. In conjunction with a rapid and aggressive reduction in GHG emissions across all sectors of the economy, sequestration of C in soil (and vegetation) can be an important negative emissions method for limiting global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees C This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of soils in delivering Nature's Contributions to People'.

AB Whole genome sequencing provides deep insights into the evolutionary history of a species, including patterns of diversity, signals of selection, and historical demography. When applied to closely related taxa with a wealth of background knowledge, population genomics provides a comparative context for interpreting population genetic summary statistics and comparing empirical results with the expectations of population genetic theory. The Galapagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.), an iconic rapid and recent radiation, offer such an opportunity. Here, we sequenced whole genomes from three individuals of the 12 extant lineages of Galapagos giant tortoise and estimate diversity measures and reconstruct changes in coalescent rate over time. We also compare the number of derived alleles in each lineage to infer how synonymous and nonsynonymous mutation accumulation rates correlate with population size and life history traits. Remarkably, we find that patterns of molecular evolution are similar within individuals of the same lineage, but can differ significantly among lineages, reinforcing the evolutionary distinctiveness of the Galapagos giant tortoise species. Notably, differences in mutation accumulation among lineages do not align with simple population genetic predictions, suggesting that the drivers of purifying selection are more complex than is currently appreciated. By integrating results from earlier population genetic and phylogeographic studies with new findings from the analysis of whole genomes, we provide the most in-depth insights to date on the evolution of Galapagos giant tortoises, and identify discrepancies between expectation from population genetic theory and empirical data that warrant further scrutiny.

DE Crossed random factors; Effect size
AB Mixed-effects models are frequently used in a variety of disciplines because they can appropriately specify multiple sources of variation. However, precisely because they distinguish between multiple sources of variation, it is difficult to specify a standardized effect size, such as eta(2). Several approaches to this problem have been proposed, but most do not address models with crossed random factors, and none allows for the range of data and models that researchers typically test. For example, no existing approach handles random slopes for a continuous predictor. We introduce several new, flexible approaches to estimating eta(2) in mixed-effect models with crossed random factors. We then conduct a simulation to assess new and old methods. We examine their respective strengths and weaknesses and offer recommendations for a simple approach based on the work of Snijders and Bosker (2011).

AB Offsetting nation-wide CO2 emissions by carbon sinks from land use change (LUC), e.g. agricultural fields extensification and afforestation, is considered as a major climate change mitigation option. We evaluated the LUC potential for reducing emissions and creating annual soil and ecosystem carbon sinks in Finland. We used agricultural statistics, the forest growth model MOTTI, the soil carbon model Yasso07, and the RCP8.5 climate scenario.
   The soil carbon stock (SOC) of extensified grasslands showed on average less carbon loss than cropland, thus reducing future carbon emissions by LUC between 0.17 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), initially, and 0.08 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) after 50 years. The annual rate of such carbon gain was in comparison to SOC between 1.4 parts per thousand and 0.7 parts per thousand which is lower than proposed by the Paris 4 parts per thousand initiative for offsetting global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Furthermore, after afforestation, estimated SOC is expected to increase above pre-LUC levels with 30 years lag. Estimated SOC sink from afforestation when compared to continuous cultivation varied depending on dominant tree species and soil fertility from between 0.19 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (1.7 parts per thousand for spruce in medium fertile soil) to 0.46 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (3.7 parts per thousand for silver birch in highly fertile soil). Future total soil and biomass carbon sink attributed to afforestation ranged between 1.65 and 2.44 Mg ha(-1) y(-1).
   Combined carbon sinks created by the present LUC could with 30 years lag offset annually between 0.01 and 4% of the present national net CO2 emissions in Finland. The long delay and a small scale of potential future carbon emission reduction by the LUC highlighted the importance of employing additional tools to reach the national neutrality targets due in next 15 or 30 years.

AB Countries around the world are taking active efforts to address the current climate crisis. Negative emissions technologies (NET) such as enhanced weathering will play a significant role in these efforts in the coming decades. Enhanced weathering is based on the terrestrial application of powdered natural or synthetic silicate minerals to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. In the latter case, non-hazardous industrial waste (NHIW) can react with water and CO2 from the atmosphere to achieve carbon drawdown through the acceleration of the naturally occurring weathering process. This approach also addresses the problem of sustainable industrial waste management. Besides, carbon drawdown also enhances soil quality for agricultural application sites. In the future, planning the large-scale implementation of enhanced weathering via carbon management networks can be facilitated by using optimization models. In this work, a source-sink model is developed for the proper allocation of NHIW to application sites. The method is demonstrated with a case study based at Shandong Province, China. Two scenarios are analyzed, with both achieving significant negative CO2 emissions. The CO2 sequestration rates for these two scenarios are determined as 12.73 Mt/y and 13.77 Mt/y, respectively. Scenario 1 shows that the system can achieve negative CO2 emissions at a cost of $ 184.25/t CO2, which is comparable to previously reported cost estimates. Given the necessary input data, the model can be used to generate case-specific estimates for any country. The increasing use of clean energy in the transport and crushing process will enhance CO2 sequestration of the system.

AB It has been suggested that the sequestration of CO2 by agricultural soils offers a means to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and in turn mitigate the impacts of climate change. Carbon sequestration by grassland soils, which account for more than 60% of agricultural land use in Ireland, could contribute to a successful net reduction of atmospheric GHG emissions in accordance with the COP21 Paris Agreement. However, current estimates of soil carbon sequestration are variable and it is likely that many permanent grasslands are close to saturation. A literature search shows that soil carbon sequestration is enhanced by a variety of different management strategies, although one option that has only been examined to date in New Zealand is full inversion tillage (FIT) during grassland renovation. FIT involves inverting topsoil, generally to depths of 30 cm, resulting in the movement of C-deficient subsoil to the surface and the burying of carbon-rich topsoil. In this review, we hypothesise that over the next-30 years the new topsoil could incorporate large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) from the re-seeded sward vegetation and that the buried carbon will be retained. We assess the current capability of Irish grassland soils to sequester carbon and suggest a potential role of FIT during grassland renovation. An analysis of the distribution of grasslands in Ireland using the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) suggests that-26% of Ireland's agricultural grasslands are suitable for FIT.

AB Beta-diversity was originally defined spatially, i.e., as variation in community composition among sites in a region. However, the concept of beta-diversity has since been expanded to temporal contexts. This is referred to as "temporal beta-diversity", and most approaches are simply an extension of spatial beta-diversity. The persistence and turnover of individuals over time is a unique feature of temporal beta-diversity. Nakadai (2020) introduced the "individual-based beta-diversity" concept, and provided novel indices to evaluate individual turnover and compositional shift by comparing individual turnover between two periods at a given site. However, the proposed individual-based indices are applicable only to pairwise dissimilarity, not to multiple-temporal (or more generally, multiple-unit) dissimilarity. Here, individual-based beta-diversity indices are extended to multiple-unit cases. In addition, a novel type of random permutation criterion related to these multiple-unit indices for detecting patterns of individual persistence is introduced in the present study. To demonstrate the usage the properties of these indices compared to average pairwise measures, I applied them to a dataset for a permanent 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. Information regarding "individuals" is generally missing from community ecology and biodiversity studies of temporal dynamics. In this context, the methods proposed here are expected to be useful for addressing a wide range of research questions regarding temporal changes in biodiversity, especially studies using traditional individual-tracked forest monitoring data.

AB Recent findings that some gray whales that feed off Sakhalin Island (SI), Russia, in the western North Pacific (WNP) overwinter in the eastern North Pacific (ENP) indicate that population structure in this species is more complex than originally thought. We generated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and microsatellite genotypes (n = 12 loci) from 156 whales sampled off SI and compared them to available data from 106 ENP whales. Significant mitochondrial and nuclear genetic differentiation between the SI and ENP whales was found. Genetic cluster analysis identified two groups among the SI whales, one of which was genetically similar to ENP whales. Photographs collected from the biopsied SI whales showed that both groups comprised whales known to migrate to the ENP, suggesting that the clustering pattern was not reflective of some SI whales interbreeding while overwintering in the WNP. Instead, the genetic differentiation observed between the SI and ENP whales may be due to assortative mating of SI whales while west of eastern migratory routes. The rare but continued reports of gray whales off the coasts of Japan and China, however, confirm that some gray whales overwinter in the WNP and highlight the need to collect additional data from these whales.

AB Aim Two of the most important forces affecting biodiversity are land use change (LUC) and global climate change (GCC). Previous studies have modelled their impacts on species separately, and together, but few have done so for multiple species with dispersal limitations incorporated into the models. Location Qinghai-Tibet plateau region. Methods We integrate species distribution models plus a dispersal model to predict LUC and GCC impacts on the ranges of five species of pikas in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau region of China. Pikas are sensitive to land use and climate change and have limited dispersal abilities. Results The predicted impacts of LUC and GCC on pikas vary between species as well as between LUC and GCC projections. Incorporation of dispersal limitations appreciably restricts the amount of colonized habitat. For all five species, the amount of habitat abandoned or colonized when LUC and GCC are modelled together is less than the sum of LUC and GCC modelled separately. Three of the five species experience a net increase in occupied habitat by 2080 relative to their current ranges under all modelled projections. However, relative to a "Dispersal Only" baseline scenario that assumes no environmental change but continued range expansion into suitable, unoccupied habitat, all five species suffer a net loss of occupied habitat by 2080 under some or all projections. Main conclusions Predictions of future distributions of species based solely on LUC or GCC, as well as predictions assuming additive impacts, can be misleading. Inclusion of dispersal limitations in models markedly alters predicted future distributions of species. The use of a "Dispersal Only" scenario provides a different and perhaps more accurate way to gauge net impacts to species. Future work should consider incorporating all these parameters to better predict the impacts of LUC and GCC on biodiversity.

AB Globally, agriculture sector is the significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions into the atmosphere. To achieve the goal of limiting or mitigating these emissions, a rigorous abatement strategy with an additional focus on improving crop productivity is now imperative. Replacing traditional agriculture with soil conservation-based farming can have numerous ecological benefits. However, most assessments only consider improvements in soil properties and crop productivity, and often preclude the quantitative impact analysis on GHGs emissions. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate crop productivity (i.e., biomass, grain, total yield) and GHGs emissions (i.e., CO2, N2O, CH4) for three major soil conservation practices i.e., no-tillage, manures, and biochar. We also examined the yield potential of three major cereal crops (i.e., wheat, rice, maize) and their significance in mitigating GHGs emissions. None of the manures were able to reduce GHGs emissions, with poultry manure being the largest contributor to all GHGs emissions. However, pig-manure had the greatest impact on crop yield while emitting the least CO2 emissions. Use of biochar showed a strong coupling effect between reduction of GHGs (i.e., CH4 by -37%; N2O by -25%; CO2 by -5%) and the increase in crop productivity. In contrast, no-tillage resulted in higher GHGs emissions with only a marginal increase in grain yield. Depending on crop type, all cereal crops showed varied degrees of GHGs mitigation under biochar application, with wheat responding most strongly due to the additional yield increment. The addition of biochar significantly reduced CO2 and N2O emissions under both rainfed and irrigated conditions, although CH4 reductions were identical in both agroecosystems. Interestingly, the use of biochar resulted in a greater yield benefit in rainfed than in irrigated agriculture. Despite significant GHGs emissions, manure application contributed to higher crop yields, regardless of soil type or agroecosystem. Moreover, no-tillage showed a significant reduction in CH4 and N2O emissions under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Notably , biochar application in coarse while no-till in fine textured soils contributed to N2O mitigation. Most importantly, effectiveness of no-tillage as a countermeasure to GHGs emissions while providing yield benefits is inconsistent. Overall, the decision to use farm manures should be reconsidered due to higher GHGs emissions. We conclude that the use of biochar could be an ideal way to reduce GHGs emissions.

AB Global change is expected to impact on the distribution and abundance of forests. Spain represents the southwestern limit of distribution for several types of deciduous forests and, as part of the Mediterranean Basin, it has all the characteristics to be affected by climate change. This study analyses the effects of climate change on habitat suitability and vulnerability in four categories of deciduous forests: Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Leibl., Quercus robur L. and Betula celtiberica Rothm. and Vasc. The approach combines an ensemble platform for species distribution models (SDMs) using three algorithms applied to four global circulation models (GCMs) driven by two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Bioclimatic, biogeographic, soil and topographic variables were taken into consideration as predictors to build 320 single distribution models. Ensemble-forecasting models were then produced for each forest category and RCPs by computing a consensus of single-model projections. The adapted proposal of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was also applied to deal with the uncertainty and notify the likelihood of the outcomes . The results revealed generalized losses in habitat suitability compared to current conditions for all the forest categories, which were more drastic for the RCP 8.5 emission pathway. Exceptions worth noting are forests of Fagus sylvatica (likelihood 25%-50%) and Quercus robur (likelihood 75%-100%) in the Orocantabrian biogeographic subprovince, and Quercus petraea formations in the Cantabrian Atlantic subprovince (likelihood 25%50%). Betula celtiberica would suffer the largest losses of habitat suitability under the climate change scenarios analysed. The vulnerability analysis confirmed that the deciduous formations least affected by climate change in future will be the Orocantabrian forests, while the Pyrenean and Oroiberian communities are the most vulnerable. The models developed in this study provide decision-makers with basic information and a useful tool for designing plans for the conservation and management of these forests in order to mitigate the impact of climate change. The study also highlights the importance and usefulness of conducting analyses at the biogeographic level, since the effects of climate change may be different and require management and conservation policies at local level.

AB The iso/anisohydric continuum has been used to classify tree species' drought response strategies. The range over which stomata are regulating leaf water potential (psi(l)) before turgor loss occurs can be described with metrics such as the dependence of psi(l) on soil water potential (psi(soil)) and the size of 'hydroscape area' (HA), but corresponding field data from adult trees are scarce. We examined the stomatal conductance (g(s))-psi(l) relationship in its temporal (diurnal vs seasonal and interannual) and spatial (within-crown vs between-site) variation in European beech, using extensive psi(l) and g(s) measurements in the canopy of four beech stands across a precipitation gradient, and complemented the data set by published psi(l) and g(s) measurements in further Central European beech stands (including the extreme 2018 drought) in order to cover the full water potential operation space of the species. Both metrics characterize beech as a strictly anisohydric species with delta psi(l)/delta psi(soil) >> 1 and HA = 4 MPa2. However, stomates close sensitively in response to increasing vapor pressure deficit, disproving the widely assumed dependence of large psi(l) variation on looser stomatal control. Characterizing the water status regulation mechanisms of trees requires separating diurnal from day-to-day variation in psi(l) and g(s). The large diurnal and seasonal psi(l) variation in beech leaves is partly caused by a low leaf tissue elasticity, suggesting that a whole-plant perspective with consideration of osmotic and elastic tissue properties and stem and root hydraulics is needed for fully understanding psi(l) regulation and the drought tolerance strategy of trees.

AB Premise The mechanisms generating the geographical distributions of genetic diversity are a central theme in evolutionary biology. The amount of genetic diversity and its distribution are controlled by several factors, including dispersal abilities, physical barriers, and environmental and climatic changes. We investigated the patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation among populations of the widespread species Brosimum alicastrum in Mexico. Methods Using nuclear DNA microsatellite data, we tested whether the genetic structure of B. alicastrum was associated with the roles of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as geographical barriers to gene flow and to infer the role of past events in the genetic diversity patterns. We further used a maximum-likelihood population-effects mixed model (MLPE) to identify the main factor affecting population differentiation in B. alicastrum. Results Our results suggested that Mexican B. alicastrum is well differentiated into three main lineages. Patterns of the genetic structure at a finer scale did not fully correspond to the current geographical barriers to gene flow. According to the MLPE mixed model, isolation by distance is the best model for explaining the genetic differentiation of B. alicastrum in Mexico. Conclusions We propose that the differentiation patterns might reflect (1) an ancient differentiation that occurred in Central and South America, (2) the effects of past climatic changes, and (3) the functions of some physical barriers to gene flow. This study provides insights into the possible mechanisms underlying the geographic genetic variation of B. alicastrum along a moisture gradient in tropical lowland forests.

AB Root-associated fungal communities modify the climatic niches and even the competitive ability of their hosts, yet how the different components of the root microbiome are modified by habitat loss remains a key knowledge gap. Using principles of landscape ecology, we tested how free-living versus host-associated microbes differ in their response to landscape heterogeneity. Further, we explore how compartmentalisation of microbes into specialised root structures filters for key fungal symbionts. Our study demonstrates that free-living fungal community structure correlates with landscape heterogeneity, but that host-associated fungal communities depart from these patterns. Specifically, biotic filtering in roots, especially via compartmentalisation within specialised root structures, decouples the biogeographic patterns of host-associated fungal communities from the soil community. In this way, even as habitat loss and fragmentation threaten fungal diversity in the soils, plant hosts exert biotic controls to ensure associations with critical mutualists, helping to preserve the root mycobiome.

AB Although neo-Darwinian (and less often Lamarckian) dynamics are regularly invoked to interpret cancer's multifarious molecular profiles, they shine little light on how tumorigenesis unfolds and often fail to fully capture the frequency and breadth of resistance mechanisms. This uncertainty frames one of the most problematic gaps between science and practice in modern times. Here, we offer a theory of adaptive cancer evolution, which builds on a molecular mechanism that lies outside neo-Darwinian and Lamarckian schemes. This mechanism coherently integrates non-genetic and genetic changes, ecological and evolutionary time scales, and shifts the spotlight away from positive selection towards purifying selection, genetic drift, and the creative-disruptive power of environmental change. The surprisingly simple use-it or lose-it rationale of the proposed theory can help predict molecular dynamics during tumorigenesis. It also provides simple rules of thumb that should help improve therapeutic approaches in cancer.

AB Flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) is one of the most prominent xenobiotic metabolic enzymes. It can catalyze the conversion of heteroatom-containing chemicals to polar, readily excretable metabolites and is considered an efficient detoxification system for xenobiotics. Bivalves can accumulate paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) produced by dinoflagellates, especially during outbreaks of harmful algal blooms. Exploring FMO genes in bivalves may contribute to a better understanding of the adaptation of these species and the mechanisms of PSTs bioavailability. Therefore, through genome screening, we examined the expansion of FMO genes in two scallops (Patinopecten yessoensis and Chlamys farreri) and found a new subfamily (FMO_like). Our expression analyses revealed that, in both scallops, members of the FMO_N-oxide and FMO_like subfamilies were mainly expressed from the D-stage larvae to juveniles, whereas the FMO_GS-OX subfamily genes were mainly expressed at and prior to the trochophore stage. In adult organs, higher expressions of FMOs were observed in the kidney and hepatopancreas than in other organs. After exposure to PST-producing algae, expression changes in FMOs occurred in hepatopancreas and kidney of both scallops, with more members being up-regulated in hepatopancreas than in kidney for Alexandrium catenella exposure, while more up-regulated FMOs were found in kidney than in hepatopancreas of C. farreri exposed to A. minutum. Our findings suggest the adaptive functional diversity of scallop FMO genes in coping with the toxicity of PST-producing algae.

AB To predict how widely distributed species will perform under future climate change, it is crucial to understand and reveal their underlying phylogenetics. However, detailed information about plant adaptation and its genetic basis and history remains scarce and especially widely distributed species receive little attention despite their putatively high adaptability. To examine the adaptation potential of a widely distributed species, we sampled the model plant Silene vulgaris across Europe. In a greenhouse experiment, we exposed the offspring of these populations to a climate change scenario for central Europe and revealed the population structure through whole-genome sequencing. Plants were grown under two temperatures (18 degrees C and 21 degrees C) and three precipitation regimes (65, 75, and 90 mm) to measure their response in biomass and fecundity-related traits. To reveal the population genetic structure, ddRAD sequencing was employed for a whole-genome approach. We found three major genetic clusters in S. vulgaris from Europe: one cluster comprising Southern European populations, one cluster of Western European populations, and another cluster containing central European populations. Population genetic diversity decreased with increasing latitude, and a Mantel test revealed significant correlations between F-ST and geographic distances as well as between genetic and environmental distances. Our trait analysis showed that the genetic clusters significantly differed in biomass-related traits and in the days to flowering. However, half of the traits showed parallel response patterns to the experimental climate change scenario. Due to the differentiated but parallel response patterns, we assume that phenotypic plasticity plays an important role for the adaptation of the widely distributed species S. vulgaris and its intraspecific genetic lineages.

AB Being able to assign sex to individuals and identify autosomal and sex-linked scaffolds are essential in most population genomic analyses. Non-model organisms often have genome assemblies at scaffold-level and lack characterization of sex-linked scaffolds. Previous methods to identify sex and sex-linked scaffolds have relied on synteny between the non-model organism and a closely related species or prior knowledge about the sex of the samples to identify sex-linked scaffolds. In the latter case, the difference in depth of coverage between the autosomes and the sex chromosomes are used. Here, we present "sex assignment through coverage" (SATC), a method to assign sex to samples and identify sex-linked scaffolds from next generation sequencing (NGS) data. The method works for species with a homogametic/heterogametic sex determination system and only requires a scaffold-level reference assembly and sampling of both sexes with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. We use the sequencing depth distribution across scaffolds to jointly identify: (i) male and female individuals, and (ii) sex-linked scaffolds. This is achieved through projecting the scaffold depths into a low-dimensional space using principal component analysis (PCA) and subsequent Gaussian mixture clustering. We demonstrate the applicability of our method using data from five mammal species and a bird species complex. The method is freely available at as R code and a graphical user interface (GUI).

AB Background Quantifying metabolic rate in free-living animals is invaluable in understanding the costs of behaviour and movement for individuals and communities. Dynamic body acceleration (DBA) metrics, such as vectoral DBA (VeDBA), are commonly used as proxies for the energy expenditure of movement but are of limited applicability for slow-moving species. It has recently been suggested that metrics based on angular velocity might be better suited to characterise their energetics. We investigated whether a novel metric-the 'Rate of change of Rotational Movement (RocRM)', calculated from the vectoral sum of change in the pitch, roll and yaw/heading axes over a given length of time, is a suitable proxy for energy expenditure. Results We found that RocRM can be used as an alternative energy expenditure proxy in a slow-moving benthic invertebrate. Eleven Giant spider conchs Lambis truncata (collected in the Red Sea) were instrumented with multiple channel (Daily Diary) tags and kept in sealed chambers for 5 h while their oxygen consumption, V?O-2, was measured. We found RocRM to be positively correlated with V?O-2, this relationship being affected by the time-step (i.e. the range of the calculated differential) of the RocRM. Time steps of 1, 5, 10 and 60 s yielded an explained variability of between 15 and 31%. The relationship between V?O-2 and VeDBA was not statistically significant, suggesting RocRM to provide more accurate estimations of metabolic rates in L. truncata. Conclusions RocRM proved to be a statistically significant predictor of V?O-2 where VeDBA did not, validating the approach of using angular-based metrics over dynamic movement-based ones for slower moving animals. Further work is required to validate the use of RocRM for other species, particularly in animals with minimally dynamic movement, to better understand energetic costs of whole ecosystems. Unexplained variability in the models might be a consequence of the methodology used, but also likely a result of conch activity that does not manifest in movement of the shell. Additionally, density plots of mean RocRM at each time-step suggest differences in movement scales, which may collectively be useful as a species fingerprint of movement going forward.

AB Human population expansion into wildlife habitats has increased interest in the behavioural ecology of human-wildlife interactions. To date, however, the socioecological factors that determine whether, when or where wild animals take risks by interacting with humans and anthropogenic factors still remains unclear. We adopt a comparative approach to address this gap, using social network analysis (SNA). SNA, increasingly implemented to determine human impact on wildlife ecology, can be a powerful tool to understand how animal socioecology influences the spatiotemporal distribution of human-wildlife interactions. For 10 groups of rhesus, long-tailed and bonnet macaques (Macaca spp.) living in anthropogenically impacted environments in Asia, we collected data on human-macaque interactions, animal demographics, and macaque-macaque agonistic and affiliative social interactions. We constructed 'human co-interaction networks' based on associations between macaques that interacted with humans within the same time and spatial locations, and social networks based on macaque-macaque allogrooming behaviour, affiliative behaviours of short duration (agonistic support, lip-smacking, silent bare-teeth displays and non-sexual mounting) and proximity. Pre-network permutation tests revealed that, within all macaque groups, specific individuals jointly took risks by repeatedly, consistently co-interacting with humans within and across time and space. GLMMs revealed that macaques' tendencies to co-interact with humans was positively predicted by their tendencies to engage in short-duration affiliative interactions and tolerance of conspecifics, although the latter varied across species (bonnets>rhesus>long-tailed). Male macaques were more likely to co-interact with humans than females. Neither macaques' grooming relationships nor their dominance ranks predicted their tendencies to co-interact with humans. Our findings suggest that, in challenging anthropogenic environments, less (compared to more) time-consuming forms of affiliation, and additionally greater social tolerance in less ecologically flexible species with a shorter history of exposure to humans, may be key to animals' joint propensities to take risks to gain access to resources. For males, greater exploratory tendencies and less energetically demanding long-term life-history strategies (compared to females) may also influence such joint risk-taking. From conservation and public health perspectives, wildlife connectedness within such co-interaction networks may inform interventions to mitigate zoonosis, and move human-wildlife interactions from conflict towards coexistence.

AB Widespread woody encroachment is a prominent concern for savanna systems as it is often accompanied by losses in productivity and biodiversity. Extensive ecosystem-level work has advanced our understanding of its causes and consequences. However, there is still debate over whether local management can override regional and global drivers of woody encroachment, and it remains largely unknown how encroachment influences woody community assemblages. Here, we examined species-level changes in woody plant distributions and size structure from the late 1980s to the late 2000s based on spatially intensive ground-based surveys across Kruger National Park, South Africa. This study region spans broad gradients in rainfall, soil texture, fire frequency, elephant density, and other topographic variables. Species-level changes in frequency of occurrence and size class proportion reflected widespread woody encroachment primarily by Dichrostachys cinerea and Combretum apiculatum, and a loss of large trees mostly of Sclerocarya birrea and Acacia nigrescens. Environmental variables determining woody species distributions across Kruger varied among species but did not change substantially between two sampling times, indicating that woody encroachers were thickening within their existing ranges. Overall, more areas across Kruger were found to have an increased number of common woody species through time, which indicated an increase in stem density. These areas were generally associated with decreasing fire frequency and rainfall but increasing elephant density. Our results suggest that woody encroachment is a widespread but highly variable trend across landscapes in Kruger National Park and potentially reflects an erosion of local heterogeneity in woody community assemblages. Many savanna managers, including in Kruger, aim to manage for heterogeneity in order to promote biodiversity, where homogenization of vegetation structure counters this specific goal. Increasing fire frequency has some potential as a local intervention. However, many common species increased in commonness even under near-constant disturbance conditions, which likely limits the potential for managing woody encroachment in the face of drivers beyond the scope of local control. Regular field sampling coupled with targeted fire management will enable more accurate monitoring of the rate of encroachment intensification.

AB From regional to global scales, anthropogenic environmental change is causing biodiversity loss and reducing ecosystem functionality. Previous studies have investigated the relationship between plant diversity and functional insect communities in temperate and also in tropical grasslands and forests. However, few studies have explored these dynamics in subtropical forests. Here, cavity-nesting Hymenoptera and associated parasitoids were collected across a controlled tree diversity experiment in subtropical China to test how predatory wasps, bees and parasitoids respond to tree species richness. Abundance and species richness of predatory wasps and parasitoids were positively correlated with tree species richness, while bee abundance and bee species richness were unrelated to tree species richness. Our results indicate that tree species richness increases the abundance and species richness of important communities such as predators and parasitoids. Moreover, the results highlight the importance of subtropical forests in maintaining abundance and species richness of key functional insect groups. (c) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB European brown hare populations have declined during the last decades. Agricultural intensification has been identified as a relevant driver of this process and agri-environment schemes have been implemented to foster biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Because species-specific outcomes of measures strongly depend on tailored design of the policy framework and the local management, while changing climate may pose additional challenges, policy and management need science-based information of which landscape composition should be promoted to achieve set biodiversity goals.
   Here, we used direct observations of European brown hares over 20 years for evaluating the effects of landscape composition and weather conditions on European brown hare density. For the first time, our analysis compared the estimates of machine learning (gradient boosting machine) and linear mixed models in terms of importance of a wide range of explanatory variables for European brown hare densities and effect trends.
   Scattered woody vegetation, as represented by the two variables transitional woodland-shrub and small woody features, was on top rankings among the predictors and greater proportions of these elements were accompanied by sharp increases of European brown hare density. Also warmer winter temperature had a positive effect.
   We conclude that promoting scattered woody vegetation in agricultural landscapes is a powerful tool for improving European brown hare habitat quality. Particularly with the increasing dynamic in agriculture due to climate change, incentives and regulations that create a long-lasting heterogeneity in the landscape composition through near-natural elements can support the population of this popular mammal.

AB Functional connectivity (i.e., the movement of individuals across a landscape) is essential for the maintenance of genetic variation and persistence of rare species. However, illuminating the processes influencing functional connectivity and ultimately translating this knowledge into management practice remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we combine various population structure analyses with pairwise, population-specific demographic modeling to investigate historical functional connectivity in Graham's beardtongue (Penstemon grahamii), a rare plant narrowly distributed across a dryland region of the western US. While principal component and population structure analyses indicated an isolation-by-distance pattern of differentiation across the species' range, spatial inferences of effective migration exposed an abrupt shift in population ancestry near the range center. To understand these seemingly conflicting patterns, we tested various models of historical gene flow and found evidence for recent admixture (similar to 3400 generations ago) between populations near the range center. This historical perspective reconciles population structure patterns and suggests management efforts should focus on maintaining connectivity between these previously isolated lineages to promote the ongoing transfer of genetic variation. Beyond providing species-specific knowledge to inform management options, our study highlights how understanding demographic history may be critical to guide conservation efforts when interpreting population genetic patterns and inferring functional connectivity.

AB Key message In Rosaceae, tandem duplication caused the drastic expansion of CNGC gene family Group I. The members MdCN11 and MdCN19 negatively regulate Valsa canker resistance. Apple (Malus domestica) and pear (Pyrus bretschneideri and P. communis) are important fruit crops in Rosaceae family but are suffering from threats of Valsa canker. Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs) take crucial roles in plant immune responses. In the present study, a total of 355 CNGCs was identified from 8 Rosaceae plants. Based on phylogenetic analysis, 540 CNGCs from 18 plants (8 in Rosaceae and 10 others) could be divided into four groups. Group I was greatly expanded in Rosaceae resulted from tandem duplications. A large number of cis-acting regulatory elements (cis-elements) responsive to signals from multiple stresses and hormones were identified in the promoter regions of CNGCs in Malus spp. and Pyrus spp. Expressions of most Group I members were obviously up-regulated in Valsa canker susceptible varieties but not in the resistant ones. Furthermore, overexpression of the MdCN11 and MdCN19 in both apple fruits and 'Duli' (P. betulifolia) suspension cells compromised Valsa canker resistance. Overexpression of MdCN11 induced expression of hypersensitive response (HR)-related genes. In conclusion, tandem duplication resulted in a drastic expansion of CNGC Group I members in Rosaceae. Among these, MdCN11 and MdCN19 negatively regulate the Valsa canker resistance via inducting HR.

AB Landscape features influence wildlife movements across spatial scales and have the potential to influence the spread of disease. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease affecting members of the family Cervidae, particularly white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the first positive CWD case in a wild deer in Ohio, USA, was recorded in 2020. Landscape genetics approaches are increasingly used to better understand potential pathways for CWD spread in white-tailed deer, but little is known about genetic structure of white-tailed deer in Ohio. The objectives of our study were to evaluate spatial genetic structure in white-tailed deer across Ohio and compare the support for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by landscape resistance (IBR) models in explaining this structure. We collected genetic data from 619 individual deer from 24 counties across Ohio during 2007-2009. We used microsatellite genotypes from 619 individuals genotyped at 11 loci and haplotypes from a 547-base pair fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. We used spatial and non-spatial genetic clustering tests to evaluate genetic structure in both types of genetic data and empirically optimized landscape resistance surfaces to compare IBD and IBR using microsatellite data. Non-spatial genetic clustering tests failed to detect spatial genetic structure, whereas spatial genetic clustering tests indicated subtle spatial genetic structure. The IBD model consistently outperformed IBR models that included land cover, traffic volume, and streams. Our results indicated widespread genetic connectivity of white-tailed deer across Ohio and negligible effects of landscape features. These patterns likely reflect some combination of minimal resistive effects of landscape features on white-tail deer movement in Ohio and the effects of regional recolonization or translocation. We encourage continued CWD surveillance in Ohio, particularly in the proximity of confirmed cases. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB Endurance athletes may implement rigid dietary strategies, such as the ketogenic diet (KD), to improve performance. The effect of the KD on appetite remains unclear in endurance athletes. This study analyzed the effects of a KD, a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD), and habitual diet (HD) on objective and subjective measures of appetite in trained cyclists and triathletes, and hypothesized that the KD would result in greater objective and subjective appetite suppression. Six participants consumed the KD and HCD for 2-weeks each, in a random order, following their HD. Fasting appetite measures were collected after 2-weeks on each diet. Postprandial appetite measures were collected following consumption of a ketogenic meal after the KD, high-carbohydrate meal after the HCD, and standard American/Western meal after the HD. Fasting total ghrelin (GHR) was lower and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and hunger were higher following the KD versus HD and HCD. Fasting insulin was not different. Mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis and effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals showed that postprandial GHR and insulin were lower and GLP-1 was higher following the ketogenic versus the standard and high-carbohydrate meals.

AB Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) are widely considered an offshore and oceanic species, but certain populations also use coastal areas and semi-enclosed seas. Based upon fifteen years of study, we report that Canadian Pacific fin whales (B. p. velifera) have returned to the Kitimat Fjord System (KFS) in the Great Bear Rainforest, and have established a seasonally resident population in its intracoastal waters. This is the only fjord system along this coast or elsewhere in which fin whales are known to occur regularly with strong site fidelity. The KFS was also the only Canadian Pacific fjord system in which fin whales were commonly found and killed during commercial whaling, pointing to its long-term importance. Traditional knowledge, whaling records, and citizen science databases suggest that fin whales were extirpated from this area prior to their return in 2005-2006. Visual surveys and mark-recapture analysis documented their repopulation of the area, with 100-120 whales using the fjord system in recent years, as well as the establishment of a seasonally resident population with annual return rates higher than 70%. Line transect surveys identified the central and outer channels of the KFS as the primary fin whale habitat, with the greatest densities occurring in Squally Channel and Caamano Sound. Fin whales were observed in the KFS in most months of the year. Vessel- and shore-based surveys (27,311 km and 6,572 hours of effort, respectively) indicated regular fin whale presence (2,542 detections), including mother-calf pairs, from June to October and peak abundance in late August-early September. Seasonal patterns were variable year-to-year, and several lines of evidence indicated that fin whales arrived and departed from the KFS repeatedly throughout the summer and fall. Additionally, we report on the population's social network and morphometrics. These findings offer insights into the dynamics of population recovery in an area where several marine shipping projects are proposed. The fin whales of the Great Bear Rainforest represent a rare exception to general patterns in this species' natural history, and we highlight the importance of their conservation.

TI Death-feigning behaviours increase survival rate of littoral cladocerans
   under predation by odonate larvae
SO FRESHWATER BIOLOGY

ID DRAGONFLY LARVAE; PREY CAPTURE
AB Because littoral cladocerans are common prey for odonate larvae, they are ideal organisms to examine prey and predator interactions in aquatic habitats. Although death-feigning behaviour observed in littoral cladocerans is viewed as a trait to reduce predation risk, no study has examined the effectiveness of death-feigning at reducing mortality. We studied the effectiveness of death-feigning behaviour by two littoral cladocerans, Chydorus sphaericus and Oxyurella tenuicaudis, against the odonate larvae of Sympetrum frequens. We first examined how the odonate larvae detected the prey and found that the larvae consumed active cladocerans, even under dark conditions, but they did not consume anaesthetised cladocerans, indicating that the larvae detect the prey using mechanical cues such as vibrational currents created by the prey individuals. We then observed behavioural events of odonate larvae and prey cladocerans using a video-recording system to count the number of cladocerans that showed death-feigning behaviours when odonate larvae attacked and those that were not consumed when they showed death-feigning behaviours. We observed a total of 1,099 behavioural events in prey-predator interactions. On average, the odonate larvae pursued 63% of the cladocerans encountered, attacked 89% of the cladocerans pursued, and successfully captured only 29% of the cladocerans with the first attack. Among the cladocerans that were not captured, 38% of the individuals continually swam, but 62% ceased to move and exhibited death-feigning behaviours. The odonate larvae's capture rate for cladocerans exhibiting the death-feigning behaviours fell significantly short of that for cladocerans that were continually swimming. The experiments clearly showed that the littoral cladocerans' death-feigning behaviour effectively decreased predation rate by odonate larvae. The results suggest that the death feigning serves as an adaptive behaviour to reduce mortality risk in littoral cladocerans under predation by such predators that can detect prey using mechanical cues such as those of vibrational currents.

AB Ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss have been caused by economic booms in developing countries over recent decades. In response, ecosystem restoration projects have been advanced in some countries but the effectiveness of different approaches and indicators at large spatio-temporal scales (i.e., whole catchments) remains poorly understood. This study assessed the effectiveness of a diverse array of 440 aquatic restoration projects including wastewater treatment, constructed wetlands, plant/algae salvage and dredging of contaminated sediments implemented and maintained from 2007 to 2017 across more than 2000 km(2) of the northwest Taihu basin (Yixing, China). Synchronized investigations of water quality and invertebrate communities were conducted before and after restoration. Our analysis showed that even though there was rapid urbanization at this time, nutrient concentrations (NH4+-N, TN, TP) and biological indices of benthic invertebrate (taxonomic richness, Shannon diversity, sensitive taxon density) improved significantly across most of the study area. Improvements were associated with the type of restoration project, with projects targeting pollution-sources leading to the clearest ecosystem responses compared with those remediating pollution sinks. However, in some locations, the recovery of biotic communities appears to lag behind nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), likely reflecting long-distance re-colonization mutes for invertebrates given the level of pre-restoration degradation of the catchment. Overall, the study suggests that ecological damage caused by recent rapid economic development in China could potentially be mitigated by massive restoration investments synchronized across whole catchments, although these effects could be expected to be enhanced if urbanization rates were reduced at the same time.

AB Background and Aims Understanding the population genetics and evolutionary history of endangered species is urgently needed in an era of accelerated biodiversity loss. This knowledge is most important for regions with high endemism that are ecologically vulnerable, such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP).
   Methods The genetic variation of 84 juniper trees from six populations of Juniperus microsperma and one population of Juniperus erectopatens, two narrow-endemic junipers from the QTP that are sister to each other, was surveyed using RNA-sequencing data. Coalescent-based analyses were used to test speciation. migration and demographic scenarios. Furthermore. positively selected and climate-associated genes were identified, and the genetic load was assessed for both species.
   Key Results Analyses of 149 052 single nucleotide polymorphisms showed that the two species arc well differentiated and monophyletic. They diverged around the late Pliocene. but interspecific gene flow continued until the Last Glacial Maximwn. Demographic reconstruction by Stairway Plot detected two severe bottlenecks for J. microsperma but only one for J. erectopaens. The identified positively selected genes and climate-associated genes revealed habitat adaptation of the two species. Furthermore, although J. microsperma had a much wider geographical distribution than J. erectopatens, the former possesses lower genetic diversity and a higher genetic load than the latter.
   Conclusions This study sheds light on the evolution of two endemic juniper species from the QTP and their responses to Quaternary climate fluctuations. Our findings emphasize the importance of speciation and demographic history reconstructions in understanding the current distribution pattern and genetic diversity of threatened species in mountainous regions.

AB The alkalinity concentration swing (ACS) is a new process for direct air capture of carbon dioxide driven by concentrating an alkaline solution that has been exposed to the atmosphere and loaded with dissolved inorganic carbon. Upon concentration, the partial pressure of CO2 increases, allowing for extraction and compression. Higher concentration factors result in proportionally higher outgassing pressure, and higher initial alkalinity concentrations at the same concentration factor outgas a higher concentration of CO2. Two desalination technologies, reverse osmosis and capacitive deionization, are examined as possible ACS implementations, and two corresponding energy models are evaluated. The ACS is compared to incumbent technologies and estimates for water, land, and energy requirements for capturing one million tonnes of CO2 per year are made. Estimates for the lower end of the energy range for both approaches compare favorably to other approaches, such as solid sorbent and calcining methods.

AB Animal social structure is influenced by multiple socioecological factors. Of these, the links between changes to group demography through the arrival of new individuals and residents' social structure remain unclear. Across seven groups of captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), we examine how male introductions may be influenced by, and in-turn influence, aspects of female social structure. GLMMs revealed that males integrated more successfully into groups in which females showed more 'despotic' social structures, i.e., higher aggression rates, steeper dominance hierarchies, and greater rank-skew in allogrooming network connectedness. Yet during periods that followed males' social integration, females increased their social tolerance (decreased aggres-sion and shallower hierarchies) and group cohesivity (less clustered allogrooming networks), but retained their tendencies to groom dominants. Our findings, independent of group size and matrilin-eal relatedness, help better understand how dispersal/immigration may influence social structure, and how assessing changes to social structure may inform macaque welfare and management.

AB Conservation and natural resource management are frequently hampered by poor understanding of how species distributions have changed over time. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) correlate known occurrences with environmental variables to predict a species' potential range. These models can then be projected to unsurveyed areas or time periods to overcome gaps in data on species' distribution. The eastern quoll Dasyurus viverrinus is restricted to Tasmania but until recently occurred over a large area of south-eastern mainland Australia. We used SDMs to reconstruct the distribution of climates suitable for D. viverrinus during the mid-Holocene and present day and identified areas likely to remain suitable in the future which could be prioritised for conservation. Climatically suitable habitat has mostly remained stable since the midHolocene, with some expansion. The historic contraction of the species' distribution was evidently due to threatening processes other than climate change, which are still operating. Under current conditions, large areas of south-eastern Australia still provide suitable habitat for eastern quolls and will continue to do so under predicted climate change scenarios for 2055. Suitable areas include offshore islands, in particular islands within the Nooramunga Marine and Coastal Park in Victoria, and islands that make up the Furneaux Group in the Bass Strait. Translocations to these islands would establish populations in climatically suitable areas separate from threatening processes.

AB In crowding, perception of a target deteriorates in the presence of nearby flankers. Surprisingly, perception can be rescued from crowding if additional flankers are added (uncrowding). Uncrowding is a major challenge for all classic models of crowding and vision in general, because the global configuration of the entire stimulus is crucial. However, it is unclear which characteristics of the configuration impact (un)crowding. Here, we systematically dissected flanker configurations and showed that (un)crowding cannot be easily explained by the effects of the sub-parts or low-level features of the stimulus configuration. Our modeling results suggest that (un)crowding requires global processing. These results are well in line with previous studies showing the importance of global aspects in crowding.

AB The current standard approach for analyzing cortical bone structure and trabecular bone microarchitecture from micro-computed tomography (microCT) is through classic parametric (e.g., ANOVA, Student's T-test) and nonparametric (e.g., Mann-Whitney U test) statistical tests and the reporting of p-values to indicate significance. However, on their own, these univariate assessments of significance fall prey to a number of weaknesses, including an increased chance of Type 1 error from multiple comparisons. Machine learning classification methods (e.g., unsupervised, k-means cluster analysis and supervised Support Vector Machine classification, SVM) simultaneously utilize an entire dataset comprised of many cortical structure or trabecular microarchitecture measures, thus minimizing bias and Type 1 error that are generated through multiple testing. Through simultaneous evaluation of an entire dataset, k-means and SVM thus provide a complementary approach to classic statistical analysis and enable a more robust assessment of microCT measures.

AB Willow biochar can help to sequestrate carbon. However, biomasses should not be grown on arable lands, as it would increase competition with food production and lead to sustainability issues such as increased food prices and decreased food security. The purpose of this study is to calculate the carbon footprint (CF) of willow biochar in Finland and assess the greenhouse gas compensation potential of marginal lands if they are utilized for willow biochar production. The CF of willow biochar is inadequately assessed together with marginal lands in the literature. A cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of willow biochar was conducted. The results were then applied to assess the total CF of marginal lands. It was found that the CF of willow biochar is -1875 kgCO(2)eq t(-1) of dry biochar. Grown on marginal lands in Finland, willow biochar could compensate 7.7% of yearly agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. On buffer zones, willow biochar could also compensate some of the emissions depending on the zone size. The results of the study support current findings of biochar as a carbon negative product. The study also indicates that willow biochar produced in marginal lands can be used to compensate agricultural greenhouse gas emissions to some extent.

AB Remote Sensing (RS) is a useful tool for detecting and mapping Invasive Alien Plants (IAPs). IAPs mapping on dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes, using satellite RS data, is not always feasible. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with ultra-high spatial resolution data represent a promising tool for IAPs detection and mapping. This work develops an operational workflow for detecting and mapping Acacia saligna invasion along Mediterranean coastal dunes. In particular, it explores and tests the potential of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and multispectral (Green, Red, Red Edge, Near Infra-Red) UAV images collected in pre-flowering and flowering phenological stages for detecting and mapping A. saligna. After ortho-mosaics generation, we derived from RGB images the DSM (Digital Surface Model) and HIS (Hue, Intensity, Saturation) variables, and we calculated the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). For classifying images of the two phenological stages we built a set of raster stacks which include different combination of variables. For image classification, we used the Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis techniques (GEOBIA) in combination with Random Forest (RF) classifier. All classifications derived from RS information (collected on pre-flowering and flowering stages and using different combinations of variables) produced A. saligna maps with acceptable accuracy values, with higher performances on classification derived from flowering period images, especially using DSM + HIS combination. The adopted approach resulted an efficient method for mapping and early detection of IAPs, also in complex environments offering a sound support to the prioritization of conservation and management actions claimed by the EU IAS Regulation 1143/2014.

AB Despite their importance as water reservoirs and endemism hotspots, Paramos or tropical alpine ecosystems are threatened by global warming and anthropic activities. An important but often neglected component of paramo biodiversity are hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), which play key roles in the provision of ecosystem services at high elevations where bee abundance decreases. We characterized the spatial distribution of Syrphidae diversity at two Paramo complexes to identify potential bioindicator species for montane habitats. We hypothesized that bioindicator species must be easily detected and exhibit affinity for a particular habitat when replacement between and/or within habitats tend to be strong. Twelve bimonthly samples of ten days were done at Santa-Ines-Belmira and Sonson Paramo complexes in Colombia, comprising 18 sampling stations distributed among three habitat types: paramo, forest, and grassland. Flies were collected using ground and canopy Malaise traps, colored pan-traps, and sweeping. We estimated alpha and beta diversity components within and between habitats. We identified potential bioindicator species based on exclusivity and fidelity criteria. We collected 2783 specimens belonging to 41 genera and 148 species. Paramo had the highest richness and number of collected specimens (110 species, 84% completeness percentage, n = 1878), followed by forest (88 species, 65%, n = 357), and grassland (59 species, 80%, n = 571). Species replacement was the dominant component of incidence-based beta diversity. The similar contribution of nestedness and turnover between paramo and grassland reinforces the hypothesis that grassland communities may represent disturbed paramo. We propose eleven genera and fourteen species as bioindicators of paramo, one genus for forest, and one genus and two species for grassland, potentially useful to evaluate and implement conservation programs in Andean ecosystems. Implications for insect conservation: Bioindicator species facilitate monitoring the state of ecosystems, a necessary procedure to forecast and mitigate changes due to climate change and anthropogenic advances. Paramos harbor great species richness in relatively small areas and are under constant threat due to agricultural and mining practices. The conservation of these habitats will guarantee not only the continuity and persistence of ecological services provided by hoverflies but also the protection of a unique component of the world's biodiversity.

AB Zagros Mountains are like an island in the Middle East and they are subjected to changes in climate. Daphne mucronata Royle is an important medicinal plant species preserved in the high elevation regions in these mountains. Maxent species distribution model was used to integrate presence data (2413 points) and environmental variables to model the current and future potential distribution of D. mucronata in Iran. The most important variables were Bio19 with 50.5% contribution, followed by Bio8 and Bio2 with 30% and 11.4% contributions, respectively. The best Maxent model included seven variables, 4 feature types (linear, quadratic, product, and hinge), and had a test AUC value of 0.894. The current potential distribution indicated that 8% of Iran's drylands are suitable for growing D. mucronata and this area could decrease to 5.2% under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5, and 3.1% under RCP 8.5 due to climate change. Our results suggest that D. mucronata may lose overall about 2.8% and 4.9% of its current distribution under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, by 2050. There would be only 0.7 and 0.2% gains under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The species would locally disappear between 1500- and 2000-m elevation under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The establishment of some stations for monitoring the changes in transition zone or lost areas especially on the southeastern parts of Zagros Mountain can help in detecting changes in the future. Additionally, stable habitats may be good target areas for future conservation planning.

AB Aim The fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans and resultant white-nose syndrome (WNS) continues to advance across North America, infecting new bat hibernacula. Western North America hosts the highest bat diversity in the United States and Canada, yet little is known about hibernacula and hibernation behaviour in this region. An improved understanding of the distribution of suitable hibernacula is critical for land managers to anticipate conservation needs of WNS-susceptible species in currently uninfected regions. Location United States, Canada. Taxon Bats. Methods We estimated suitability of potential winter hibernaculum sites across five bat species' ranges. We estimated winter survival capacity from a mechanistic survivorship model based on bat bioenergetics and climate conditions. We then used boosted regression trees to relate these estimates, along with key landscape attributes, to bat occurrence data in a hybrid correlative-mechanistic approach. Results Winter survival capacity, topography, land cover and access to subterranean features were important predictors of winter hibernaculum selection, but the shape and relative importance of these relationships varied amongst species. This suggests that the occurrence of bat hibernacula can, in part, be predicted from readily mapped above-ground features, not just below-ground characteristics for which spatial data are lacking. Furthermore, our mechanistic estimate of winter survivorship was, on average, the third strongest predictor of winter occurrence probability across focal species. Main conclusions Winter distributions of North American bat species were driven by their physiological capacity to survive winter conditions and duration in a given location, as well as selection for topographic and other landscape features but in species-specific ways. The influence of winter survivorship on several species' distributions, the underlying influence of climate conditions on winter survivorship and the anticipated influence of WNS on bats' hibernation physiology and survivorship together suggest that North American bat distributions may undergo future shifts as these species are exposed not only to WNS but also to climate change.

AB This paper evaluates the potential use of date palm leaf biochar as a climate change solution through CO2 capture and sequestration. The pyrolysis of date palm leaf was performed at different temperatures 300 degrees, 400 degrees, 500 degrees, and 600 degrees C. The physicochemical characteristics of the synthesized biochar were examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Direct gas-solid interaction was carried out in an integrated Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR), connected with a gas analyzer for maximum and effective mixing between the biochar and CO2. LabView program was used as data acquisition for an instantaneous calculation of CO2 adsorption. This study showed that the date palm biochar as porous carbon-based materials has high CO2 adsorption capacity through physisorption and chemisorption progressions. The adsorption results showed a maximum CO2 capture percentage of 0.09 kg CO2/kg, 0.15 kg CO2/kg, 0.20 kg CO2/ kg, and 0.25 kg CO2/kg palm biochar synthesized at 300 degrees C, 400 degrees C, 500 degrees C, and 600 degrees C, respectively. This paper paid attention to the inexpensive technology applied in CO2 sequestration, where fluidization provides well mixing of biochar particles with low operation cost.

AB Cryptic, nocturnal or rare species pose a conservation challenge. Aardvarks (Orycteropus afer) occur across sub-Saharan Africa, but local or regional distribution is frequently unclear. We investigated the habitat relationships of aardvarks within Kruger National Park, South Africa, using non-invasive driving and walking surveys of aardvark sign. We used generalised linear and Maxent models in an exploratory analysis to evaluate our predictions that the distribution of suitable habitat would be influenced by elevation, vegetation productivity, potential termite activity, potential presence of large predators and amount of sand in the soils. We surveyed 1,786 km of roads and conducted 247 short walking surveys, detecting aardvark sign in 601 locations. Relative habitat use by aardvarks was positively correlated with elevation and vegetation productivity and was negatively correlated with surface water occurrence, suggesting that aardvarks avoided areas with high densities of predators, and favoured higher elevations and areas with greener vegetation. Mean annual rainfall, employed as an index of termite activity, was only weakly correlated with habitat suitability, and soil components had little predictive power. We generated predictive maps of aardvark habitat distribution within the Kruger National Park. Our sampling technique could be employed to investigate aardvark distribution and habitat relationships more broadly.

AB Population and conservation genetics studies have greatly benefited from the development of new techniques and bioinformatic tools associated with next-generation sequencing. Analysis of extensive data sets from whole-genome sequencing of even a few individuals allows the detection of patterns of fine-scale population structure and detailed reconstruction of demographic dynamics through time. In this study, we investigated the population structure, genomic diversity and demographic history of the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), the world's largest lizard, by sequencing the whole genomes of 24 individuals from the five main Indonesian islands comprising the entire range of the species. Three main genomic groups were observed. The populations of the Island of Komodo and the northern coast of Flores, in particular, were identified as two distinct conservation units. Degrees of genomic divergence among island populations were interpreted as a result of changes in sea level affecting connectivity across islands. Demographic inference suggested that Komodo dragons probably experienced a relatively steep population decline over the last million years, reaching a relatively stable N-e during the Saalian glacial cycle (400-150 thousand years ago) followed by a rapid N-e decrease. Genomic diversity of Komodo dragons was similar to that found in endangered or already extinct reptile species. Overall, this study provides an example of how whole-genome analysis of a few individuals per population can help define population structure and intraspecific demographic dynamics. This is particularly important when applying population genomics data to conservation of rare or elusive endangered species.

AB The Multidrug and Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) protein belongs to a secondary transporter gene family, which plays a primary role in transporting many kinds of substrates such as organic compounds, secondary metabolites, and phytohormones. MATE protein members exist in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, evolution and comprehensive analysis of the MATE genes has not been performed in Rosaceae species. In the present study, a total of 404 MATEs genes were identified from six Rosaceae genomes (Prunus avium, Pyrus bretschneideri, Prunus persica, Fragaria vesca, Prunus mume, and Malus domestica) and classified into eight main subfamilies (I-VII) based on structural and phylogenetic analysis. Microcollinearity analysis showed that whole-genome duplication events might play a vital role in the expansion of the MATE genes family. The Ka/Ks analysis, chromosomal localization, subcellular localization, and molecular characteristics (length, weight, and pI) were performed using various bioinformatics tools. Furthermore, different subfamilies have different introns-exons structures, cis-acting elements, and conserved motifs analysis, indicating functional divergence in the MATE family. Subsequently, RNA-seq analysis and real-time qRT-PCR were conducted during Chinese pear fruit development. Moreover, PbMATE genes were significantly expressed under hormonal treatments of MeJA (methyl jasmonate), SA (salicylic acid), and ABA (abscisic acid). Overall, our results provide helpful insights into the functions, expansion complexity, and evolutions of the MATE genes in Chinese pear and five Rosaceae species.

AB Homophily by morphological and behavioral traits has been described in several species of vertebrates, but its functional consequences remain poorly studied. Homophily by plurally breeding females may improve direct fitness by enhancing reproductive success. Female mammals may exhibit phenotypical masculinization due to exposure to androgens during early development, a condition that is associated with maternal performance during subsequent breeding. Our goal was to assess whether female composition (in terms of masculinization) of plurally breeding groups influences female fitness in a natural population of degus (Octodon degus). We assessed if plurally breeding female degus assort themselves by anogenital distance (AGD), an accurate measure of masculinization level. We also quantified if homophily by AGD phenotype affects female reproductive success and the reproductive output of the group. Plurally breeding groups typically included similarly masculinized (i.e., long AGD) females or similarly feminized (short AGD) females, indicating a strong degree of homophily. Females weaned more offspring in plurally breeding groups with more masculinized females. Additionally, standardized variance in the number of offspring weaned decreased in plurally breeding groups with mostly masculinized females, indicating greater reproductive equality in these groups. We conclude that female degus organize into homophilic social groups of similar AGD, and that social groups of masculinized females exhibit a higher reproductive success.

AB Currently, some species of Sapindaceae are important fruit crops worldwide. The Huaya India (Meliccocus oliviformis, Sapindaceae) is a neglected Neotropical fruit tree consumed locally in the Maya Lowlands of Mexico, where it exists in both wild and domesticated forms. Our objective was to evaluate the genetic diversity of the Huaya India in its possible domestication area and thus generate knowledge that serves as the basis for a commercial management. A total of 450 individuals collected from 15 natural vegetation sites and 15 Maya villages, were characterized using nine microsatellite loci and population genetics approaches were applied. STRUCTURE, Neighbor-Joining and PCoA analyses suggested the existence of three main groups: 1) one composed by 14 natural vegetation sites, 2) one integrated by 10 Maya villages plus one natural vegetation site, 3) one composed by five Maya villages. At the species level, genetic differentiation was high (F-ST = 0.562) and gene flow was low (Nm = 0.395); between genetic groups, differentiation was low and gene flow was high. Genetic diversity was low at the level species (H-E = 0.19) and higher in the group composed for only natural vegetation sites. When we considered only two groups (natural vegetation sites vs Maya villages) to explore a possible bottleneck as a consequence of human management, the natural vegetation sites showed higher, and significant, genetic diversity (H-E = 0.231) than the Maya villages (H-E = 0.152). This study can serve as a basis to develop management strategies for Huaya India in the Maya Lowlands of Mexico, but without compromising its conservation.

AB Soil carbon is the major active pool of terrestrial carbon, and as such, soil organic carbon (SOC) targets, policies and measures will be pivotal to achieving global climate targets. SOC sequestration may reduce the net annual greenhouse gas emissions from Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use by between 3% and 71%, while simultaneously supporting various ecosystem services. Accurate SOC accounting and monitoring, however, is constrained by various technical challenges related to indicators, rates of SOC change, measuring the impact of management practices on SOC, and the long-term persistence of sequestered SOC. We assessed countries' pledges to the Paris Agreement for SOC in agriculture to better understand the level, transparency, and specificity of commitments. Reviewing 184 countries' initial Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), we considered whether SOC was included, what was pledged, the level of ambition promised and the specificity of mitigation targets. Twenty-eight countries referred to SOC in their NDCs, citing quantified or unquantified mitigation targets, national policies or programs, and actions and measures to be implemented in agricultural lands (14), peatlands (6) or wetlands (14). Countries' reasons for not including SOC in NDCs included the need to prioritize goals of sustainable development and food security above climate mitigation, a lack of incentives for farmers to improve management practices, and the difficulty of accurately monitoring changes in SOC. Including SOC targets in NDCs can improve NDCs' comprehensiveness and transparency to track and compare policy progress across NDCs; it can also leverage SOC-related climate finance, technical support, and capacity building. Key policy insights Many NDCs specify practices known to have the potential to achieve SOC sequestration or protection without explicitly mentioning SOC. The SOC-related mitigation potential of these practices can be quantified in future NDCs. NDCs are not presently a good indicator of countries' interest or commitment to SOC action at national level. To improve this, countries with existing SOC policies, programs, and actions can specify their SOC-related commitments in future NDCs. Increased collaboration between countries with experience managing SOC and countries needing support to develop SOC-related targets, policies, measures and incentives for land users and farmers would facilitate the provision of such needed support. To increase country commitments and attention to managing SOC, there is a need for improved SOC measurement and monitoring, for better evidence on the impacts of management practices on SOC, and for incentives for farmers to change practices and overcome barriers.

TI beta diversity among ant communities on fragmented habitat islands: the

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce biodiversity and alter species composition in local communities. beta diversity describes the variation in species composition between or among communities in fragmented landscapes and has two components: species turnover and nestedness. In this study, we assessed beta diversity of ant assemblages on 24 island fragments in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We constructed a species-level phylogenetic tree and measured five morphological traits of all ant species captured. We then assessed taxonomic (both incidence-based and abundance-weighted), functional and phylogenetic beta diversity and partitioned beta diversity into turnover and nestedness (as well as the contributions of particular species and particular islands). Finally, we examined the relationships between beta diversity and a suite of geographical variables (i.e. difference in island area, difference in isolation and inter-island distance) using Mantel tests. We found taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover components dominated overall beta diversity whereas the functional turnover and nestedness components contributed equally to overall beta diversity. Overall beta diversity increased with increasing difference in isolation and inter-island distance; however, only abundance-weighted overall beta diversity decreased with increasing difference in island size. Our results indicate that species that were abundant on large islands were also abundant on small islands. We conclude that the dispersal limitation of ants likely shapes the pattern of beta diversity along isolation and inter-island distance gradients. Additionally, functional redundancy of species (i.e. different species share similar functional roles) could also explain beta diversity patterns among fragmented habitat islands. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating both incidence-based and abundance-weighted community data when examining beta diversity in fragmented landscapes. By partitioning beta diversity into the contributions of particular species and particular fragments, our study implies that small patches can be valuable for maintaining biodiversity among ant communities.

AB Determining the genetic diversity and differentiation among populations is a critical element of conservation biology, but for many aquatic, data-deficient species with small population sizes, this is not possible. Closely related species may therefore provide a model. For the first time, using over 4000 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci, we characterise the population genetic diversity and structure of one of the world's rarest marine fish, the spotted handfish (Brachionichthys hirsutus), a species which is also a member of the most threatened marine bony fish family (Brachionichthyidae). Fin clips were taken from 170 live spotted handfish across seven disjunct sites within the only known estuary (in Tasmania, Australia) where multiple populations of the species are found. Spatially discrete populations clustered into three genetic groupings and a significant variance in allele frequencies among populations (overall F-ST = 0.043), even at the small scale of the estuary, was observed. Furthermore, low contemporary migration rate estimates suggest low genetic homogeneity between locations. Because of the low genetic connectivity, population clusters of spotted handfish within the estuary should be considered as separate conservation management units. This insight should be considered for management and conservation strategies of other data-deficient and threatened species in the family.

AB Deep-sea hydrothermal vent habitats are small, rare and support unique species through chemosynthesis. As this vulnerable ecosystem is increasingly threatened by human activities, management approaches should address biodiversity conservation. Diversity distribution data provide a useful basis for management approaches as patterns of beta -diversity (the change in diversity from site to site) can guide conservation decisions. Our question is whether such patterns are similar enough across vent systems to support a conservation strategy that can be deployed regardless of location. We compile macrofaunal species occurrence data for vent systems in three geological settings in the North Pacific: volcanic arc, back-arc and mid-ocean ridge. Recent discoveries in the Mariana region provide the opportunity to characterize diversity at many vent sites. We examine the extent to which diversity distribution patterns differ among the systems by comparing pairwise beta -diversity, nestedness and their additive components. A null model approach that tests whether species compositions of each site pair are more or less similar than random provides insight into community assembly processes. We resolve several taxonomic uncertainties and find that the Mariana arc and back-arc share only 8% of species despite their proximity. Species overlap, species replacement and richness differences create different diversity distributions within the three vent systems; the arc system exhibits much greater beta -diversity than both the back-arc and mid-ocean ridge systems which, instead, show greater nestedness. The influence of nestedness on beta -diversity also increased from the arc to back-arc to ridge. Community assembly processes appear more deterministic in the arc and ridge systems while back-arc site pairs deviate little from the null expectation. These analyses reflect the need for a variety of management strategies that consider the character of diversity distribution to protect hydrothermal vents, especially in the context of mining hydrothermal deposits.

AB The transition of housing gestating sows from individual stalls to group pens allows for a greater freedom of movement and social interactions, but it comes with many challenges to ensure group cohesion and safety of all animals. Previous research on the behavior and welfare of group housed sows has predominately focused on aggression at mixing, feeding systems, and flooring type, with little information on association patterns within the pen. In order to examine the complex direct and indirect relationships among group housed sows, this study recorded dyadic associations (defined as resting in proximity, <1.5 m) among a subset of multiparous sows (n = 129) housed in the same dynamic group pen. Stochastic simulations were used to compare the association patterns observed to random permutations of association patterns given the pen logistics. For this study pen, 13.4 % of the dyads had significantly higher associations than we would expect under the null model of completely random lying patterns, while 43 % of dyads were never recorded to rest in proximity. Distinct subpopulations demonstrating clear preferences for different subareas of the gestation pen were also found. Younger sows demonstrated association preferences above and beyond what would be expected if there were only a mutual preference for a general area of the pen. The older sows, on the other hand, seldom formed strong associations, and their distribution within the pen appears to be driven by preferences for specific lying areas rather than for resting partners. Beyond this age dynamic, our results also indicated that sows that rested most often on the slatted floors, tended to be younger, smaller, had more severe lesions and had higher feed rank scores (i.e., ate last in the day) - all indicators of lower social rank - relative to the sows which were consistently recorded in the sow cubicles (i.e., concrete lying areas). While the results of this observational study have shed some light on the factors which influence positive-to-neutral social interactions amongst sows in group housed pens, we hope that they will ultimately serve as a jumping-off point for future experimental work capable of producing more comprehensive and conclusive insights into these important social dynamics.

   EMISSIONS
AB We synthesized 20 years of research to explain the interrelated processes that determine soil and plant responses to biochar. The properties of biochar and its effects within agricultural ecosystems largely depend on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions. We describe three stages of reactions of biochar in soil: dissolution (1-3 weeks); reactive surface development (1-6 months); and aging (beyond 6 months). As biochar ages, it is incorporated into soil aggregates, protecting the biochar carbon and promoting the stabilization of rhizodeposits and microbial products. Biochar carbon persists in soil for hundreds to thousands of years. By increasing pH, porosity, and water availability, biochars can create favorable conditions for root development and microbial functions. Biochars can catalyze biotic and abiotic reactions, particularly in the rhizosphere, that increase nutrient supply and uptake by plants, reduce phytotoxins, stimulate plant development, and increase resilience to disease and environmental stressors. Meta-analyses found that, on average, biochars increase P availability by a factor of 4.6; decrease plant tissue concentration of heavy metals by 17%-39%; build soil organic carbon through negative priming by 3.8% (range -21% to +20%); and reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from soil by 12%-50%. Meta-analyses show average crop yield increases of 10%-42% with biochar addition, with greatest increases in low-nutrient P-sorbing acidic soils (common in the tropics), and in sandy soils in drylands due to increase in nutrient retention and water holding capacity. Studies report a wide range of plant responses to biochars due to the diversity of biochars and contexts in which biochars have been applied. Crop yields increase strongly if site-specific soil constraints and nutrient and water limitations are mitigated by appropriate biochar formulations. Biochars can be tailored to address site constraints through feedstock selection, by modifying pyrolysis conditions, through pre- or post-production treatments, or co-application with organic or mineral fertilizers. We demonstrate how, when used wisely, biochar mitigates climate change and supports food security and the circular economy.

AB Climate-driven changes in phenology have widespread effects on ecological interactions and species' abundances. Most predictions of changes in phenology and the consequences for ecology and conservation are based on research in temperate systems. Climate-driven changes in phenology are largely undocumented in subtropical regions, which host much of the world's biodiversity. Factors important to regulating phenology in temperate systems (e.g. winter chilling requirements) are likely weak or absent in subtropical ecosystems; plant phenology in these regions could respond to climate differently than in the temperate zone. Here we examine flowering phenology data for 105 plant species based on herbarium specimens and photographs from 1911 to 2015 in the southern subtropical Nanling region in south China. Temperatures in this region warmed 0.3 degrees C over the 105-year study period, and most plant species flowered earlier over time, although species varied substantially in the magnitude of phenological response to warming temperatures. Spring flowering times advanced in response to warming temperatures in late summer and early autumn and in early spring, with late summer and early autumn temperatures having almost twice as strong an effect on spring flowering times as early spring temperatures (-4.7 versus -2.5 days degrees C-1). This strong effect of late summer and early autumn temperatures is very different from temperate systems and has substantial implications for anticipating future changes in phenology. The temperatures in late summer and early autumn may affect spring phenology by accelerating bud formation or initial growth. Warming January temperature delayed summer flowering and advanced winter flowering. Increases in precipitation during April to June also tended to delay summer flowering. Autumn flowering species showed inconsistent responses to warming. These results highlight important differences between climate-driven changes in phenology in temperate and subtropical areas. Understanding these differences will be important in understanding the effects of climate change on vegetation phenology and ecosystem processes.

AB Few studies that apply the theory of island biogeography have considered the functional and phylogenetic dimensions of diversity. However, the joint use of the three diversity dimensions, i.e. taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic, can help us to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we compare phyllostomid bat assemblages between five land-bridge islands off the south-east coast of Brazil and compare these islands with three sites on the mainland. For this, we have estimated the three dimensions of alpha- and beta-diversity, nestedness and community indexes based on mean trait values for the islands and the mainland. The mainland showed higher species richness and taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity. In addition, only species richness and phylogenetic diversity were positively related to island area. Taxonomically and functionally, the poorest assemblages (minor islands) were subgroups of the richer assemblages (mainland and larger islands). Taken together, our results show that bat assemblages of smaller islands tend to be more sensitive to changes in species richness than those of larger islands, with the larger islands working as a 'source' of species for small islands. These results demonstrate the high conservation value of the larger islands, which has direct consequences for local population dynamics of phyllostomid bats.

AB The impact of storms on coastal dunes and beaches and the effects they induce in topography and plant communities are natural processes that contribute to maintaining natural coastal dynamics. However, because coasts are often densely populated, these phenomena are perceived as major threats to human property. To protect human assets sustainably, nature-based defenses have emerged as an option. Coastal dunes act as natural buffers that mitigate the extent of erosion and inland flooding, and their resistance depends on the biogeomorphological feedback between the plants and the dunes. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of one winter storm on beach and dune topography and the plant communities, and to explore the effect of plants in mitigating erosion on beaches with different geomorphological features. The effects on plant communities were evaluated by comparing diversity and plant cover before and after the storm. Later, the role of plants in conferring dune resistance against erosion was examined by measuring erosion on the exposed face of the dunes considering plant cover and plant richness. The results did not show significant differences in plant diversity and plant cover between pre-and post-storm conditions, but turnover of species was recorded. The dune building species were not affected but inland species disappeared. Erosion was reduced when the dunes were higher and, furthermore, plant cover was negatively correlated with erosion on these dunes. The results showed a reduced impact of the storm on the plant communities, which is important as it facilitates the recovery of dunes by the dune-building species and protects them in a subsequent storm. The novelty of this study is that: (a) it demonstrates the species-specific role of plants in mitigating dune erosion in field conditions; (b) it shows the interaction between plant-related features and geomorphological variables in promoting dune resistance to erosion, and (c) it explores the immediate effect of a winter storm on the plant community and dune-building species.

AB Changes in climate and land use are major drivers of biodiversity loss. These drivers likely interact and their mutual effects alter biodiversity. These interaction mechanisms are rarely considered in biodiversity assessments, as only the combined individual effects are reported. In this study, we explored interaction effects from mechanisms that potentially affect biodiversity under climate change. These mechanisms entail that climate-change effects on, for example, species abundance and species' range shifts depend on land-use change. Similarly, land-use change impacts are contingent on climate change. We explored interaction effects from four mechanisms and projected their consequences on biodiversity. These interactions arise if species adapted to modified landscapes (e.g. cropland) differ in their sensitivity to climate change from species adapted to natural landscapes. We verified these interaction effects by performing a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of 42 bioclimatic studies (with different increases in global mean temperature) on species distributions in landscapes with varying cropland levels. We used the Fraction of Remaining Species as the effect-size metric in this meta-analysis. The influence of global mean temperature increase on FRS did not significantly change with different cropland levels. This finding excluded interaction effects between climate and landscapes that are modified by other land uses than cropping. Although we only assessed coarse climate and land-use patterns, global mean temperature increase was a good, significant model predictor for biodiversity decline. This emphasizes the need to analyse interactions between land-use and climate-change effects on biodiversity simultaneously in other modified landscapes. Such analyses should also integrate other conditions, such as spatial location, adaptive capacity and time lags. Understanding all these interaction mechanisms and other conditions will help to better project future biodiversity trends and to develop coping strategies for biodiversity conservation.

AB Multiple mating by females can dramatically alter selection on males by creating indirect interactions between rivals via sperm competition. Exactly how this behavior alters the relationship between male mating and fertilization success depends on multiple factors: re-mating frequency, sperm usage patterns, and mating assortment (the extent to which the most promiscuous individuals mate with each other). Here, we explore the role these elements play in determining sexual selection in a highly polygyandrous species, the squash bug Anasa tristis. Using replicated semi-natural enclosures, in which individuals were able to freely interact for a 2-week period, we tracked matings between individuals and subsequent female offspring production. Multiple mating was extremely common, resulting in very high levels of sperm competition intensity. However, network analysis revealed that the most promiscuous males mated with less polyandrous females, and therefore experienced lower levels of sperm competition. As a result, estimated male reproductive success increased with mating success, but this relationship varied according to the mode of sperm utilization with which it was calculated. Furthermore, females with more mating partners produced more offspring, suggesting they also benefit from mating multiply. Our findings highlight that polyandry has numerous and complex effects on sexual selection which may only be exposed when examined under naturalistic conditions.

AB Premise The genetic structure of hybrid zones provides insight into the potential for gene flow to occur between plant taxa. Four closely related European orchid species (Orchis anthropophora, O. militaris, O. purpurea, and O. simia) hybridize when they co-occur. We aimed to characterize patterns of hybridization in O. militaris-O. purpurea, O. purpurea-O. simia, and O. anthropophora-O. simia hybrid zones using molecular and morphological data. Methods We used 11 newly isolated nuclear microsatellites to genotype 695 individuals collected from seven hybrid zones and six allopatric parental populations in France. Geometric morphometric analysis was conducted using 15 labellum landmarks to capture the main aspects of petal shape. Results Backcrossing was asymmetric toward O. militaris in multiple O. militaris-O. purpurea hybrid zones. Hybrids in O. purpurea-O. simia and O. anthropophora-O. simia hybrid zones were largely limited to F1 and F2 generations, but further admixture had occurred. These patterns were reflected in labellum geometric morphometric data, which correlated strongly with nuclear microsatellite data in all three species combinations. Conclusions The coexistence of parental and admixed individuals in these Orchis hybrid zones implies they are likely to be tension zones being maintained by a balance between gene flow into the hybrid zone and selection acting against admixed individuals. The pattern of admixture in the three species combinations suggests intrinsic selection acting on the hybrids is weaker in more closely related taxa.

AB Background Genome-wide data are invaluable to characterize differentiation and adaptation of natural populations. Reduced representation sequencing (RRS) subsamples a genome repeatedly across many individuals. However, RRS requires careful optimization and fine-tuning to deliver high marker density while being cost-efficient. The number of genomic fragments created through restriction enzyme digestion and the sequencing library setup must match to achieve sufficient sequencing coverage per locus. Here, we present a workflow based on published information and computational and experimental procedures to investigate and streamline the applicability of RRS. Results In an iterative process genome size estimates, restriction enzymes and size selection windows were tested and scaled in six classes of Antarctic animals (Ostracoda, Malacostraca, Bivalvia, Asteroidea, Actinopterygii, Aves). Achieving high marker density would be expensive in amphipods, the malacostracan target taxon, due to the large genome size. We propose alternative approaches such as mitogenome or target capture sequencing for this group. Pilot libraries were sequenced for all other target taxa. Ostracods, bivalves, sea stars, and fish showed overall good coverage and marker numbers for downstream population genomic analyses. In contrast, the bird test library produced low coverage and few polymorphic loci, likely due to degraded DNA. Conclusions Prior testing and optimization are important to identify which groups are amenable for RRS and where alternative methods may currently offer better cost-benefit ratios. The steps outlined here are easy to follow for other non-model taxa with little genomic resources, thus stimulating efficient resource use for the many pressing research questions in molecular ecology.

AB Context Exploratory modeling in forestry uses a variety of approaches to simulate forest management. One important assumption that every approach makes is about the deep uncertainty-the lack of the knowledge required for making an informed decision-that future forest management will face. This assumption can strongly influence simulation results and their interpretation but is rarely studied. Objectives Our objective was to explore how differences in modeling approaches influence the deep uncertainty faced in simulated forest management. Methods We used SOSIEL Harvest, a new agent-based extension to a landscape-change model, LANDIS-II, to simulate three approaches to modeling forest management. For each, we used the same forest and management data from Michigan, US, which isolated the differences among approaches as the only variable factor. We then used a new method, also introduced here, to measure and compare the deep uncertainty faced during simulated management. Finally, we used a typology of sources of uncertainty to categorize the sources responsible for this deep uncertainty. Results The simulated forest management in the three modeling approaches faced substantially different degrees of deep uncertainty, which translated into considerable differences in simulation results. There was an overall negative relationship between deep uncertainty and the ability of the management to respond to forest change and adapt decisions accordingly. Conclusions While inherent deep uncertainty faced in simulated forest management can be substantial, it is overestimated by exploratory models that underestimate management's ability to respond to forest change. Reducing such model-related uncertainty will allow for more realistic results from exploratory studies of forest management.

AB Variation in genetic diversity across species ranges has long been recognized as highly informative for assessing populations' resilience and adaptive potential. The spatial distribution of genetic diversity within populations, referred to as fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS), also carries information about recent demographic changes, yet it has rarely been connected to range scale processes. We studied eight silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) population pairs (sites), growing at high and low elevations, representative of the main genetic lineages of the species. A total of 1,368 adult trees and 540 seedlings were genotyped using 137 and 116 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), respectively. Sites revealed a clear east-west isolation-by-distance pattern consistent with the post-glacial colonization history of the species. Genetic differentiation among sites (F-CT = 0.148) was an order of magnitude greater than between elevations within sites (F-SC = 0.031), nevertheless high elevation populations consistently exhibited a stronger FSGS. Structural equation modelling revealed that elevation and, to a lesser extent, post-glacial colonization history, but not climatic and habitat variables, were the best predictors of FSGS across populations. These results suggest that high elevation habitats have been colonized more recently across the species range. Additionally, paternity analysis revealed a high reproductive skew among adults and a stronger FSGS in seedlings than in adults, suggesting that FSGS may conserve the signature of demographic changes for several generations. Our results emphasize that spatial patterns of genetic diversity within populations provide information about demographic history complementary to non-spatial statistics, and could be used for genetic diversity monitoring, especially in forest trees.

AB A key piece of information for ecosystem management is the relationship between the environment and population genetic structure. However, it is difficult to clearly quantify the effects of environmental factors on genetic differentiation because of spatial autocorrelation and analytical problems. In this study, we focused on stream ecosystems and the environmental heterogeneity caused by groundwater and constructed a sampling design in which geographic distance and environmental differences are not correlated. Using multiplexed ISSR genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq) method, a fine-scale population genetics study was conducted in fluvial sculpin Cottus nozawae, for which summer water temperature is the determinant factor in distribution and survival. There was a clear genetic structure in the watershed. Although a significant isolation-by-distance pattern was detected in the watershed, there was no association between genetic differentiation and water temperature. Instead, asymmetric gene flow from relatively low-temperature streams to high-temperature streams was detected, indicating the importance of low-temperature streams and continuous habitats. The groundwater-focused sampling strategy yielded insightful results for conservation.

AB Climate and land use/land cover (LULC) change are two major global change factors driving shifts in the location of suitable areas for many species. Here, we assessed if a low-vagility newt, Triturus marmoratus, can track displacement of suitable areas by 2100, and tested whether climate or LULC changes are primary drivers of the species' future distribution. We combined niche modelling with the process-based model simRShift to improve biological relevance and simulate species dispersal by 2100 under scenarios of climate and LULC changes at high spatial resolution. Our results show that T. marmoratus could lose a significant part of its current French range in the coming decades, and that the range loss will primarily be driven by climate change, with LULC change playing a secondary role. The species seems unlikely to be able to track the northern shift of its suitable habitat as rapidly as required given the rate of climate warming during the 21st century. This is due to insufficient dispersal ability, which is compounded by the magnitude of habitat fragmentation in the human-dominated landscape. We highlight the need to assess vulnerability and anticipate threats arising from global change even for species that are not currently considered endangered. We identified areas where the species is most likely to occur and be extinct in the future, which can serve as a guide for population monitoring. Our framework can support conservation strategy development by defining ecological corridors that would assist species to track their required habitats in the face of global change.

AB Biochar amendment has been proposed as a promising means to increase carbon (C) sequestration and simultaneously benefit plant productivity. However, quantifying the assimilation and dynamics of photosynthetic C in plant-soil systems under biochar addition remains elusive. This study established two experimental factors involving biochar addition and nitrogen (N) fertilization to quantitatively assess the effect of biochar on photosynthetic C fate in a rice plant-soil system. The rice plants and soil samples were collected and analyzed after 6-h pulse labeling with (CO2)-C-13 at the tillering, jointing, heading and ripening stages. Biochar did not affect the proportions of photoassimilated carbon-13 (C-13) allocations in plant-soil systems. Nevertheless, biochar enhanced the C-13 contents in the shoot, root, and soil pools, especially when combined with N fertilization, and biochar increased the cumulative assimilated C-13 contents in the shoot, root, and soil pools by 23%, 14% and 20%, respectively, throughout the whole growth stage. Moreover, biochar addition significantly enhanced the N use efficiency (NUE) by c. 23% at the heading and ripening stages. In summary, biochar increases the content of photoassimilated C in plant-soil systems by improving plant productivity via enhancing NUE, thus resulting in a higher soil C sequestration potential.

AB Although body size correction and inferential statistics have been used in morphological studies for many decades, their applications are far from being ubiquitous. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify the extent of taxonomic papers that performed body size correction and implemented a statistical hypothesis testing framework during the analysis of morphological data. Our results indicate that in most papers, neither of these analyses were performed but instead, cursory comparisons of descriptive statistics were presented. With the development of numerous freely available and powerful statistical programs such as R, we find it prudent to outline a standardized and statistically defensible framework to enhance the workflow of morphological analyses in taxonomic studies. This 5-step approach can be applied to meristic and mensural data across a wide range of taxonomic groups. We include an easy-to-use companion R script to facilitate the implementation of this workflow. Our proposed framework is not rooted in phylogenetic or evolutionary theory and hence, should not be used in place of explicit species delimitation techniques. Nevertheless, it can be incorporated into a more robust integrative taxonomic framework and is particularly useful for identifying diagnostic characters for species diagnoses.

AB ABSTR A C T Geometric morphometrics allows researchers to use the specific software to quantify and to visualize morpho-logical differences between taxa from insect wings. Our objective was to assess wing geometry to distinguish four Anopheles sibling species of the Maculipennis complex, An. maculipennis s. s., An. daciae sp. inq., An. atroparvus and An. melanoon, found in Northern Italy. We combined the geometric morphometric approach with different machine learning alghorithms: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and an ensemble model (EN). Centroid size was smaller in An. atroparvus than in An. maculipennis s. s. and An. daciae sp. inq. Principal component analysis (PCA) explained only 33% of the total variance and appeared not very useful to discriminate among species, and in particular between An. maculipennis s. s. and An. daciae sp. inq. The performance of four different machine learning alghorithms using procrustes coordinates of wing shape as predictors was evaluated. All models showed ROC-AUC and PRC-AUC values that were higher than the random classifier but the SVM algorithm maximized the most metrics on the test set. The SVM algorithm with radial basis function allowed the correct classification of 83% of An. maculipennis s. s. and 79% of An. daciae sp. inq. ROC-AUC analysis showed that three landmarks, 11, 16 and 15, were the most important procrustes coordinates in mean wing shape comparison between An. maculipennis s. s. and An. daciae sp. inq. The pattern in the three-dimensional space of the most important procrustes coordinates showed a clearer differentiation between the two species than the PCA. Our study demonstrated that machine learning algorithms could be a useful tool combined with the wing geometric morphometric approach.

AB The state of California could play an important role in emerging markets for biochar, due in part to the availability of low-value biomass resources and their potential for use in agriculture sector. In this study, we assess the scale of production and use, and comment on potential markets for biochar in California. We explore various sectors for the application of biochar produced from local biomass using surveys and a market-sizing approach. A market-oriented approach for biochar innovation and the ecosystem around a biochar producer is also discussed. Next, we identify barriers to biochar market success in the present and the near future based on a survey of local producers. Among the barriers analyzed, access to capital investment for scale-up is the biggest barrier experienced by a majority of producers, followed by market and demand. When grouped under different categories, the extent of barriers decreased in the order: market > scale-up > technical > socio-political > environmental. Most producers anticipate that revenues from carbon offset credits would help them scale up their facilities and expand the biochar market. In the near future, soil-based applications of biochar could be the most likely market for biochar, followed by filtration, livestock feed, and manure management. As the industry evolves, rewarding carbon credits, increasing awareness and improving production processes are expected to help commercialize biochar. Finally, we offer recommendations to promote the growth of biochar in California. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB In cross-country ski skating, both the G2 and G4 sub-techniques involve one pole push for every second ski push but are used at largely different speed-slope ranges. The aim of this study was to compare temporal and kinematic patterns between G2 and G4 at both identical and different speed-slope conditions. A mixed model was used to analyse spatio-temporal parameters, while a combination of dynamic time warping and statistical parametric mapping was used to compare time traces. Main spatio-temporal parameters, such as cycle time, ski contact time and swing time, differed between G2 and G4 (all p < 0.01). Moreover, two forward and more pronounced acceleration phases of the centre of mass (CoM) were visible in G4 while only one acceleration phase was present in G2. The more continuous propulsion in G2 allows for maintaining a more constant speed at steep slopes and low speeds where this sub-technique is preferred. In contrast, the achievement of high speeds while skiing on flatter terrain seem to require more dynamic motion with shorter, more explosive propulsion periods allowed for in G4. In conclusion, G2 and G4 are two unique movements as characterised by fundamentally different CoM motion and should be denoted as two different sub-techniques.

AB Different stomatal behaviors among species under drought conditions may affect species-specific seasonal variations in photosynthesis and water use efficiency (WUE), and could enable species to follow differing growth strategies. Here we monitored leaf gas exchange, intra-annual radial growth, leaf stoichiometry, and microclimate of three conifers with contrasting stomatal behaviors (isohydric Picea wilsonii and Pinus tabuliformis vs. anisohydric Juniperus przewalskii) over three growing seasons, and collected tree-ring records of the monitored species, on the cold and arid northeastern Tibet Plateau. We used these data to assess the species-specific seasonal variations in net photosynthetic rate (A(n)), transpiration efficiency (TE) and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi), and their impacts on growth.
   Our observations show that the A(n) of all three conifers was greatest in autumn. This peak was closely related to increasing stomatal conductance following alleviation of drought stress, rather than to variations in leaf nitrogen concentrations. WUEi of the three conifers did not exhibit a regular seasonal pattern, but TE was significantly lower in summer than in spring and autumn, due to the regulation by vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Increasing summer VPD reduced TE mainly by increasing transpiration rate for J. przewalskii and by decreasing A(n) for the isohydric conifers.
   The increases of A(n) from summer to autumn were much greater for the two isohydric Pinaceae plants than for J. przewalskii. This was consistent with the growth-climate relationships, in which the autumn drought in the previous year limited radial growth of the isohydric conifers more strongly than in the anisohydric conifer. Therefore, we suggest that the growth of isohydric species may profit more from the photosynthates accumulated during the previous post-growing season in the cold and arid Tibetan Plateau.

AB Over the past 20 years, the introduction of new molecular techniques has given a new impetus to genetic and genomic studies of fishes. The main traits selected in the aquaculture sector conform to the polygenic model, and, thus far, effective breeding programmes based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and marker-assisted selection (MAS) have been applied to simple traits (e.g. disease resistance and sexual maturation of salmonids) and known Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs). Genomic selection uses the genomic relationships between candidate loci and SNPs distributed over the entire genome and in tight linkage disequilibrium (LD) with genes that encode the traits. SNP (low and high density) arrays are used for genotyping thousands of genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs). The genomic expected breeding value (GEBV) of selection candidates is usually calculated by means of the GBLUP or ssGBLUP (single step) methods. In recent years, in several aquaculture breeding programmes, the genomic selection method has been applied to different fish and crustacean species. While routine implementation of genomic selection is now largely carried out in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), it is expected that, in the near future, this method will progressively spread to other fish species. However, genomic selection is an expensive method, so it will be relevant mostly for traits of high economic value. In several studies (using different salmonid species), the accuracy of the GEBVs varied from 0.10 to 0.80 for different traits (e.g. growth rate and disease resistance) compared to traditional breeding methods based on geneology. Genomic selection applied to aquaculture species has the potential to improve selection programmes substantially and to change ongoing fish breeding systems. In the long term, the ability to use low-pass genome sequencing methods, low-cost genotyping and novel phenotyping techniques will allow genomic selection to be applied to thousands of animals directly at the farm level.

AB Aim Availability of uniformly collected presence, absence, and abundance data remains a key challenge in species distribution modeling (SDM). For invasive species, abundance and impacts are highly variable across landscapes, and quality occurrence and abundance data are critical for predicting locations at high risk for invasion and impacts, respectively. We leverage a large aquatic vegetation dataset comprising point-level survey data that includes information on the invasive plant Myriophyllum spicatum (Eurasian watermilfoil) to: (a) develop SDMs to predict invasion and impact from environmental variables based on presence-absence, presence-only, and abundance data, and (b) compare evaluation metrics based on functional and discrimination accuracy for presence-absence and presence-only SDMs. Location Minnesota, USA. Methods Eurasian watermilfoil presence-absence and abundance information were gathered from 468 surveyed lakes, and 801 unsurveyed lakes were leveraged as pseudoabsences for presence-only models. A Random Forest algorithm was used to model the distribution and abundance of Eurasian watermilfoil as a function of lake-specific predictors, both with and without a spatial autocovariate. Occurrence-based SDMs were evaluated using conventional discrimination accuracy metrics and functional accuracy metrics assessing correlation between predicted suitability and observed abundance. Results Water temperature degree days and maximum lake depth were two leading predictors influencing both invasion risk and abundance, but they were relatively less important for predicting abundance than other water quality measures. Road density was a strong predictor of Eurasian watermilfoil invasion risk but not abundance. Model evaluations highlighted significant differences: Presence-absence models had high functional accuracy despite low discrimination accuracy, whereas presence-only models showed the opposite pattern. Main conclusion Complementing presence-absence data with abundance information offers a richer understanding of invasive Eurasian watermilfoil's ecological niche and enables evaluation of the model's functional accuracy. Conventional discrimination accuracy measures were misleading when models were developed using pseudoabsences. We thus caution against the overuse of presence-only models and suggest directing more effort toward systematic monitoring programs that yield high-quality data.

AB Studying beta-diversity patterns of biological communities and how species are organized in space is central to understanding the processes that maintain species diversity. Furthermore, knowledge on beta-diversity patterns is key for the protection and conservation planning of regional diversity. Insects represent the terrestrial animal group with the largest global biomass and a great body of information about spatial diversity patterns of megadiverse orders such as hymenopterans, lepidopterans, and coleopterans is available. However, studies dedicated to understanding these patterns in dipterans are scarce. Here, we aim to characterize the spatial variation of the assemblage of phytosaprophytic flies in the Amazon forest by investigating its distribution across hierarchies of spatial scales and the effect of geographical distance. The study site is located in the Direct Influence Area of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam, Para state, Brazil. Sampling followed the Rapid Assessments for Long Term Ecological Research experimental design. Fly assemblages were not uniform across most of the spatial scales investigated. The larger scale (from 10 to 100 km) contributed more to the gamma diversity of the region than the smaller ones (approximately 1 km). The beta diversity with a Shannon index of over 60 % of gamma taxonomic diversity was influenced by the diversity within transects (alpha-diversity). Pairwise dissimilarity showed no significant relationship between geographical distance and Sorensen dissimilarity, turnover, nestedness, balanced variation in species abundances, or abundance gradient components. The absence of stochastic processes in the formation of the assemblages of phytosaprophytic flies indicates that environmental filters are more important to its structuring than neutral processes. Thus, studies on larger scales can provide more robust evidence on the assemblages distribution, both in preserved and highly impacted environments. Our study considered this wide-scale and our finding revealed some patterns in the assembly rules of the flies community Amazon.

AB The critically endangered Brazilian Merganser Mergus octosetaceus is one of the rarest waterfowls in the world. Only three isolated populations remain in the Brazilian Cerrado, totaling less than 250 individuals. We evaluated the potential influence of small hydroelectric plants (SHPs) and Protected Areas (PAs) on the species' conservation. We identified suitable areas by using recent presence records and environmental predictors, and overlapped it with the species dispersion zone and the SHP impact zone. Suitable areas for the species are limited to 4% of the geographic space (142,899 km2). Within the dispersion zone, we found 36 planned SHPs, which can impact 4.1% of the suitable area and 17.2% of the suitable area inside PAs. Our results expose the critical situation of the Brazilian Merganser, with few isolated suitable areas, high potential impacts for the three known populations, and a high proportion of suitable areas out of PAs. We highlight the need of considering SHPs impacts on the Brazilian Merganser in environmental impact assessment studies to reduce them. Furthermore, we appointed areas for search of new populations, and emphasize how urgent the implementation of effective conservation actions aiming to protect the remaining suitable habitats for the Brazilian Merganser is.

AB Aim: Understanding how biotic communities are spatially distributed is essential for biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes. The large-scale subsidence wetlands generated by underground coal mining in China have been increasingly used by large numbers of waterbirds, which remain understudied. We aimed to explore the role of non-random assembly in shaping the regional waterbird diversity in nonbreeding seasons, providing insights for the conservation.
   Location: The North China Plain.
   Methods: Taxonomic beta-diversity and functional beta-diversity (both multiple-site and pairwise) of the waterbird communities were quantified and decomposed into turnover (i.e. species replacement) and nestedness components (i.e. the poorer sites being subsets of the richer sites). Observed functional alpha-diversity and pairwise beta-diversity, as well as the two components, were compared with simulated means under random assembly processes in null models, which maintained the species richness, pairwise taxonomic dissimilarity, and its turnover and nestedness components as the observed.
   Results: The communities exhibited similar multiple-site taxonomic and functional beta-diversity, which were primarily contributed by taxonomic and functional turnover, respectively. The pairwise functional beta-diversity, as well as its turnover and nestedness components, was positively correlated with their taxonomic counterparts. The pairwise functional beta-diversity was higher than the taxonomic beta-diversity, with the former mainly reflecting nestedness of functional strategies and the latter reflecting species replacement. The observed functional alpha-diversities in most communities were lower, and most of the observed pairwise functional beta-diversities were higher than the simulated means in null models.
   Main conclusions: The above patterns suggest the existence of non-random assembly of the waterbird communities across the subsidence wetlands. To protect waterbirds in the subsidence wetlands, we suggest that most wetlands should be protected via increasing habitat diversity. Furthermore, considering the changing environmental conditions, changes in the multiple biodiversity metrics should be monitored to inform the ongoing management plans. conditions, changes in the multiple biodiversity metrics should be monitored to inform the ongoing management plans.

AB Inequality between private and public patients in Australia has been an ongoing concern due to its two tiered insurance system. This article investigates the variations in hospital length of stay for hip replacements using the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset from 2003/2004 to 2014/2015, employing a Bayesian hierarchical random coefficients model with trend. We find systematic differences in the length of stay between public and private hospitals, after observable patient complexity is controlled. This suggests shorter stays in public hospitals due to pressure from the Activity-based funding scheme, and longer stays in private system due to potential moral hazard. Our counterfactual analysis shows that public patients stay 1.8 days shorter than private patients in 2014, which leads to the "quicker but sicker" concern that is commonly voiced by the public. We also identify widespread variations among individual hospitals. Sources for such variation warrant closer investigation by policy makers.

AB Telomeres form the ends of linear chromosomes and usually comprise protein complexes that bind to simple repeated sequence motifs that are added to the 3 ' ends of DNA by the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). One of the primary functions attributed to telomeres is to solve the "end-replication problem" which, if left unaddressed, would cause gradual, inexorable attrition of sequences from the chromosome ends and, eventually, loss of viability. Telomere-binding proteins also protect the chromosome from 5 ' to 3 ' exonuclease action, and disguise the chromosome ends from the double-strand break repair machinery whose illegitimate action potentially generates catastrophic chromosome aberrations. Telomeres are of special interest in the blast fungus, Pyricularia, because the adjacent regions are enriched in genes controlling interactions with host plants, and the chromosome ends show enhanced polymorphism and genetic instability. Previously, we showed that telomere instability in some P. oryzae strains is caused by novel retrotransposons (MoTeRs) that insert in telomere repeats, generating interstitial telomere sequences that drive frequent, break-induced rearrangements. Here, we sought to gain further insight on telomeric involvement in shaping Pyricularia genome architecture by characterizing sequence polymorphisms at chromosome ends, and surrounding internalized MoTeR loci (relics) and interstitial telomere repeats. This provided evidence that telomere dynamics have played historical, and likely ongoing, roles in shaping the Pyricularia genome. We further demonstrate that even telomeres lacking MoTeR insertions are poorly preserved, such that the telomere-adjacent sequences exhibit frequent presence/absence polymorphism, as well as exchanges with the genome interior. Using TERT knockout experiments, we characterized chromosomal responses to failed telomere maintenance which suggested that much of the MoTeR relic-/interstitial telomere-associated polymorphism could be driven by compromised telomere function. Finally, we describe three possible examples of a phenomenon known as "Adaptive Telomere Failure," where spontaneous losses of telomere maintenance drive rapid accumulation of sequence polymorphism with possible adaptive advantages. Together, our data suggest that telomere maintenance is frequently compromised in Pyricularia but the chromosome alterations resulting from telomere failure are not as catastrophic as prior research would predict, and may, in fact, be potent drivers of adaptive polymorphism.

AB Changes in the functional structures of communities are rarely examined along multiple large-scale environmental gradients. Here, we describe patterns in functional beta diversity for New Zealand marine fishes versus depth and latitude, including broad-scale delineation of functional bioregions. We derived eight functional traits related to food acquisition and locomotion and calculated complementary indices of functional beta diversity for 144 species of marine ray-finned fishes occurring along large-scale depth (50-1200 m) and latitudinal gradients (29 degrees-51 degrees S) in the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone. We focused on a suite of morphological traits calculated directly from in situ Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video (stereo-BRUV) footage and museum specimens. We found that functional changes were primarily structured by depth followed by latitude, and that latitudinal functional turnover decreased with increasing depth. Functional turnover among cells increased with increasing depth distance, but this relationship plateaued for greater depth distances (>750 m). In contrast, functional turnover did not change significantly with increasing latitudinal distance at 700-1200 m depths. Shallow functional bioregions (50-100 m) were distinct at different latitudes, whereas deeper bioregions extended across broad latitudinal ranges. Fishes in shallow depths had a body shape conducive to efficient propulsion, while fishes in deeper depths were more elongated, enabling slow, energy-efficient locomotion, and had large eyes to enhance vision. Environmental filtering may be a primary driver of broad-scale patterns of functional beta diversity in the deep sea. Greater environmental homogeneity may lead to greater functional homogeneity across latitudinal gradients at deeper depths (700-1200 m). We suggest that communities living at depth may follow a 'functional village hypothesis', whereby similar key functional niches in fish communities may be maintained over large spatial scales.

AB More frequent droughts and rising temperatures pose serious threats to tropical forests. When stomata are closed under dry and hot conditions, plants lose water through leaf cuticles, but little is known about cuticle conductance (g(min)) of tropical trees, how it varies among species and environments, and how it is affected by temperature. We determined g(min) in relation to temperature for 24 tropical tree species across a steep rainfall gradient in Panama, by recording leaf drying curves at different temperatures in the laboratory. In contrast with our hypotheses, g(min) did not differ systematically across the rainfall gradient; species differences did not reflect phylogenetic patterns; and in most species g(min) did not significantly increase between 25 and 50 degrees C. g(min) was higher in deciduous than in evergreen species, in species with leaf trichomes than in species without, in sun leaves than in shade leaves, and tended to decrease with increasing leaf mass per area across species. There was no relationship between stomatal and cuticle conductance. Large species differences in g(min) and its temperature response suggest that more frequent hot droughts may lead to differential survival among tropical tree species, regardless of species' position on the rainfall gradient.

AB Freshwater ecosystems, providing valuable goods and services to humans, have been subjected to multiple human impacts, among which climate change plays a central role in threats to species. It is expected that protected areas, the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation efforts, will assume a decisive role in protecting freshwater species from the impacts of climate change. This study assessed the effects of climate change on migratory fish of the second largest neotropical river basin, evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas in safeguarding fish species, and hence the ecological functions that they perform and the ecosystem resources that they provide. The present range of 23 migratory fish of economic interest in the Parana-Paraguay basin was estimated and the responses to future climatic shifts projected to the middle and end of the 21st century were examined, quantifying predictive uncertainties. Changes and losses of climatically suitable areas will trigger severe contractions in range, with the greatest impact on the most valuable species in commercial fishing, where range losses are likely to surpass 65% in the future. The main channel of the Upper Parana River and tributaries of its left margin are projected to serve as climatic refuges for many species, and such regions are not affected by high predictive uncertainty. The results revealed that protected areas do not sufficiently protect migratory fish at present, and that they will continue to offer negligible protection in the face of climate change. This study alerts decision makers to the potential damage to inland fishery resources from climate change and provides useful information to guide conservation strategies spatially. We advocate that the creation of new protected areas and the redesign of the existing network to encompass regions that maximize current and future occupancy of migratory fish are crucial to conserve the valuable ecological, societal, and economic benefits that they provide.

AB Despite the apparent simplicity of species distribution modelling approaches, the reliability of their predictions depends on the application of a number of good practices regarding the input data and the parametrisation of algorithms. In the context of invasion biology, inadequate modelling procedures may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the potential spread of introduced species. However, clear guidelines for implementing these recommendations are often lacking, confusing or simply unknown by non-modeller end-users. Here, taking as an example the introduced land planarian Obama nungara, I fitted MaxEnt models applying six recommended processing steps with respect to sampling bias, predictor choice, training area, evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, separately or implemented together. I compared the resulting outputs to a model fitted with all default settings. All models differed from one another and from the default model, highlighting the importance of considering all these parameters when fitting species distribution models. However, the model that incorporated all fine-tuning methods was by far the most dissimilar, predicting much larger suitable areas globally, including in Africa where O. nungara has not been found so far. A closer examination suggested that it is likely a result of lower overfitting. This is a demonstration that modelling settings matter a lot, to the point that fined-tuned or default models may lead to considerably different conclusions when applied to invasive species.

AB Past studies of Sophora sect. Edwardsia using traditional phylogenetic and population genetic markers have been unable to produce a resolved species phylogeny of this recent radiation of shrubs and trees. Here we examined the relationships within and between the New Zealand species of Sophora sect. Edwardsia using next-generation sequencing. We generated genome-wide SNP data with double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). Sophora prostrata was resolved as sister to the remaining species in all analyses. Relationships between the remaining taxa exhibited a high level of conflict with many of the genetic clusters reflecting geography rather than species boundaries. This result contrasts with a previous study, which was able to differentiate most species using genotype data from nine microsatellite loci. Overall our ddRADseq results indicate a high level of interspecific hybridisation and introgression within the group, which blurs the taxonomic boundaries throughout the distributional ranges of most species. Hybridisation and introgression among regional metapopulations comprising closely related species may increase the adaptive potential to respond to changing local conditions, and at the same time selection acts to maintain their genetic identity in the face of ongoing gene flow.

AB In seasonally dry tropical forests, plant functional type can be classified as deciduous low wood density, deciduous high wood density, or evergreen high wood density species. While deciduousness is often associated with drought-avoidance and low wood density is often associated with tissue water storage, the degree to which these functional types may correspond to diverging and unique water use strategies has not been extensively tested. We examined (a) tolerance to water stress, measured by predawn and mid-day leaf water potential; (b) water use efficiency, measured via foliar delta C-13; and (c) access to soil water, measured via stem water delta O-18. We found that deciduous low wood density species maintain high leaf water potential and low water use efficiency. Deciduous high wood density species have lower leaf water potential and variable water use efficiency. Both groups rely on shallow soil water. Evergreen high wood density species have low leaf water potential, higher water use efficiency, and access alternative water sources. These findings indicate that deciduous low wood density species are drought avoiders, with a specialized strategy for storing root and stem water. Deciduous high wood density species are moderately drought tolerant, and evergreen high wood density species are the most drought tolerant group. Synthesis. Our results broadly support the plant functional type framework as a way to understand water use strategies, but also highlight species-level differences.

AB Plant transpiration downregulation in the presence of soil water stress is a critical mechanism for predicting global water, carbon, and energy cycles. Currently, many terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) represent this mechanism with an empirical correction function (beta) of soil moisture - a convenient approach that can produce large prediction uncertainties. To reduce this uncertainty, TBMs have increasingly incorporated physically based plant hydraulic models (PHMs). However, PHMs introduce additional parameter uncertainty and computational demands. Therefore, understanding why and when PHM and beta predictions diverge would usefully inform model selection within TBMs. Here, we use a minimalist PHM to demonstrate that coupling the effects of soil water stress and atmospheric moisture demand leads to a spectrum of transpiration responses controlled by soil-plant hydraulic transport (conductance). Within this transport-limitation spectrum, beta emerges as an end-member scenario of PHMs with infinite conductance, completely decoupling the effects of soil water stress and atmospheric moisture demand on transpiration. As a result, PHM and beta transpiration predictions diverge most for soil-plant systems with low hydraulic conductance (transport-limited) that experience high variation in atmospheric moisture demand and have moderate soil moisture supply for plants. We test these minimalist model results by using a land surface model at an AmeriFlux site. At this transport-limited site, a PHM downregulation scheme outperforms the beta scheme due to its sensitivity to variations in atmospheric moisture demand. Based on this observation, we develop a new "dynamic beta" that varies with atmospheric moisture demand - an approach that overcomes existing biases within beta schemes and has potential to simplify existing PHM parameterization and implementation.

AB Afrotheria is an ancient radiation of African mammals which includes the Chrysochloridae (Golden Moles), a highly specialized family of fossorial, range-restricted species, and the regionally endangered forest-dependent Dendrohyrax arboreus (Southern Tree Hyrax). South Africa is home to 17 of the 21 currently described Golden Moles, of which 16 are endemic and 10 listed as either Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered according to the IUCN regional Red List. As such, ensuring adequate conservation of Afrotheria within the country is paramount. Until recently, the legislation tasked with ensuring responsible infrastructure development in South Africa failed to adequately protect cryptic species such as Golden Moles and the Southern Tree Hyrax during the environmental impact assessment process. We detail how new legislation which requires the use of a web-based application, the Environmental Screening Tool, will improve the protection afforded to Afrotheria species of conservation concern. We describe the process by which 11 species of conservation concern are incorporated into the screening tool, what this tells us of our current knowledge of their distribution and discuss the potential impact the screening tool may have on Afrotheria conservation going forward.

AB Aim The Arctic is warming rapidly, and sea ice is disappearing. This is expected to have profound effects on Arctic wildlife. However, empirical evidence that this decline in sea ice is associated with a decline in Arctic wildlife populations is lacking. Location Svalbard Archipelago. Methods Using long-term time series data (1988-2018) from two fjords in West Spitsbergen (Svalbard), we tested whether or not sea ice concentration was associated with the population size of two of the most common Arctic seabirds, the Brunnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia) and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). Results We found that the size of guillemot and kittiwake colonies has declined on Svalbard from the mid-1990s onwards, though the shapes of these trajectories were not linear and kittiwake colony size has stabilized or even increased in recent years. sea ice concentration in West Spitsbergen also declined during the study period. Independent of these long-term trends, sea ice concentration was positively and significantly associated with seabird colony size with a 2-year lag, though variations in sea ice explained only a small proportion of the changes in colony size. One likely mechanism linking sea ice and seabird population size involves changes in the food chain, with poor sea ice conditions in a given year leading to low food availability 2 years later. This would affect breeding probability and hence colony size for kittiwakes and guillemots. This relationship between sea ice and colony size was the same in both fjords for guillemots. In the case of kittiwakes, it was not apparent in the fjord where productive glacier fronts, intensely used by kittiwakes to forage, may have buffered the effects of changes in sea ice. Main conclusions Our study provides evidence that the ongoing decline in Arctic sea ice plays a role in Arctic seabird population trajectories. However, sea ice disappearance on the breeding grounds was likely not the main driver of changes in seabird populations.

AB Until around 2000, giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis were believed to have no social structure. Despite a resurgence of interest in giraffe behaviour in around 2010, most studies are of isolated populations, making it difficult to draw general conclusions. Although it is now well established that giraffe social organisation is non-random, there is little consensus as to what influences preferred and avoided associations or the underpinning mechanisms. We test two hypotheses: first, giraffe have a complex cooperative social system, exhibited by 1) stable groups of females, 2) offspring that stay in their natal group for part or all of their lives, 3) support by non-mothers in rearing young, and 4) non-reproductive females in the group; and second, giraffe form matrilineal societies, evidenced by 1) male dispersal, 2) female philopatry, 3) assistance in raising or protecting offspring, and 4) individual benefits gained from social foraging. We reviewed 404 papers on giraffe behaviour and social organisation; captive studies were included where they supplemented information from free-living populations. We show that giraffe exhibit many of the features typical of mammals with complex cooperative social systems and matrilineal societies. However, the social complexity hypothesis posits that such species also require complex communication systems to regulate interactions and relations among group members; giraffe communication systems are poorly understood. Quantifying the fitness and survival benefits of the giraffe's social organisation is necessary to ensure its long-term survival. Giraffe numbers have declined by 40% since 1985, they have been declared extinct in seven (possibly nine) countries and are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. We identify research areas that will advance our understanding of giraffe behaviour and conservation requirements.

AB Copy number variation through gene or chromosome amplification provides a route for rapid phenotypic variation and supports the long-term evolution of gene functions. Although the evolutionary importance of copy-number variation is known, little is understood about how genetic background influences its tolerance. Here, we measured fitness costs of over 4000 overexpressed genes in 15 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains representing different lineages, to explore natural variation in tolerating gene overexpression (OE). Strain-specific effects dominated the fitness costs of gene OE. We report global differences in the consequences of gene OE, independent of the amplified gene, as well as gene-specific effects that were dependent on the genetic background. Natural variation in the response to gene OE could be explained by several models, including strain-specific physiological differences, resource limitations, and regulatory sensitivities. This work provides new insight on how genetic background influences tolerance to gene amplification and the evolutionary trajectories accessible to different backgrounds.

AB Genetic variation determines the evolutionary potential of a species and is vital for fully understanding the evolution of a species, as well as for developing optimal conservation strategies. Horsfieldia tetratepala is classified as a Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations (PSESP) in China where it is an economically important rainforest tree, but it has declined sharply, mainly caused by habitat destruction and is now an endangered, narrow endemic. Effective conservation strategies for H. tetratepala are required urgently, but limited information exists about its genetic diversity. Accordingly, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) was used to sequence sixty-three H. tetratepala trees covering ten isolated populations to assess genomic diversity and population structure. The survey generated 8103 high-quality SNPs, analysis of which revealed low genetic diversity and moderate genetic differentiation among populations. However, Bayesian clustering of the sampled H. tetratepala populations produced two genetic clusters, though with some populations from Guangxi and Yunnan intermixed. Because of the increase in habitat fragmentation and human disturbance, conservation priority should be placed on populations with higher genetic variation (e.g., BB, TKH, DWS, and GLQ), allowing the formulation of more effective conservation strategies for this PSESP species.

AB One of the most critical challenges in species distribution modelling is testing and validating various digitally derived environmental predictors (e.g., remote-sensing variables, topographic variables) by field data. Therefore, here we aimed to explore the value of soil properties in the spatial distribution of four European indigenous crayfish species. A database with 473 presence and absence locations in Romania for Austropotamobius bihariensis, A. torrentium, Astacus astacus and Pontastacus leptodactylus was used in relation to eight digitalised soil properties. Using random forest modelling, we found a preference for dense soils with lower coarse fragments content together with deeper sediment cover and higher clay values for A. astacus and P. leptodactylus. These descriptors trigger the need for cohesive soil river banks as the microenvironment for building their burrows. Conversely, species that can use banks with higher coarse fragments content, the highland species A. bihariensis and A. torrentium, prefer soils with slightly thinner sediment cover and lower density while not influenced by clay/sand content. Of all species, A. astacus was found related with higher erosive soils. The value of these soil-related digital descriptors may reside in the improvement of approaches in crayfish species distribution modelling to gain adequate conservation measures.

AB This study aimed to analyze whether there are differences between bilingual (Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish) and monolingual (Brazilian Portuguese) school children regarding reading and writing learning achievement, in executive functions (EF) components and metalinguistic abilities. Twenty-three bilingual and 23 monolingual children, aged 6 to 8 years, were assessed in terms of their writing, reading, and metalinguistic abilities, and with verbal and non-verbal tasks testing EF. A bilingual advantage was observed in reading and writing abilities and in 16 of the 44 EF measures, including subcomponents of working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and executive attention, mainly in non-verbal paradigms, while monolingual children outperformed bilingual ones in three scores: counting errors (Five Digits Test), omission of bells (Bells test) and sequential trial B (Trail Making Test). There were moderate and weak effect sizes in metalinguistic subcomponents showing bilingual advantage. Literacy improvement seems to have the potential to increase linguistic and cognitive abilities.

AB Species distribution modelling studies the relationship between species occurrence records and their environmental setting, providing a valuable approach to predicting species distribution in the Southern Ocean (SO), a challenging region to investigate due to its remoteness and extreme weather and sea conditions. The specificity of SO studies, including restricted field access and sampling, the paucity of observations and difficulties in conducting biological experiments, limit the performance of species distribution models. In this review, we discuss some issues that may influence model performance when preparing datasets and calibrating models, namely the selection and quality of environmental descriptors, the spatial and temporal biases that may affect the quality of occurrence data, the choice of modelling algorithms and the spatial scale and limits of the projection area. We stress the importance of evaluating and communicating model uncertainties, and the most common evaluation metrics are reviewed and discussed accordingly. Based on a selection of case studies on SO benthic invertebrates, we highlight important cautions to take and pitfalls to avoid when modelling the distribution of SO species, and we provide some guidelines along with potential methods and original solutions that can be used for improving model performance.

AB Scree forests with large numbers of protected plants and wildlife are seriously threatened by climate change due to more frequent drought episodes, which cause challenges for very stony, shallow soils. The effect of environmental factors on the radial growth of five tree species-European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), and mountain elm (Ulmus glabra Huds.)-was studied in the mixed stands (105-157 years) in the western Krkonose Mountains (Czech Republic) concerning climate change. These are communities of maple to fir beechwoods (association Aceri-Fagetum sylvaticae and Luzulo-Abietetum albae) on ranker soils at the altitude 590-700 m a.s.l. Production, structure, and biodiversity were evaluated in seven permanent research plots and the relationships of the radial growth (150 cores) to climatic parameters (precipitation, temperature, and extreme conditions) and air pollution (SO2, NOX, ozone exposure). The stand volume reached 557-814 m(3) ha(-1) with high production potential of spruce and ash. The radial growth of beech and spruce growing in relatively favorable habitat conditions (deeper soil profile and less skeletal soils) has increased by 16.6%-46.1% in the last 20 years. By contrast, for sycamore and ash growing in more extreme soil conditions, the radial growth decreased by 12.5%-14.6%. However, growth variability increased (12.7%-29.5%) for all tree species, as did the occurrence of negative pointer years (extremely low radial growth) in the last two decades. The most sensitive tree species to climate and air pollution were spruce and beech compared to the resilience of sycamore and ash. Spectral analysis recorded the largest cyclical fluctuations (especially the 12-year solar cycle) in spruce, while ash did not show any significant cycle processes. The limiting factors of growth were droughts with high temperatures in the vegetation period for spruce and late frosts for beech. According to the degree of extreme habitat conditions, individual tree species thus respond appropriately to advancing climate change, especially to an increase in the mean temperature (by 2.1 degrees C), unevenness in precipitation, and occurrence of extreme climate events in the last 60 years.

AB The influence of biochars on water retention, mitigating nutrient leaching, and pollutant removal in green infrastructure has been explored in the past. However, there is a lack of understanding on how feedstock (i.e., biomass) would affect biochar physicochemical properties and hence, overall erosion control (including infiltration, surface, and sub-surface runoff) in green infrastructure. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of biochars produced from three different feedstocks (pig manure, wood, and kitchen waste) on the erosion of granite residual soil. Flume experiments were conducted to measure and analyze soil erosion, runoff, and infiltration. The result showed that the runoff and soil erosion of kitchen waste biochar (KWB) samples were reduced by 17.7% and 21.7%, respectively. On the contrary, wood biochar (WB) and pig manure biochar (PMB) were found to enhance runoff and soil erosion. In addition, biochar particles were found in runoff and infiltration in erosion experiment. Thus, it is important to note that measures should be taken to prevent biochar loss when using biochar as a soil amendment. Additionally, the effects of different types of biochar on soil hydraulic and hydrophobicity properties should be taken into account as a selection criterion for choosing amendments in green infrastructure. This study finds that kitchen waste biochar has better performance in improving soil hydraulics and erosion.

AB Beta diversity, which measures the variation in community composition along environmental gradients, has great significance for biodiversity conservation and nature reserve construction. Biodiversity usually includes taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic dimensions. However, few studies have considered these three dimensions of beta diversity simultaneously in the grassland. Thus, based on 194 sites in the Inner Mongolia grassland, we calculated taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic beta diversity and further explored the relative importance of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation on beta diversity patterns. The results showed that the taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity mainly consisted of the turnover compo-nent, but functional beta diversity mainly consisted of the nestedness component. Dispersal limitation dominantly influenced taxonomic and functional beta diversity, while environmental filtering dominantly influenced phylogenetic beta diversity. According to the inequivalence of three dimensions of diversity, we highlight that it is necessary to conduct comprehensive re-search based on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity for better biodiversity con-servation.

AB Adherence to preventive measures is influenced by people's knowledge, attitudes and practices towards a disease; therefore, assessing knowledge of COVID-19 is critical in the overall effort to contain the outbreak. This cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduates (n = 3621) of different programs and different levels of education associated with universities in north-central Ecuador. The form consisted of 32 questions covering demographics, symptoms, detection, treatment, transmission, prevention and knowledge of the virus. The rate of correct answers was 75.5% (21.1 +/- 5 out of 28), with differences observed regarding program of study, educational level and location of institution (alpha = 0.05), although effect size analyses showed that these differences could not be considered large. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that lower scores were associated with initial stages of education, careers related to social sciences and location of institution. Participants possessed sufficient knowledge about detection, transmission and prevention, although they overestimated fatality rate and were less confident about the characteristics of the virus and the effectiveness of traditional medicine. Consequently, future educational programs must place emphasis on addressing deficient knowledge. Certainly, improving COVID-19 literacy will promote the appropriate application of protective measures aimed at preventing the virus' spread.

AB Farmland abandonment has been a widespread land-use change in the Iberian Peninsula since the second half of the 20th century, leading to the establishment of secondary forests across the region. In this study, we aimed to address changes in the recent (1985-2014) emergence patterns of these forests and examine how environmental factors affected their growth by considering differences in leaf-habit types. We used a combination of Landsat-derived land-cover maps and aboveground biomass (AGB) maps from the European Space Agency to assess the secondary forest establishment and growth, respectively, in the study region. We also obtained a set of topographic, climatic and landscape variables from diverse GIS layers and used them for determining changes over time in the environmental drivers of forest establishment and AGB using general linear models. The results highlight that secondary forest cover was still increasing in the Iberian Peninsula at a rate above the European average. Yet, they also indicate a directional change in the emergence of secondary forests towards lower and less steep regions with higher water availability (mean rainfall and SPEI) and less forest cover but are subjected to greater drought events. In addition, these environmental factors differentially affect the growth of forests with different leaf-habit types: i.e., needleleaf secondary forests being less favoured by high temperature and precipitation, and broadleaf deciduous forests being most negatively affected by drought. Finally, these spatial patterns of forest emergence and the contrasting responses of forest leaf-habits to environmental factors explained the major development of broadleaf evergreen compared to broadleaf deciduous forests and, especially, needleleaf secondary forests. These results will improve the knowledge of forest dynamics that have occurred in the Iberian Peninsula in recent decades and provide an essential tool for understanding the potential effects of climate warming on secondary forest growth.

AB In this paper, we analyze the determinants of job satisfaction for employees over the age 50 or more, using the latest SHARE-ERIC dataset (Wave 7) filtered for Romania (over 2000 records). After applying logistic regressions with average marginal effects, we obtained an overall and seven regional models which emphasize that a good atmosphere at the workplace and the deserved recognition received for the work done are the most reliable predictors of career satisfaction, confirmed in this order of importance by many other robustness checks. Particularly, in the case of respondents from the Western part of Romania, we found that meritocracy-based influence, namely deserved recognition, counts almost as much as the workplace atmosphere. For these individuals, previous educational performance and lifetime employment at a single job matter more than the previous dual-core on job satisfaction. Unexpectedly, the adults from central romania present a negative influence of life satisfaction on job satisfaction due to an unbalanced work-family vision of life. The locus of control has different effects on job satisfaction in south and south-western regions, while in the north-east, meaning in life is negatively influencing job satisfaction. Bridge employment exerts a negative influence on career satisfaction in the north-west, and in the South-East, and interpersonal trust has a positive effect.

AB Africa has experienced unprecedented growth across a range of development indices for decades. However, this growth is often at the expense of Africa's biodiversity and ecosystems, jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions of people depending on the goods and services provided by nature, with broader consequences for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Encouragingly, Africa can still take a more sustainable path. Here, we synthesize the key learnings from the African Ecological Futures project. We report results from a participatory scenario planning process around four collectively-owned scenarios and narratives for the evolution of Africa's ecological resource base over the next 50 years. These scenarios provided a lens to review pressures on the natural environment, through the drivers, pressures, state, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) framework. Based on the outcomes from each of these steps, we discuss opportunities to reorient Africa's development trajectories towards a sustainable path. These opportunities fall under the broad categories of "effective natural resource governance", "strategic planning capabilities", "investment safeguards and frameworks", and "new partnership models". Underpinning all these opportunities are "data, management information, and decision support frameworks". This work can help inform collaborative action by a broad set of actors with an interest in ensuring a sustainable ecological future for Africa.

AB The direct examination of plant canopy temperature can assist in optimizing citrus irrigation management in greenhouses. This study aimed to develop a method to measure canopy temperature using thermal imaging in one-year-old citrus plants in a greenhouse to identify plants with water stress and verify its potential to be used as a tool to assess citrus water status. The experiment was conducted for 48 days (27 November 2019 to 13 January 2020). We evaluated the influence of five levels of irrigation on two citrus species ('Red Ruby' grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) and 'Valencia' sweet orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck)). Images were taken using a portable thermal camera and analyzed using open-source software. We determined canopy temperature, leaf photosynthesis and transpiration, and plant biomass. The results indicated a positive relationship between the amount of water applied and the temperature response of plants exposed to different water levels. Grapefruit and sweet orange plants that received less water and were submitted to water restrictions showed higher canopy temperatures than the air (up to 6 degrees C). The thermal images easily identified water-stressed plants. Our proof-of-concept study allowed quickly obtaining the canopy temperature using readily available equipment and can be used as a tool to assess citrus water status in one-year-old citrus plants in greenhouses and perhaps in commercial operations with mature trees in the field after specific experimentation. This technique, coupled with an automated system, can be used for irrigation scheduling. Thus, setting up a limit temperature is necessary to start the irrigation system and set the irrigation time based on the soil water content. To use this process on a large scale, it is necessary to apply an automation routine to process the thermal images in real time and remove the weeds from the background to determine the canopy temperature.

AB The goal of this work is to evaluate a deep learning algorithm that has been designed to predict the topological evolution of dynamic complex non-Euclidean graphs in discrete-time in which links are labeled with communicative messages. This type of graph can represent, for example, social networks or complex organisations such as the networks associated with Industry 4.0. In this paper, we first introduce the formal geometric deep lean learning algorithm in its essential form. We then propose a methodology to systematically mine the data generated in social media Twitter, which resembles these complex topologies. Finally, we present the evaluation of a geometric deep lean learning algorithm that allows for link prediction within such databases. The evaluation results show that this algorithm can provide high accuracy in the link prediction of a retweet social network.

AB To contribute to what is known about involvement of vegetation dynamics in Neotropical speciation, we used the Epidendrum latilabre complex, a taxonomically well-defined species group, to investigate past connections between Amazonian (AM) and Atlantic (AF) forests and address the following topics: (1) divergence times between sister species currently distributed in AM and AF; (2) distribution patterns of ancestral species of the E. latilabre complex and (3) potential routes connecting ancestral ranges between AM and AF. We developed a robust phylogenetic estimate for species of the E. latilabre complex by sequencing two nuclear and six plastid loci. Then, we combined divergence time estimation, ancestral range reconstruction and ecological niche modelling. Our biogeographic reconstruction exhibits a complex pattern of connections among tropical forests east of the Andes in South America. The AM and AF species of the E. latilabre complex are intermixed in the results, and climatic shifts during the Pleistocene (Chibanian) are suggested here as a major force promoting speciation. Sister species tend to be ecologically distinct in their climate niche spaces, and vicariance and peripheral isolation are reconstructed as the main drivers of speciation. There is evidence to suggest that the south-east/north-west bridge and the northern/north-eastern coastal route have been occupied by the ancestors of the E. latilabre complex, and alternative routes across the South American dry diagonal were unlikely. Further studies on Neotropical epiphytic taxa are still necessary for understanding the dynamics of historical connections between AM and AF.

AB Population genomics has significantly increased our ability to make inferences about microevolutionary processes and demographic histories, which have the potential to improve protection and recovery of imperiled species. Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionida) represent one of the most imperiled groups of organisms globally. Despite systemic decline of mussel abundance and diversity, studies evaluating spatiotemporal changes in distribution, demographic histories, and ecological factors that threaten long-term persistence of imperiled species remain lacking. In this study, we use genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) and mitochondrial sequence data (mtDNA) to define conservation units (CUs) for two highly imperiled freshwater mussel species, Potamilus amphichaenus and Potamilus streckersoni. We then synthesize our molecular findings with details from field collections spanning from 1901 to 2019 to further elucidate distributional trends, contemporary status, and other factors that may be contributing to population declines for our focal species. We collected GBS and mtDNA data for individuals of P. amphichaenus and P. streckersoni from freshwater mussel collections in the Brazos, Neches, Sabine, and Trinity drainages ranging from 2012 to 2019. Molecular analyses resolved disputing number of genetic clusters within P. amphichaenus and P. streckersoni; however, we find defensible support for four CUs, each corresponding to an independent river basin. Evaluations of historical and recent occurrence data illuminated a generally increasing trend of occurrence in each of the four CUs, which were correlated with recent increases in sampling effort. Taken together, these findings suggest that P. amphichaenus and P. streckersoni are likely rare throughout their respective ranges. Because of this, the establishment of CUs will facilitate evidence-based recovery planning and ensure potential captive propagation and translocation efforts are beneficial. Our synthesis represents a case study for conservation genomic assessments in freshwater mussels and provides a model for future studies aimed at recovery planning for these highly imperiled organisms.

AB Open field burning of rice straw besides causing environmental pollution and human health problems results in loss of organic carbon and essential nutrients. Urgent solution is required for management of rice straw in an eco-friendly and sustainable manner. The aim of the present study was to examine the efficiency of direct return of rice straw into the soil versus biochar generated from rice straw, and compare it with wood derived biochar in influencing soil biological processes and potential to accumulate soil organic C (SOC). We studied the effect of pyrogenic conversion of rice straw and wood chips to biochar on changes in chemical composition of feedstock by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and C and N mineralization kinetics, microbial metabolism, carbon use efficiency (CUE) and soil enzyme activities in a series of laboratory incubation experiments conducted at 25 degrees C temperature and field capacity moisture. Pyrogenic conversion of feedstock to biochar resulted in increase in C (39.6% to 69.2%) and N (0.4% to 1.65%) contents and lowering of C/N (99 to 28.4) and H/C (1.94 to 0.60) ratios. Charring resulted in decrease in aliphatic and increase in aromatic components. Decomposition of organic substrates was governed by aromaticity and C/N ratio; in 127 days, only 12% of rice straw biochar embodied C was mineralized as against 76% from rice straw. The addition of biochars resulted in soil N priming (120 +/- 24 mg N kg(-1)) whereas straw application resulted in net N immobilization (-13 mg N kg(-1)). Compared to unpyrogenic straw, the rice straw biochar led to greater microbial growth, lower metabolic quotient, higher CUE (3.3 times) and decreased microbial respiration, with potential to promote SOC accumulation. It was concluded that addition of rice residue generated biochar into soil is more beneficial for soil biological processes and SOC stabilization to stymie climate change than direct return of plant residue into the soil. The results are significant for devising eco-friendly rice residue management practices in the Indo-Gangetic plains.

   INFERENCE; GEOGRAPHY; SELECTION
AB Spatial population genetic data often exhibits 'isolation-by-distance,' where genetic similarity tends to decrease as individuals become more geographically distant. The rate at which genetic similarity decays with distance is often spatially heterogeneous due to variable population processes like genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. Petkova et al., 2016 developed a statistical method called Estimating Effective Migration Surfaces (EEMS) for visualizing spatially heterogeneous isolation-by-distance on a geographic map. While EEMS is a powerful tool for depicting spatial population structure, it can suffer from slow runtimes. Here, we develop a related method called Fast Estimation of Effective Migration Surfaces (FEEMS). FEEMS uses a Gaussian Markov Random Field model in a penalized likelihood framework that allows for efficient optimization and output of effective migration surfaces. Further, the efficient optimization facilitates the inference of migration parameters per edge in the graph, rather than per node (as in EEMS). With simulations, we show conditions under which FEEMS can accurately recover effective migration surfaces with complex gene-flow histories, including those with anisotropy. We apply FEEMS to population genetic data from North American gray wolves and show it performs favorably in comparison to EEMS, with solutions obtained orders of magnitude faster. Overall, FEEMS expands the ability of users to quickly visualize and interpret spatial structure in their data.

AB As a result of co-evolution between plants and herbivores, related plants often interact with similar herbivore communities. Variation in plant-herbivore interactions is determined by variation in underlying functional traits and by ecological and stochastic processes. Hence, typically, only a subset of possible interactions is realised on individual plants. We show that insect herbivore communities assembling on individual plants are structured by plant phylogeny among 12 species in two phylogenetic lineages of Brassicaceae. This community sorting to plant phylogeny was retained when splitting the community according to herbivore feeding guilds. Relative abundance of herbivores as well as the size of the community structured community dissimilarity among plant species. Importantly, the amount of intraspecific variation in realised plant-herbivore interactions is also phylogenetically structured. We argue that variability in realised interactions that are not directly structured by plant traits is ecologically relevant and must be considered in the evolution of plant defences.

AB Early signs of noise-induced hearing damage are difficult to identify, as they are often confounded by factors such as age, audiometric thresholds, or even music experience. Much previous research has focused on deficits observed at high intensity levels. In contrast, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that noise exposure causes a degradation in low-sound-level auditory processing in humans, as a consequence of dysfunction of the inner hair cell pathway. Frequency difference limens (FDLs) and amplitude modulation depth discrimination (MDD) were measured for five center frequencies (0.75, 1, 3, 4 and 6 kHz) at 15 and 25 dB sensation level (SL), as a function of noise exposure, age, audiometric hearing loss, and music experience. Forty participants, aged 33-75 years, with normal hearing up to 1 kHz and mild-to-moderate hearing loss above 2 kHz, were tested. Participants had varying degrees of self reported noise exposure, and varied in music experience. FDL worsened as a function of age. Participants with music experience outperformed the non-experienced in both the FDL and MDD tasks. MDD thresholds were significantly better for high-noise-exposed, than for low-noise-exposed, participants at 25 dB SL, particularly at 6 kHz. No effects of age or hearing loss were observed in the MDD. It is possible that the association between MDD thresholds and noise exposure was not causal, but instead was mediated by other factors that were not measured in the study. The association is consistent, qualitatively, with a hypothesized loss of compression due to outer hair cell dysfunction. Crown Copyright (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental and dispersal filters are key determinants of species distributions of Amazonian tree communities. However, a comprehensive analysis of the role of environmental and dispersal filters is needed to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that drive phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover of Amazonian tree communities. We compare measures of taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity in 41 one-hectare plots to test the relative importance of climate, soils, geology, geomorphology, pure spatial variables and the spatial variation of environmental drivers of phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover in Ecuadorian Amazon tree communities. We found low phylogenetic and high taxonomic turnover with respect to environmental and dispersal filters. In addition, our results suggest that climate is a significantly better predictor of phylogenetic turnover and taxonomic turnover than geomorphology and soils at all spatial scales. The influence of climate as a predictor of phylogenetic turnover was stronger at broader spatial scales (50 km(2)) whereas geomorphology and soils appear to be better predictors of taxonomic turnover at mid (5 km(2)) and fine spatial scales (0.5 km(2)) but a weak predictor of phylogenetic turnover at broad spatial scales. We also found that the combined effect of geomorphology and soils was significantly higher for taxonomic turnover at all spatial scales but not for phylogenetic turnover at large spatial scales. Geographic distances as proxy of dispersal limitation was a better predictor of phylogenetic turnover at distances of 50 < 500 km. Our findings suggest that climatic variation at regional scales can better predict phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover than geomorphology and soils.

AB Ecological factors, such as predation, have traditionally been used to explain sociability. However, it is increasingly recognised that individuals within a group do not associate randomly, and that these non-random associations can generate fitness advantages. The majority of the empirical evidence on differentiated associations in group-living mammals, however, comes from a limited number of taxa and we still know very little about their occurrence and characteristics in some highly social species, such as rats (Rattus spp.). Here, using network analysis, we quantified association patterns in four groups of male fancy rats. We found that the associations between rats were not randomly distributed and that most individuals had significantly more preferred/avoided associates than expected by random. We also found that these preferences can be stable over time, and that they were not influenced by individuals' rank position in the dominance hierarchy. Our findings are consistent with work in other mammals, but contrast with the limited evidence available for other rat strains. While further studies in groups with different demographic composition are warranted to confirm our findings, the occurrence of differentiated associations in all male groups of rats have important implications for the management and welfare of captive rat populations.

AB Collecting and conserving genetic diversity from plant populations for ex situ collections is a major objective of seed banks and botanic gardens. However, current guidelines for collecting germplasm to preserve plant species ex situ might not adequately capture the genetic diversity present in real plant population systems. Here, we tested a previously unexplored challenge for sampling practices: when populations of a rare plant species vary in size. We hypothesized that sampling proportional to the population size would capture more genetic diversity than sampling an equal number of individuals from every population. Using simulations of a hypothetical rare species, we tested equal and proportional strategies and calculated how many alleles were captured by either strategy. The effects of migration rate, recent bottlenecks, and sampling intensity on genetic diversity capture were also examined. We found that when population sizes differ (e.g., one population 3 times the size of median population size), proportional sampling captures more genetic diversity under constant size populations. The relatively modest improvement (1-5% more allelic diversity for most cases) was observed across all parameters of migration and intensity tested-except when there were recent bottlenecks. We also created simulations tailored to three IUCN Red List threatened oaks (Quercus oglethorpensis, Q. engelmanii, and Q. acerifolia) and found similar results for these detailed case studies as for our generic simulations. We conclude that sampling proportional to population size may often be a useful sampling strategy to create genetically diverse ex situ plant populations, ultimately resulting in more efficient use of resources.

AB Introduction Multiple systematic reviews have investigated the relation between socioeconomic position (SEP) and body mass index (BMI) throughout the life course. However, BMI does not capture quantity and distribution of fat and muscle, which are better indicators of obesity than BMI, and have been independently linked to adverse health outcomes. Less is known about the relation between SEP and body composition, and the literature has not been reviewed. We therefore systematically reviewed the literature on the association between life course SEP and body composition in adulthood. Methods A protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019119937), and the review followed PRISMA guidelines. An electronic search of three databases (MEDLINE, Embase Classic + Embase and SPORTDiscus) was conducted. Original studies in the English language were included that examine the association between any recognised measure of SEP at any age and body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass, ratio and distribution) in adulthood, measured using a direct technique, i.e., not an anthropometric measure. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Results A total of 47 papers were included in the final review, none were from low-income countries (LICs). Greater advantage in childhood and adulthood was associated with lower fat levels in high-income countries (HICs). Associations in the opposite direction were found exclusively in middle-income countries (MICs). No studies in MICs reported associations for childhood SEP. For measures of lean mass, the majority of papers reported no association, or greater advantage in adulthood associated with higher lean mass, with little variation between HICs and MICs. Associations in HICs are more often observed in women than men. Conclusion The results indicate that fat measures follow similar patterns to those seen for BMI, and that women in HICs are more likely to experience inequalities in both fat and lean measures. Further research in LICs and MICs is needed.

AB Background The relation between socioeconomic position (SEP) and obesity measured by body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight for height, has been extensively reviewed in children, showing consistent associations between disadvantaged SEP and higher BMI in high-income countries (HICs) and lower BMI in middle-income countries (MICs). Fat mass (FM), a more accurate measure of adiposity, and fat-free mass (FFM) are not captured by BMI, but have been shown to track from childhood to adulthood, and be important for cardiovascular health and functional outcomes in later life. It is not clear whether body composition is associated with SEP. We systematically reviewed the association between SEP and body composition in childhood. Methods A systematic review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019119937). Original studies in the English language, which examined the association between SEP and body composition in childhood, were included. An electronic search of three databases was conducted. Two independent reviewers carried out screening, data extraction and quality assessment. Due to heterogeneity in results, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Heterogeneity in findings according to SEP, sex, body composition measure and country income level was investigated. Results 50 papers were included, the majority from HICs. No papers were from low-income countries. Disadvantage in childhood was associated with greater FM and lower FFM in HICs, but with lower FM and lower FFM in MICs. When measures of FFM indexed to height were used there was no evidence of associations with SEP. In HICs, more studies reported associations between disadvantaged SEP and higher FM among girls comparative to boys. Conclusions Inequalities in FM are evident in HICs and, in the opposite direction, in MICs and follow similar trends to inequalities for BMI. Inequalities in height are likely important in understanding inequalities in FFM.

AB Individual variation is increasingly recognized as a central component of ecological processes, but its role in structuring environmental niche associations remains largely unknown. Species' responses to environmental conditions are ultimately determined by the niches of single individuals, yet environmental associations are typically captured only at the level of species. Here, we develop scenarios for how individual variation may combine to define the compound environmental niche of populations, use extensive movement data to document individual environmental niche variation, test associated hypotheses of niche configuration, and examine the consistency of individual niches over time. For 45 individual white storks (Ciconia ciconia; 116 individual-year combinations), we uncover high variability in individual environmental associations, consistency of individual niches over time, and moderate to strong niche specialization. Within populations, environmental niches follow a nested pattern, with individuals arranged along a specialist-to-generalist gradient. These results reject common assumptions of individual niche equivalency among conspecifics, as well as the separation of individual niches into disparate parts of environmental space. These findings underscore the need for a more thorough consideration of individualistic environmental responses in global change research. Understanding how individual niches vary can inform ecology and conservation. A study of 45 GPS-tracked white storks across three breeding populations reveals that individual environmental niches are nested, arranged along a specialist-generalist gradient that is highly consistent over time.

AB In Brazil, neglect and lack of data have complicated urban freight transportation planning. Belo Horizonte is one such example, where the administration's disregard for urban freight transport has led to multiple negative externalities. Using the maximum entropy method, this study analyzed the influence of urban planning factors on warehouse location in the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region. Warehouse location was analyzed using 19 factors, with the results recorded on a map of logistic probabilities concerning locating warehouses. Given this is exploratory research, the model was validated by visual comparison to address the four hypotheses: (i) warehouses tend to be located near roads and railroads; (ii) warehouses tend to be located close to their consumer markets; (iii) warehouses tend to be located in urban areas; and (iv) warehouses tend to be located next to each other, creating clusters. These hypotheses were based on the extant literature and confirmed from observations of the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region. The results also demonstrated that the maximum entropy method can suitably model freight transportation in support of urban planning policy.

AB The importance of soils to society has gained increasing recognition over the past decade, with the potential to contribute to most of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With unprecedented and growing demands for food, water and energy, there is an urgent need for a global effort to address the challenges of climate change and land degradation, whilst protecting soil as a natural resource. In this paper, we identify the contribution of soil science over the past decade to addressing gaps in our knowledge regarding major environmental challenges: climate change, food security, water security, urban development, and ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. Continuing to address knowledge gaps in soil science is essential for the achievement of the SDGs. However, with limited time and budget, it is also pertinent to identify effective methods of working that ensure the research carried out leads to real-world impact. Here, we suggest three strategies for the next decade of soil science, comprising a greater implementation of research into policy, interdisciplinary partnerships to evaluate function trade-offs and synergies between soils and other environmental domains, and integrating monitoring and modelling methods to ensure soil-based policies can withstand the uncertainties of the future. Highlights We highlight the contributions of soil science to five major environmental challenges since 2010. Researchers have contributed to recommendation reports, but work is rarely translated into policy. Interdisciplinary work should assess trade-offs and synergies between soils and other domains. Integrating monitoring and modelling is key for robust and sustainable soils-based policymaking.

AB Many studies have inferred the way in which natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow shape the population genetic structures, but very few have quantified the population differentiation under spatially and temporally varying levels of selection pressure, population fluctuation and gene flow. In Nara Park (6.6 km(2)), central Japan, where several hundred sika deer (Cervus nippon) have been protected for more than 1,200 years, heavily- or moderately-haired nettle (Urtica thunbergiana) populations have evolved probably in response to intense deer browsing. Here, we analysed the genetic structure of two Nara Park populations and five surrounding populations using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. A total of 546 marker loci were genotyped from 210 individuals. A Bayesian method estimated 5.5% of these loci to be outliers, which are putatively under natural selection. Neighbour-joining, principal coordinates and Bayesian clustering analyses using all-loci, non-outlier loci and outlier loci datasets showed that the Nara Park populations formed a cluster distinct from the surroundings. These results indicate the genome-wide differentiation of the Nara Park populations from the surroundings. Moreover, these imply the following: (1) gene flow is limited between these populations and thus genetic drift is a major factor causing the differentiation; and (2) natural selection imposed by intense deer browsing has contributed to some extent to the differentiation. In conclusion, sika deer seems to have counteracted genetic drift to drive the genetic differentiation of hairy nettles in Nara Park. This study suggests that a single herbivore species could lead to genetic differentiation among plant populations.

AB Background: This study examined the global association between the Traditional Japanese Diet Score and suicide rate. Methods: Average food supply and energy supply by country were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Statistics Division database (FAOSTAT). Traditional Japanese Diet Score (TJDS) was calculated from food group classifications. Age-standardized suicide rates per 100,000 people by country were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2017 database. The 26-year associations between TJDS and suicide rates were examined controlling for covariates using a mixed-effects model in 138 countries with populations of 1 million or greater. Results: A significant negative association was found in the analysis of the relationship between TJDS and the prevalence of suicide (beta (se) =-0.126 (0.031), p < 0.001]. The interaction term between TJDS and year was also significant (beta (se) =-0.011 (0.003), p < 0.001]. The change in the effect of TJDS on suicide rates by year was examined. The effect of TJDS was not significant from 1991 to 1999 but became significant after 2000; the slope of the TJDS to suicide rate in 2017 was-0.270 (95% confidence interval-0.382,-0.169, p < 0.001). Limitations: This was a national ecological study and did not consider individual differences in sex, age, and lifestyle. Conclusions: TJDS may be is a protective factor for depression, which may prevent suicide. The association between TJDS and suicide rates became stronger over time and was inversely associated with suicide rates after 2000.

AB Naturally fragmented landscapes are adequate systems for evaluating patterns and mechanisms that determine species distribution without confounding effects of anthropogenic fragmentation and habitat loss. We aimed to evaluate an ant metacommunity's spatiotemporal patterns in montane forest islands amid a grassland-dominated matrix. We assessed these patterns by deconstructing the ant metacommunity into forest-dependent and habitat generalist species. We sampled twice a year (summer and winter) over 2 years (2014 and 2015), using soil and arboreal pitfall traps, in fourteen forest islands (varying in size, shape, and connectivity) in the Espinhaco Range Biosphere Reserve, Brazil. We evaluated the relationship between ant species richness, composition (beta-diversity), and predictor variables of forest island structure (canopy cover and understory density) and landscape structure (forest amount, number of forest islands, and shape). We sampled 99 ant species, 66.7% of which were classified as forest-dependent and 33.3% as habitat generalist species. We found that ant beta-diversity was higher in space than in time, and that species composition variation in time (temporal beta-diversity) differed between ant species groups. Both ant groups responded differently to forest island and landscape structure characteristics. Landscape structure seems to act as a spatial filter and the forest islands' local characteristics as an environmental filter, which jointly determine the local and regional diversity. We demonstrate the importance that forest archipelagos pose to ant metacommunity's structure and dynamics in montane tropical regions. Mountaintop conservation and management strategies must consider the forest island archipelago to maintain the biodiversity and the functioning of these systems.

AB Sea pen communities are United Nations General Assembly-designated Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems which occur worldwide in soft-bottom sediments where trawling often occurs. However, the ability of marine managers to assess, monitor and mitigate impacts to sea pens at national scales has been constrained by a limited understanding of their environmental requirements, geographical distribution and responses to trawling. In this study, we used random forest species distribution modelling (SDM) to predict the distribution of suitable habitat for 3 sea pen species (tall sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis, slender sea pen Virgularia mirabilis and phosphorescent sea pen Pennatula phosphorea) on the UK continental shelf, exploring the results relative to the distribution of fishing activity. Occurrence of all 3 species corresponded to areas of low current and wave velocity, where suspended matter in the water column was also low. However, for F. quadrangularis, the largest species, the models indicated substantially different drivers of distribution between the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas ICES Ecoregions. This disparity appears to reflect modification to the range and realised niche of this species in the Greater North Sea, due to trawling impacts. P. phosphorea and V. mirabilis appear to be more resilient to trawling, with no clear negative relationships observed. Our findings illustrate the value of broadscale qualitative comparisons between SDMs and human activity data for insights on pressure-state relationships. When combined with robust distribution maps, this improved understanding of vulnerability will enable marine managers to make ecologically sound, defensible decisions and deliver tangible conservation outcomes for sea pen communities.

AB As a source of emerging infectious diseases, wildlife assemblages (and related spatial patterns) must be quantitatively assessed to help identify high-risk locations. Previous assessments have largely focussed on the distributions of individual species; however, transmission dynamics are expected to depend on assemblage composition. Moreover, disease-diversity relationships have mainly been studied in the context of species loss, but assemblage composition and disease risk (e.g. infection prevalence in wildlife assemblages) can change without extinction. Based on the predicted distributions and abundances of 4466 mammal species, we estimated global patterns of disease risk through the calculation of the community-level basic reproductive ratio R0, an index of invasion potential, persistence, and maximum prevalence of a pathogen in a wildlife assemblage. For density-dependent diseases, we found that, in addition to tropical areas which are commonly viewed as infectious disease hotspots, northern temperate latitudes included high-risk areas. We also forecasted the effects of climate change and habitat loss from 2015 to 2035. Over this period, many local assemblages showed no net loss of species richness, but the assemblage composition (i.e. the mix of species and their abundances) changed considerably. Simultaneously, most areas experienced a decreased risk of density-dependent diseases but an increased risk of frequency-dependent diseases. We further explored the factors driving these changes in disease risk. Our results suggest that biodiversity and changes therein jointly influence disease risk. Understanding these changes and their drivers and ultimately identifying emerging infectious disease hotspots can help health officials prioritize resource distribution.

AB Climate change is projected to have significant effects on the distribution of species globally, but research into the implications in parts of Africa has been limited. Using species distribution modelling, this study models climate change-related risks to the terrestrial biodiversity (birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants) of Kenya's economically-important and ecologically diverse Tana River Basin. Large reductions in species richness are projected with just 2 degrees C warming (relative to preindustrial levels) with birds and plants seeing the greatest impact. Potential climate refugia for biodiversity are identified within the basin, but often overlap with areas already converted to agriculture or set aside for agricultural expansion, and the majority are outside protected areas. Similarly, some protected areas contain no projected refugia at higher levels of global warming, showing they may be insufficient to protect the basin's biodiversity as climate changes. However, risks to biodiversity are much smaller if the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 'well below 2 degrees C' warming, rather than 2 degrees C only, is met. The potential for refugia for plants and animals decreases strongly with warming. For example, 82% of the basin remaining climatically suitable for at least 75% of the plants currently present at 1.5 degrees C warming, as compared with 23% at 2 degrees C and 3% at 4.5 degrees C. This research provides the first assessment of the combined effects of development plans and climate change on biodiversity of the Tana River Basin, including identifying potential areas for restoration, and contributes to a greater understanding of biodiversity protection and adaptation options in Kenya.

AB Aim Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (CCVA) prescribes the quantification of species vulnerability based on three components: sensitivity, adaptive capacity and exposure. Such assessments should be performed through combined approaches that integrate trait-based elements (e.g., measures of species sensitivity such as niche width) with correlative tools quantifying exposure (magnitude of changes in climate within species habitat). Furthermore, as land use alterations may increase climate impacts on biodiversity, CCVAs should focus on both climate and land use change effects. Unfortunately, most of such assessments have so far focused exclusively on exposure to climate change. Location Himalaya. Methods We evaluated the vulnerability of three otter species occurring in the Himalayan region, that is, Aonyx cinereus, Lutra lutra and Lutrogale perspicillata, to 2050 climate and land use change through the recently proposed Climate Niche Factor Analysis (CNFA) framework combined with Species Distribution Models. Results Future climate and land use change will reduce (6%-15%) and shift (10%-18%) the geographical range of the three species in the Himalaya, with land use alterations exerting far more severe effects than climate change. Among vulnerability components, sensitivity played a greater role than exposure in determining the vulnerability of the otters. Specifically, the most specialist species, L. perspicillata, showed the highest vulnerability in comparison with the most generalist, L. lutra. Main conclusions Our results underline how coupling climate and land use change components in CCVAs can generate diverging predictions of species vulnerability compared to approaches relying on climate change only. Moreover, intrinsic components, such as species sensitivity, proved significantly more important in determining vulnerability than extrinsic metrics such as habitat exposure.

AB Phenotypic flexibility allows individuals to reversibly modify trait values and theory predicts an individual's relative degree of flexibility positively correlates with the environmental heterogeneity it experiences. We test this prediction by integrating surveys of population genetic and physiological variation with thermal acclimation experiments and indices of environmental heterogeneity in the Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis) and its congeners. We combine field measures of thermogenic capacity for 335 individuals, 22,006 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 181 individuals, and laboratory acclimations replicated on five populations. We show that Junco populations: (1) differ in their thermogenic responses to temperature variation in the field; (2) harbor allelic variation that also correlates with temperature heterogeneity; and (3) exhibit intra-specific variation in thermogenic flexibility in the laboratory that correlates with the heterogeneity of their native thermal environment. These results provide comprehensive support that phenotypic flexibility corresponds with environmental heterogeneity and highlight its importance for coping with environmental change. Theory predicts that organisms in varied environments should evolve to be more phenotypically flexible. Evidence combining genetic and physiological variation with thermal acclimation experiments shows that the thermogenic flexibility of wild juncos is greatest in populations where temperatures are most variable.

AB Microgyne trifurcata is a rare native plant species from one of the areas with the highest human impact on the environment in southern South America. Its habitat, mostly grasslands suitable for agriculture, has been increasingly covered by crops since the late 1800s. Microgyne trifurcata provides an excellent case study to understand how different environmental variables have affected the distribution area of a rare species. This study aims to estimate the impact of topoclimatic and land-use changes in the distribution of Microgyne trifurcata throughout the twentieth century. We carried out recent past and present distribution modeling using the Ensembles of Small Models (ESM) methodology. In this spatio-temporal study, we included climatic, topographic, and land-use variables. We classified the occurrences into two periods of the twentieth century. The first dates from 1901 to 1940, and the second, from 1960 to 2000, when the main cropping changes of the area occurred. The projected area between 1960 and 2000 provides for this species new suitable habitats toward the northeast of the area of study. Our results highlight the importance of assessing the combined impacts of climate and land-use changes on species distributions over time. This study shows that the potential area of Microgyne trifurcata decreased and underwent fragmentation throughout the twentieth century when these variables combined are used to model its distribution. Our outcomes prompt future studies on the vulnerability of Microgyne trifurcata to outline conservation strategies.

AB Both biochar and nitrogen (N) addition have been proposed for enhancing plant productivity and increasing carbon (C) sequestration. Although numerous studies have been conducted to examine responses of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes to biochar or N addition, biochar is often co-applied with N fertilizer and the interactive effects of the two factors still remain unclear. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of manipulative experiments with 267 two-factor observations to quantify the main and interactive effects of biochar and N addition on soil GHG fluxes at a global scale. Our results showed that biochar addition significantly increased soil CO2 emission by 10.1%, but decreased N2O emission by 14.7%. Meanwhile, N addition increased both soil CO2 and N2O emissions by 11.6% and 288%, respectively. The combination of biochar and N addition also exhibited significant positive effect on CO2 (+18.0%) and N2O (+148%) emissions, but there were non-significant changes in CH4 fluxes. Consequently, antagonistic interaction between biochar and N addition was observed in soil GHG fluxes and their global warming potential (GWP), except for CH4 uptake showing an additive interaction. This synthesis highlights the importance of the interactive effects between biochar and N addition, providing a quantitative basis to develop sustainable strategies toward widespread application of biochar to preserve cropping system and mitigate climate change.

AB Urban trees are supposed to have an important regulating function for the urban microclimate, carbon sequestration and a number of other ecosystem services. Vice versa, urban trees suffer from droughts that are typically enhanced within the urban heat island. In the present study, we examined how ecosystem services cooling and carbon sequestration by urban trees were impaired due to the extreme Central European drought periods in the years 2018 and 2019. The analysis was based on continuous measurements of tree growth, sap flow and meteorological characteristics along a transect of five sites of Tilia cordata and three sites of Robinia pseudoacacia spread over the urban area of Wurzburg, Germany. The biomass increment of both tree species was reduced up to 50 % with respect to normal weather conditions, especially in the extreme drought year 2018. The studied tree species revealed contrasting growth strategies with T. cordata being more prone to droughts than R. pseudoacacia. Under drought conditions R. pseudoacacia showed twice as much carbon sequestration as T. cordata, which means that R. pseudoacacia is much more water use efficient than T. cordata. In drought years the water use efficiency increases up to 4.4 kg (kg H2O)(-1) for R. pseudoacacia, while it remains at 0.83-0.86 kg (kg H2O)(-1) for T. cordata. Whereas both species have shown substantially reduced transpiration rates in both years, T. cordata had a higher transpiration activity than R. pseudoacacia, Hence, T. cordata made a larger contribution to microclimatic cooling in drought and normal years. These findings are systematically depending on the specific sites within the urban area.

AB Objective To explore glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) patterns in 5- to 9-year-olds in the recent-onset period of type 1 diabetes and identify parent psychosocial factors that may predict children's HbA1c trajectory using a prospective, longitudinal design. Research design and methods We measured family demographics and parent psychosocial factors at baseline. We collected HbA1c levels from children every 3 months for up to 30 months. Deriving several features around HbA1c trends, we used k-means clustering to group trajectories and linear and logistic regressions to identify parent psychosocial predictors of children's HbA1c trajectories. Results The final cohort included 106 families (48 boys, mean child age 7.50 +/- 1.35 years and mean diabetes duration 4.71 +/- 3.19 months). We identified four unique HbA1c trajectories in children: high increasing, high stable, intermediate increasing and low stable. Compared to a low stable trajectory, increasing parent-reported hypoglycaemia fear total score was associated with decreased odds of having a high stable or intermediate increasing trajectory. Increasing parent-reported diabetes-specific family conflict total score was associated with increased odds of having a high stable or intermediate increasing trajectory. Conclusions We are the first to identify distinct HbA1c trajectories in 5- to 9-year-olds with recent-onset type 1 diabetes as well as parent psychosocial factors that may predict high stable or increasing trajectories and could represent future treatment targets.

AB Common ground can be mutually established between conversational partners in several ways. We examined whether the modality (visual or linguistic) with which speakers share information with their conversational partners results in memory traces that affect subsequent references addressed to a particular partner. In 32 triads, directors arranged a set of tangram cards with one matcher and then with another, but in different modalities, sharing some cards only linguistically (by describing cards the matcher couldn't see), some only visually (by silently showing them), some both linguistically and visually, and others not at all. Then directors arranged the cards again in separate rounds with each matcher. The modality with which they previously established common ground about a particular card with a particular matcher (e.g., linguistically with one partner and visually with the other) affected subsequent referring: References to cards previously shared only visually included more idea units, words, and reconceptualizations than those shared only linguistically, which in turn included more idea units, words, and reconceptualizations than those shared both linguistically and visually. Moreover, speakers were able to tailor references to the same card appropriately to the distinct modality shared with each addressee. Such gradient, partner-specific adaptation during re-referring suggests that memory encodes rich-enough representations of multimodal shared experiences to effectively cue relevant constraints about the perceptual conditions under which speakers and addressees establish common ground.

AB The world often goes too fast for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to process. We tested the therapeutic effectiveness of input slowing in children with ASD. Over 12 months, 12 children with ASD had weekly speech therapy sessions where stimuli were slowly played on a PC, while 11 age- and level-matched children with ASD had speech therapy using real-time stimuli. At the beginning and end of the study, all participants were assessed on communication, imitation, facial emotion recognition, behavior, and face exploration. Whereas communication and facial emotion recognition improved in both groups, imitation increased, inappropriate behaviors decreased, and time spent fixating mouth and eyes increased solely in the group using slowness. Slowness therapy seems very promising for ASD children.

AB Using a 150-year time series of data on arthropod species richness in Italy, the authors identify the main drivers of assemblage compositional turnover, finding that turnover is highest in locations with rapid changes in precipitation, particularly when human population density also increased rapidly.
   Long-term studies are essential to understand the impacts of global changes on the multiple facets of biological diversity. Here, we use distribution data for over 600 species of arthropods collected over 150 years from locations across Italy and test how multiple environmental stressors (climate, land use and human population density) influenced assemblage composition and functionality. By carefully reconstructing the temporal changes in these stressors, we explicitly tested how environmental changes can determine the observed changes in taxonomic and functional diversity. We found that rapid changes in precipitation destabilize the assemblages and maximize colonization and extinction rates, especially when coupled with changes in human population density (for taxonomy) or temperature (for functionality). Higher microclimatic heterogeneity increases the stability of biodiversity by reducing taxonomic and functional loss. Finally, changes in natural habitats increased colonization, influencing taxonomic nestedness and functional replacement. The integration of long-term datasets combining distributions, climate and traits may deepen our understanding of the processes underlying biodiversity responses to global-scale drivers.

AB Gene duplication is a crucial process involved in the appearance of new genes and functions. It is thought to have played a major role in the growth of enzyme families and the expansion of metabolism at the biosphere's dawn and in recent times. Here, we analyzed paralogous enzyme content within each of the seven enzymatic classes for a representative sample of prokaryotes by a comparative approach. We found a high ratio of paralogs for three enzymatic classes: oxidoreductases, isomerases, and translocases, and within each of them, most of the paralogs belong to only a few subclasses. Our results suggest an intricate scenario for the evolution of prokaryotic enzymes, involving different fates for duplicated enzymes fixed in the genome, where around 20-40% of prokaryotic enzymes have paralogs. Intracellular organisms have a lesser ratio of duplicated enzymes, whereas free-living enzymes show the highest ratios. We also found that phylogenetically close phyla and some unrelated but with the same lifestyle share similar genomic and biochemical traits, which ultimately support the idea that gene duplication is associated with environmental adaptation.

AB The southeastern United States has wide-scale potential to achieve high productivity from elite eastern cottonwood and hybrid poplar varietals to produce renewable bioenergy and bioproducts. In order to determine how environmental drivers impact water use and growth so that individuals can maintain growth during drought periods, varietals that use water efficiently, and/or tolerate water stress conditions, are needed to make planting recommendations across a variety of sites. Additionally, inoculation with nitrogen-fixing endophytic bacteria may improve water stress tolerance. The goals of this research were (1) to determine water use strategies using measurements of diurnal sapflow and differences in leaf retention for three eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides, ST66, S7C8, and 110412) and three hybrid poplar (two P. deltoides x Populus maximowiczii, 6329 and 8019, and one Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides, 5077) varietals on contrasting field sites, (2) determine the physiological impact of endophyte inoculation, and (3) determine which physiological parameters were most highly correlated with aboveground biomass. We found that whole-tree water use efficiency (WUE) was similar across varietals at 5.2 g biomass per kg water used and that water use scaled with tree size. We found that water use strategies in terms of scaled stomatal sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit converged across varietals under stressful soil water conditions at both sites, but that varietals 8019 and 110412 tended to exhibit the highest plasticity in stomatal sensitivity exhibiting the largest range in scaled stomatal sensitivity under different soil moisture conditions. Endophyte inoculation increased growth and stomatal sensitivity at the nitrogen-limited site. Leaf area, whole-tree WUE, and plasticity in stomatal sensitivity were correlated with aboveground biomass production across sites and varietals. Overall, these data can be used to model hydrologic impacts of large-scale Populus biofuel production as well as recommend varietals with efficient water use and stomatal sensitivity under a range of soil and atmospheric moisture stress factors.

AB Studies of domestication genetics enrich our understanding of how domestication shapes genetic and morphological diversity. We characterized patterns of genetic variation in two independently domesticated pumpkins and their wild progenitors to assess and compare genetic consequences of domestication. To compare genetic diversity pre- and post-domestication and to identify genes targeted by selection during domestication, we analyzed similar to 15,000 SNPs of 48 unrelated accessions, including wild, landrace, and improved lines for each of two pumpkin species, Cucurbita argyrosperma and Cucurbita maxima. Genetic diversity relative to its wild progenitor was reduced in only one domesticated subspecies, C. argyrosperma ssp. argyrosperma. The two species have different patterns of genetic structure across domestication status. Only 1.5% of the domestication features identified for both species were shared between species. These findings suggest that ancestral genetic diversity, wild-crop gene flow, and domestication practices shaped the genetic diversity of two similar Cucurbita crops in different ways, adding to our understanding of how genetic diversity changes during the processes of domestication and how trait improvement impacts the breeding potential of modern crops.

AB The seasonal and diel variations of dung beetle species were studied in an Iberian mid-mountain locality to examine the interaction between these two temporal rhythms. We assume that a seasonal variation in the diel activity would support the notion that both rhythms may assist in achieving a quick and flexible response when the climatic conditions change. Data coming from 4,104 pitfall traps placed during 15 sampling periods and totalling 30 daily sampling cycles were analysed using circular statistics and General Linear Models. A wide variety of seasonal patterns are observed, highlighting those species with a clear unimodal or spring-autumn bimodal seasonal pattern. However, a midday diel pattern is the norm in most of the species, except in the case of those exhibiting a high body weight that prefer dusk or night periods. We hypothesize that most of the dung beetle species fly at noon to promote the passive heating of their muscle activity and minimize the metabolic energy expenditure. Results only partially support the seasonal variation in diel activity. Diel preferences are mainly manifested at the time of the year in which the abundance is greater. Approximately two-thirds of the considered species exhibit a similar diel activity along their seasonal active period. As consequence, a significant portion of the dung beetle species currently inhabiting Mediterranean mid-mountains are not able to use the daily variation in climatic conditions to limit the inconveniences of climate change.

AB Feed-forward loops (FFLs) are among the most ubiquitously found motifs of reaction networks in nature. However, little is known about their stochastic behavior and the variety of network phenotypes they can exhibit. In this study, we provide full characterizations of the properties of stochastic multimodality of FFLs, and how switching between different network phenotypes are controlled. We have computed the exact steady-state probability landscapes of all eight types of coherent and incoherent FFLs using the finite-butter Accurate Chemical Master Equation (ACME) algorithm, and quantified the exact topological features of their high-dimensional probability landscapes using persistent homology. Through analysis of the degree of multimodality for each of a set of 10,812 probability landscapes, where each landscape resides over 10(5)-10(6) microstates, we have constructed comprehensive phase diagrams of all relevant behavior of FFL multimodality over broad ranges of input and regulation intensities, as well as different regimes of promoter binding dynamics. In addition, we have quantified the topological sensitivity of the multimodality of the landscapes to regulation intensities. Our results show that with slow binding and unbinding dynamics of transcription factor to promoter, FFLs exhibit strong stochastic behavior that is very different from what would be inferred from deterministic models. In addition, input intensity play major roles in the phenotypes of FFLs: At weak input intensity, FFL exhibit monomodality, but strong input intensity may result in up to 6 stable phenotypes. Furthermore, we found that gene duplication can enlarge stable regions of specific multimodalities and enrich the phenotypic diversity of FFL networks, providing means for cells toward better adaptation to changing environment. Our results are directly applicable to analysis of behavior of FFLs in biological processes such as stem cell differentiation and for design of synthetic networks when certain phenotypic behavior is desired.

AB The paper deals with the analysis of the influences of job satisfaction among Europeans aged 50 + (SHARE-ERIC's data set-Wave7) filtered on main residences and education before 1989. Besides confirming the leading role of the workplace atmosphere and own efforts recognition (dual-core), it further validates the assumption that education and residence in former communist countries count when analyzing job satisfaction and brings two particular types of models. We used many methods based on data mining and variable selection, ordinal and binary logistic and probit regressions, cross-validations via LASSO and mixed-effects modeling with random effects on countries, average marginal effects, and logistic-based prediction nomograms. We discovered seven common influences that count the most when analyzing job satisfaction in these circumstances. It is about the dual-core above and the ones corresponding to older respondents, the better-educated ones (ISCED2011), those with computer skills, the ones endowed with thoroughness, and the ones having higher values of the CASP index of life quality. Depending on each of the two specific models, we discovered peculiarities related to the role of some economic (GDP and SMC to GDP) and institutional (WGI) indicators. For the ex-communist models, we found significant negative influences for both categories while, for non-communist ones, only the second category matters and has a positive role.

AB Background Cost-effectiveness models in Parkinson's disease often include health states based on Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) and time in 'off'. Few studies have investigated utilities in these health states. Objective The aim of this study was firstly to explore utilities in health states based on H&Y and off-time, and secondly to investigate to what extent H&Y and off-time correlated with EQ-5D dimensions. Methods Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease in the National Parkinson's Disease Patient Registry (PARKreg) in Sweden with observations of EQ-5D-3L, H&Y and off-time were included. Correlations with EQ-5D dimensions were analyzed. The relationship between the EQ-5D-3L and H&Y and off-time were estimated by a linear mixed-model with random intercept. Results Among patients in PARKreg, 1823 observations fulfilled inclusion criteria. The dimensions 'self-care', 'mobility' and 'usual activities' correlated moderately with H&Y (r(s) = 0.45, r(s) = 0.46, r(s) = 0.45). Weak correlations were found for 'anxiety/depression' and 'pain/discomfort' (r(s) = 0.24, r(s) = 0.22) (p values < 0.001). All dimensions correlated weakly with off-time. The fitted model included H&Y, time in 'off', and sex. All H&Y stages were found to be significant and had large and monotonous impact on EQ-5D. Off-time was not significant, but improved the model goodness of fit. Predicted values ranged from 0.733 to - 0.106. Conclusion This study provides utilities for health states reflecting the current modeling practice of interventions targeting motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Future research should investigate patient utilities in health states that also capture non-motor symptoms of the disease, as the management of and options for treatments targeting these symptoms increases.

TI Kinetics modeling, thermodynamics and thermal performance assessments of
   pyrolytic decomposition of Moringa oleifera husk and Delonix regia pod
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB A non-isothermal decomposition of Moringa oleifera husk and Delonix regia seed pod was carried out in an N-2 pyrolytic condition with the primary objective of undertaking the kinetics modeling, thermodynamics and thermal performance analyses of the identified samples. Three different isoconversional models, namely, differential Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, and Starink techniques were utilized for the deduction of the kinetics data. The thermodynamic parameters were deduced from the kinetic data based on a first-order chemical reaction model. In the kinetics study, a strong correlation (R-2>0.9) was observed throughout the conversion range for all the kinetic models. The activation energy profiles showed two distinctive regions. In the first region, the average activation energy values were relatively higher-a typical example is in the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa technique-MH (199 kJ/mol) and RP (194 kJ/mol), while in the second region, MH (292 kJ/mol) and RP (234 kJ/mol). It was also demonstrated that the thermal process for the samples experienced endothermic reactions thought the conversion range. In summary, both the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters vary significantly with conversion-underscoring the complexity associated with the thermal conversion of lignocellulosic biomass samples.

AB Analysing social networks is challenging. Key features of relational data require the use of non-standard statistical methods such as developing system-specific null, or reference, models that randomize one or more components of the observed data. Here we review a variety of randomization procedures that generate reference models for social network analysis. Reference models provide an expectation for hypothesis testing when analysing network data. We outline the key stages in producing an effective reference model and detail four approaches for generating reference distributions: permutation, resampling, sampling from a distribution, and generative models. We highlight when each type of approach would be appropriate and note potential pitfalls for researchers to avoid. Throughout, we illustrate our points with examples from a simulated social system. Our aim is to provide social network researchers with a deeper understanding of analytical approaches to enhance their confidence when tailoring reference models to specific research questions.

AB Aim Root traits play important roles in plant growth and ecosystem processes. Clarifying the primary drivers of variation in root traits is indispensable for understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Location China. Taxon Seed plant species. Methods We compiled six key first-order root traits of 437 seed plant species from different biomes, phylogenetic affiliations, plant growth forms and mycorrhizal types in China. The six root traits included root diameter (RD), root tissue density (RTD), specific root length (SRL), root C content (RCC), root N content (RNC) and root C:N ratio (RCN), which are highly relevant for plant growth rate and resource acquisition. The phylogenetic linear mixed model was employed to examine the effects of climate and soil variables on root traits and to quantify the relative contributions of environment, phylogeny, plant growth form and mycorrhizal type to root trait variation. Results Environment explained most of the variations in RTD and RCC (37.4% and 24.2%, respectively). Mean precipitation of the wettest quarter and mean diurnal temperature range were the main climate drivers of RTD and RCC, respectively. Phylogeny contributed the most to the variation in RD, RNC and RCN (27.0%-52.3%). SRL showed strong links to both environment and phylogeny (35.0% and 27.8%, respectively). However, plant growth form and mycorrhizal type had little effect on root trait variation (<6.0%). Main conclusions Our study revealed the primary drivers of variations in different root traits of seed plants in China. Climate variability and seasonality variables were more important factors driving root trait variation than the annual averages of temperature and precipitation. Incorporating the different responses of root traits to changing environments and phylogenetic affiliations observed in the present study into terrestrial ecosystem models will improve our ability to predict future vegetation distribution and ecosystem functions under global change.

AB Anthropogenic climate change ( CC) is affecting a wide range of ecosystems and species, modifying current biodiversity patterns, and increasing the risk of extinction for many species. To address this threat, identifying, managing and protecting climate refugia has been suggested as an approach to incorporate CC into systematic conservation planning. In this study, we applied a detailed Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) approach with the Maximum Entropy Algorithm to assess the potential effects of CC on the distribution of climatic suitability for Saguinus leucopus and Saguinus oedipus. These two species were investigated to identify climate refugia, and to assess the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PAs). Correlative models were generated with presence records, and bioclimatic variables describing recent (similar to 2000) and future (similar to 2050) climates, with data from two Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), describing moderate (RCP 4.5) and extreme (RCP 8.5) climate change scenarios. For both species, moderate and extreme CC scenarios resulted in expansion of climatic suitability. Refugia models, through the overlapping of GCMs, indicated that 88% and 82% of the recent climate suitability may act as refugia for S. leucopus and S. oedipus. Greater variation was found coming from GCM selection than from RCPs. Regions of exposure to climatic novelties were identified for both species. Results suggest that climate refugia for these species are critically under-protected, as only 5.7% and 9.9% respectively, coincide with current PAs. Finally, PAs that are playing an important role in preserving climate refugia for these species are mentioned.

AB The lack of organic matter content in deteriorated soils in drought stricken areas is a serious problem for vegetation cover. The use of organic amendments like biochar and compost to agricultural soils could be a good remedy for poor soil, water deficiency and plants growth. The comparative analysis of the effects of biochar produced from argan shells, compost and their mixture on the growth of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) was the main objective of this research. It was assumed that the addition of biochar mixed with compost could enhance soil fertility and then improve crop productivity of plants. For this purpose, three treatments (2%, 4% and 6%) of biochar (B), compost (C) and biochar-compost (B-C) mixture were applied to soil. The samples for different treatments were collected, incubated and then analyzed. In order to evaluate the plant growth, the greenhouse experiments were conducted for three months in the pots filled with untreated and treated soils. The results showed that the addition of biochar and compost to soil increased pH, electrical conductivity, exchangeable cations, total nitrogen, phosphorus, total organic matter and cation exchange capacity. A significant improvement of the biomass of plants has been observed when applying a mixture of biochar and compost at 6% for quinoa and sugar beet and at 4% for alfalfa. According to the obtained results, mixing argan biochar with compost has a positive impact on soil nutrients and growth of plants.

AB Objectives: "Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2016" provides guidelines in regard to prompt management and resuscitation of sepsis or septic shock. The study is aimed to assess the robustness of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that formulate these guidelines in terms of fragility index and reverse fragility index.
   Method: RCTs that contributed to these guidelines having parallel two-group design, 1:1 allocation ratio, and at least one dichotomous outcome were included in the study. The median fragility index was calculated for RCTs with significant statistical outcomes, whereas the median reverse fragility index was calculated for RCTs with nonsignificant statistical results.
   Results: Hundred RCTs that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The median fragility index was 5.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1-30] and median reverse fragility index was 13 (95% CI 12.07-16.8) at a p value of 0.05. The median reverse fragility index was 16 (95% CI 10-26) at a p value of 0.01. Most of the RCTs included in this analysis were of good quality, having a median Jadad score of 6.
   Conclusion: This analysis found that the surviving sepsis guidelines were based on highly robust RCTs with statistically insignificant results and on some moderately robust RCTs with statistically significant results. RCTs with statistically insignificant results were more robust than RCTs with statistically significant results in regard to these

AB Judgments about the self compared to internalized standards are central to theoretical frameworks of social anxiety. Yet, empirical research on social comparisons-how people view themselves relative to others-and social anxiety is sparse. This research program examines the nature of everyday social comparisons in the context of social anxiety across 2 experience-sampling studies containing 8,396 unique entries from 273 adults. Hypotheses and analyses were preregistered with the Open Science Foundation (OSF) prior to data analysis. Study 1 was a 3-week daily diary study with undergraduates, and Study 2 was a 2-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study with a clinical sample of adults diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and a psychologically healthy comparison group. In both studies, social anxiety was associated with less favorable, more unstable social comparisons. In both studies, favorable social comparisons were associated with higher positive affect and lower negative affect and social anxiety. In both studies, social comparisons and momentary affect/social anxiety were more strongly linked in people with elevated trait social anxiety/SAD compared to less socially anxious participants. Participants in Study 2-even those with SAD-made more favorable social comparisons when they were with other people than when alone. Taken together, results suggest that social anxiety is associated with unfavorable, unstable self-views that are linked to compromised well-being.

AB The paper aims to emphasize the advantages of several advanced statistical and data mining techniques when applied to the dense literature on corruption measurements and determinants. For this purpose, we used all seven waves of the World Values Survey and we employed the Naive Bayes technique in SQL Server Analysis Services 2016, the LASSO package together with logit and melogit regressions with raw coefficients in Stata 16. We further conducted different types of tests and cross-validations on the wave, country, gender, and age categories. For eliminating multicollinearity, we used predictor correlation matrices. Moreover, we assessed the maximum computed variance inflation factor (VIF) against a maximum acceptable threshold, depending on the model's R squared in Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regressions. Our main contribution consists of a methodology for exploring and validating the most important predictors of the risk associated with bribery tolerance. We found the significant role of three influences corresponding to questions about attitudes towards the property, authority, and public services, and other people in terms of anti-cheating, anti-evasion, and anti-violence. We used scobit, probit, and logit regressions with average marginal effects to build and test the index based on these attitudes. We successfully tested the index using also risk prediction nomograms and accuracy measurements (AUCROC > 0.9).

AB The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) plots have been widely used to evaluate the performance of species distribution models. Plotting the ROC/PR curves requires a traditional test set with both presence and absence data (namely PA approach), but species absence data are usually not available in reality. Plotting the ROC/PR curves from presence-only data while treating background data as pseudo absence data (namely PO approach) may provide misleading results. In this study, we propose a new approach to calibrate the ROC/PR curves from presence and background data with user-provided information on a constant c, namely PB approach. Here, c defines the probability that species occurrence is detected (labeled), and an estimate of c can also be derived from the PB-based ROC/PR plots given that a model with good ability of discrimination is available. We used five virtual species and a real aerial photography to test the effectiveness of the proposed PB-based ROC/PR plots. Different models (or classifiers) were trained from presence and background data with various sample sizes. The ROC/PR curves plotted by PA approach were used to benchmark the curves plotted by PO and PB approaches. Experimental results show that the curves and areas under curves by PB approach are more similar to that by PA approach as compared with PO approach. The PB-based ROC/PR plots also provide highly accurate estimations of c in our experiment. We conclude that the proposed PB-based ROC/PR plots can provide valuable complements to the existing model assessment methods, and they also provide an additional way to estimate the constant c (or species prevalence) from presence and background data.

AB An increase in frequency, intensity and duration of drought events affects forested ecosystems. Trees react to these changes by adjusting stomatal conductance to maximize the trade-off between carbon gains and water losses. A better understanding of the consequences of these drought-induced physiological adjustments for tree growth could help inferring future productivity potentials of boreal forests. Here, we used samples from a forest inventory network in Canada where a decline in growth rates of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) occurred in 1988-1992, an exceptionally dry period, to verify if this growth decline resulted from physiological adjustments of trees to drought. We measured carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in growth rings of 95 spruces and 49 pines spanning 1985-1993. We used C-13 discrimination (Delta C-13) and O-18 enrichment (Delta O-18) as proxies for intrinsic water use efficiency and stomatal conductance, respectively. We studied how inter-annual variability in isotopic signals was linked to climate moisture index, vapor pressure deficit and annual snowfall amount. We found significantly lower Delta C-13 values over 1988-1990, and significantly higher Delta O-18 values in 1988-1989 and 1991 compared to the 1985-1993 averages. We also observed that a low climatic water balance and a high vapor pressure deficit were linked with low Delta C-13 and high Delta O-18 in the two study species, in parallel with low growth rates. The latter effect persisted into the year following drought for black spruce, but not for jack pine. These findings highlight that small differences in physiological parameters between species could translate into large differences in post-drought recovery. The stronger and longer lasting impact on black spruce compared to jack pine suggests a less efficient carbon use and a lower acclimation potential to future warmer and drier climate conditions.

AB The survival of forest tree species within certain areas of their distributions is in question due to the increasing occurrence of disturbances and degradation processes in forest ecosystems due to climate change. The aim of this paper is to predict changes in the spatial distribution of the ten most important tree species in Serbia (European beech, Pedunculate oak, Austrian oak, Hungarian oak, Sessile oak, Narrow-leafed ash, Silver fir, Norway spruce, Black and Scots pine) using climate indices (Forestry Aridity Index, FAI and Ellenberg Quotient, EQ) with up-to-date climate observations (E-OBS, covering the time period 1990-2019) and projections of future climate conditions (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, split into two time periods 2041-2070, 2071-2100). The computation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves has shown that both FAI and EQ have a "fair" to "excellent" ability to predict the occurrence of five out of ten species (European beech, Silver fir, Norway spruce, Black and Scots pine), with EQ having a slightly better predicting ability. EQ-based projections from mid (2041-2070) to late 21st century (2071-2100) under RCP 4.5 predict that reduction rates will not exceed 25%. Similar reduction rates are given by FAI-based projections until 2070, while rates increase to approximately 35% towards the end of this century. For RCP 8.5, FAI-based projections are significantly worse than EQ-based projections. Irrespective of the used index, projections until 2070 suggest that 55-75% of existing habitats will remain intact. Towards the end of the century, however, our analysis indicate that 75-85% (EQ) to 90-100% (FAI) of the five analyzed species habitats, will be found outside of their current climate space.

AB Tetrastigma loheri (Vitaceae) is a vine species native to Borneo and the Philippines. Because it is a commonly encountered forest species in the Philippines, T. loheri is potentially suitable for studying patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity among fragmented forest ecosystems in various parts of this country. However, previous research suggests that T. loheri is part of a species complex in the Philippines (i.e. the T. loheri s. l. complex) that potentially also contains Philippine plants identified as T. diepenhorstii, T. philippinense, T. stenophyllum, and T. trifoliolatum. This uncertainty about its taxonomic delimitation can make it challenging to draw conclusions that are relevant to conservation from genetic studies using this species. Here, we tested the hypothesis that T. loheri s. l. is composed of more than one species in the Philippines. For this, we used generalized mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) and Poisson tree process (PTP) species delimitation models to identify clades within DNA sequence phylogenies of T. loheri s. l. that might constitute species within this complex. Although these methods identified several putative species, these are statistically poorly supported and subsequent random forest analyses using a geometric morphometric leaf shape dataset and several other vegetative characters did not result in the identification of characters that can be used to discriminate these putative species morphologically. Furthermore, the results of principal component and principal coordinates analyses of these data suggest the absence of morphological discontinuities within the species complex. Under a unified species concept that uses phylogenetic and morphological distinction as operational criteria for species recognition, we therefore conclude that the currently available data do not support recognizing multiple species in the T. loheri s. l. complex. This implies that T. loheri is best considered as a single, morphologically variable species when used for studying patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity in the Philippines.

AB Plastic tree shelters are commonly used in plantations under Mediterranean climates to protect against herbivory and enhance outplanting performance. However, effects on outplanting performance cannot be generalized due to the complexity of plant responses to microenvironmental conditions within the tube wall. The interactions between the light transmissivity of the tubes and species-specific responses to light and site environment on two-year outplanting performance were studied in two species with contrasting shade tolerance planted inside tree shelters with four different light transmissivities and a non-tree shelter control at two Mediterranean sites with contrasting rainfall and temperature. In general, increasing light transmissivity enhanced biomass accumulation, suggesting that the use of clear tubes might be advisable. However, the shade-tolerant Q. ilex did not benefit from the greater light transmissivity in the most arid site, indicating that the positive effect of clear tubes depends on water stress experienced by seedlings, which ultimately is determined by drought resistance strategies and site conditions. The growth of both species and survival of P. halepensis were higher within clear tubes in the continental site than in unsheltered plants, which suggests that factors other than light, such as warmer daytime temperatures or the prevention of dust deposition, can explain this beneficial site-dependent effect of tree shelters. In conclusion, our results confirm the hypothesis that the effect of tree shelter and its light transmission on outplanting performance is site and species-specific, but further research is needed to identify the effect of other effects not related to light transmission.

AB Neophobia (the fearful reaction to novel stimuli or situations) has a crucial effect on individual fitness and can vary within and across species. However, the factors predicting this variation are still unclear. In this study, we assessed whether individual characteristics (rank, social integration, sex) and species socio-ecological characteristics (dietary breadth, group size, domestication) predicted variation in neophobia. For this purpose, we conducted behavioral observations and experimental tests on 78 captive individuals belonging to 10 different ungulate species-an ideal taxon to study inter-specific variation in neophobia given their variety in socio-ecological characteristics. Individuals were tested in their social groups by providing them with familiar food, half of which had been positioned close to a novel object. We monitored the individual latency to approach and eat food and the proportion of time spent in its proximity. Using a phylogenetic approach and social network analyses, we showed that across ungulate species neophobia was higher in socially more integrated individuals, as compared to less integrated ones. In contrast, rank and sex did not predict inter-individual differences in neophobia. Moreover, species differed in their levels of neophobia, with Barbary sheep being on average less neophobic than all the other study species. As group size in Barbary sheep was larger than in all the other study species, these results support the hypothesis that larger group size predicts lower levels of neophobia, and confirm ungulates as a highly promising taxon to study animal behavior and cognition with a comparative perspective. Significance statement In several species, individuals may respond fearfully to novel stimuli, therefore reducing the risks they may face. However, it is yet unclear if certain individuals or species respond more fearfully to novelty. Here, we provided food to 78 individual ungulates with different characteristics (e.g., sex, rank, social integration, group size, domestication, dietary breadth) in different controlled conditions (e.g., when food was close to novel or to familiar objects). Across species, we found that socially integrated individuals responded more fearfully in all species. Moreover, being in larger groups decreased the probability of fearfully responding to novelty.

AB Key message Native Fraxinus ornus cohabits with the alien invasive species Ailanthus altissima. This work aims to give an insight into the distinction of functional traits, which relate to species invasiveness. Fraxinus ornus cohabits with the alien species Ailanthus altissima, which is invasive throughout Europe and North America. This work studied ecophysiological response of two cohabiting species and their leaf and bark traits to contribute to understanding A. altissima invasiveness. We compared the radiation-use and water-use efficiency following 6 months of good water supply as opposed to a pronounced water shortage in two cohabiting species. Leaf anatomical properties were studied, and their differences in leaf and bark biochemical and optical properties were examined. The two species differed significantly in leaf morphology, but less so for leaf biochemistry. This latter differed more in comparison from two precipitation levels within the same species. Compared to F. ornus, the A. altissima leaves were thicker, with thicker epidermal and palisade layers, and less numerous, but larger, stomata. A. altissima had higher effective photochemical efficiency and maintained a more favourable water potential despite higher stomatal conductance with high precipitation, meanwhile there were no significant differences of ecophysiological responses in low precipitation. There were only small differences between the two species for the leaf optical properties, while they differed significantly for the bark optical properties. We show that pigments have an important role in defining bark reflectance, and that differences in bark spectral signatures provide a basis for the distinction between these two species for remote sensing.

AB Technologies for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere have been recognized as an important part of limiting warming to well below 2 degrees C called for in the Paris Agreement. However, many scenarios so far rely on bioenergy in combination with carbon capture and storage as the only CDR technology. Various other options have been proposed, but have scarcely been taken up in an integrated assessment of mitigation pathways. In this study we analyze a comprehensive portfolio of CDR options in terms of their regional and temporal deployment patterns in climate change mitigation pathways and the resulting challenges. We show that any CDR option with sufficient potential can reduce the economic costs of achieving the 1.5 degrees C target substantially without increasing the temperature overshoot. CDR helps to reduce net CO2 emissions faster and achieve carbon neutrality earlier. The regional distribution of CDR deployment in cost-effective mitigation pathways depends on which options are available. If only enhanced weathering of rocks on croplands or re- and afforestation are available, Latin America and Asia cover nearly all of global CDR deployment. Besides fairness and sustainability concerns, such a regional concentration would require large international transfers and thus strong international institutions. In our study, the full portfolio scenario is the most balanced from a regional perspective. This indicates that different CDR options should be developed such that all regions can contribute according to their regional potentials.

AB Partial migration, whereby a population comprises multiple behavioural phenotypes that each have varying tendencies to migrate, is common among many animals. Determining the mechanisms by which these phenotypes are maintained is important for understanding their roles in population structure and stability. The aim here was to test for the temporal and spatial consistency of migratory phenotypes in a common bream Abramis brama ('bream') population, and then determine their social preferences and extent of mixing across three successive annual spawning periods. The study applied passive acoustic telemetry to track the movements of bream in the River Bure system of the Norfolk Broads, a lowland wetland comprising highly connected riverine and lacustrine habitats. Analyses revealed that individual migratory phenotype was highly consistent across the 3 years, but this was not predicted by fish sex or length at tagging. During the annual spawning periods, network analyses identified off-channel areas visited by both resident and migrant fish that, in non-spawning periods, were relatively independent in their space use. Within these sites, the co-occurrence of bream was non-random, with individuals forming more preferred associations than expected by chance. These associations were not strongly predicted by similarity in fish length, sex or behavioural phenotype, indicating that the resident and migrant phenotypes mixed during their annual spawning periods. The results suggested these different phenotypes, with spatially distinct resource use in non-spawning periods, comprised a single population, with this having important implications for the management of this wetland resource.

AB Biochar application has been widely recommended as a potential solution to tackle the challenges of food security and climate change in agroecosystems, but the effect sizes of biochar application on crop yield, soil carbon sequestration, and global warming potential (GWP) shows great uncertainties. To explore the effect variation of biochar application alone (B) and biochar combined with chemical fertilizers (BF) on crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), and GWP, this study reviewed updated datasets with 455, 131, and 95 independent experiments globally to identify the key factors influencing the responses of crop yield, SOC, and GWP to B and BF, respectively. Overall, the effect sizes were different between B and BF in both improving crop yield (15.1 % and 48.4 %, respectively) and decreasing GWP (27.1 % and 14.3 %, respectively), whereas there were almost no differences in terms of increasing SOC (32.9 % and 34.8 %, respectively). In addition, the effect sizes of B and BF on crop yield were coupled with these on SOC. Increased biochar carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio) and soil pH decreased the impact of B and BF on crop yield, while increased SOC promoted the impact of BF on crop yield. The effect size on GWP increased with biochar pH increasing but soil pH decreasing under B and BF. The wetness index, soil properties (SOC, pH, and clay), and biochar properties (type, pH, C:N ratio, and application rate) jointly explained 70 %-79 %, 90 %-93 %, and 70 %-97 % of the effect variations in crop yield, SOC, and GWP, respectively. The biochar C:N ratio and soil pH were the most important factors determining the effect size of biochar application on crop yield, SOC, and GWP. Taken together, biochar application is a tripartite win-win solution for improving crop yield, increasing SOC, and decreasing GWP mainly depending on biochar properties and soil pH.

AB With a unique biogeophysical signature relative to other freshwater sources, meltwater from glaciers plays a crucial role in the hydrological and ecological regime of high latitude coastal areas. Today, as glaciers worldwide exhibit persistent negative mass balance, glacier runoff is changing in both magnitude and timing, with potential downstream impacts on infrastructure, ecosystems, and ecosystem resources. However, runoff trends may be difficult to detect in coastal systems with large precipitation variability. Here, we use the coupled energy balance and water routing model SnowModel-HydroFlow to examine changes in timing and magnitude of runoff from the western Juneau Icefield in Southeast Alaska between 1980 and 2016. We find that under sustained glacier mass loss (-0.57 +/- 0.12 m w. e. a(-1)), several hydrological variables related to runoff show increasing trends. This includes annual and spring glacier ice melt volumes (+10% and +16% decade(-1)) which, because of higher proportions of precipitation, translate to smaller increases in glacier runoff (+3% and +7% decade(-1)) and total watershed runoff (+1.4% and +3% decade(-1)). These results suggest that the western Juneau Icefield watersheds are still in an increasing glacier runoff period prior to reaching "peak water." In terms of timing, we find that maximum glacier ice melt is occurring earlier (2.5 days decade(-1)), indicating a change in the source and quality of freshwater being delivered downstream in the early summer. Our findings highlight that even in maritime climates with large precipitation variability, high latitude coastal watersheds are experiencing hydrological regime change driven by ongoing glacier mass loss.

AB Evolutionary relatedness may hinder stable coexistence due to similar niches and nonlinear responses to competition. The mechanisms driving stability may respond differently to phylogenetic distance. Related species may be synchronic (have similar demographic responses over time), affecting fluctuation-dependent mechanisms: the storage effect should destabilize coexistence, and relative nonlinearity should be stronger due to increased fluctuations in competition. We tested these hypotheses using invasion analysis based on a model parameterized for 19 plant species from a semiarid grassland. Although weakly, coexistence stability increased with phylogenetic distance. Stabilization through fluctuation-independent niche differentiation was stronger between distant relatives as a result of weaker competition. Synchronicity was higher between close relatives, having the expected negative effects on the storage effect's contribution to coexistence. Relative nonlinearity was strong at both ends of the phylogenetic relatedness gradient but not in the middle. This may be the result of different nonlinear responses between distant relatives and of stronger fluctuations in competition due to synchronicity between closer relatives. The effect of phylogenetic distance on coexistence was almost negligible when pairwise species were analyzed, in accordance with previous research. Phylogenetic distance became more important as more species interacted, however, suggesting that evolutionary relatedness may be influential in species-rich communities.

AB Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of TDFs in South America: the Amazonian TDF hypothesis and the Pleistocene Arc hypothesis (PAH). There is a need to evaluate the distribution patterns of different organisms across the TDF distribution. We tested the following hypotheses: the species composition is determined by historical-evolutionary events, and therefore, the TDFs have a similar species composition as predicted by the PAH. Alternatively, the species composition is determined by recent ecological processes, and therefore, the TDFs have a sharing of species to their respective adjacent dominant habitat, with no support for the PAH. We expect that climatic factors drive the species richness, abundance and species dissimilarity (beta-diversity) between TDFs and adjacent habitats across the latitudinal gradient. We sampled dung beetles across six Brazilian states in TDF fragments and adjacent dominant habitats and obtained the climatic conditions across the gradient. We used the beta-diversity partition and generalised linear models to test our hypotheses. We sampled 8,625 dung beetles representing 102 species. Sorensen dissimilarity was higher among TDFs than between TDFs and adjacent habitats and was mostly due to the substitution of species. Annual mean temperature had a positive effect on abundance in TDFs but did not affect species richness. Species substitution (Podani's approach) between TDFs and adjacent habitats decreased with mean diurnal range of temperature, while nestedness patterns (Baselga's approach) increased with annual precipitation. Depending on the approach used (Baselga's vs. Podani's), we can obtain different results across the latitudinal gradient. The composition and structure of dung beetle assemblages in TDFs are mostly determined by more recent regional-to-local ecological processes since each TDF has a unique evolutionary history and a different dung beetle species composition. Our results do not support the Pleistocene Arc hypothesis. Abstract in portuguese is available with online material

AB Construction industry spending in July 2020 was $1.3 trillion indicating significant growth in construction spending in the USA. This sector's growth can be attributed to strategic decisions of various organizations on broadening their company's footprint into new markets. Such decisions require comprehension of job markets for successful expansion. This study focuses on utilizing post-occupancy evaluation of the quality of work on construction coating projects across the USA to understand the relationship between different regions and states and strategy to expand into new job markets. Network analysis utilized data from over two thousand owners collected over a period of four years. The study provides insights for construction-coating projects in relation to mobilization and footprint expansion. Specifically, the correlation of customer satisfaction for construction-coating contractors known as applicators working across the USA and understanding the relationship between region and states. The analysis identifies regions where jobs are performed by applicators from another region, highlighting business opportunities in the different regions across USA, while identifying poorly connected states. This study paves the way for future works that understand the footprint and connections with other states, especially for other trade applicators in the construction industry.

AB The nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) transcription factor (TF) family consists of three subfamilies NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC. Many studies have proven that NF-Y complex plays multiple essential roles in stress response in Arabidopsis and other plant species. However, little attention has been given to these genes in peanut. In this study, thirty-three AhNF-Y genes were identified in cultivated peanut and they were distributed on 16 chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis of the NF-Y amino acid sequences indicated that the peanut NF-Y proteins were clustered in pairs at the end of the branches and showed high conservation with previous reported plant NF-Ys. Evolutionary history analysis showed that only segmental duplication contributed to expansion of this gene family. Analysis of the 1500-bp regulatory regions upstream the start codon showed that, except for AhNF-YB6, peanut NF-Ys contained at least one abiotic stress response element in their regulatory region. Expression patterns of peanut NF-Ys in 22 tissues and developmental stages were analyzed. A few NF-Ys showed universal expression patterns, while most NF-Ys showed specific expression patterns. Through RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analyses, expression of six AhNF-Y genes was induced under salt stress in leaves or roots. In addition, AhNF-YA4/8/11, NF-YB4 and NF-YC2/8 also responded to osmotic stress, ABA (abscisic acid) and salicylic acid (SA) treatment.

AB The expansion and intensification of agricultural lands (i.e., croplands and pasture areas) have become increasing threats to species diversity around the world. However, genus diversity should be considered for biodiversity conservation due to the important role that phylogenetic diversity and evolutionary history play shaping biodiversity patterns, particularly in the Neotropics, the most species-rich realm. Here, we explored agricultural land effects on distribution patterns of terrestrial vertebrate diversity at the genus level using cases from the Neotropics. We compiled distribution data on genera of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles and explored the effects of agricultural lands on genus diversity distribution patterns for terrestrial vertebrates in the region using distribution modelling. Geography Weighting Regression (GWR) was used to explore the spatially variable relationship between agricultural lands and genus diversity. We found that there are significant, nonstationary relationships between agricultural lands and genus diversity in the Neotropics. The non-stationary relationship between croplands and genus diversity was stronger than that between pasture areas and genus diversity. Furthermore, these effects may depend on changes in genus groups (i.e., amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles) and biomes. The relationship was the strongest for the croplands and reptile diversity pair at the genus levels. The relationship between both croplands and pasture areas and reptile diversity was the largest in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. Given the influence of crop and pasturelands on vertebrate distribution patterns, we argue that agriculture development should be considered in the spatial prioritization of conservation for vertebrates in the Neotropics. Agricultural lands should be used as environmental variables for distribution modelling, and understanding the impacts of agricultural lands on biodiversity is critical for effective conservation management in the Neotropics.

AB The green odorous frog (Odorrana margaretae) displays a circular distribution around the Sichuan Basin of western China and possesses multiple replicate hybrid zones between lineages with high levels of divergence. To gain an understanding of the speciation process, we obtained 1540 SNPs from 29 populations and 227 individuals using ddRAD sequencing. Population structure analysis revealed three groups within the species: the West, North & South, and East groups. Demographic inference showed that they were initially isolated at similar to 2 million years ago, and subsequent post-glacial expansion produced the current circular distribution with four secondary contact zones. Hybridization in those zones involved lineages with various levels of divergence and produced greatly different patterns of introgression. Contact zones between the East and North & South groups (E-S and E-N) had contrast admixture levels but both showed a general lack of potential barrier loci. Meanwhile, the reconnection of the West and North & South groups produced two contact zones along the rim of the Basin. The S-W zone had extensive admixture while the N-W zone had limited admixture within a narrow geographic distance. Both showed substantial barrier effects, and a large number of potential barrier loci were shared. We also detected strong coupling among these loci. The N-W hybrid zone involved two highly-diverged lineages (F-ST = 0.704) and many loci have reached fixation around the hybrid zone. This study system offers a unique opportunity to understand the dynamics of introgression in contact zones and the architecture of reproductive isolation at different stages of speciation.

AB Phenotypic polymorphism within a species is a notable phenomenon in evolutionary biology to understand the process of adaptive speciation and other historical events. The Saxifraga fortunei complex is a widespread herb found in East Asia. It includes several ecotypic taxa corresponding to their habitat environments. The distribution of the various ecotypes in a limited area of the Japanese Archipelago makes the species a suitable model to investigate the impact of population demographic history and natural selection on lineage diversification. Here, Sanger-based sequencing was used to estimate the divergence timeframe between populations of the Eurasian continent and Japan. Genome-wide SNPs obtained by ddRAD sequencing were used to investigate the phylogeographic origins of ecotypic taxa. The phylogenetic analyses revealed the divergence of the Japanese population from the continental population in the late Miocene. Two distinct regional clades of North and South Japan were identified; phenotypic diversification was evident only in the southern clade. The South Japan clades displayed a historical distribution expansion from north to south. The phenotypic variations appeared to have generated during the expansion. The ecotypic boundaries were incongruent with the genetic grouping. We propose that morphological and ecological specialization in Japanese populations was repeatedly generated by local natural selection.

AB Unprecedented increases in agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in recent years have caused substantial environmental pollution that leads to ozone depletion and global warming. Application of biochar and/or nitrification inhibitors (NIs) has the potential to reduce N2O emissions; however, it is not clear how biochar application may affect the efficacy of NI in reducing nitrification rates, soil enzyme activities, and N2O emissions under different soil moisture regimes. We conducted a 60-day laboratory incubation experiment to study the effects of manure biochar and nitrapyrin (as a NI) on N2O emissions from a urea fertilized soil with either 60 (low) or 80% (high) water-filled pore space (WFPS). Nitrification rates were significantly affected by biochar x NI x WFPS and biochar x WFPS interactions. Biochar initially increased and then decreased the rates, resulting in 45.2 and 26.6% (P < 0.001 for both) overall reductions in low and high WFPS, respectively while NI reduced the rates only in the first 10 days at 60% WFPS. Biochar decreased (P < 0.001) and NI increased (P = 0.007) beta-1,4-N-acetyl glucosaminidase activities while urease activities were increased (P < 0.001) by biochar across WFPS. Biochar had significant interaction with NI in cumulative N2O emissions with the efficacy of NI being reduced when co-applied with biochar. Cumulative N2O emissions were greater at high than at low WFPS; the emissions were decreased by biochar at 60% WFPS and NI at both 60 and 80% WFPS. We conclude that biochar reduces efficacy of nitrapyrin in mitigating N2O emissions and their effects on net nitrification rates, enzyme activities and N2O emissions are dependent on soil moisture level.

AB Accidents on power lines are the leading cause of mortality for many raptor species. In order to prioritise corrective measures, much effort has been focused on identifying the factors associated with collision and electrocution risk. However, most studies lack of precise data about the use of pylons and its underlying driving factors, often relying on biased information based on recorded fatalities. Here, we used multiple years of high-resolution data from 49-GPS tagged Canarian Egyptian Vultures (Neophron percnopterus majorensis) to overcome these typical biases. Birds of our target population use electric pylons extensively for perching (diurnal) and roosting (nocturnal), so accidents with these infrastructures are nowadays the main cause of mortality. Predictive models of pylon intensity of use were fitted for diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, accounting for power line, environmental, and individual vulture's features. Using these measures as a proxy for mortality risk, our model predictions were validated with out-of-sample data of actual mortality recorded during 17 years. Vultures used more pylons during daytime, but those chosen at night were used more intensively. In both time periods, the intensity of use of pylons was determined by similar drivers: vultures avoided pylons close to roads and territories of conspecifics, preferentially used pylons located in areas with higher abundance of food resources, and spread their use during the breeding season. Individuals used pylons unevenly according to their sex, age, and territorial status, indicating that site-specific mitigation measures may affect different fractions of the population. Our modelling procedures predicted actual mortality reasonably well, showing that prioritising mitigation measures on relatively few pylons (6%) could drastically reduce accidents (50%). Our findings demonstrate that combining knowledge on fine-scale individual behaviour and pylon type and distribution is key to target cost-effective conservation actions aimed at effectively reducing avian mortality on power lines.

AB Numerous species of cetaceans have been recorded in mixed-species groups (MSGs). By forming groups with individuals of different species, cetaceans may reduce predation risk, improve foraging, and gain social benefits. Most accounts of cetacean MSGs, however, are descriptive and little is known about their functions. Furthermore, research has been hindered by inconsistent use of terminology and the lack of a conceptual framework to guide investigations. We reviewed the cetacean literature to compare how MSGs have been termed and defined, to assess their characteristics, to evaluate what is known about their potential functions, and to provide directions for future study. In total, we reviewed 203 studies reporting observations of cetacean MSGs. These MSGs involved 54 different species, predominantly delphinids, that formed 216 different species pairs with varied morphologies and levels of relatedness. Cetacean MSGs occurred across the globe, from tropical to cold temperate seas, from shallow coastal waters to the open ocean, and varied in characteristics such as group size and frequency of occurrence. Only 27 of the reviewed studies proposed and discussed the potential functions of cetacean MSGs, suggesting reduced predation risk (5 species pairs), improved foraging (17 species pairs), and social benefits (12 species pairs) as the main drivers. In most cases, however, the factors that drive the formation of cetacean MSGs remain unknown. Amongst the reviewed studies, MSGs were referred to by various terms, often with no explicit definitions. To reduce this inconsistency, we recommend that future studies use only the term mixed-species group which we define as individuals of two or more species found in close spatial proximity due to mutual or unreciprocated attraction derived from evolutionary grouping benefits. There were also few structured investigations to confirm MSG occurrence and to analyse their potential causes and consequences. To facilitate the study of cetacean MSGs, we developed a conceptual framework that establishes diverse approaches to, firstly, distinguish MSGs from chance encounters and aggregations and to, secondly, investigate their potential functions. This is necessary if we are to advance this field of study and improve our understanding of the role that MSGs play in species and community ecology.

AB Precipitation patterns are becoming increasingly extreme, particularly at northern latitudes. Current climate models predict that this trend will continue in the future. While droughts have been repeatedly studied in many ecosystems over the last decades, the consequences of increasingly intense, but less frequent rainfall events, on carbon (C) cycling are not well understood. At northern latitudes, peatlands store one third of the terrestrial carbon and their functioning is highly dependent on water. Shifts in rainfall regimes could disrupt peatland C dynamics and speed-up the rates of C loss. How will these immense stocks of C be able to withstand and recover from extreme rainfall? We tested the resistance and resilience effects of extreme precipitation regimes on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes, pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and litter decomposition rates by exposing intact peat cores to extreme, spring-time rainfall patterns in a controlled mesocosm experiment. We find that more intense but less frequent rainfall destabilized water table dynamics, with cascading effects on peatland C fluxes. Decomposition and respiration rates increased with a deeper mean water table depth (WTD) and larger WTD fluctuations. We observed similar patterns for CO2 uptake, which were likely mediated by improved vascular plant performance. After a three-week recovery period, CO2 fluxes still displayed responses to the earlier WTD dynamics, suggesting lagged effects of precipitation regime shifts. Furthermore, we found that CH4 emissions decreased with deeper mean WTD, but this showed a high resilience once WTD dynamics stabilised. Not only do our results illustrate that shifting rainfall patterns translate in altered WTD dynamics and, consequentially, influence C fluxes, they also demonstrate that exposure to altered rainfall early in the growing season can have lasting effects on CO2 exchange. Even though the increased CO2 assimilation under extreme precipitation patterns signals peatland resistance under changing climatic conditions, it may instead mark the onset of vascular plant encroachment and the associated C loss.

ID BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB Background
   Climate change has been widely accepted as one of the major threats for global biodiversity and understanding its potential effects on species distribution is crucial to optimise conservation planning in future scenarios under global change. Integrating detailed climatic data across spatial and temporal scales into species distribution modelling can help to predict potential changes in biodiversity. Consequently, this type of data can be useful for developing efficient biodiversity management and conservation planning. The provision of such data becomes even more important in highly biodiverse regions, currently suffering from climatic and landscape changes. The Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica (BRMI; Portugal-Spain) is one of the most relevant reserves for wildlife in Europe. This highly diverse region is of great ecological and socio-economical interest, suffering from synergistic processes of rural land abandonment and climatic instabilities that currently threaten local biodiversity.
   Aiming to optimise conservation planning in the Reserve, we provide a complete dataset of historical and future climate models (1 x 1 km) for the BRMI, used to build a series of distribution models for 207 vertebrate species. These models are projected for 2050 under two climate change scenarios. The climatic suitability of 52% and 57% of the species are predicted to decrease under the intermediate and extreme climatic scenarios, respectively. These models constitute framework data for improving local conservation planning in the Reserve, which should be further supported by implementing climate and land-use change factors to increase the accuracy of future predictions of species distributions in the study area.
   New information
   Herein, we provide a complete dataset of state-of-the-art historical and future climate model simulations, generated by global-regional climate model chains, with climatic variables resolved at a high spatial resolution (1 x 1 km) over the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica. Additionally, a complete series of distribution models for 207 species (168 birds, 24 reptiles and 15 amphibians) under future (2050) climate change scenarios is delivered, which constitute framework data for improving local conservation planning in the reserve.

TI Investigating the Impacts of Road Traffic Conditions and Driver's
   Characteristics on Automated Vehicle Takeover Time and Quality Using a
   Driving Simulator
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This study investigates the impacts of road traffic conditions and driver's characteristics on the takeover time in automated vehicles using a driving simulator. Automated vehicles are barely expected to maintain their fully automated driving capability at all times based on the current technologies, and the automated vehicle system transfers the vehicle control to a driver when the system can no longer be automatically operated. The takeover time is the duration from when the driver requested the vehicle control transition from the automated vehicle system to when the driver takes full control of the vehicle. This study assumes that the takeover time can vary according to the driver's characteristics and the road traffic conditions; the assessment is undertaken with various participants having different characteristics in various traffic volume conditions and road geometry conditions. To this end, 25 km of the northbound road section between Osan Interchange and Dongtan Junction on Gyeongbu Expressway in Korea is modeled in the driving simulator; the experiment participants are asked to drive the vehicle and take a response following a certain triggering event in the virtual driving environment. The results showed that the level of service and road curvature do not affect the takeover time itself, but they significantly affect the stabilization time, that is, a duration for a driver to become stable and recover to a normal state. Furthermore, age affected the takeover time, indicating that aged drivers are likely to slowly respond to a certain takeover situation, compared to the younger drivers. With these findings, this study emphasizes the importance of having effective countermeasures and driver interface to monitor drivers in the automated vehicle system; therefore, an early and effective alarm system to alert drivers for the vehicle takeover can secure enough time for stable recovery to manual driving and ultimately to achieve safety during the takeover.

AB Spatiotemporal variation in community composition is of considerable interest in ecology. However, few studies have focused on seasonal variation patterns in taxonomic and functional community composition at the fine scale. As such, we conducted seasonal high-density sampling of the submerged macrophyte community in Hongshan Bay of Erhai Lake in China and used the generalized dissimilarity model (GDM) to evaluate the effects of environmental factors and geographic distance on taxonomic and functional beta diversity as well as corresponding turnover and nestedness components. At the fine scale, taxonomic turnover and nestedness as well as functional turnover and nestedness showed comparable contributions to corresponding taxonomic and functional beta diversity, with different importance across seasons. All taxonomic and functional dissimilarity metrics showed seasonal variation. Of note, taxonomic beta diversity was highest in summer and lowest in winter, while functional beta diversity showed the opposite pattern. Taxonomic and functional turnover showed similar change patterns as taxonomic and functional beta diversity. Taxonomic nestedness was low in summer and high in winter. Functional nestedness was also lower in summer. These results suggest that under extreme environmental conditions, both turnover and nestedness can exist at the fine scale and seasonal community composition patterns in submerged macrophytes should be considered. Future investigations on community assembly mechanisms should pay greater attention to long-term dynamic characteristics and functional information.

AB Despite their potential to generate high-quality positioning data, the use of highresolution acoustic telemetry systems (HRATS) has been neglected in coastal marine areas due to the limitations that these environments pose to the transmission of acoustic signals. In this work, we applied a HRATS and social network analysis (SNA) to study the social interactions of the pearly razorfish (Xyrichtys novacula), a small coastal wrasse, in a Mediterranean marine reserve. Our analysis was based on proximity measures estimated from high-resolution trajectories from 232 individuals tracked during 55 days within a marine protected area. Associations were defined as the proportion of 5min intervals in which two individuals were observed within 1 m from each other, and social networks were generated for the overall tracking period and for each particular day. The obtained network parameters were contrasted against 1,000 null association models obtained by randomly redistributing individual trajectories within the study area. The obtained networks showed a harem-like social structure, with agonistic behavior between males and larger association indices between individuals of different sex. Occasionally, sporadic associations of large groups of females were observed conducting excursions along the study area. By providing a comprehensive view of the organizational structure of the pearly razorfish, our study demonstrates the potential of HRATS to efficiently produce high-throughput tracking data from large numbers of individuals and of proper null social model formulation to reconstruct the social networks in wild-living marine fish populations. The combination of HRATS and SNA represents a powerful tool to study key ecological processes regarding the social interactions of individuals, including social dynamics, collective movements, and the response to environmental perturbations.

AB In 1970, Susumu Ohno hypothesized that gene duplication was a major reservoir of adaptive innovation. However, it was not until over two decades later that DNA sequencing studies uncovered the ubiquity of gene duplication across all domains of life, highlighting its global importance in the evolution of phenotypic complexity and species diversification. Today, it seems that there are no limits to the study of evolution by gene duplication, as it has rapidly coevolved with numerous experimental and computational advances in genomics. In this perspective, we examine word stem usage in PubMed abstracts to infer how evolving discoveries and technologies have shaped the landscape of studying evolution by gene duplication, leading to a more refined understanding of its role in the emergence of novel phenotypes.

AB Mercury (Hg) is a highly toxic element due to its high affinity for protein sulfhydryl groups, which upon binding, can destabilize protein structure and decrease enzyme activity. Prokaryotes have evolved enzymatic mechanisms to detoxify inorganic Hg and organic Hg (e.g., MeHg) through the activities of mercuric reductase (MerA) and organomercury lyase (MerB), respectively. Here, the taxonomic distribution and evolution of MerAB was examined in 84,032 archaeal and bacterial genomes, metagenome assembled genomes, and single-cell genomes. Homologs of MerA and MerB were identified in 7.8 and 2.1% percent of genomes, respectively. MerA was identified in the genomes of 10 archaeal and 28 bacterial phyla previously unknown to code for this functionality. Likewise, MerB was identified in 2 archaeal and 11 bacterial phyla previously unknown to encode this functionality. Surprisingly, homologs of MerB were identified in a number of genomes (similar to 50% of all MerB-encoding genomes) that did not encode MerA, suggesting alternative mechanisms to detoxify Hg(II) once it is generated in the cytoplasm. Phylogenetic reconstruction of MerA place its origin in thermophilic Thermoprotei (Crenarchaeota), consistent with high levels of Hg(II) in geothermal environments, the natural habitat of this archaeal class. MerB appears to have been recruited to the mer operon relatively recently and likely among a mesophilic ancestor of Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. This is consistent with the functional dependence of MerB on MerA and the widespread distribution of mesophilic microorganisms that methylate Hg(II) at lower temperature. Collectively, these results expand the taxonomic and ecological distribution of mer-encoded functionalities, and suggest that selection for Hg(II) and MeHg detoxification is dependent not only on the availability and type of mercury compounds in the environment but also the physiological potential of the microbes who inhabit these environments. The expanded diversity and environmental distribution of MerAB identify new targets to prioritize for future research.

AB The large-scale deployment of carbon capture technologies is expected to play a crucial role in efforts to meet stringent climate targets set forth by the Paris Agreement, but current models rely heavily upon carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies for which viability at the gigatonne scale is uncertain. While most 1.5 and 2 degrees C scenarios project rapid decarbonization of the energy sector facilitated by carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), they generally assume that CCS units can only capture similar to 90% of the CO2 in coal and natural gas combustion flues because this was previously considered the optimal condition for aqueous amine scrubbers. In this Perspective, we discuss a small but growing body of literature that examines the prospect of moving significantly beyond 90% capture-a concept we term deep CCS. in light of recent developments in materials and process design. The low incremental costs associated with performing varying degrees of deep CCS suggest that this approach is not only feasible but may also alleviate burdens placed upon CDR techniques facing significant barriers to large-scale deployment. We estimate that rapid deployment of deep CCS in deep decarbonization pathways could avoid more than 1 gigatonne of CO2 globally each year. The principles of deep CCS could also be applied directly to the CDR strategy of employing bioenergy with CCS, which could lead to a significant alleviation of the land and freshwater burden associated with this technology.

TI Social survival: Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) use social
   structure to partition ecological niches within proposed critical

AB Animal culture and social bonds are relevant to wildlife conservation because they influence patterns of geography, behavior, and strategies of survival. Numerous examples of socially-driven habitat partitioning and ecological-niche specialization can be found among vertebrates, including toothed whales. But such social-ecological dynamics, described here as 'social niche partitioning', are not known among baleen whales, whose societies-particularly on foraging grounds-are largely perceived as unstructured and incidental to matters of habitat use and conservation. However, through 16 years of behavioral observations and photo-identifications of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding within a fjord system in the Canadian Pacific (primarily within Gitga'at First Nation waters), we have documented long-term pair bonds (up to 12 years) as well as a complex societal structure, which corresponds closely to persistent patterns in feeding strategy, long-term site fidelity (extended occupancy and annual rate of return up to 75%), specific geographic preferences within the fjord system, and other forms of habitat use. Randomization tests of network congruency and clustering algorithms were used to test for overlap in patterns of social structure and habitat use, which confirmed the occurrence of social niche partitioning on the feeding grounds of this baleen whale species. In addition, we document the extensive practice of group bubble net feeding in Pacific Canada. This coordinated feeding behavior was found to strongly mediate the social structure and habitat use within this humpback whale society. Additionally, during our 2004-2019 study, we observed a shift in social network structure in 2010-2012, which corresponded with environmental and demographic shifts including a sudden decline in the population's calving rate. Our findings indicate that the social lives of humpback whales, and perhaps baleen whales generally, are more complex than previously supposed and should be a primary consideration in the assessment of potential impacts to important habitat.

AB The slow-worm lizards of the genus Anguis show significant morphological, behavioural and ecological uniformity owing to their limbless, elongated bodies and semifossorial lifestyle. This makes the delimitation of species challenging. Five monophyletic, deeply divergent and mostly parapatric mitochondrial lineages are currently recognized, although hybridization occurs along contact zones. In the southern edge of the range of the genus, two endemic Balkan Anguis (Anguis graeca and Anguis cephallonica) share a broad area of co-distribution and intermediate morphological characteristics. Expecting to retrieve hybrids within the overlap in their distributions, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms but did not recover any evidence of interspecific gene flow. Within each species, genomic data revealed shallow population structuring influenced by spatial isolation, with the exception of the southernmost population of A. cephallonica from the Mani Peninsula. Species distribution modelling showed a lack of strong niche overlap and specific environmental preferences; both species showed a precipitation dependence, but A. cephallonica was better acclimatized to high temperatures. Finally, geometric morphometrics of the head shape suggested morphological divergence, mostly seen in the elongation of the head of A. cephallonica. All the evidence supports a long and complete reproductive isolation between the two southern slow worms and raises questions about how ecomorphological divergence might have acted to promote their speciation.

ID RAPID ASSESSMENT; RESISTANCE; SELECTION; QUALITY; RESISTOGRAPH;

AB Background: Accurate estimates of wood density are needed by the forest sector to increase value along the tree-to-product value-chain. Amongst tools supporting in-situ assessments, micro-drills and acoustic hammers have become increasingly popular. Our objective was to use these tools, and other easily-obtained measures, to develop predictive wood density models for in-situ assessments of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) trees in western North America.
   Methods: Wood density estimates of 133 trees, 60-75 years-old, were benchmarked against X-ray densitometry data using linear mixed-effects models. Mean resistograph amplitude (unadjusted, adjusted, and standardised variants), and combinations of acoustic velocity, tree diameter, stand age, and site index were considered as fixed effects. Plots, comprising differing treatments, and sites were considered as random effects. Candidate models were selected based on fit statistics, and further evaluated with an independent external dataset comprising 37 Douglas-fir trees.
   Results: The optimal model comprised amplitude (adjusted), site index (transformed), and the quotient of velocity and age. It had a mean absolute percentage error, MAPE, of 4.1%, mean absolute error, MAE, of 19.4 kg.m(-3), a root-mean-squared-error, RMSE of 25.0 kg.m(3), and marginal R-2 for fixed effects, 1221 , R(marg)(2)of 0.60. With external data, MAPE was 8.7%, MAE 52.4 kg.m(3) and RMSE 59.5 kg.m(3). Fit statistics for a simpler two-variable model (standardised amplitude and transformed site index) were: MAPE 4.9%, MAE 23.2 kg.m(3), RMSE 28.0 kg.m(3), and R-marg(2), 0.48, and with external data MAPE was 8.5%, MAE 51.6 kg.m and RMSE 59.3 kg.m(3). Thus, with external data, the simpler model produced greater accuracy than the optimal model. Amplitude, and all other single-variable models, recorded poorer levels of accuracy.
   Conclusions: Micro-drilling alone, though highly significant as a predictor, is insufficient for providing accurate wood density estimates of individual trees. Site effects need to be considered too. Standardisation of mean amplitudes to z-scores makes models highly portable across a range of resistance tools and operating speeds, and therefore more practical. As noted in the literature, optimal models are not necessarily best for predicting outcomes with other datasets, therefore model evaluation with external data is critical to determining how well a model will perform in practice.

AB In this study, a comparative literature-based assessment of the impact of operational factors such as climatic condition, vegetation type, availability of land, water, energy and biomass, management practices, cost and soil characteristics was carried out on six greenhouse gas removal (GGR) methods. These methods which include forestation, enhanced weathering (EW), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar, direct air capture with carbon storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) were accessed with the aim of identifying the conditions and requirements necessary for their optimum performance. The extent of influence of these factors on the performance of the various GGR methods was discussed and quantified on a scale of 0-5. The key conditions necessary for optimum performance were identified with forestation, EW, SCS and biochar found to be best deployed within the tropical and temperate climatic zones. The CCS technologies (BECCS and DACCS) which have been largely projected as major contributors to the attainment of the emission mitigation targets were found to have a larger locational flexibility. However, the need for cost optimal siting of the CCS plant is necessary and dependent on the presence of appropriate storage facilities, preferably geological. The need for global and regional cooperation as well as some current efforts at accelerating the development and deployment of these GGR methods were also highlighted.

AB Leaves interact with a wealth of microorganisms. Among these, fungi are highly diverse and are known to contribute to plant health, leaf senescence and early decomposition. However, patterns and drivers of the seasonal dynamics of foliar fungal communities are poorly understood.
   We used a multifactorial experiment to investigate the influence of warming and tree genotype on the foliar fungal community on the pedunculate oak Quercus robur across one growing season.
   Fungal species richness increased, evenness tended to decrease, and community composition strongly shifted during the growing season. Yeasts increased in relative abundance as the season progressed, while putative fungal pathogens decreased. Warming decreased species richness, reduced evenness and changed community composition, especially at the end of the growing season. Warming also negatively affected putative fungal pathogens. We only detected a minor imprint of tree genotype and warming x genotype interactions on species richness and community composition.
   Overall, our findings demonstrate that warming plays a larger role than plant genotype in shaping the seasonal dynamics of the foliar fungal community on oak. These warming-induced shifts in the foliar fungal community may have a pronounced impact on plant health, plant-fungal interactions and ecosystem functions.

AB CONTEXT: Crop suitability determines its distribution and yield in a given region and can be greatly affected by climate change. In recent decades, the distribution of soybean cultivation has undergone significant spatial shifts in China. However, whether this change matches with climatic suitability for soybean at a national scale has not been reported.
   OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to investigate the spatial distribution and shifts in climatically suitable areas for soybean from 1961 to 2017 and to determine whether actual production matches with climatic suitability in China.
   METHODS: The MaxEnt model was used to simulate the presence probability of soybean from 1961 to 2017 based on soybean occurrence data and climate data across China. Regions were classified as climatically unsuitable or as having low, moderate, or high climatic suitability. Then, the overlay analysis was performed to assess spatial changes of soybean suitability and the consistency between climatic suitability and actual production.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Accumulated temperature >= 10 degrees C, humidity index during the potential growing season, and annual temperature range were the major climatic factors that affected soybean distribution. Areas of high climatic suitability were mainly located in the Northeast and North-central Regions, and the total acreage of high suitability was 129.88 x 10(6) ha. Unsuitable areas for soybean contracted over the study period, whereas highly suitable areas migrated westward and southward. The climatic suitability for soybean across China has increased overall in the past decades. The area of improved climatic suitability from 1961 to 2017 comprised 14.60% of the entire land area of China and was concentrated primarily in the Northwest and North-central Regions. Nonetheless, consistency between climatic suitability and actual production decreased from 83.47% in 1985 to 65.16% in 2015. This may pose a risk to soybean production, especially in emerging major planting areas of the Southwest Region.
   SIGNIFICANCE: This study described the distribution of climatically suitable areas for soybean, used spatial analysis to illustrate the extent to which climatically suitable areas overlap with actual production areas, and discussed possible solutions for improving soybean production at a national scale in China. This work has practical significance for optimizing the regional layout of soybean production and implementing countermeasures to address future climate change.

AB With large deployment of wireless sensor networks, anomaly detection for sensor data is becoming increasingly important in various fields. As a vital data form of sensor data, time series has three main types of anomaly: point anomaly, pattern anomaly, and sequence anomaly. In production environments, the analysis of pattern anomaly is the most rewarding one. However, the traditional processing model cloud computing is crippled in front of large amount of widely distributed data. This paper presents an edge-cloud collaboration architecture for pattern anomaly detection of time series. A task migration algorithm is developed to alleviate the problem of backlogged detection tasks at edge node. Besides, the detection tasks related to long-term correlation and short-term correlation in time series are allocated to cloud and edge node, respectively. A multi-dimensional feature representation scheme is devised to conduct efficient dimension reduction. Two key components of the feature representation trend identification and feature point extraction are elaborated. Based on the result of feature representation, pattern anomaly detection is performed with an improved kernel density estimation method. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted with synthetic data sets and real-world data sets.

AB Global nitrogen eutrophication, which is disrupting the intimate plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) symbiosis, can alter the diversity and physiological functions of soil AMF greatly. However, shifts of beta diversity and the intrinsic patterns of AMF community dissimilarities in response to nitrogen addition remain unclear. Based on a 7-year nitrogen addition experiment in a Qinghai-Tibet Plateau alpine meadow, we detected the changes in soil AMF alpha diversity (richness and genus abundance) and the community composition beta diversity by partitioning the two components of Simpson and nestedness dissimilarities along (turnover) and within (variation) nitrogen addition treatments, and fitted with environmental factor dissimilarities. We found that nitrogen addition decreased AMF richness by decreasing the most dominant AMF genus of Glomus but increasing the abundance of the rare genera. The turnover of the AMF community overall beta diversity along the nitrogen addition gradients was induced by the increased nestedness dissimilarity, while the variation within treatments was explained by both increased Simpson and nestedness dissimilarities, which was significantly correlated with soil pH. Our study found both Simpson and nestedness dissimilarities worked on the AMF community dissimilarity after nitrogen addition and the significant variation within the same treatment, which would be important in the future for predicting global AMF or microbial diversity changes in response to nitrogen eutrophication.

AB Global cooling and glacial-interglacial cycles since Antarctica's isolation have been responsible for the diversification of the region's marine fauna. By contrast, these same Earth system processes are thought to have played little role terrestrially, other than driving widespread extinctions. Here, we show that on islands along the Antarctic Polar Front, paleoclimatic processes have been key to diversification of one of the world's most geographically isolated and unique groups of herbivorous beetles-Ectemnorhinini weevils. Combining phylogenomic, phylogenetic, and phylogeographic approaches, we demonstrate that these weevils colonized the subAntarctic islands from Africa at least 50 Ma ago and repeatedly dispersed among them. As the climate cooled from the mid-Miocene, diversification of the beetles accelerated, resulting in two speciesrich clades. One of these clades specialized to feed on cryptogams, typical of the polar habitats that came to prevail under Miocene conditions yet remarkable as a food source for any beetle. This clade's most unusual representative is a marine weevil currently undergoing further speciation. The other clade retained the more common weevil habit of feeding on angiosperms, which likely survived glaciation in isolated refugia. Diversification of Ectemnorhinini weevils occurred in synchrony with many other Antarctic radiations, including penguins and notothenioid fishes, and coincided with major environmental changes. Our results thus indicate that geoclimatically driven diversification has progressed similarly for Antarctic marine and terrestrial organisms since the Miocene, potentially constituting a general biodiversity paradigm that should be sought broadly for the region's taxa.

AB Longitudinal measurement invariance-the consistency of measurement in data collected over time-is a prerequisite for any meaningful inferences of growth patterns. When one or more items measuring the construct of interest show noninvariant measurement properties over time, it leads to biased parameter estimates and inferences on the growth parameters. In this paper, I extend the recently developed alignment-within-confirmatory factor analysis (AwC) technique to adjust for measurement biases for growth models. The proposed AwC method does not require a priori knowledge of noninvariant items and the iterative searching of noninvariant items in typical longitudinal measurement invariance research. Results of a Monte Carlo simulation study comparing AwC with the partial invariance modeling method show that AwC largely reduces biases in growth parameter estimates and gives good control of Type I error rates, especially when the sample size is at least 1,000. It also outperforms the partial invariance method in conditions when all items are noninvariant. However, all methods give biased growth parameter estimates when the proportion of noninvariant parameters is over 25%. Based on the simulation results, I conclude that AO is a viable alternative to the partial invariance method in growth modeling when it is not clear whether longitudinal measurement invariance holds. The current paper also demonstrates AwC in an example modeling neuroticism over three time points using a public data set, which shows how researchers can compute effect size indices for noninvariance in AwC to assess to what degree invariance holds and whether AwC results are trustworthy.

AB Context For many organisms, responses to climate change (CC) will be affected by land-use and land-cover changes (LULCC). However, the extent to which LULCC is concurrently considered in climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs) is unclear. Objectives We identify trends in inclusion of LULCC and CC in vulnerability assessments of species and the direction and magnitude of their combined effect on biodiversity. Further, we examine the effect size of LULCC and CC in driving changes in "currencies" of response to CC, such as distribution, abundance and survival. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review of articles published in the last 30 years that focused on CCVA and accounted for impacts of both CC and LULCC. Results Across 116 studies, 34% assumed CC and LULCC would act additively, while 66% allowed for interactive effects. The majority of CCVAs reported similar effect sizes for CC and LULCC, although they affected different CCVA currencies. Only 14% of the studies showed larger effects of CC than of LULCC. Another 14% showed larger effects of LULCC than CC, specifically for dispersal, population viability, and reproduction, which tend to be strongly affected by fragmentation and disturbance. Although most studies found that LULCC and CC had negative effects on species currencies, in some cases effects were neutral or even positive. Conclusions CCVAs that incorporate LULCC provided a better account of drivers of vulnerability, and highlight aspects of drivers that are generally more amenable to on-the-ground management intervention than CCVAs that focus on CC alone.

AB Urbanization decreases the species richness and results in the homogenization of bird communities. Bird species are important indicator species for biodiversity and reflect the habitat quality of urban forests and other green spaces. In this study we investigated the key drivers that influence bird communities in urban forests and green spaces in the Southeastern European city of Ljubljana, Slovenia. We were interested in how the number of species, species dissimilarity and indicator species are affected by the type of green space (urban forest vs park), area of green space and type of urbanization (urban vs peri-urban areas). We sampled birds twice in 2012 in 39 standardized point counts across Ljubljana. We found that the abundance was influenced by the area of the green space. Species dissimilarity and species turnover are affected by the area and type of green space. Interestingly, the analysis showed that the species composition of peri-urban areas was similar to that of urban areas. Indicator species were found for all environmental variables. On the basis of the results, we suggest the strategy that would increase the diversity of birds and increase the stability of their populations in urban areas. Urban planners should encourage 1) both forests and parks since they harbour different species of birds, 2) larger green spaces since larger areas have species that are more typical of larger areas and 3) a mosaic of a larger number of smaller forest remnants combined with larger forest complex serving as source areas.

AB Because residents and immigrants from group living species may experience fitness costs associated with permanent changes in group membership, we examined the hypothesis that females experiencing socially unstable or socially stable conditions during development compensate these costs by shaping the phenotype of their own offspring differently. Groups of adult females experiencing either socially stable or unstable conditions in the early social environment were assigned to either socially stable or unstable conditions in the social environment as adults. We quantified affiliative and agonistic interactions among the females during pregnancy and lactation of the focal female, maternal and allomaternal care, hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) acute stress response, and early offspring growth. Social instability during breeding enhanced agonistic interactions among adult females, and offspring that experienced socially unstable conditions exhibited enhanced offspring care, regardless of adult environments. Neither social behavior, offspring care, acute stress physiology, nor early growth was influenced by early or adult social stability conditions. These findings imply that socially unstable conditions prime developing females to shape the phenotype of their offspring to prevent negative effects of socially unstable environments.

AB The pulmonate freshwater snail Promenetus exacuous (Planorbidae) has a widespread patchy distribution throughout much of North America, including New York State and the surrounding areas. Minimal life history information exists for the species in this region and information on its genetic diversity and structure is currently lacking for any portion of its range. We examined the species' reproductive behaviour, genetic diversity and population structure throughout New York and western Connecticut using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) haplotypes (241 snails) and 10 microsatellite loci (312 snails). Throughout the region, P. exacuous is a single, primarily outcrossing species with relatively high within-population genetic diversity. Populations are genetically differentiated and composed of divergent COI lineages. The region was colonized after the Wisconsin glacial retreat by snails from multiple, historically isolated populations and Pleistocene events played a major role in the historical diversification of lineages. Subsequent dispersal has likely been facilitated by birds and humans, but contemporary gene flow is low, resulting in genetic differentiation even among geographically proximate sites. Our data reveal that complex interactions between historical and contemporary processes contribute to the overall patterns of genetic diversity in freshwater snails.

AB Purpose Plant belowground storage traits are important for mediating environmental stress, but their role in response to water availability and their coordination with above-ground traits is largely unknown. We predicted a coordination of conserva-tive above- and belowground traits and preferential storage of water-soluble carbohydrates in the drier grassland and acquisitive traits and preferential stor-age of starch in the wetter grassland.
   Methods We examined the relationship between plant preference/response for water availability habitat preference, intrinsic water use efficiency, and leaf relative water content deficit) and the traits of belowground storage organs (morphological, anatomical, and storage carbohydrate concentration) in 37 perennial herbs from a wet and a dry temperate grassland in the Czech Republic.
   Results Species from the dry grassland preferred lower moisture, had greater water use efficiency than those from the wet grassland, and were also more conservative in their morphological and leaf traits. Although dry grassland plants preferentially stored oligo- and polysaccharides, their water-use efficiency increased with greater concentrations of starch. Leaf relative water content deficit did not vary significantly between the grasslands and additionally, the relationship to plant economy was not always in accord with other measures of preference for water availability.
   Conclusion Our results imply that belowground storage organs play a role in the response to reduced water availability. The strategies employed are further dependent upon the habitat and phylogeny of the species.

AB Wind turbines represent an encouraging option for sustainable energy but their noise emissions can be an issue for their public acceptance. Noise reduction measures, such as trailing-edge serrations or permeable inserts, seem to offer promising results in reducing wind turbine noise levels. This manuscript presents a novel holistic approach for perception-based evaluation of wind turbine noise and the performance of reduction measures using synthetic sound auralization. To demonstrate its feasibility, a case study featuring four state-of-the-art noise reduction trailing-edge add-ons synthetically applied to two full-scale wind turbines at nominal power is presented. The synthetic sound signals were auralized and propagated to three observer locations. The expected annoyance in each case was estimated by employing a combination of psychoacoustic sound quality metrics and a listening experiment featuring 16 participants. A close relation was found between the results of the psychoacoustic metrics and the listening experiment. In general, this holistic approach provides valuable information for the design of optimal noise reduction measures and wind turbines.

AB Aim We examined variation in crustacean zooplankton composition and diversity across Canada, the most lake-rich country in the world. In addition to alpha-diversity patterns, we explore mechanisms behind beta-diversity spatial variation, using taxonomic and functional metrics. Our goal was to explore geographical gradients and related mechanisms shaping zooplankton distribution across different spatial scales.
   Location Canada.
   Taxon Crustacean zooplankton.
   Methods Pelagic zooplankton was sampled in and characterized for 624 lakes across Canada, spanning 12 ecozones (defined by climatic, vegetation and geological differences) or 6 continental drainage basins as part of the NSERC Canadian Lake Pulse Network project. We compared taxon and trait distributions, as well as spatial (longitudinal and latitudinal) patterns of community composition and diversity. We computed taxonomic and functional spatial beta-diversity indices, decomposing these into taxon replacement and richness differences. Finally, species (or traits) and lake uniqueness (contributions) to beta-diversity (SCBD and LCBD) were estimated by ecozone and continental basin.
   Results In all, 90 crustacean zooplankton species were identified across the country. Differences in zooplankton taxonomic and functional composition were more distinct when considered by continental basin than by ecozone. alpha-diversity varied greatly across space, with greatest diversity in eastern Canada. beta-diversity was greatest when based on taxonomy and was driven by richness differences across all spatial and biodiversity dimensions.
   Main conclusions Structuring factors influencing zooplankton taxon and trait assemblages vary across spatial scales, being more important at the broadest scale considering continental hydrodynamics. Our results point to the combined effects of physical barriers to longitudinal dispersal and climate change in shaping zooplankton taxonomic and functional biogeography across Canadian lakes.

AB In highly disturbed environments, clonality facilitates plant survival via resprouting after disturbance, resource sharing among interconnected stems and vegetative reproduction. These traits likely contribute to the encroachment of deep-rooted clonal shrubs in tallgrass prairie. Clonal shrubs have access to deep soil water and are typically thought of as relatively insensitive to environmental variability. However, how leaf physiological traits differ among stems within individual clonal shrubs (hereafter 'intra-clonal') in response to extreme environmental variation (i.e. drought or fire) is unclear. Accounting for intra-clonal differences among stems in response to disturbance is needed to more accurately parameterize models that predict the effects of shrub encroachment on ecosystem processes. We assessed intra-clonal leaf-level physiology of the most dominant encroaching shrub in Kansas tallgrass prairie, Corms drummondii, in response to precipitation and fire. We compared leaf gas exchange rates from the periphery to centre within shrub clones during a wet (2015) and extremely dry (2018) year. We also compared leaf physiology between recently burned shrubs (resprouts) with unburned shrubs in 2018. Resprouts had higher gas exchange rates and leaf nitrogen content than unburned shrubs, suggesting increased rates of carbon gain can contribute to recovery after fire. In areas recently burned, resprouts had higher gas exchange rates in the centre of the shrub than the periphery. In unburned areas, leaf physiology remained constant across the growing season within clonal shrubs (2015 and 2018). Results suggest single measurements within a shrub are likely sufficient to parameterize models to understand the effects of shrub encroachment on ecosystem carbon and water cycles, but model parameterization may require additional complexity in the context of fire.

AB This study combined a social network analysis and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to test for general patterns of contagious spread of a mycobacterial infection for which pathways of disease acquisition are not well understood. Our population included 275 cases diagnosed with avian mycobacteriosis that were nested in a source population of 16,430 birds at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance facilities from 1992 through mid-2014. Mycobacteria species were determined using conventional methods and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Mycobacterium avium avium (MAA) and Mycobacterium genavense were the most common species of mycobacteria identified and were present in different proportions across bird taxa. A social network for the birds was constructed from the source population to identify directly and indirectly connected cases during time periods relevant to disease transmission. Associations between network connectivity and genetic similarity of mycobacteria (as determined by clusters of genotypes separated by few single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) were then evaluated in observed and randomly generated network permutations. Findings showed that some genotypes clustered along pathways of bird connectivity, while others were dispersed throughout the network. The proportion of directly connected birds having a similar mycobacterial genotype was 0.36 and significant (p<0.05). This proportion was higher (0.58) and significant for MAA but not for M. genavense. Evaluations of SNP distributions also showed genotypes of MAA were more related in connected birds than expected by chance; however, no significant patterns of genetic relatedness were identified for M. genavense, although data were sparse. Integrating the WGS analysis of mycobacteria with a social network analysis of their host birds revealed significant genetic clustering along pathways of connectivity, namely for MAA. These findings are consistent with a contagious process occurring in some, but not all, case clusters.

AB Seagrasses play a vital role in structuring coastal marine ecosystems, but their distributional range and genetic diversity have declined rapidly in recent decades. To improve conservation of seagrass species, it is important to predict how climate change may impact their ranges. Such predictions are typically made with correlative species distribution models (SDMs), which can estimate a species' potential distribution under present and future climatic scenarios given species' presence data and climatic predictor variables. However, these models are typically constructed with species-level data, and thus ignore intraspecific genetic variability, which can give rise to populations with adaptations to heterogeneous climatic conditions. Here, we explore the link between intraspecific adaptation and niche differentiation in Thalassia hemprichii, a seagrass broadly distributed in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean and a crucial provider of habitat for numerous marine species. By retrieving and re-analysing microsatellite data from previous studies, we delimited two distinct phylogeographical lineages within the nominal species and found an intermediate level of differentiation in their multidimensional environmental niches, suggesting the possibility for local adaptation. We then compared projections of the species' habitat suitability under climate change scenarios using species-level and lineage-level SDMs. In the Central Tropical Indo-Pacific region, models for both levels predicted considerable range contraction in the future, but the lineage-level models predicted more severe habitat loss. Importantly, the two modelling approaches predicted opposite patterns of habitat change in the Western Tropical Indo-Pacific region. Our results highlight the necessity of conserving distinct populations and genetic pools to avoid regional extinction due to climate change and have important implications for guiding future management of seagrasses.

AB The resistance of different genotypes to abiotic stress may be due to genetic effects and/or to phenotypic plasticity allowing them to acclimate to variable conditions. The contribution of one or the other mechanism determines different strategies with implications for the species conservation and adaptive management. In this study, the ecophysiological response to drought of Nothofagus pumilio provenance sites (humid, mesic and xeric) from contrasting precipitation regimes was evaluated in a common garden trial. Seedlings were submitted to progressive drought by withdrawing irrigation (control vs water deficit). Assuming a genetic base determined by selection pressures, populations from more xeric sites are expected to show higher resistance to drought, e. g., higher resistance to xylem cavitation and safety margin, stronger stomatal control and osmotic adjustment. Vulnerability to cavitation curves were performed, and the percentage loss of conductivity (P12, P50, P88 and slope) was obtained. The water potential at turgor loss point (TLP) and the osmotic potential at full turgor (pi 100) were calculated from pressure-volume curves. The humid site showed a significantly higher P50 value than the mesic and the xeric sites. Pre-dawn water potential differed between the provenances from xeric and mesic conditions under severe water deficit. Natural selection was inferred from the comparison of differentiation at neutral markers and phenotypic traits (F-ST vs. P-ST), with signals of adaptive variation (P-ST > F-ST) for stomatal density, specific leaf area, TLP, pi 100 and stomatal conductance. Results suggest a differential adaptive capacity to drought of N. pumilio provenance sites that could be evidencing local adaptation to their home environment.

AB Aim We investigate how plant distributions are shaped by current and palaeoclimate regimes. We specifically use global conifer biodiversity to test if palaeoclimatic signatures are stronger in range-restricted taxa relative to widespread taxa.
   Location Global.
   Taxon Coniferales.
   Methods We combine global geographical occurrences for 606 conifer species and 69 conifer genera with climate information (modern day and palaeoclimate) to examine the predictors of current conifer distribution. We test how climate predicts the richness of range-restricted taxa and influences turnover of widespread taxa using generalized dissimilarity models and a zeta diversity framework. We also construct ensemble distribution models to test if palaeoclimates differentially influence the current distribution of range-restricted versus widespread taxa.
   Results Generalized dissimilarity models suggest that palaeoclimatic variation is associated with richness differences among small-range species and genera; specifically, most occur in areas with little temporal climatic variation. Turnover among more widespread taxa, in contrast, is more strongly related to broad modern and palaeoclimatic temperature gradients. Ensemble distribution models also suggest that palaeoclimatic variation contributes more to the current range of genera with restricted ranges.
   Main conclusions The most widespread conifers broadly follow past and current temperature gradients, leading to latitudinal sorting of genera based on their physiological adaptations. Range-restricted species and genera, however, preferentially occur in climatically stable regions where they contribute to richness hotspots. History, rather than current climate patterns, likely exerts a disproportionate influence on global richness patterns in the group.

AB Life history theory posits that organisms should time their reproduction to coincide with environmental conditions that maximize their fitness. Population-level comparisons have contributed important insights on the adaptive value of reproductive timing and its association to environmental variation. Yet, despite its central role to ecology and evolution, the causes and consequences of variation in reproductive timing among individuals within populations are poorly understood in vertebrates other than birds.
   Using a combination of observational field studies and a split-brood experiment, we investigated whether differences in breeding time were associated with changes in hatching success, reproductive allocation and reaction norms linking offspring performance to temperature within an anadromous Baltic Sea population of perch Perca fluviatilis.
   Field observations revealed substantial variation in reproductive timing, with the breeding period lasting almost 2 months and occurring in temperatures ranging from 10 to 21celcius. The hatching success of perch decreased as the reproductive season progressed. At the same time, the reproductive allocation strategy changed over the season, late breeders (the offspring of which were introduced into a high resource environment and increased predation pressure) produced more and smaller eggs that resulted in smaller larvae, compared with early breeders.
   The split-brood experiment in which eggs were incubated in different temperatures (10, 12, 15, 18 degrees C) showed that differences in reproductive timing were associated with a change in the shape of the reaction norm linking offspring performance to water temperature indicative of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, with the offspring of early breeders performing best in low temperatures and the offspring of late breeders performing best in high temperatures.
   The seasonal changes in reproductive traits and the shape of the thermal performance suggest time-dependent adaptive differences among individuals within the population. Management actions aimed at preserving and restoring variation in the timing of reproductive events will thus likely also influence variation in associated life history traits and thermal performance curves, which could safeguard populations against environmental challenges and changes associated with exploitation and global warming.

AB The evolvability of sociality requires that some variation in social groups is heritable. Experiments on fly social groups find that genotypic differences in network position are largely robust to changes in the environment flies experience, while selection on network position varies across environments.
   Social group structure is highly variable and can be important for nearly every aspect of behavior and its fitness consequences. Group structure can be modeled using social network analysis, but we know little about the evolutionary factors shaping and maintaining variation in how individuals are embedded within their networks (i.e., network position). While network position is a pervasive target of selection, it remains unclear whether network position is heritable and can respond to selection. Furthermore, it is unclear how environmental factors interact with genotypic effects on network positions, or how environmental factors shape selection on heritable network structure. Here we show multiple measures of social network position are heritable, using replicate genotypes and replicate social groups of Drosophila melanogaster flies. Our results indicate genotypic differences in network position are largely robust to changes in the environment flies experience, though some measures of network position do vary across environments. We also show selection on multiple network position metrics depends on the environmental context they are expressed in, laying the groundwork for better understanding how spatio-temporal variation in selection contributes to the evolution of variable social group structure.

AB Aim Modelling African great ape distribution has until now focused on current or past conditions, while future scenarios remain scarcely explored. Using an ensemble forecasting approach, we predicted changes in taxon-specific distribution under future scenarios of climate, land use and human populations for (1) areas outside protected areas (PAs) only (assuming complete management effectiveness of PAs), (2) the entire study region and (3) interspecies range overlap.
   Location Tropical Africa.
   Methods We compiled occurrence data (n = 5,203) on African apes from the IUCN A.P.E.S. database and extracted relevant climate-, habitat- and human-related predictors representing current and future (2050) conditions to predict taxon-specific range change under a best- and a worst-case scenario, using ensemble forecasting.
   Results The predictive performance of the models varied across taxa. Synergistic interactions between predictors are shaping African ape distribution, particularly human-related variables. On average across taxa, a range decline of 50% is expected outside PAs under the best scenario if no dispersal occurs (61% in worst scenario). Otherwise, an 85% range reduction is predicted to occur across study regions (94% worst). However, range gains are predicted outside PAs if dispersal occurs (52% best, 21% worst), with a slight increase in gains expected across study regions (66% best, 24% worst). Moreover, more than half of range losses and gains are predicted to occur outside PAs where interspecific ranges overlap.
   Main Conclusions Massive range decline is expected by 2050, but range gain is uncertain as African apes will not be able to occupy these new areas immediately due to their limited dispersal capacity, migration lag and ecological constraints. Given that most future range changes are predicted outside PAs, Africa's current PA network is likely to be insufficient for preserving suitable habitats and maintaining connected ape populations. Thus, conservation planners urgently need to integrate land use planning and climate change mitigation measures at all decision-making levels both in range countries and abroad.

AB Brettanomyces bruxellensis is considered one of the most problematic microbes associated with wine production. Sulfur dioxide is commonly used to inhibit the growth of B. bruxellensis and limit the potential wine spoilage. Brettanomyces bruxellensis wine isolates can grow at higher concentrations of this preservative than isolates from other sources. Thus, it has been suggested that the use of sulfite may have selected for B. bruxellensis strains better adapted to survive in the winemaking environment. We utilized laboratory adaptive evolution to determine the potential for this to occur. Three B. bruxellensis strains, representative of known genetic variation within the species, were subjected to increasing sublethal sulfur dioxide concentrations. Individual clones isolated from evolved populations displayed enhanced sulfite tolerance, ranging from 1.6 to 2.5 times higher than the corresponding parental strains. Whole-genome sequencing of sulfite-tolerant clones derived from two of the parental strains revealed structural variations affecting 270 genes. The region containing the sulfite efflux pump encoding gene, SSU1, showed clear copy number variants in all sequenced clones. Regardless of parental strain genetic background, SSU1 copy number changes were reproducibly associated with one SSU1 haplotype. This work clearly demonstrates adaptive evolution of B. bruxellensis when exposed to sublethal sulfites and suggests that, similar to Saccharomyces cereuisiae wine yeast, the mechanism responsible involves the gene SSU1.

AB Freshwater biodiversity is rapidly declining due to accelerated human-induced disturbances. Increased humaninduced environmental disturbances are believed not to only decrease species numbers, but to also diminish beta diversity, for instance, by the local extinction of native species and wide-spread introduction of non-native species - a process widely known as biotic homogenization. Here, we investigated whether anthropogenic impacts reduce beta diversity. We also assessed the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in driving beta diversity. We examined relationships among macroinvertebrates beta diversity, stream status classes (reference and impacted classes), and environmental predictors in streams in Northern Nigeria. We used PERMDISP and distance-based redundancy analysis followed by variation partitioning to evaluate how beta diversity of macroinvertebrates differed between the reference and impacted sites, and what mechanisms were responsible for their responses. While beta diversity between reference and impacted sites was similar for all distance matrices, there were significant differences in composition related to turnover between the reference and impacted sites using the distance matrices. Species sorting prevailed in structuring macroinvertebrates communities in our system, while spatial variables were not relevant. Our result of beta diversity of macroinvertebrates and their responses to disturbances support the hypothesis that disturbances do not necessarily lead to biotic homogenization. We recommend that tropical streams restoration ecologists need to emphasize the study of varying condition classes in their attempt to develop effective restoration strategies based on their environmental heterogeneity.

AB The broadening in species' thermal tolerance limits and breadth from tropical to temperate latitudes is proposed to reflect spatial gradients in temperature seasonality, but the importance of seasonal shifts in thermal tolerances within and across locations is much less appreciated. We performed thermal assays to examine the maximum and minimum critical temperatures (CTmax and CTmin, respectively) of a mosquito community across their active seasons. Mosquito CTmin tracked seasonal shifts in temperature, whereas CTmax tracked a countergradient pattern with lowest heat tolerances in summer. Mosquito thermal breadth decreased from spring to summer and then increased from summer to autumn. We show a temporal dichotomy in thermal tolerances with thermal breadths of temperate organisms in summer reflecting those of the tropics ("tropicalization") that is sandwiched between a spring and autumn "temperatization." Therefore, our tolerance patterns at a single temperate latitude recapitulate classical patterns across latitude. These findings highlight the need to understand the temporal and spatial components of thermotolerance variation better, including plasticity and rapid seasonal selection, and the potential for this variation to affect species responses to climate change. With summers becoming longer and increasing winter nighttime temperatures, we expect increasing tropicalization of species thermal tolerances in both space and time.

AB Landscape features can strongly influence gene flow and the strength and direction of these effects may vary across spatial scales. However, few studies have evaluated methodological approaches for selecting spatial scales in landscape genetics analyses, in part because of computational challenges associated with optimizing landscape resistance surfaces (LRS). We used the federally threatened eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi) in central Florida as a case study with which to compare the importance of landscape features and their scales of effect in influencing gene flow. We used genetic algorithms (ResistanceGA) to empirically optimize LRS using categorical land cover surfaces, multiscale resource selection surfaces (RSS), and four combinations of landscape covariates measured at multiple spatial scales (multisurface multiscale LRS). We compared LRS where scale was selected using pseudo- and full optimization. Multisurface multiscale LRS received more empirical support than LRS optimized from categorical land cover surfaces or RSS. Multiscale LRS with scale selected using full optimization generally outperformed those with scale selected using pseudo-optimization. Multiscale LRS with large spatial scales (1200-1800 m) received the most empirical support. Our results highlight the importance of considering landscape features across multiple spatial scales in landscape genetic analyses, particularly broad scales relative to species movement potential. Different effects of scale on home range-level movements and dispersal could explain weak associations between habitat suitability and gene flow in other studies. Our results also demonstrate the importance of large tracts of undeveloped upland habitat with heterogenous vegetation communities and low urbanization for promoting indigo snake connectivity.

AB 1. Mediterranean fin whales aggregating in the Pelagos Sanctuary in summer to feed are exposed to vessel collision risk, particularly from high-speed ferries.
   2. This study developed models to predict summer fin whale distribution using a generalized additive model (GAM) and MaxEnt, with the aim of providing a tool to identify potential high whale-ferry collision risk areas along ferry routes within the Pelagos Sanctuary during summertime.
   3. Models were trained using sightings data collected in the summer months of 2009-2018 on board ferries crossing the central area of the Pelagos Sanctuary. Environmental predictors were bathymetry and mean sea surface chlorophyll concentration of the annual spring bloom period.
   4. The predictive ability of GAM and MaxEnt was assessed using existing knowledge of summer fin whale distribution in the region. GAM (deviance explained = 20.2%) predictions matched documented distributions more closely than that of MaxEnt, with highest predicted fin whale occurrence in deep offshore waters (>2000 m) encompassing the central north-western and western regions, and in the south-eastern region, consistent with known fin whale habitats within the Pelagos Sanctuary. Inter-annual variability was evident, influencing collision risk areas.
   5. Collision risk was estimated as a function of the overlap between the predicted probability of fin whale occurrence and ferry density estimated from Automated Identification System data. Ferry routes that cross the northern and eastern regions of the Pelagos Sanctuary presented relatively higher collision risk.
   6. Areas with changes in risk intensity between the years were temporally and spatially dynamic: some appeared intermittently throughout the study period while others persisted over consecutive years or recurred in different years.
   7. Due to the vastness of the Pelagos Sanctuary, vessel speed reduction maybe a more practical measure to manage collision risk than re-routing shipping lanes. A combination of Seasonal Management Areas and Dynamic Management Areas approaches could be adopted for high-risk areas.

AB As a consequence of climate change, water scarcity has increased the use of the iso-/anisohydric concept with the aim of identifying anisohydric or drought-tolerant genotypes. Recently, Meinzer and colleagues developed a metric for discriminating between iso- and anisohydric behavior called the hydroscape, which describes a range in which stomata control leaf water potential (psi) with decreasing water availability, and it is linked to several water-regulation and drought-tolerance traits. Thus, our objective was to test the usefulness of the hydroscape in discriminating between iso- and anisohydric Prunus dulcis cultivars, a species that is widely cultivated in Mediterranean central Chile due to its ability to withstand water stress. Through a pot desiccation experiment, we determined that the hydroscape was able to discriminate between two contrasting Prunus cultivars; the more anisohydric cultivar had a hydroscape 4.5 times greater than that of the other cultivar, and the hydroscape correlated with other metrics of plant water-use strategies, such as the maximum range of daily psi variation and the psi at stomatal closure. Moreover, the photosynthesis rates were also differently affected between cultivars. The more isohydric cultivar, which had a smaller hydroscape, displayed a steeper photosynthesis reduction at progressively lower midday psi. This methodology could be further used to identify drought-tolerant anisohydric Prunus cultivars.

AB Hydraulic stress in plants occurs under conditions of low water availability (soil moisture; theta) and/or high atmospheric demand for water (vapor pressure deficit; D). Different species are adapted to respond to hydraulic stress by functioning along a continuum where, on one hand, they close stomata to maintain a constant leaf water potential (Psi(L)) (isohydric species), and on the other hand, they allow Psi(L) to decline (anisohydric species). Differences in water-use along this continuum are most notable during hydrologic stress, often characterized by low theta and high D; however, theta and D are often, but not necessarily, coupled at time scales of weeks or longer, and uncertainty remains about the sensitivity of different water-use strategies to these variables. We quantified the effects of both theta and D on canopy conductance (G(c)) among widely distributed canopy-dominant species along the isohydric-anisohydric spectrum growing along a hydroclimatological gradient. Tree-level G(c) was estimated using hourly sap flow observations from three sites in the eastern United States: a mesic forest in western North Carolina and two xeric forests in southern Indiana and Missouri. Each site experienced at least 1 year of substantial drought conditions. Our results suggest that sensitivity of G(c) to theta varies across sites and species, with G(c) sensitivity being greater in dry than in wet sites, and greater for isohydric compared with anisohydric species. However, once theta limitations are accounted for, sensitivity of G(c) to D remains relatively constant across sites and species. While D limitations to G(c) were similar across sites and species, ranging from 16 to 34% reductions, theta limitations to G(c) ranged from 0 to 40%. The similarity in species sensitivity to D is encouraging from a modeling perspective, though it implies that substantial reduction to G(c) will be experienced by all species in a future characterized by higher D.

TI Collaborative Governance Under the Endangered Species Act: An Empirical
   Analysis of Protective Regulations
SO YALE JOURNAL ON REGULATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; STATE; ENVIRONMENT
AB Recent conservation and administrative law scholarship emphasizes the need for potential legal adversaries to work together. Stakeholders and regulators can pool their political capital, money, property, expertise, and legal leverage to achieve more than could be accomplished through mere mechanical implementation of statutory commands. Most commentators associate collaboration with programs promoting fuzzy objectives to engage the public and advisory groups.
   The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a polarizing statute that imposes seemingly uncompromising mandates. But this Article demonstrates that the ESA actually provides rich opportunities for collaborative governance. In exploring this underappreciated success story, we document how conservation collaboration adapts otherwise strict, generic prohibitions to the recovery needs of individual species on the brink of extinction. We identify conditions under which collaboration arises.
   This Article examines the nearly two hundred ESA protective regulations that tailor federal restrictions to the ecological and social circumstances of particular extinction threats. Our original empirical study explores how the rules manifest collaborative governance, as well as the extent to which they foster imperiled species recovery. We focus on provisions in which parties agree to constrain activities in exchange for limited statutory liability. Almost three-quarters of the protective regulations substitute practice-based limitations for difficult-to-detect, proximate-effect prohibitions.
   Our results show that collaborative governance transforms the ESA from a statute prohibiting certain outcomes (such as harm or jeopardy to a species) to a regulatory program implementing collaboratively crafted best practices, along the lines of pollution-control statutes. Paradoxically, this shift may improve the prospect for species recovery, even with regulations that are less stringent than the standard statutory prohibitions. This insight allows us to recommend mechanisms for constructing better regulations and suggest avenues for future research.

AB Although most emergent wetlands across central North America have been destroyed or degraded, wetland restoration in recent decades has provided new habitat resources for wetland birds in agriculturally dominated landscapes. The goals of wetland restorations often include providing habitat for migratory and breeding waterfowl and other wetland birds. One such restored wetland complex in the Illinois River Valley, the Emiquon Preserve, is isolated from most flooding events of the Illinois River allowing the growth of persistent emergent vegetation that was quickly colonized by breeding wetland birds. We examined nest occurrence and variables influencing site selection, nest success, and changes in nest density across stages of the wetland succession cycle. We located 327 nests from nine species of wetland birds (American Bittern, Botaurus lentiginosus; American Coot, Fulica americana; Black-crowned Night-Heron, Nycticorax nycticorax; Black-necked Stilt, Himantopus mexicanus; Common Gallinule, Gallinula galeata; Green Heron, Butorides virescens; Least Bittern, Ixobrychus exilis; Pied-billed Grebe, Podilymbus podiceps; Sora, Porzana carolina) during 2013-2019. Common Gallinules were more likely to nest in persistent emergent vegetation than other cover types. American Coots and Least Bitterns selected nest sites based on water depth. Black-necked Stilt and Black-crowned Night-Heron nests were less successful in deeper water. Black-necked Stilt, Black-crowned Night-Heron, and Common Gallinule nests were less successful with later initiation dates. Nest density did not vary between persistent emergent and hemi-marsh cover types. Across 2013-2019 we estimated an average of 372 nests/year for six marsh-nesting bird species at Emiquon, including two state-endangered (Common Gallinule and Black-crowned Night-Heron) and one state-threatened (Least Bittern). Wetlands restored from agricultural fields can quickly provide critical breeding habitat for marsh-nesting birds of conservation concern, although continued management is needed to provide resources to maintain persistent emergent vegetation communities as individual marshes transition through the marsh cycle.

AB Transpiration represents more than 30% of the global land-atmosphere water exchange but is highly uncertain. Plant hydraulics was ignored in traditional land surface modeling, but recently plant hydraulics has been found to play an essential role in transpiration simulation. A new physical-based representation of plant hydraulic schemes (PHS) was recently developed and implemented in the Common Land Model (CoLM). However, it is unclear to what extent PHS can reduce these uncertainties. Here, we evaluated the PHS against measurements obtained at 81 FLUXNET sites. The transpiration of each site was estimated using an empirical evapotranspiration partitioning approach. The metric scores defined by the International Land Model Benchmarking Project (ILAMB) were used to evaluate the model performance and compare it with that of the CoLM default scheme (soil moisture stress (SMS)). The bias score of transpiration in PHS was higher than SMS for most sites, and more significant improvements were found in semi-arid and arid sites where transpiration was limited by soil moisture. The hydraulic redistribution in PHS optimized the soil water supply and thus improved the transpiration estimates. In humid sites, no significant improvement in seasonal or interannual variability of transpiration was simulated by PHS, which can be explained by the insensitivity of transpiration demand coupled to the photosynthesis response to precipitation. In arid and semi-arid sites, seasonal or interannual variability of transpiration was better captured by PHS than SMS, which was interpreted by the improved drought sensitivity for transpiration. Arid land is widespread and is expected to expand due to climate change, thus there is an urgent need to couple PHS in land surface models.

AB Selective grazing of livestock creates lightly and heavily grazed vegetation patches, which together contribute to the whole community in grazed grasslands. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) predicts moderate grazing intensity can increase species diversity. However, grazing patchiness complicates predicted responses to grazing intensity from ecological theory and may influence how various management regimes affect biodiversity at the whole community scale. We examined effects of management regime and grazing intensity on plant species diversity, community composition, aboveground net primary production (ANPP), and soil compaction. Two management regimes (season-long continuous grazing and grazing and mowing alternated annually) and seven levels of grazing intensity were applied over the past 10 yr. We assessed how alpha diversity within patches and beta diversity across patches contributed to the diversity of the whole plot and how these relationships responded to both grazing intensity and management regime. We further divided beta diversity into nestedness and replacement components across lightly and heavily grazed patches within plots. The mixed grazing-mowing regime differed from the continuous grazing regime in that the former had a higher number of palatable species, higher species evenness, and higher Shannon-Wiener diversity, in both lightly and heavily grazed patches and the whole plots, and especially at moderate and high grazing intensities. The continuous grazing regime and the mixed grazing-mowing regime did not differ in total beta diversity. However, the nestedness component of total beta diversity was dominant in the continuous grazing regime. In contrast, species richness and ANPP did not differ significantly between the two management regimes, though soil hardness in heavily grazed patches was significantly higher under the continuous grazing regime than the mixed grazing-mowing regime. Loss of rare species under both management regimes, even at low to moderate grazing intensities, suggests that selective grazing and patch formation may not conform with the IDH. Our study indicates that the mixed grazing-mowing regime is more sustainable for long-term grassland management than the continuous grazing regime by controlling the creation of heavily grazed patches. These findings, integrating alpha-beta-gamma diversity and patch-scale approaches, provide a more thorough evaluation than the intermediate disturbance hypothesis of grazing management in terms of sustainability and biodiversity conservation in semiarid regions.

AB The campo rupestre ecosystem is considered an old, climatically buffered, infertile landscape. As a consequence, long-term isolation is thought to have played an important role in the diversification of its biota. Here, we tested for hybridization between two endemic leaf frogs from the campo rupestre. We used sequence markers and coalescent models to verify haplotype sharing between the species, to test the existence and direction of gene flow, and to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene flow. Additionally, ecological niche modelling (ENM) was used to assess for potential co-occurrence by overlapping the climatic niche of these species since the middle Pleistocene. We found haplotype sharing and/or lack of differentiation in four nuclear fragments, one of them associated with introgression. The coalescent models support introgressive hybridization unidirectionally from Pithecopus megacephalus to P. ayeaye, occurring similar to 300 kya. ENM corroborates this scenario, revealing areas of potential environmental niche overlap for the species at about 787 kya. These results contradict the expectation of reduced hybridization, while ENM suggests climatic fluctuation rather than stability for the two species. The reduced hybridization hypothesis needs to be further investigated because our results suggest that it may have unrealistic premises at least for animals.

AB Nestedness is widely observed in natural metacommunities, but its underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. The distribution of habitats in the landscape and differences in dispersal rates of distinct insect taxa can determine the nestedness of the metacommunity. Here, we evaluated how species habitat specialization contributes to metacommunity nestedness in insect groups with different dispersal capacities in a mountaintop landscape in south-eastern Brazil. We sampled ants, butterflies and dung beetles in two main habitats, naturally fragmented forest islands and a grassland matrix (campo rupestre), during both dry and rainy seasons. We classified species according to their degree of habitat specialization (generalists or specialists) based on the relative frequencies and abundances between these two contrasting habitats. Forty of 211 species were classified as habitat specialists, seven as habitat generalists. It was not possible to classify the remaining species. The metacommunity was nested in structure, with habitat generalist species contributing more to nestedness than habitat specialists. Nonetheless, habitat distribution in the landscape did not affect the nestedness of the metacommunity. Our findings reveal that species sorting (for habitat specialists) and mass effects (for habitat generalists) are concurrent processes in the mountaintop forest-grassland mosaic. Our study helps to advance our understanding of the differences in the distribution of generalist and specialist species in a tropical mountaintop landscape and improves our ability to predict and manage the increasingly adverse effects of changes in land use and climate on metacommunities and ecosystem functions.

AB The implementation of soil organic carbon sequestration (SCS) practices on agricultural land has the potential to help to mitigate climate change at the global level. However, our understanding of the extent to which viticultural soils can contribute to this global effort remains limited. In this study, we used a random forest regression to predict the change in soil organic carbon stocks in vineyards of Western Europe under five SCS practices: organic amendments (OA), cover cropping (CC), organic amendments and no-tillage (OA+NT), no-tillage and cover cropping (NT+CC), and a combination of organic amendments, no-tillage and cover cropping (OA+NT+CC). The abatement rate of each SCS practice was modelled and mapped for six countries in Western Europe: Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Germany and Austria. Overall, the highest abatement rate was reached under OA+NT+CC (8.29 Mg CO2-eq. ha(-1) yr(-1)), whereas the lowest was observed under CC (7.03 Mg CO2-eq. ha(-1) yr(-1)). Results showed major differences in abatement rates at the regional and national level. Despite these differences, the adoption of SCS practices was associated with a high abatement potential in the six countries and should be encouraged in the viticulture sector as a way to offset greenhouse gas emissions via soil carbon sequestration.

AB Premise of research. Numbering around 10,000 species, ferns are the second-largest group of vascular plants. Relatively little work, however, has focused on the population genetic processes driving fern evolution. Early work by pteridologists suggested that ferns should be highly inbred (via gametophytic selfing) and therefore should have exceptionally low genetic diversity, with most genetic variation derived from polyploidy. Methodology. We conducted a meta-analysis, starting with literature searches using Google Scholar and Web of Science, to identify studies on fern population genetics. From these papers, we recorded population genetic metrics including expected heterozygosity under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (H-e), percent of polymorphic loci (%P), the inbreeding coefficient (F), Wright's fixation index (F-ST), the molecular marker(s) used, and the geographic origin of the samples. We compared these metrics among ferns with various mating systems and growth habits. Pivotal results. We compiled a data set of 156 fern taxa from 87 publications. We found that both mating system and growth habit have a significant impact on the genetic diversity (%P) and population structuring of fern populations (F, F-ST). We found that temperate regions are the most thoroughly sampled and that most studies have used allozymes, with a shift in marker usage in the 2000s and 2010s. Conclusions. Contrary to early hypotheses, natural fern populations are not restricted to gametophytic selfing and instead regularly outcross. As we anticipate rapid growth in this field in the near future, we present a review of the major findings in fern population genetics to date. We also suggest possible future directions such as expanding geographic and taxonomic sampling and highlighting methods that will capitalize on the rapidly expanding genomic resources for ferns.

AB We investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of prescribed fire and wildfire within Washington State, USA using records from the state's Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Spatiotemporal comparisons of prescribed fire and wildfire area burned revealed that (1) fire activity broadly differed between the eastern and western portion of the state in terms of total area and distribution of burn sources, (2) over the 2004-2019 period, wildfire largely replaced prescribed fire as the predominant source of burning, and (3) wildfire and prescribed fire occur during distinct months of the year. Spatiotemporal variation in prescribed fire activity at regional levels were measured using five parameters: total area burned, total biomass burned, burn days, burn approval rates, and pile burn frequency. Within-region spatial variability in prescribed fire parameters across land ownership categories and bioclimatic categories were often detectable. Regression models of the annualized prescribed fire parameters suggested that prescribed fire activities have been declining in multiple administrative regions over the 2004-2019 period. A descriptive analysis of seasonal trends found that prescribed fire use largely peaked in the fall months, with minor peaks usually occurring in the spring. Lastly, we described how area burned, biomass burned, and pile burn frequency differed between prescribed fires approved and denied by the DNR, and found that approved prescribed fires were typically smaller and burned less biomass than denied fires.

AB Scientific research on heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback is burdened by certain methodological issues, such as lack of consistent training quality and fidelity assessment or control conditions that would mimic the intervention. In the present study, a novel sham HRV-biofeedback training was proposed as a credible control condition, indistinguishable from the real training. The Yield Efficiency of Training Index (YETI), a quantitative measure based on the spectral distribution of heart rate during training, was suggested for training quality assessment. A training fidelity criterion derived from a two-step classification process based on the average YETI index and its standard deviation (YETISD) was suggested. We divided 57 young, healthy volunteers into two groups, each subjected to 20 sessions of either real or sham HRV-biofeedback. Five standard HRV measures (standard deviation of the NN (SDNN), root mean square of the standard deviation of the NN (RMSSD), total power, low-frequency (LF), and high-frequency (HF) power) collected at baseline, after 10 and 20 sessions were subjected to analysis of variance. Application of a training fidelity criterion improved sample homogeneity, resulting in a substantial gain in effect sizes of the group and training interactions for all considered HRV indices. Application of methodological amendments, including proper control conditions (such as sham training) and quantitative assessment of training quality and fidelity, substantially improves the analysis of training effects. Although presented on the example of HRV-biofeedback, this approach should similarly benefit other behavioral training procedures that interact with any of the many psychophysiological mechanisms in the human body.

AB Understanding patterns of population differentiation and gene flow in insect vectors of plant diseases is crucial for the implementation of management programs of disease. We investigated morphological and genome-wide variation across the distribution range of the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius (Linnaeus, 1758) (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Aphrophoridae), presently the most important vector of the plant pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al., 1987 in Europe. We found genome-wide divergence between P. spumarius and a very closely related species, P. tesselatus Melichar, 1899, at RAD sequencing markers. The two species may be identified by the morphology of male genitalia but are not differentiated at mitochondrial COI, making DNA barcoding with this gene ineffective. This highlights the importance of using integrative approaches in taxonomy. We detected admixture between P. tesselatus from Morocco and P. spumarius from the Iberian Peninsula, suggesting gene-flow between them. Within P. spumarius, we found a pattern of isolation-by-distance in European populations, likely acting alongside other factors restricting gene flow. Varying levels of co-occurrence of different lineages, showing heterogeneous levels of admixture, suggest other isolation mechanisms. The transatlantic populations of North America and Azores were genetically closer to the British population analyzed here, suggesting an origin from North-Western Europe, as already detected with mitochondrial DNA. Nevertheless, these may have been produced through different colonization events. We detected SNPs with signatures of positive selection associated with environmental variables, especially related to extremes and range variation in temperature and precipitation. The population genomics approach provided new insights into the patterns of divergence, gene flow and adaptation in these spittlebugs and led to several hypotheses that require further local investigation.

AB Adsorbent made by carbonization of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions has become a promising material for wastewater treatment owing to its cost-effective, simple, and eco-friendly processing method. Ultrasound is considered a green technique to modify carbon materials because it uses water as the solvent. In this study, a comparison of Reactive Black 5 (RB5) adsorption capacity between biochar (BC) generated by pyrolysis of water bamboo (Zizania latifolia) husks at 600 degrees C and ultrasound-assisted biochar (UBC) produced by pyrolysis at 600 degrees C assisted by ultrasonic irradiation was performed. UBC showed a greater reaction rate and reached about 80% removal efficiency after 4 h, while it took 24 h for BC to reach that level. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images indicated that the UBC morphology surface was more porous, with the structure of the combination of denser mesopores enhancing physiochemical properties of UBC. By Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET), the specific surface areas of adsorbent materials were analyzed, and the surface areas of BC and UBC were 56.296 m(2)/g and 141.213 m(2)/g, respectively. Moreover, the pore volume of UBC was 0.039 cm(3)/g, which was higher than that of BC at 0.013 cm(3)/g. The adsorption isotherms and kinetics revealed the better fits of reactions to Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating the inclination towards monolayer adsorption and chemisorption of RB5 on water bamboo husk-based UBC.

ID BANDWIDTH SELECTION; DENSITY-ESTIMATION; LINEAR-REGRESSION; MODELS
AB The package allows the use of two new statistical methods for the analysis of interval-censored data: 1) direct estimation/prediction of statistical indicators and 2) linear (mixed) regression analysis. Direct estimation of statistical indicators, for instance, poverty and inequality indicators, is facilitated by a non parametric kernel density algorithm. The algorithm is able to account for weights in the estimation of statistical indicators. The standard errors of the statistical indicators are estimated with a non parametric bootstrap. Furthermore, the package offers statistical methods for the estimation of linear and linear mixed regression models with an interval-censored dependent variable, particularly random slope and random intercept models. Parameter estimates are obtained through a stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm. Standard errors are estimated using a non parametric bootstrap in the linear regression model and by a parametric bootstrap in the linear mixed regression model. To handle departures from the model assumptions, fixed (logarithmic) and data-driven (Box-Cox) transformations are incorporated into the algorithm.

AB Biodiversity is being lost at an alarming rate, but the rate of this loss is likely to be underestimated as a result of a deficit in taxonomic knowledge (i.e. the Linnean shortfall). This knowledge gap is more extensive for morphologically indistinct taxa. The advancement of molecular techniques and delimitation methods has facilitated the identification of such cryptic species, but a majority of these taxa remain undescribed. To investigate the effects of taxonomic uncertainty on understanding of biodiversity, we applied the general lineage concept of species to an amphipod species complex, the Gammaruslacustris lineage that occupies springs of the northern Chihuahuan Desert, which is emerging in contemporary times. We investigated species boundaries using a validation-based approach and examined genetic structure of the lineage using a suite of microsatellite markers to identify independently evolving metapopulations. Our results show that each spring contains a genetically distinct population that is geographically isolated from other springs, suggesting evolutionary independence and status as separate species. Additionally, we observed subtle interspecific morphological variation among the putative species. We used multiple lines of evidence to formally describe four new species (Gammarus langi sp. nov., G. percalacustris sp. nov., G. colei sp. nov. and G. malpaisensis sp. nov.) endemic to the northern Chihuahuan Desert. Cryptic speciation is likely to be high in other aquatic taxa within these ecosystems, and across arid landscapes throughout North America and elsewhere, suggesting that the magnitude of the Linnean shortfall is currently underestimated in desert springs worldwide.

AB The role of divergent selection between alternative environments in promoting reproductive isolation (RI) between lineages is well recognized. However, most studies view each divergent environment as homogenous, thereby overlooking the potential role within-environment variation plays in RI between differentiating lineages. Here, we test the importance of microenvironmental variation in RI by using individual trees of two host plants, each harboring locally adapted populations of the cynipid wasp Belonocnema treatae. We compared the fitness surrogate (survival) of offspring from hybrid crosses with resident crosses across individual trees on each of two primary host plants, Quercus virginiana and Q. geminata. We found evidence of weak hybrid inviability between host-associated lineages of B. treatae despite strong genomic differentiation. However, averaging across environments masked great variation in hybrid fitness on individual trees, where hybrids performed worse than, equal to, or better than residents. Thus, considering the environmental context of hybridization is critical to improving the predictability of divergence under variable selection.

AB An accurate estimation of critical speed (CS) is important to accurately define the boundary between heavy and severe intensity domains when prescribing exercise. Hence, our aim was to compare CS estimates obtained by statistically appropriate fitting procedures, i.e., regression analyses that correctly consider the dependent variables of the underlying models. A second aim was to determine the correlations between estimated CS and aerobic fitness parameters, i.e., ventilatory threshold, respiratory compensation point, and maximal rate of oxygen uptake. Sixteen male runners performed a maximal incremental aerobic test and four exhaustive runs at 90, 100, 110, and 120% of the peak speed of the incremental test on a treadmill. Then, two mathematically equivalent formulations (time as function of running speed and distance as function of running speed) of three different mathematical models (two-parameter, three-parameter, and three-parameter exponential) were employed to estimate CS, the distance that can be run above CS (d '), and if applicable, the maximal instantaneous running speed (s(max)). A significant effect of the mathematical model was observed when estimating CS, d ', and s(max) (P < 0.001), but there was no effect of the fitting procedure (P > 0.77). The three-parameter model had the best fit quality (smallest Akaike information criterion) of the CS estimates but the highest 90% confidence intervals and combined standard error of estimates (%SEE). The 90% CI and %SEE were similar when comparing the two fitting procedures for a given model. High and very high correlations were obtained between CS and aerobic fitness parameters for the three different models (r >= 0.77) as well as reasonably small SEE (SEE <= 6.8%). However, our results showed no further support for selecting the best mathematical model to estimate critical speed. Nonetheless, we suggest coaches choosing a mathematical model beforehand to define intensity domains and maintaining it over the running seasons.

AB Lemon (Citrus limon) is a fruit tree with major agricultural importance around the Mediterranean basin and is considered to be highly drought resistant. In this study, we tested the effect of two months summer-desiccation on physiological and yield parameters of mature lemon trees growing under Mediterranean climate during three consecutive years. We also examined the efficiency of current irrigation regime, which is based on reference evapo-transpiration. We measured leaf gas exchange and water potential (Psi(l)), monitored sap flow and soil moisture and followed flowering, fruit set and fruit size. Lemon trees showed an isohydric stomatal regulation, as stomata maintained leaf water potential >-2 MPa. Summer desiccation caused a gradual decrease in diurnal tree water use, starting immediately after cessation of irrigation, with leaf gas exchange practically halted at the end of the drought period. Tree function recovered following re-irrigation, and fruit yields were not reduced, but even mildly increased during the first year. In contrast, summer desiccation during two consecutive years caused long-term effects of tree activity decrease, significantly lower yield, main branch collapse and even tree mortality. Irrigation amounts matched closely tree water-use amounts; soil moisture was maintained around 26% (v/v); and irrigation responded dynamically to meteorological changes, indicating that current irrigation regime represents highly efficient water management. The lemon desiccation protocol relied on the physiological capacity of this species to avoid short-term drought effects through stomatal closure. Still, this protocol must be managed carefully, to reduce risk to trees and save yields.

AB Anthropogenic climate change pushes forest ecosystems globally beyond their limits. Widespread events of forest die-off have been attributed to direct and indirect impacts of increasingly frequent and intense droughts. Here, we focus on an extensive mortality event in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica (L.)) forests in Germany, following the successive 2018 - 2019 hot droughts. To examine whether this die-off indeed attributed to observed trends in drought occurrence and intensity, we sampled 143 beech and 186 spruce trees at three low-elevation sites (Spessart, Hassberge, Fichtelberg) with different edaphic properties in northern Bavaria. We analysed long-term hydroclimatic sensitivity and growth responses to extreme events of five site- and species-specific tree-ring width chronologies, including a reference site for each species. Growth of beech was sensitive to drought in April to June, whereas spruce growth was strongly related to drought during June to August, except at slightly higher elevations at the Fichtelberg site, where a summer temperature signal was observed. Trees at the Spessart and Hassberge sites showed an increased response to hydroclimatic conditions in April following the extreme drought in 1976 and from the 1990s onwards at the Fichtelberg site. Spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) outbreaks during the 2018 drought accelerated the high mortality rates in around 50% of the trees at the Spessart and Hassberge site. In 2018, around 7% of all beech trees died at the Hassberge site, the site with the highest clay content. Our results suggest that these widespread mortality events can be attributed to an increasing drought sensitivity and were accelerated by the consecutive recent drought years. Sustainable forest management practices for these ecologically and economically important tree species are required to mitigate the effects of global warming in the future.

AB Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and magnitude due to climate change. In this context, the impacts of droughts on forest mortality will increase making it more relevant to determine the resilience of native forests to drought. Austrocedrus chilensis is an endemic conifer adapted to dry-mesic environmental conditions in the Patagonian Andes. We sampled 9 sites along a 60 km transect encompassing the West-East precipitation gradient (2000-500 mm yr(-1)) located at Nahuel Huapi National Park (Argentina). We measured tree-ring widths of living and dead trees growing in three forest types (mixed, closed, and open) along the precipitation gradient. We characterized extreme droughts using six stations precipitation series and CRUTS v4 temperature records. The extreme summer drought of 1943-44 appears to have influenced the growth patterns of A. chilensis over the next 30 years in all trees along the precipitation gradient. Based on basal area increments before, during, and after ten extreme droughts, we calculated the growth resilience components: resistance (Rt), recovery (Rc), and relative resilience (rRs) for living and dead trees. The Rt and rRs show low values (index < 1) whereas Rc was higher (index > 1) for all trees and forest types. Differences among forest types were only significant for Rt. In turn, living and dead trees showed significant differences for Rt in closed forests. Our results also indicate that A. chilensis trees with a high capacity to maintain growth rates during droughts (resistance) in wetter environments (mixed and closed forests) have a larger chance of survival than in drier forests. Consequently, an increase in the intensity and frequency of drought events suggested by future climate change scenarios could affect the carbon reservoirs related to Patagonian forests and their ecosystem services to people.

AB Climate warming, in particular in island environments, where opportunities for species to disperse are limited, may become a serious threat to cold adapted alpine species. In order to understand how alpine species may respond to a warming world, we need to understand the drivers that have shaped their habitat specialisation and the evolutionary adaptations that allow them to utilize alpine habitats. The endemic, endangered New Zealand kea (Nestor notabilis) is considered the only alpine parrot in the world. As a species commonly found in the alpine zone it may be highly susceptible to climate warming. But is it a true alpine specialist? Is its evolution driven by adaptation to the alpine zone, or is the kea an open habitat generalist that simply uses the alpine zone to, for example, avoid lower lying anthropogenic landscapes? We use whole genome data of the kea and its close, forest adapted sister species, the kaka (Nestor meridionalis) to reconstruct the evolutionary history of both species and identify the functional genomic differences that underlie their habitat specialisations. Our analyses do not identify major functional genomic differences between kea and kaka in pathways associated with high-altitude. Rather, we found evidence that selective pressures on adaptations commonly found in alpine species are present in both Nestor species, suggesting that selection for alpine adaptations has not driven their divergence. Strongly divergent demographic responses to past climate warming between the species nevertheless highlight potential future threats to kea survival in a warming world.

AB In the current fragmented media landscape, online video is becoming an important outlet for content dissemination. Online video channels provide content creators a way of organizing content and building an online following through subscriptions and social sharing. This paper describes a decision support systems (DSS) based framework for online video channel management and content creation. The relevant DSS literature was reviewed along with both modeling and behavioral aspects of online videos and video channels. An empirical case study was run on a dataset consisting of views, shares, and subscriptions from over 1000 videos from nine YouTube channels. This paper contributes to DSS theory by proposing a flexible framework for incorporating both behavioral and empirical work into an integrative process for online video content creation. This framework builds on existing data-driven DSS theory, but includes specific entities and processes for online content creation.

AB As DNA sequencing technologies and methods for delimiting species with genomic data become more accessible and numerous, researchers have more tools than ever to investigate questions in systematics and phylogeography. However, easy access to sophisticated computational tools is not without its drawbacks. Choosing the right approach for one's question can be challenging when presented with multitudinous options, some of which fail to distinguish between species and intraspecific population structure. Here, we employ a methodology that emphasizes intensive geographic sampling, particularly at contact zones between populations, with a focus on differentiating intraspecific genetic clusters from species in the Pantherophis guttatus complex, a group of North American ratsnakes. Using a mitochondrial marker as well as ddRADseq data, we find evidence of mitonuclear discordance which has contributed to historical confusion about the relationships within this group. Additionally, we identify geographically and genetically structured populations within the species Pantherophis emoryi that are congruent with previously described morphological variation. Importantly, we find that these structured populations within P. emoryi are highly admixed throughout the range of the species and show no evidence of any reproductive isolation. Our data support a revision of the taxonomy of this group, and we recognize two species within the complex and three subspecies within P. emoryi. This study illustrates the importance of thorough sampling of contact zones and consideration of gene flow when delimiting species in widespread complexes containing parapatric lineages.

AB The moose is a highly prized game species in North America and is often the target of illegal harvesting. Forensic DNA analysis can be used to assist in investigations into wildlife crime by providing the link between the illegal incidents and suspects. In this study, we present the development and validation of a short-tandem repeat (STR) based forensic DNA test for the individualization of moose in Alberta and Yukon, Canada. We show that the markers used in the test are appropriate for forensic use and are sufficiently specific to moose. We also demonstrate the limit of detection and quantitation of the moose STR test on the ABI 3500 genetic analyzer. Lastly, we describe the population genetic structure of moose present in our forensic population database and make recommendations regarding the calculation of appropriately conservative forensic statistics.

AB Distinguishing neutral and adaptive genetic variation is one of the main challenges in investigating processes shaping population structure in the wild, and landscape genomics can help identify signatures of adaptation to contrasting environments. Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice-free period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Results from three gene-environment association methods supported the hypothesis of local adaptation to both freshwater and marine environments (strongest associations with sea surface and air temperatures during summer and salinity). Our results support a fisheries management strategy at a regional scale, and other implications for hatchery projects and adaptation to climate change are discussed.

AB Tropical and subtropical acidic soils have been well documented as hotspots of global soil nitrogen (N) oxide (i.e., nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions). While the effectiveness of possible mitigation options has been extensively examined in croplands, little is known about their effectiveness in reducing N-oxide emissions from acidic soils of rapidly expanding tea plantations in China. Here, we conducted a 2-year field experiment to investigate how organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer and biochar amendment affect soil N-oxide emissions from a subtropical tea plantation. Across the 2-year measurement period, full organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer significantly increased N2O emissions by an average of 17% while had a lower NO emission compared to synthetic fertilizer alone. Our global meta-analysis further revealed that full or partial organic fertilizer substitution resulted in a 29% (95% confidence interval: 5%-60%) increase of N2O emissions from acidic soils. In contrast, irrespective of fertilizer type, biochar amendment significantly reduced N2O emissions by 14% in the first but not second experimental year, suggesting a transient effect. The trade-off effect of full organic substitution on N2O and NO emissions may be attributed to the favorable conditions for N2O production due to the stimulated activity of nitrifiers and denitrifiers. The suppression of N2O emission following biochar amendment was probably due to promoted further reduction of N2O to dinitrogen. The fertilizer-induced emission factor (EF) of N2O (2.1%) in the tea plantation was greater than the current IPCC default value, but the EF of NO (0.8%) was comparable to the global estimate. Taken together, while biochar amendment could have mitigation potential, cautions are needed when applying organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer as mitigation options for acidic soils as hotspots of N-oxide emissions.

AB In socially living mammals, females often form highly differentiated and stable social relationships, commonly with genetically related individuals, which leads to social clusters within groups (i.e. matrilines). However, in primates, research on female social relationships commonly focuses on species and populations with female philopatry and the frequent occurrence of affiliative and agonistic behaviours. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the long-term patterns of female social relationships in a primate with female-biased dispersal, where affiliative and agonistic behaviours among females are rare. We analysed 9 years of continuous data from female Ugandan red colobus monkeys, Piliocolobus tephrosceles, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, and used spatial proximity to establish social networks for 3- and 6month periods. Then, we investigated the differentiation, stability and clustering of social relationships for each of these periods using several approaches. As expected for a primate with female-biased dispersal, our results largely confirmed the absence of temporally stable social relationships and social clusters within the group. However, in about half of the analysed time periods, females formed differentiated social relationships. This indicates that factors other than dispersal patterns and within-group contest competition contribute to the formation of the ephemeral relationships, as measured by spatial proximity, among female red colobus. Therefore, our results on the patterns of female social relationships in a primate with female-biased dispersal provide important empirical insight for the refinements of theories that aim to explain social evolution in mammals.

AB Reducing building energy consumption is of foremost importance to achieve energy and environmental sustainability. However, upgrading the physical properties of the buildings alone may not be enough to reduce their energy consumption, since occupants' behaviour is a determining factor on the real consumption of a building. In this regard, the use of in-home displays (IHDs) can represent a valid help for increasing user awareness, while also preventing the so-called rebound effect. Recent studies have questioned the estimates of benefits of IHDs available in the literature. In this context, the aim of this work is to provide detailed qualitative and quantitative analyses of the effect of IHDs on more than 200 apartments in four Danish buildings. The consumptions of heating, electricity and water were monitored along with the tenants' use of the IHDs. Qualitative research methods were used to provide context to the quantitative findings and helped explaining the findings of the quantitative analyses. The qualitative research activities began in September 2015 and continued until October 2019, while the energy monitoring campaign was performed in the period December 2016-June 2019. In one building, the screens did not work for more than a year after installation. When the IHDs started working in this building, the average consumption of cold water, hot water, electricity and heating decreased by 17%, 23%, 12% and 17%, respectively. End-user interviews supported this and found a positive impact of the IHDs. There was no correlation between the residents' level of interactions with the IHDs and the consumption.

AB Tetraclinis articulata is a xerothermic Mediterranean conifer native from NW Africa that grows under semiarid conditions in the Atlas Mountains. This species is particularly well adapted to water scarcity and forms xeric woodlands subjected to recurring drought, aridification and overexploitation. Wood of T. articulata has been considered of limited dendrochronological value due to abundant anatomical anomalies in their growth rings. We studied tree-ring growth and tree-ring features to check its dendrochronological potential and evaluate their climatic signals and drought legacy effects at two semiarid sites with contrasting elevation in Morocco. Tree-ring boundaries were properly identified on wood cores from 60 to 68% of the sampled trees. Intra-annual wood density fluctuations (IADF), microrings, missing rings and rings with undefined limits were most abundant at the low-elevation coastal site than at the mountain site. Microring and missing ring abundance was inversely related to tree-ring growth, independent of cambial age, and mostly dependent on drought occurrence. IADF frequency was independent of tree-ring growth but inversely related to cambial age. A complex response of IADF formation to cool March to June conditions was found at the low-elevation coastal site, while IADF formation in the mountain site was related to May water availability. Undefined ring limits were observed only at the lowelevation site, showing positive relationships with elevated maximum temperatures in previous winter. Previous winter rainfall favored radial growth, but a significant legacy effect of water availability was evident up to three years prior to growth. Tree-ring growth was mostly related to water availability 33 and 26 months prior to growth at low-elevation and mountain sites, respectively. The obtained results reveal a very plastic cambial activity and a strong ability of T. articulata to withstand drought even for long periods.

AB The breadth of a species' climatic niche is an important ecological trait that allows adaptation to climate change, but human activities often reduce realised niche breadth by impacting species distributions. Some life-history traits, such as dispersal ability and reproductive speed, allow species to cope with both human impact and climate change. But how do these traits interact with human pressure to determine niche change? Here we investigate the patterns and drivers of change in the realised climatic niche of 258 terrestrial mammal species. Our goal is to disentangle the impacts of human land use, climate change and life history. We quantified the past and present climatic niches of each species by considering past climatic conditions (Mid Holocene) within their pre-human impact distributions, and current climatic conditions within the current distributions. Depending on the difference between past and current niche, we defined four categories of change: 'shrink', 'shift', 'stable' and 'expand'. We found over half of the species in our sample have undergone niche shrink, while only one in six retained a stable niche. Climate change and distribution change were the strongest correlates of species niche change, followed by biogeography, anthropogenic land use and life-history traits. Factors that increased the probability of niche shrink included: overall climatic instability, reduction in distribution range, historical land use, large body mass and long weaning age. Species with these characteristics might require interventions that facilitate natural dispersal or assisted colonisation to survive rapidly changing climates.

AB Tropical forests uptake more atmospheric CO2 and transpire more water than any other forest in the world and are critical components of the global carbon and hydrological cycles. Both cycles depend to a great extent on the carbon and water balance of individual trees. Such adjustments are usually evaluated through well-established and newly-emerging traits but integrating them for a systemic understanding of trees' responses to climate change can be challenging. We propose using complex correlation networks to integrate and understand how trees coordinate water- and carbon-related traits under changing climate conditions. We built a correlation network based on 20 traits measured in the wood of Hymenaea courbaril (Leguminosae) trees, a species known for its extreme anisohydric water-use strategy, sampled along a climate gradient in Southeastern Brazil. Intercellular to ambient CO2 concentrations ratio (ci/ca, estimated from tree-ring delta 13C) is a central network trait for being coordinated with several hydraulic and carbon allocation traits. Trees of H. courbaril coordinate these traits along the climate gradient, favoring high ci/ca under warm and dry conditions. A high ci/ca is only possible through a consistent water supply provided by wider vessels together with the investment on soluble sugars, at the detriment of starch, likely for hydraulic maintenance. Trees also favor heat resistance by investing in cell-wall xylose, another central network trait, from xyloglucans and xylans, at the expense of mannose from glucomannans. Such trade-offs within, and between, structural and non-structural carbon allocation reflect wellknown metabolic pathways in plants. In summary, this systemic approach confirms previously reported patterns on leaf physiology, stem hydraulics and carbon adjustments while bringing to light the previously unreported role of cell-wall composition and its fine adjustments to cope with climate change.

AB Background Kiwi (Apteryx spp.) are flightless ratites from New Zealand whose numbers and distributions have declined following human arrival. Some of the kiwi species are known to hybridise but the extent of hybridization is unknown. Methods We reviewed hybridisation in kiwi (Apteryx spp.) and present new genetic data examining the extent of hybridisation between Rowi (A. rowi) and Little Spotted Kiwi (A. owenii) at Okarito, the location of the only remaining natural population of the threatened Rowi. We also genetically examined the syntype specimens of A. haastii Potts, 1872, collected from near Okarito in the 1870s, which have unusual morphologies. Results We found evidence of recurrent hybridisation between Rowi and Little Spotted Kiwi over the last 150 years, including one F1 hybrid found in the last 15 years, despite Little Spotted Kiwi's likely extinction on the mainland in the 1970s. However, we found little evidence of introgression of Little Spotted Kiwi alleles into the extant Rowi population. The syntype specimens of A. haastii were also found to be hybrids between Little Spotted Kiwi and Rowi. Conclusions Our genetic analyses indicate that, although we detected multiple instances of hybridisation between Rowi and Little Spotted Kiwi, it does not appear to be an ongoing threat to Rowi. Because the syntype specimens of A. haastii are hybrids and therefore not representative of the prevailing usage of the name for the Great Spotted Kiwi (A. haastii), we resurrect the nomen oblitum A. maxima Sclater and Hochstetter, 1861 for the large spotted kiwi species.

AB How people choose between options with differing outcomes (explore-exploit) is a central question to understanding human behaviour. However, the standard explore-exploit paradigm relies on gamified tasks with lowstake outcomes. Consequently, little is known about decision making for biologically-relevant stimuli. Here, we combined placebo and explore-exploit paradigms to examine detection and selection of the most effective treatment in a pain model. During conditioning, where 'optimal' and 'suboptimal' sham-treatments were paired with a reduction in electrical pain stimulation, participants learnt which treatment most successfully reduced pain. Modelling participant responses revealed three important findings. First, participants' choices reflected both directed and random exploration. Second, expectancy modulated pain - indicative of recursive placebo effects. Third, individual differences in terms of expectancy during conditioning predicted placebo effects during a subsequent test phase. These findings reveal directed and random exploration when the outcome is biologically-relevant. Moreover, this research shows how placebo and explore-exploit literatures can be unified.

AB Globally, forests are facing an increasing risk of mass tree mortality events associated with extreme droughts and higher temperatures. Hydraulic dysfunction is considered a key mechanism of drought-triggered dieback. By leveraging the climate breadth of the Australian landscape and a national network of research sites (Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network), we conducted a continental-scale study of physiological and hydraulic traits of 33 native tree species from contrasting environments to disentangle the complexities of plant response to drought across communities. We found strong relationships between key plant hydraulic traits and site aridity. Leaf turgor loss point and xylem embolism resistance were correlated with minimum water potential experienced by each species. Across the data set, there was a strong coordination between hydraulic traits, including those linked to hydraulic safety, stomatal regulation and the cost of carbon investment into woody tissue. These results illustrate that aridity has acted as a strong selective pressure, shaping hydraulic traits of tree species across the Australian landscape. Hydraulic safety margins were constrained across sites, with species from wetter sites tending to have smaller safety margin compared with species at drier sites, suggesting trees are operating close to their hydraulic thresholds and forest biomes across the spectrum may be susceptible to shifts in climate that result in the intensification of drought.

AB Variation in life-history traits within a population is caused by genetic, maternal and environmental factors. We explored the high variability in development time, adult body weight and fecundity in females of the sexually size dimorphic spider Trichonephila senegalensis. Their mothers originated from two habitats-strongly seasonal Namibia and mildly seasonal South Africa-and we reared F1 females under standardized laboratory conditions. We found that a considerable part of the variability in recorded life-history traits is caused by family-specific effects, comprising genetic, maternal and early environmental influences. Furthermore, we show population differences in development time, where females originating from Namibia matured within shorter periods than females from South Africa. Also, the relationship between development time and adult weight differs between the two populations, as a significant correlation is only found in females with Namibian origin. Against common wisdom, there was a weak overall correlation between adult weight and clutch mass. We also found that females make different life-history decisions under increasing rather than under decreasing daylength. Although a considerable part of variability in life-history traits is family-specific, we discuss how the between-population differences in life histories and their trade-offs reflect adaptation to diverse habitats.

AB The grasshopper Ommexecha virens Serville has low dispersion capacity, and it is regarded as a specialist, only being found in sandy, dry environments with high incidence of sunlight. Considering these aspects, we evaluated the diversity and genetic structure of O. virens natural populations using ISSR (Inter Simple Sequence Repeat) markers. The data pointed to low expected heterozygosity for some populations (H-E = 0.06-0.09), probably a consequence of positive inbreeding, which is typical of species showing low or null dispersion indices. Moreover, significant genetic differentiation was observed (F-ST = 0.50 and G(ST) = 0.51), as well as low number of migrants (N-m = 0.47), indicating that the populations are genetically differentiated. This is likely related to the limitation in dispersing and fragmentation of suitable environment localities colonized by O. virens. The populations of O. virens were structured in three genetic groups associated to different landscapes, revealing the presence of a secondary contact zone, possibly arisen from isolation followed by genetic divergence among populations and subsequent gene flow of divergent individuals of O. virens. At last, we found positive isolation by distance (IBD; r: 0.427; P: 0.025) which is an important factor, since it may be adding to the emergence of reproductive barriers among individuals of O. virens that have been experiencing isolation.

AB The genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are essential to determine the genetic bases of either ecological or economic phenotypic variation across individuals within populations of the model and nonmodel organisms. For this research question, the GWAS replication testing different parameters and models to validate the results' reproducibility is common. However, straightforward methodologies that manage both replication and tetraploid data are still missing. To solve this problem, we designed the MultiGWAS, a tool that does GWAS for diploid and tetraploid organisms by executing in parallel four software packages, two designed for polyploid data (GWASpoly and SHEsis) and two designed for diploid data (GAPIT and TASSEL). MultiGWAS has several advantages. It runs either in the command line or in a graphical interface; it manages different genotype formats, including VCF. Moreover, it allows control for population structure, relatedness, and several quality control checks on genotype data. Besides, MultiGWAS can test for additive and dominant gene action models, and, through a proprietary scoring function, select the best model to report its associations. Finally, it generates several reports that facilitate identifying false associations from both the significant and the best-ranked association Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) among the four software packages. We tested MultiGWAS with public tetraploid potato data for tuber shape and several simulated data under both additive and dominant models. These tests demonstrated that MultiGWAS is better at detecting reliable associations than using each of the four software packages individually. Moreover, the parallel analysis of polyploid and diploid software that only offers MultiGWAS demonstrates its utility in understanding the best genetic model behind the SNP association in tetraploid organisms. Therefore, MultiGWAS probed to be an excellent alternative for wrapping GWAS replication in diploid and tetraploid organisms in a single analysis environment.

AB Reef-building species are recognized as having an important ecological role and as generally enhancing the diversity of benthic organisms in marine habitats. However, although these ecosystem engineers have a facilitating role for some species, they may exclude or compete with others. The honeycomb worm Sabelaria alveolata (Linnaeus, 1767) is an important foundation species, commonly found from northwest Ireland to northern Mauritania, whose reef structures increase the physical complexity of the marine benthos, supporting high levels of biodiversity. Local patterns and regional differences in taxonomic and functional diversity were examined in honeycomb worm reefs from 10 sites along the northeastern Atlantic to explore variation in diversity across biogeographic regions and the potential effects of environmental drivers. While taxonomic composition varied across the study sites, levels of diversity remained relatively constant along the European coast. Assemblages showed high levels of species turnover compared to differences in richness, which varied primarily in response to sea surface temperatures and sediment content, the latter suggesting that local characteristics of the reef had a greater effect on community composition than the density of the engineering species. In contrast, the functional composition of assemblages was similar regardless of taxonomic composition or biogeography, with five functional groups being observed in all sites and only small differences in abundance in these groups being detected. Functional groups represented primarily filter-feeders and deposit-feeders, with the notable absence of herbivores, indicating that the reefs may act as biological filters for some species from the local pool of organisms. Redundancy was observed within functional groups that may indicate that honeycomb worm reefs can offer similar niche properties to its associated assemblages across varying environmental conditions. These results highlight the advantages of comparing taxonomic and functional metrics, which allow identification of a number of ecological processes that structure marine communities.

AB Wildlife species impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation often require conservation efforts to maintain populations. Long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) still persist within the highly urbanised matrix of northern Sydney (Australia). One population at North Head, Sydney, is currently listed as an Endangered population due to its small size, apparent isolation and other threats. To support future management, we used 1,446 single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) from 167 bandicoots to: i) assess the assumption of isolation and determine if genetic structuring is present between North Head and individuals from 11 other localities in northern Sydney, and ii) investigate genetic diversity over time in the North Head population from 2002 to 2018. Analyses confirmed population structuring and genetic divergence between North Head and greater northern Sydney. Three distinct populations were identified that corresponded to geographic localities (North Head, northern Sydney and Mosman). All populations were significantly differentiated (F-ST = 0.171-0.345), suggesting local genetic drift between localities. North Head genetic diversity indices estimated between 2002 to 2018 showed relatively constant levels of allelic richness (1.90-2.00) and observed heterozygosity (H-O = 0.231-0.310) along with minor levels of inbreeding (F-IS 0.020-0.052). The identification of some individuals sampled on North Head that were assigned to other populations suggests some sporadic geneflow into the population has occurred and may have assisted with maintaining genetic diversity. These data suggest that the North Head population is distinct from other northern Sydney populations and has relatively constant levels of genetic diversity.

AB Bumblebees are important pollinators for many wild plants and crops. However, the bumblebee populations are seriously declining in many parts of the world. Hence, the bumblebee conservation strategy should be urgently addressed, and the species distribution modeling approach can effectively evaluate the potentially suitable areas for their conservation. Here, one of the most abundant and endemic species of bumblebee in China, Bombus pyrosoma, was selected to assess current and future climates' influence on its distribution with MaxEnt. Nine high-resolution bioclimatic/environmental variables with high contribution rates and low correlations were used. Four of the nine bioclimatic/environmental variables, min temperature of the coldest month (bio_06), annual mean temperature (bio_01), precipitation of wettest month (bio_13) and radiation of warmest quarter (bio_26), were found to be the most critical factors influencing the distribution of B. pyrosoma. The modeling results showed that the areas with high and moderate suitability for B. pyrosoma covered 141,858 and 186,198 km(2) under the current climate conditions. More than 85% of the sampling sites in 2019 were found to be suitable under the current scenario. Under the future A1B and A2 scenarios in 2050 and 2100, the areas with low and moderate suitability for B. pyrosoma increased. However, alarmingly, the high suitability areas decreased under the future A1B and A2 scenarios in 2050 and 2100. Furthermore, regions covering seven provinces of northern China were the most crucial for developing nature reserves for B. pyrosoma, with the following order of suitable areas: Gansu, Shanxi, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Hebei and Beijing. Our study highlights the impact of future climate changes on the distribution of B. pyrosoma, and conservation strategies should mitigate the threats posed by environmental changes, particularly in the current high suitability areas.

AB The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) is a 4 million km(2) area in the eastern Central Pacific Ocean exhibiting large variability in environmental parameters, particularly oxygen and primary production, that is being targeted for deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining. This remote region's pelagic biology is very poorly sampled, including for micronekton and zooplankton that provide essential ecosystem services such as carbon flux and support for commercial fisheries. We built a baseline of deep scattering layer (DSL) depths and vertical migration behaviors, proxies for mesopelagic micronekton and zooplankton communities, using shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler datasets. Acoustic data (38 kHz, 75 kHz) were compiled from research cruises passing near or through the CCZ (2004-2019), and environmental data (mean midwater oxygen partial pressure, surface chlorophyll-a, and sea surface height anomaly) were assembled from the World Ocean Atlas and satellite oceanographic datasets. Our results suggest that midwater oxygen, associated with the Eastern Tropical Pacific Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ), is the strongest predictor of daytime DSL depths and the proportions of midwater populations that undergo vertical migration in this region. We used these relationships to predict micronekton and zooplankton behaviors across the CCZ, including licensed mining exploration areas and no-mining reserves. While the OMZ encompasses most licensed exploration areas, the current network of reserves lies outside of the core OMZ and ultimately may not represent or protect the pelagic OMZ fauna at highest risk from mining impacts. This research will further assist in developing resource exploitation regulations by the International Seabed Authority, and will provide mesopelagic baseline information for monitoring changes that may occur in the CCZ once industrial-scale mining begins.

AB The composition and diversity of animal microbiomes is shaped by a variety of factors, many of them interacting, such as host traits, the environment, and biogeography. Hybrid zones, in which the ranges of two host species meet and hybrids are found, provide natural experiments for determining the drivers of microbiome communities, but have not been well studied in marine environments. Here, we analysed the composition of the symbiont community in two deep-sea, Bathymodiolus mussel species along their known distribution range at hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with a focus on the hybrid zone where they interbreed. In-depth metagenomic analyses of the sulphur-oxidising symbionts of 30 mussels from the hybrid zone, at a resolution of single nucleotide polymorphism analyses of similar to 2500 orthologous genes, revealed that parental and hybrid mussels (F2-F4 generation) have genetically indistinguishable symbionts. While host genetics does not appear to affect symbiont composition in these mussels, redundancy analyses showed that geographic location of the mussels on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge explained most of the symbiont genetic variability compared to the other factors. We hypothesise that geographic structuring of the free-living symbiont population plays a major role in driving the composition of the microbiome in these deep-sea mussels.

AB OBJECTIVES: The risk of brain injury following surgery for type A aortic dissection (TAAD) remains substantial and no consensus has still been reached on which neuroprotective technique should be preferred. We aimed to investigate the association between neuroprotective strategies and clinical outcomes following TAAD repair.
   METHODS: Using the UK National Adult Cardiac Surgical Audit, we identified 1929 patients undergoing surgery for TAAD (2011-2018). Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) only, unilateral (uACP), bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (bACP) and retrograde cerebral perfusion were used in 830, 117, 760 and 222 patients, respectively. The primary end point was a composite of death and/or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Generalized linear mixed model was used to adjust the effect of neuroprotective strategies for other confounders.
   RESULTS: The use of bACP was associated with longer circulatory arrest (CA) compared to other strategies. There was a trend towards lower incidence of death and/or CVA using uACP only for shorter CA. In particular, primary end point rate was 27.7% overall and 26.5%, 12.5%, 28.0% and 22.9% for CA <30 min and 28.6%, 30.4%, 33.3% and 33.0% for CA >= 30 min with DHCA only, uACP, bACP and retrograde cerebral perfusion, respectively. The use of DHCA only was associated with five-fold [odds ratio (OR) 5.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36-21.02] and two-fold (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.01-3.09) increased risk of death and/or CVA compared to uACP and bACP, respectively, but the effect of uACP was significantly associated with CA duration (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99; P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: In TAAD repair, the use of uACP and bACP was associated with a lower adjusted risk of death and/or CVA when compared to DHCA. uACP can offer some advantage but only for a shorter CA duration.

AB Mediterranean tree species have evolved to face seasonal water shortages, but may fail to cope with future increases in drought frequency and intensity. We investigated stem radial increment dynamics in two typical Mediterranean tree species, Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), a drought-avoiding species, and holm oak (Quercus ilex), a drought-tolerant species, in a mixed forest and on contrasting slope aspects (south- and north-facing). Intra- and inter-annual growth patterns were modelled using the VS-Lite2 model for each tree species and slope-aspect. Both species showed a bimodal growth pattern, with peaks coinciding with favourable conditions in spring and autumn. A bimodal growth pattern is always observed in P. halepensis, while in Q. ilex is facultative, which suggests different strategies adopted by these species to cope with summer drought. More specifically, trees on south-facing slope showed a more evident bimodal pattern and more intra-annual density fluctuations. In recent decades, the intensity of both growth peaks has diminished and drifted away due to the increased summer drought. The VS-Lite2 model reveals a niche partitioning between both species. Differences in growing season's length and timings of growth peaks in both species are relevant for their coexistence and should be considered for estimating mixed-forest responses under climate change scenarios.

AB Male ornamentation, such as conspicuous male coloration, can evolve through female mate choice. Alternatively, in species without overt female mate preference, conspicuous male coloration can evolve as a badge of status via intrasexual selection to avoid costly fights or prevent mating attempts with other males. Here, we investigated the drivers of conspicuous male coloration in an ontogenetic colourchanging damselfly, Xanthagrion erythroneurum, where the juvenile males are yellow and change colour to red upon sexual maturity. We first showed that red males were chromatically and achromatically more conspicuous than the yellow males. We then quantified the condition of the males: red males were larger and in better condition than yellow males. We tested female preference in a choice experiment where we artificially manipulated male colour and found that females did not choose mates based on male coloration. We further tested whether the male coloration affected male-male interactions. We presented red and yellow males at the breeding site and measured behavioural responses from conspecific males and heterospecific (Ischnura heterosticta) males. Red males received less aggression from conspecifics and heterospecifics than yellow males. Our study experimentally showed that male conspicuousness is not a target of female mate choice in damselflies. Instead, intra- and interspecific male-male interactions appear to be the driver of its evolution.

AB Key Message Hybrid saplings were more reactive to soil water deficit than Japanese and European larch. European larch had hydraulically safer wood and anisohydric behavior, Japanese and hybrid larch showed isohydric strategy. Deciduous larch species could be an alternative to evergreen conifers in reforestation, but little is known about drought sensitivity of their saplings. The effect of an experimental drought on hydraulics and quantitative wood anatomy was tested on saplings of European larch (EL, Larix decidua), Japanese larch (JL, Larix kaempferi) and their hybrid (HL). Across species, biomass, transpiration rate and relative water content were higher in controls than in drought stressed trees, but transpiration efficiency was lower. JL had the highest transpiration efficiency under drought, and EL the lowest, coinciding with slower growth of EL. Wood of EL formed before drought was hydraulically safer as shown by higher wall/lumen ratio and lower pit cavity area. EL neither had a significant increase in transpiration efficiency nor a reduction in transpiration rate under drought, suggesting that the stomata remained open under soil water deficit. HL saplings were the most reactive to water shortage, indicated by intra-annual density fluctuations and a decrease in relative water content of the sapwood. Significant reduction in transpiration by HL suggested a higher stomatal sensitivity, while the same leaf surface area was maintained and radial growth was still similar to its best parent, the JL. The latter showed a significantly lower leaf surface area under drought than controls. EL, with its hydraulically safer wood, followed an anisohydric behavior, while JL and HL revealed an isohydric strategy. Altogether, our results suggest species dependent acclimations to drought stress, whereby HL followed the strategy of JL rather than that of EL.

Karst. and Fagus sylvatica (L.) are important tree species in Europe, and the foreseen increase in temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) could increase the vulnerability of these species. However, their physiological performance under climate change at temperate and productive sites is not yet fully understood, especially in uneven-aged stands. Therefore, we investigated tree-ring width and stable isotope chronologies (delta C-13/delta O-18) of these two species at 10 sites along a climate gradient in Central Europe. In these uneven-aged stands, we compared the year-to-year variability of dominant and suppressed trees for the last 80 years in relation to the sites' spatial distribution and climate. delta O-18 and delta C-13 were generally consistent across sites and species, showing high sensitivity to summer VPD, whereas climate correlations with radial growth varied much more and depended on mean local climate. We found no significant differences between dominant and suppressed trees in the response of stable isotope ratios to climate variability, especially within the annual high-frequency signals. In addition, we observed a strikingly high coherence of the high-frequency delta O-18 variations across long distances with significant correlations above 1500 km, whereas the spatial agreement of delta C-13 variations was weaker (similar to 700 km). We applied a dual-isotope approach that is based on known theoretical understanding of isotope fractionations to translate the observed changes into physiological components, mainly photosynthetic assimilation rate and stomatal conductance. When separating the chronologies in two time windows and investigating the shifts in isotopes ratios, a significant enrichment of either or both isotope ratios over the last decades can be observed. These results, translated by the dual-isotope approach, indicate a general climate-driven decrease in stomatal conductance. This improved understanding of the physiological mechanisms controlling the short-term variation of the isotopic signature will help to define the performance of these tree species under future climate.

AB Drought will increasingly threaten forest ecosystems worldwide. Understanding how competition influences tree growth response to drought is essential for forest management aiming at climate change adaptation. However, published results from individual case studies are heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory. We reviewed 166 cases from the peer-reviewed literature to assess the influence of stand-level competition on tree growth response to drought. We monitored five indicators of tree growth response: mean sensitivity (inter-annual tree ring width variability); association between inter-annual growth variability and water availability; resistance; recovery; and resilience to drought. Vote counting did not indicate a consistent effect of competition on mean sensitivity. Conversely, higher competition for resources strengthened the association between water availability and inter-annual growth rates. Meta-analysis showed that higher competition reduced resistance (p < 0.001) and improved recovery (p < 0.05), but did not consistently affect resilience. Species, site and stand characteristics, and drought intensity were insignificant or poor predictors for the large variability among the investigated cases. Our review and meta-analysis show that competition does not affect the response of tree growth to drought in a unidirectional and universal way. Although density reduction (thinning) can alleviate growth declines during drought, the effects on growth after stress are uncertain. The large variability among investigated cases suggests that local-scale processes play a crucial role in determining such responses and should be explicitly evaluated and integrated into specific strategies for adaptation of forests to climate change.

AB Background: Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is employed to assess "functional connections" of signal between brain regions. However, multiple rs-fMRI paradigms and data-filtering strategies have been used, highlighting the need to explore BOLD signal across the spectrum. Rs-fMRI data is typically filtered at frequencies ranging between 0.008-0.2 Hz to mitigate nuisance signal (e.g. cardiac, respiratory) and maximize neuronal BOLD signal. However, some argue neuronal BOLD signal may be parsed at higher frequencies. New method: To assess the contributions of rs-fMRI along the BOLD spectra on functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices, a spatially constrained independent component analysis (ICA) was performed at seven different frequency "bins", after which FNC values and FNC measures of matrix-randomness were assessed using linear mixed models. Results: Results show FNCs at higher-frequency bins display similar randomness to those from the typical frequency bins (0.01-0.15), while the largest values are in the 0.31-0.46 Hz bin. Eyes open (EO) vs eyes closed (EC) comparison found EC was less random than EO across most frequency bins. Further, FNC was greater in EC across auditory and cognitive control pairings while EO values were greater in somatomotor, visual, and default mode FNC. Comparison with existing methods: Effect sizes of frequency and resting-state paradigm vary from small to large, but the most notable results are specific to frequency ranges and resting-state paradigm with artifacts like motion displaying negligible effect sizes. Conclusions: These suggest unique information may be derived from FNC matrices across frequencies and paradigms, but additional data is necessary prior to any definitive conclusions.

AB Large carnivores are currently disappearing from many world regions because of habitat loss, prey depletion, and persecution. Ensuring large carnivore persistence requires safeguarding and sometimes facilitating the expansion of their populations. Understanding which conservation strategies, such as reducing persecution or restoring prey, are most effective to help carnivores to reclaim their former ranges is therefore important. Here, we systematically explored such alternative strategies for the endangered Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) in the Caucasus. We combined a rule-based habitat suitability map and a spatially explicit leopard population model to identify potential leopard subpopulations (i.e., breeding patches), and to test the effect of different levels of persecution reduction and prey restoration on leopard population viability across the entire Caucasus ecoregion and northern Iran (about 737,000 km(2)). We identified substantial areas of potentially suitable leopard habitat (similar to 120,000 km(2)), most of which is currently unoccupied. Our model revealed that leopards could potentially recolonize these patches and increase to a population of >1,000 individuals in 100 yr, but only in scenarios of medium to high persecution reduction and prey restoration. Overall, reducing persecution had a more pronounced effect on leopard metapopulation viability than prey restoration: Without conservation strategies to reduce persecution, leopards went extinct from the Caucasus in all scenarios tested. Our study highlights the importance of persecution reduction in small populations, which should hence be prioritized when resources for conservation are limited. We show how individual-based, spatially explicit metapopulation models can help in quantifying the recolonization potential of large carnivores in unoccupied habitat, designing adequate conservation strategies to foster such recolonizations, and anticipating the long-term prospects of carnivore populations under alternative scenarios. Our study also outlines how data scarcity, which is typical for threatened range-expanding species, can be overcome with a rule-based habitat map. For Persian leopards, our projections clearly suggest that there is a large potential for a viable metapopulation in the Caucasus, but only if major conservation actions are taken towards reducing persecution and restoring prey.

AB Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock-replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re-establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pretranslocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting-edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced-representation genomic sequencing from 1143 deer sampled statewide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpson's diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of re-colonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a statewide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas is also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.

AB C1Q (Complement 1Q) is an important recognition molecule in the immunological complement system, which could also be putatively involved in the stress responses induced by endotoxins or exotoxins, potentially through detoxification processes. Marine bivalves are well adapted to highly complex aquatic environments with various stressors. As filter feeders, they have to cope with highly potent microalgae-derived neurotoxins, such as paralytic shellfish toxin (PSTs). Zhikong scallops, Chlamys farreri, are commercially important bivalve with the remarkable ability to accumulate PSTs. Exploring the C1Qs related to PST accumulation in C. farreri could benefit our understanding of the adaptations of bivalve species. In the present study, we systematically analyzed C1Q genes in C. farreri. In total, 97 CfC1Q genes mainly from the expanded C1Q-B subfamily were identified, from which the C1QL, C1QTNF, and C1QDC1 members in C. farreri were revealed to be under positive selection. Spatiotemporal expression analysis revealed that most CfC1QLs and CfC1QDC1s were highly expressed during the post-umbo stage and in hepatopancreas, while most CfC1QTNF members were highly expressed after the creeping larva stage and in mantle. The hepatopancreas and kidney in C. farreri are two toxin-rich organs with the highest concentrations of PSTs, acting as major "centers" for toxin accumulation and transformation, respectively. Therefore, after feeding the scallops with PST-producing dinoflagellates Alexandrium minutum and Alexandrium catenella, we determined the expression patterns of CfC1Qs in these two organs. In kidney, more than 85% of CfC1QLs and CfC1QDC1s showed drastic up-regulation with both diets. However, among these members with significant induction, a different response manner was detected after feeding with A. minutum and A. catenella, respectively as acute and chronic response patterns. In comparison, far fewer CfC1Qs showing significant up-regulation in hepatopancreas with both toxic diets and only mild regulation pattern could be found. This organ-, toxin-, and time-dependent genetic regulation of CfC1Qs may contribute to the virulence difference on account of the tissue-specific or dinoflagellate-specific different toxin analogs composition, implying the possible involvement of CfC1Qs in PST transport and homeostasis. Our findings imply the functional diversity of scallop C1Q genes in coping with PST accumulation, which might be developed as potential molecular indicators for monitoring toxin accumulation in edible mollusks or provide insight into the lineage-specific adaptation of scallops for dealing with microalgal toxin challenges.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY

DE Conflicts; Dominance; Macaques; Mounts; Relationship; Sex
AB Generally, nonreproductive sex is thought to act as "social grease," facilitating peaceful coexistence between subjects that lack close genetic ties. However, specifc nonreproductive sexual behaviors may fulfill different functions. With this study, we aimed to test whether nonreproductive mounts in Barbary macaques are used to 1) assert dominance, 2) reinforce social relationships, and/or 3) solve conflicts. We analyzed nonreproductive mounts (N = 236) and postmount behavior in both aggressive and nonaggressive contexts, in 118 individuals belonging to two semi-free-ranging groups at La Montagne des Singes (France). As predicted by the dominance assertion hypothesis, the probability to be the mounter increased with rank difference, especially in aggressive contexts (increasing from 0.066 to 0.797 in nonaggressive contexts, and from 0.011 to 0.969 in aggressive contexts, when the rank difference was minimal vs. maximal). The strength of the social bond did not significantly predict the proportion of mounts across dyads in nonaggressive contexts, providing no support for the relationship reinforcement hypothesis. Finally, in support of the conflict resolution hypothesis, when individuals engaged in postconflict mounts, 1) the probability of being involved in further aggression decreased from 0.825 to 0.517, while 2) the probability of being involved in grooming interactions with each other increased from 0.119 to 0.606. The strength of the social bond between former opponents had no significant effect on grooming occurrence and agonistic behavior after postconflict mounts. Overall, our findings suggest that nonreproductive mounts in Barbary macaques have different functions that are not affected by the strength of the social bond.

AB Though there is substantial evidence that individuals can prioritize more valuable information in visual working memory (WM), little research has examined this in the verbal domain. Four experiments were conducted to investigate this and the conditions under which effects emerge. In each experiment, participants listened to digit sequences and then attempted to recall them in the correct order. At the start of each block, participants were either told that all items were of equal value, or that an item at a particular serial position was worth more points. Recall was enhanced for these higher value items (Experiment 1a), a finding that was replicated while rejecting an alternative account based on distinctiveness (Experiment 1b). Thus, valuable information can be prioritized in verbal WM. Two further experiments investigated whether these boosts remained when participants completed a simple concurrent task disrupting verbal rehearsal (Experiment 2), or a complex concurrent task disrupting verbal rehearsal and executive resources (Experiment 3). Under simple concurrent task conditions, prioritization boosts were observed, but with increased costs to the less valuable items. Prioritization effects were also observed under complex concurrent task conditions, although this was accompanied by chance-level performance at most of the less valuable positions. A substantial recency advantage was also observed for the final item in each sequence, across all conditions. Taken together, this indicates that individuals can prioritize valuable information in verbal WM even when rehearsal and executive resources are disrupted, though they do so by neglecting or abandoning other items in the sequence.

AB The campo rupestre sensu lato is a vegetation type that occurs in South American mountains, supports a distinctive flora characterized by high rates of endemism, high herbaceous species richness and often-neglected but also species-rich of the arboreal stratum. We aimed to investigate how environmental factors and elevation are associated with the distribution and diversity of woody species in different rupestrian vegetation types across South America. Using a database of 2,049 woody species from 185 sites across four vegetation types within the campo rupestre, we assessed how the vegetation types were grouped according to their floristic composition and number of shared indicator species, as well as by using different beta diversity indices. The most important variables from a set of 27 variables (e.g. altitude, geo-edaphic and climatic) explaining species distribution were identified using redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning methods. The distribution of vegetation types was related to both environmental and spatial fractions, with a set of 17 variables retained (e.g. rockiness, grass cover and temperature seasonality as the most important variables). There was an association between the floristic composition of each vegetation type and the elevation range. Although the identified vegetation types are floristically related, they are distinguished by exclusive and habitat-specialist woody species. This uniqueness of vegetation types should be considered in terms of complementarity for the conservation of campos rupestres.

AB Increased risk of pathogen transmission through proximity and contact is a well-documented cost of sociality. Affiliative social contact, however, is an integral part of primate group life and can benefit health. Despite its importance to the evolution and maintenance of sociality, the tradeoff between costs and benefits of social contact for group-living primate species remains poorly understood. To improve our understanding of this interplay, we used social network analysis to investigate whether contact via association in the same space and/or physical contact measured through grooming were associated with helminth parasite species richness in a community of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). We identified parasite taxa in 381 fecal samples from 36 individuals from the Kasekela community of chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, from November 1, 2006, to October 31, 2012. Over the study period, eight environmentally transmitted helminth taxa were identified. We quantified three network metrics for association and grooming contact, including degree strength, betweenness, and closeness. Our findings suggest that more gregarious individuals-those who spent more time with more individuals in the same space-had higher parasite richness, while the connections in the grooming network were not related to parasite richness. The expected parasite richness in individuals increased by 1.13 taxa (CI: 1.04, 1.22; p = 0.02) per one standard deviation increase in degree strength of association contact. The results of this study add to the understanding of the role that different types of social contact play in the parasite richness of group-living social primates. Significance statement Parasite infections reveal costs of group living among wild animal populations. We studied the relationship between sociality and parasite transmission by assessing whether variation in social behavior among wild chimpanzees is associated with the number of unique helminth parasites detected in individual fecal samples. Our findings revealed that associating in the same shared space, but not grooming contact, is related to higher parasite richness. These findings improve our understanding of the complex interplay of parasitism and sociality with important implications for parasite transmission patterns in host species with flexible grouping patterns.

AB Permanent changes in group membership may result in detrimental fitness effects on both group residents and immigrants. Factors associated with this form of social instability are rarely documented. We used a 15-year dataset on degus, a social and short-lived species, to test the hypothesis that physical condition and socioecological factors experienced during breeding are associated with social instability in terms of group individual membership (hypothesis 1). We also tested the hypothesis that these factors represent potential cues for individuals to predict social instability conditions during subsequent breeding (i.e., exhibiting autocorrelation) (hypothesis 2). Social instability in degu group membership was ubiquitous. Social instability increased with increasing ectoparasite load but decreased with increasing food abundance, increasing degu density, increasing mean minimum temperature, and increasing number of female group members. Of these conditions, degu density during winter exhibited autocorrelation. Finally, overall predictability of ecological conditions varied from low to high within a 5-6-year period. These findings indicate that socioecological conditions experienced by the breeding adults and their developing offspring predict within-year social instability (hypothesis 1) and provide some limited cues to individuals to predict similar conditions during the subsequent breeding event (hypothesis 2).
   Significance statement
   Permanent changes in the adult composition of social groups (social instability) can have significant impacts on the fitness of group members. Determining the ecological and social conditions associated with social instability and whether individuals can anticipate social instability in adulthood can inform socioecological theory. In the communally rearing rodent, Octodon degus, social instability during breeding is ubiquitous and impacts the fitness of adult males and females differently. We determined that social instability in degu groups during breeding is associated with local ecological conditions (ambient temperature, ectoparasite loads, abundance of food, population density) and the social environment (number of adult females). Of the ecological variables, only population density exhibited autocorrelation. These results are important because they imply limited ecological cues available for the offspring to anticipate social instability conditions as adults.

AB Whole-genome doubling (polyploidy) is common in angiosperms. Several studies have indicated that it is often associated with molecular, physiological, and phenotypic changes. Mounting evidence has pointed out that micro-RNAs (miRNAs) may have an important role in whole-genome doubling. However, an integrative approach that compares miRNA expression in polyploids is still lacking. Here, a re-analysis of already published RNAseq datasets was performed to identify microRNAs' precursors (pre-miRNAs) in diploids (2x) and tetraploids (4x) of five species (Arabidopsis thaliana L., Morus alba L., Brassica rapa L., Isatis indigotica Fort., and Solanum commersonii Dun). We found 3568 pre-miRNAs, three of which (pre-miR414, pre-miR5538, and pre-miR5141) were abundant in all 2x, and were absent/low in their 4x counterparts. They are predicted to target more than one mRNA transcript, many belonging to transcription factors (TFs), DNA repair mechanisms, and related to stress. Sixteen pre-miRNAs were found in common in all 2x and 4x. Among them, pre-miRNA482, pre-miRNA2916, and pre-miRNA167 changed their expression after polyploidization, being induced or repressed in 4x plants. Based on our results, a common ploidy-dependent response was triggered in all species under investigation, which involves DNA repair, ATP-synthesis, terpenoid biosynthesis, and several stress-responsive transcripts. In addition, an ad hoc pre-miRNA expression analysis carried out solely on 2x vs. 4x samples of S. commersonii indicated that ploidy-dependent pre-miRNAs seem to actively regulate the nucleotide metabolism, probably to cope with the increased requirement for DNA building blocks caused by the augmented DNA content. Overall, the results outline the critical role of microRNA-mediated responses following autopolyploidization in plants.

AB Theories of cognition inform our decisions when designing human-computer interfaces, and immersive systems enable us to examine these theories. This work explores the sensemaking process in an immersive environment through studying both internal and external user behaviors with a classical visualization problem: a visual comparison and clustering task. We developed an immersive system to perform a user study, collecting user behavior data from different channels: AR HMD for capturing external user interactions, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for capturing internal neural sequences, and video for references. To examine sensemaking, we assessed how the layout of the interface (planar 2D vs. cylindrical 3D layout) and the challenge level of the task (low vs. high cognitive load) influenced the users' interactions, how these interactions changed over time, and how they influenced task performance. We also developed a visualization system to explore joint patterns among all the data channels. We found that increased interactions and cerebral hemodynamic responses were associated with more accurate performance, especially on cognitively demanding trials. The layout types did not reliably influence interactions or task performance. We discuss how these findings inform the design and evaluation of immersive systems, predict user performance and interaction, and offer theoretical insights about sensemaking from the perspective of embodied and distributed cognition.

AB Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers develop interventions to change behavior based on their understanding of how behavior change techniques (BCTs) impact the determinants of behavior. A transparent, systematic, and accessible method of linking BCTs with the processes through which they change behavior (i.e., their mechanisms of action [MoAs]) would advance the understanding of intervention effects and improve theory and intervention development. The purpose of this study is to triangulate evidence for hypothesized BCT- MoA links obtained in two previous studies and present the results in an interactive, online tool. Two previous studies generated evidence on links between 56 BCTs and 26 MoAs based on their frequency in literature synthesis and on expert consensus. Concordance between the findings of the two studies was examined using multilevel modeling. Uncertainties and differences between the two studies were reconciled by 16 behavior change experts using consensus development methods. The resulting evidence was used to generate an online tool. The two studies showed concordance for 25 of the 26 MoAs and agreement for 37 links and for 460 "nonlinks." A further 55 links were resolved by consensus (total of 92 [37 + 55] hypothesized BCT-MoA links). Full data on 1,456 possible links was incorporated into the online interactive Theory and Technique Tool (https://theoryandtechniquetool.humanbehaviourchange.org/).This triangulation of two distinct sources of evidence provides guidance on how BCTs may affect the mechanisms that change behavior and is available as a resource for behavior change intervention designers, researchers and theorists, supporting intervention design, research synthesis, and collaborative research.

AB Mountain ecosystems contain strong elevational gradients in climate and vegetation that shape species distributions and the structure of animal communities. Nevertheless, studies of habitat selection for individual species rarely account for such gradients that often result in species being managed uniformly across their range, which may not improve conservation as intended. Therefore, we characterized variation in nocturnal habitat selection by 18 GPS-tagged California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) along a 1400-m elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California. We characterized three-dimensional forest structure with light detection and ranging data that we used in mixed-effects resource- and step-selection analyses of owl habitat selection. At lower elevations, owls selected stands with shorter trees, sites closer to hard edges between tall forests and open areas, sites with less diversity in forest seral types and sites with more ridge and southwest aspects. In contrast, owls at higher elevations selected the opposite. Within public forests that had taller trees and within their home range core (45% kernel density estimate of GPS points) areas, owls selected forests with less and more canopy cover at low and high elevations, respectively. Outside of their core areas, owls selected areas with fewer and more tall trees at low and high elevations, respectively. These findings may be explained by elevational gradients in prey distribution and variation in owl diet because owls consume more woodrats (Neotoma spp; earlier seral species) at lower elevations and more flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus; older forest species) at higher elevations. Thus, at low elevations and in areas unlikely to support nesting, spotted owls could benefit from management that promotes woodrat habitat by encouraging oak regeneration and creating small brushy openings within forests with shorter (younger) trees. Conversely, at higher elevations, (1) enhancing flying squirrel habitat by promoting large trees and denser canopy on mesic sites and (2) managing for greater cover type diversity on southwest-facing slopes and ridgetops is more likely to improve foraging habitat quality for spotted owls. The patterns of owl selection over elevational gradients has not been explicitly considered in most habitat management plans but clearly would improve management throughout mountain ecosystems.

AB Climate change and ensuring food security for an exponentially growing global human population are the greatest challenges for future agriculture. Improved soil management practices are crucial to tackle these problems by enhancing agro-ecosystem productivity, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. To meet Paris climate treaty pledges, soil management must address validated approaches for carbon sequestration and stabilization. The present synthesis assesses a range of current and potential future agricultural management practices (AMP) that have an effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and sequestration. Through two strategies-increasing carbon inputs (e.g., enhanced primary production, organic fertilizers) and reducing SOC losses (e.g., reducing soil erosion, managing soil respiration)-AMP can either sequester, up to 714 +/- 404 (compost) kg C ha(-1) y(-1), having no distinct impact (mineral fertilization), or even reduce SOC stocks in the topsoil (bare fallow). Overall, the carbon sequestration potential of the subsoil (>40 cm) requires further investigation. Moreover, climate change, permanent soil sealing, consumer behavior in dietary habits and waste production, as well as the socio-economic constraints of farmers (e.g., information exchange, long-term economic profitability) are important factors for implementing new AMPs. This calls for life-cycle assessments of those practices.

AB Hotspots are priority marine or terrestrial areas with high biodiversity where delineation is essential for conservation, but equally important is their linkage to the environmental policies of the overall region. In this study, fish diversity presences were linked to abiotic conditions and different habitat types to reveal multi-species and hotspots models predicted by ecological niche modelling methods within the Bay of La Paz, Mexico (south of Gulf of California). The abiotically suitable areas for 217 fish species were identified based on historical (1975-2020) presence data sets and a set of environmental layers related to distances from mangroves and rocky shores habitats, marine substrate, and bottom geomorphology conditions. Hotspot model distribution was delineated from a multi-species model identifying areas with >= 60 species per hectare and was compared to the marine conservation areas such Balandra Protected Natural Area (BPNA), illustrating how these models can be applied to improve the local regulatory framework. The results indicate that (1) there is a need for the BPNA to be enlarged to capture more of the delineated hotspot areas, and thus an update to the management plan will be required, (2) new conservation areas either adjacent or outside of the established BPNA should be established, or (3) Ramsar sites or other priority areas should be subject to legal recognition and a management plan decreed so that these vital habitats and fish diversity can be better protected.

AB Earth's atmosphere is warming and the effects of climate change are becoming evident. A key observation is that both the average levels and the variability of temperature and precipitation are changing. Information and data from new technologies are developing in parallel to provide multidisciplinary opportunities to address and overcome the consequences of these changes in forest ecosystems. Changes in temperature and water availability impose multidimensional environmental constraints that trigger changes from the molecular to the forest stand level. These can represent a threat for the normal development of the tree from early seedling recruitment to adulthood both through direct mortality, and by increasing susceptibility to pathogens, insect attack, and fire damage. This review summarizes the strengths and shortcomings of previous work in the areas of genetic variation related to cold and drought stress in forest species with particular emphasis on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), the most-planted tree species in North America. We describe and discuss the implementation of management and breeding strategies to increase resilience and adaptation, and discuss how new technologies in the areas of engineering and genomics are shaping the future of phenotype-genotype studies. Lessons learned from the study of species important in intensively-managed forest ecosystems may also prove to be of value in helping less-intensively managed forest ecosystems adapt to climate change, thereby increasing the sustainability and resilience of forestlands for the future.

AB Context Species occurrence in transformed areas (or matrix) can be enhanced by reducing the contrast in vegetation structure between the matrix and remnant natural patches. Contrast depends on both structural features of remnants and that of the matrix, which can be dynamic and determined by harvesting practices. Objectives We assess whether structurally equivalent vegetation, as determined by structural features of the matrix relative to that of remnants in the landscape, promotes species diversity and abundance in the matrix. Furthermore, we assess the relative importance of structurally equivalent vegetation compared to features of the immediate adjacent remnant patch. Methods Arthropods were sampled from 34 sites situated in alien forestry plantation blocks of different ages, dissected by corridors of natural grassland and/or closed canopy woody habitats. We analysed how arthropod assemblages within plantations were influenced by structural features of remnant vegetation in the landscape, and that of remnant patches directly adjacent. Results The amount of structurally equivalent vegetation at the landscape level promoted arthropod abundance and diversity within plantations and was more important than either the structural contrast or biotope type of the immediate adjacent patch for promoting diversity in the forestry blocks. Conclusions Landscapes composed of a mosaic of structurally distinct vegetation best contribute to promoting diversity within dynamic production areas. Harvesting practices that radically change the structural features of the entire plantation should be avoided. We recommend use of rotational harvesting, so creating a variety of plantation tree ages for improved arthropod spillover from both natural grassland and woody habitats.

AB Network ecology is an emerging field that allows researchers to conceptualize and analyse ecological networks and their dynamics. Here, we focus on the dynamics of ecological networks in response to environmental changes. Specifically, we formalize how network topologies constrain the dynamics of ecological systems into a unifying framework in network ecology that we refer to as the 'ecological network dynamics framework'. This framework stresses that the interplay between species interaction networks and the spatial layout of habitat patches is key to identifying which network properties (number and weights of nodes and links) and trade-offs among them are needed to maintain species interactions in dynamic landscapes. We conclude that to be functional, ecological networks should be scaled according to species dispersal abilities in response to landscape heterogeneity. Determining how such effective ecological networks change through space and time can help reveal their complex dynamics in a changing world.

AB Insight into complex evolutionary histories continues to build through broad comparative phylogenomic and population genomic studies. In particular, there is a need to understand the extent and scale that gene flow contributes to standing genomic diversity and the role introgression has played in evolutionary processes such as hybrid speciation. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of the Mergini tribe (sea ducks) by coupling multi-species comparisons with phylogenomic analyses of thousands of nuclear ddRAD-seq loci, including Z-sex chromosome and autosomal linked loci, and the mitogenome assayed across all extant sea duck species in North America. All sea duck species are strongly structured across all sampled marker types (pair-wise species phi ST > 0.2), with clear genetic assignments of individuals to their respective species, and phylogenetic relationships recapitulate known relationships. Despite strong species integrity, we identify at least 18 putative hybrids; with all but one being late generational backcrosses. Most interesting, we provide the first evidence that an ancestral gene flow event between long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) and true Eiders (Somateria spp.) not only moved genetic material into the former species, but likely generated a novel species - the Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri) - via hybrid speciation. Despite generally low contemporary levels of gene flow, we conclude that hybridization has and continues to be an important process that shifts novel genetic variation between species within the tribe Mergini. Finally, we outline methods that permit researchers to contrast genomic patterns of contemporary versus ancestral gene flow when attempting to reconstruct potentially complex evolutionary histories.

AB North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are critically endangered, and recent changes in distribution patterns have been a major management challenge. Understanding the role that environmental conditions play in habitat suitability helps to determine the regions in need of monitoring or protection for conservation of the species, particularly as climate change shifts suitable habitat. This study used three species distribution modeling algorithms, together with historical whale abundance data (1993-2009) and environmental covariate data, to build monthly ensemble models of past E. glacialis habitat suitability in the Gulf of Maine. The model was projected onto the year 2050 for a range of climate scenarios. Specifically, the distribution of the species was modeled using generalized additive models, boosted regression trees, and artificial neural networks, with environmental covariates that included sea surface temperature, bottom water temperature, bathymetry, a modeled Ca/anus finmarchicus habitat index, and chlorophyll. Year-2050 projections used downscaled climate anomaly fields from Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5. The relative contribution of each covariate changed seasonally, with an increase in the importance of bottom temperature and C. finmarchicus in the summer, when model performance was highest. A negative correlation was observed between model performance and sea surface temperature contribution. The 2050 projections indicated decreased habitat suitability across the Gulf of Maine in the period from July through October, with the exception of narrow bands along the Scotian Shelf.The results suggest that regions outside of the current areas of conservation focus may become increasingly important habitats for E. glacialis under future climate scenarios.

AB Increased drought frequency and severity are a pervasive global threat, yet the capacity of mesic temperate forests to maintain resilience in response to drought remains poorly understood. We deployed a throughfall removal experiment to simulate a once in a century drought in New Hampshire, USA, which coupled with the region-wide 2016 drought, intensified moisture stress beyond that experienced in the lifetimes of our study trees. To assess the sensitivity and threshold dynamics of two dominant northeastern tree genera (Quercus and Pinus), we monitored sap flux density (J(s)), leaf water potential and gas exchange, growth and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) for one pretreatment year (2015) and two treatment years (2016-17). Results showed that J, in pine (Pinus strobus L.) declined abruptly at a soil moisture threshold of 0.15 m(3) m(-3), whereas oak's (Quercus rubra L. and Quercus velutina Lam.) threshold was 0.11 m(3) m(-3)-a finding consistent with pine's more isohydric strategy. Nevertheless, once oaks' moisture threshold was surpassed, J(s) declined abruptly, suggesting that while oaks are well adapted to moderate drought, they are highly susceptible to extreme drought. The radial growth reduction in response to the 2016 drought was more than twice as great for pine as for oaks (50 vs 18%, respectively). Despite relatively high precipitation in 2017, the oaks' growth continued to decline (low recovery), whereas pine showed neutral (treatment) or improved (control) growth. The iWUE increased in 2016 for both treatment and control pines, but only in treatment oaks. Notably, pines exhibited a significant linear relationship between iWUE and precipitation across years, whereas the oaks only showed a response during the driest conditions, further underscoring the different sensitivity thresholds for these species. Our results provide new insights into how interactions between temperate forest tree species' contrasting physiologies and soil moisture thresholds influence their responses and resilience to extreme drought.

AB The age of genomics has given us a wealth of information and the tools to study whole genomes. This, in turn, has facilitated genome-wide studies among organisms that were relatively less studied in the pre-genomic era or are non-model organisms. This paves the way to the discovery of interesting evolutionary patterns, which are brought to light by genome-wide surveys of protein superfamilies. Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that is utilised across all clades of life, and acts as an important signalling switch, regulating several cellular processes. Tyrosine phosphatases, which are found predominantly in eukaryotes, act on phosphorylated tyrosine residues and sometimes on other substrates. Extending on our previous effort to look for tyrosine phosphatases in the human genome, we have looked for sequences of the cysteine-based tyrosine phosphatase superfamily in thirty mammalian genomes from all across Mammalia and validated the sequences with the presence of the signature catalytic motif. Domain architecture annotation, followed by in-depth analysis, revealed interesting taxon-specific patterns such as subtle differences between the protein families in marsupials and early mammals versus placental mammals. Finally, we discuss an interesting case of loss of the tyrosine phosphatase domain from a gene product in the course of eutherian evolution.

AB A particular threat posed by climate change for biodiversity conservation, one which has scarcely been studied, is the overlap of the potential distribution areas in phylogenetically closely related species. In this study, Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) was used to investigate the potential changes in the distribution of Delphinium bolosii and D. fissum subsp. sordidum under future climatic scenarios. These two closely related and endangered endemic species from the Iberian Peninsula do not have complete reproductive barriers between them. The two models selected different predictors with a similar effect in the biological cycle. Both taxa need low winter temperatures to break seed dormancy and sufficient rainfall to complete the flowering and fruiting stages. The current potential distribution areas of both taxa do not currently overlap. However, the results showed that potential changes may take place in the species' distribution range under future climate scenarios. The models predict a reduction of the potential distribution area of D. bolosii while, conversely, the potential distribution area of D. fissum subsp. sordidum increased. In both cases, the predicted contraction in range is very high, and loss of habitat suitability in some current localities is worrying. Notwithstanding, the models do not predict overlaps of potential areas under climate change scenarios. Our findings can be used to define areas and populations of high priority for conservation or to take action against the impacts of climate change on these endangered species.

AB Background Color vision and phototactic behavior based on opsins are important for the fitness of insects because of their roles in foraging and mate choice. Related topics, including the duplication and loss of opsin genes, have been well investigated in insect orders such as Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Odonata and Orthoptera, and the findings have been used to develop pest management strategies involving light trapping. Mirid bugs of Hemiptera, which are pests that cause heavy economic losses, show capacity for color discrimination and phototaxis. However, the opsins in mirid bugs remain uncharacterized. Herein, we examined five species to investigate the evolution of opsins in the family Miridae. Results Using RNA-seq, we identified several contigs showing high identity with opsins, including four contigs in Apolygus lucorum and three contigs each in Adelphocoris suturalis, Adelphocoris fasciaticollis, Adelphocoris lineolatus and Nesidiocoris tenuis. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that one of these genes clustered with ultraviolet-sensitive (UV) opsins and that the others clustered with long-wavelength (LW) opsins, suggesting that duplication of LW opsins and loss of blue light-sensitive (B) opsins occurred in mirid bugs. The existence of introns in the LW opsins of mirid bugs suggested that the duplication events were DNA based. Both LW1 and LW2 opsins of mirid bugs were found to be under strong purifying selection. The LW1 opsins were significantly more highly expressed than the LW2 and UV opsins. Conclusions We identified the opsins of mirid bugs using five selected mirid species as a representative sample. Phylogenetic analyses clustered one of the genes with UV opsins and the others with LW opsins, suggesting the occurrence of LW opsin duplication and B opsin loss during the evolution of mirid bugs. Intron detection suggested that the identified duplication event was DNA based. The evidence of strong purifying selection and the relatively high expression levels suggested that these opsins exhibit fundamental functions in mirid bugs.

AB Understanding the responses of species interactions to land-use change is a key challenge in ecology and conservation. In the tropical Andes, a large proportion of birds interact with other bird species and create networks of mixed-species flocks; however, the widespread effects of land-use change in the region raise concerns about the alteration of these interactions. Here we explored how structural (i.e., species richness and size) and functional (i.e., network connectivity indices) parameters of mixed flocks change along a gradient from open vegetation to native forest habitats. This study was conducted in the southern Andes of Ecuador, where we sampled mixed-species flocks in 12 areas for five consecutive months, and applied network analysis tools to characterize structural parameters (observed richness, flock size, flock encounter rate, composition) and functional parameters (degree, weighted degree, cluster, and skewness) of flocks. We found that the network indices, degree and weighted degree of species, were positively associated with areas of dense vegetation and native trees. These two network indices indicated that mixed flocks occupying native forest have higher connectivity, a factor that can promote the stability of flocks. The structural parameters of flocks, species richness, and abundance, were not associated with the vegetation structure. Overall, our results show that functional parameters of flocks can be more sensitive than structural parameters to the effects of land-use change in our study area. We demonstrate the importance of combining the analysis of structure and functionality of flocks to reveal the effects of land-use change. Lastly, our results highlight the importance of mature native forest for the conservation of species and the maintenance of non-trophic interactions.

   conductance; thermal acclimation; whole&#8208; ecosystem warming
AB Climate warming will alter photosynthesis and respiration not only via direct temperature effects on leaf biochemistry but also by increasing atmospheric dryness, thereby reducing stomatal conductance and suppressing photosynthesis. Our knowledge on how climate warming affects these processes is mainly derived from seedlings grown under highly controlled conditions. However, little is known regarding temperature responses of trees growing under field settings. We exposed mature tamarack and black spruce trees growing in a peatland ecosystem to whole-ecosystem warming of up to +9 degrees C above ambient air temperatures in an ongoing long-term experiment (SPRUCE: Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments). Here, we report the responses of leaf gas exchange after the first two years of warming. We show that the two species exhibit divergent stomatal responses to warming and vapor pressure deficit. Warming of up to 9 degrees C increased leaf N in both spruce and tamarack. However, higher leaf N in the warmer plots translate into higher photosynthesis in tamarack but not in spruce, with photosynthesis being more constrained by stomatal limitations in spruce than in tamarack under warm conditions. Surprisingly, dark respiration did not acclimate to warming in spruce, and thermal acclimation of respiration was only seen in tamarack once changes in leaf N were considered. Our results highlight how warming can lead to differing stomatal responses to warming in co-occurring species, with consequent effects on both vegetation carbon and water dynamics.

AB Context The natural patchiness of wetlands and flooding events are likely to strongly affect the genetic structure of their terrestrial species. However, these effects are not well understood yet, especially for small mammals. Objectives We investigated at different spatial scales the genetic structure of the harvest mouse (Micromys minutus), a threatened small mammal strongly tied to wetlands, and the effects on gene flow of flooding and of the different types of landscape elements composing a wetland. Methods 309 harvest mice were sampled in eight sites in Western Europe. Their genetic structure and diversity at 15 microsatellite loci were analyzed at a regional spatial scale and at a local scale, where the resistance of land cover and flooding to gene flow was also assessed, with the optimization procedure implemented in ResistanceGA. Results At a regional scale, our study revealed a strong genetic differentiation between populations from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean Sea. At the local scale, in a flooded wetland in France, the species exhibited a large genetic cluster over at least 45 km(2), in spite of a large river crossing it. Winter floods explained genetic structure better than landscape features alone, with a stronger resistance to gene flow in reed beds where vegetation level above water was high: contrary to meadows, from which individuals are forced to escape, reed beds can be "golden prisons", i.e. refuges during floods but with very low possibility of movements. Conclusions Several parameters influencing the functioning of a flooded population of harvest mouse are here highlighted that can also be useful for the development of plans to safeguard wetland ecosystems.

AB The observed patterns and underlying mechanisms of elevational beta-diversity have been explored intensively, but multi-dimensional comparative studies remain scarce. Herein, across distinct beta-diversity components, dimensions and species groups, we designed a multi-faceted comparative framework aiming to reveal the general rules in the observed patterns and underlying causes of elevational beta-diversity. We have found that: first, the turnover process dominated altitudinal patterns of species beta-diversity (beta(sim) > beta(sne)), whereas the nestedness process appeared relatively more important for elevational trait dissimilarity (beta(funcsim) < beta(funcsne)); second, the taxonomic turnover was relative higher than its phylogenetic and functional analogues (beta(sim) > beta(phylosim)/beta(funcsim)), conversely, nestedness-resultant trait dissimilarity tended to be higher than the taxonomic and phylogenetic measures (beta(funcsne) > beta(sne)/beta(phylosne)); and third, as elevational distance increased, the contradicting dynamics of environmental filtering and limiting similarity have jointly led the elevational patterns of beta-diversity, especially at taxonomic dimension. Based on these findings, we infer that the species turnover among phylogenetic relatives sharing similar functional attributes appears to be the main cause of shaping the altitudinal patterns of multi-dimensional beta-diversity. Owing to the methodological limitation in the randomization approach, currently, it remains extremely challenging to distinguish the influence of the neutral process from the offset between opposing niche-based processes. Despite the complexities and uncertainties during species assembling, with a multi-dimensional comparative perspective, this work offers us several important commonalities of elevational beta-diversity dynamics.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogeneous illness, and emerging evidence suggests that different symptom dimensions may have distinct underlying neurobiological mechanisms. We aimed to look for familial patterns in the occurrence of these symptom dimensions in a sample of families with at least two individuals affected with OCD.
   Methods: Data from 153 families (total number of individuals diagnosed with DSM-5 OCD = 330) recruited as part of the Accelerator Program for Discovery in Brain Disorders using Stem Cells (ADBS) was used for the current analysis. Multidimensional Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to extract dimensional scores from the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) checklist data. Using linear mixed-effects regression models, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), for each symptom dimension, and within each relationship type were estimated.
   Results: IRT yielded a four-factor solution with Factor 1 (Sexual/Religious/Aggressive), Factor 2 (Doubts/Checking), Factor 3 (Symmetry/Arranging), and Factor 4 (Contamination/Washing). All except for Factor 1 were found to have significant ICCs, highest for Factor 3 (0.41) followed by Factor 4 (0.29) and then Factor 2 (0.27). Sex-concordant dyads were found to have higher ICC values than discordant ones, for all the symptom dimensions. No major differences in the ICC values between parent-offspring and sib-pairs were seen.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there is a high concordance of OCD symptom dimensions within multiplex families. Symptom dimensions of OCD might thus have significant heritability. In view of this, future genetic and neurobiological studies in OCD should include symptom dimensions as a key parameter in their analyses.

AB Euryhaline teleosts exhibit major changes in renal function as they move between freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) environments, thus tolerating large fluctuations in salinity. In FW, the kidney excretes large volumes of water through high glomerular filtration rates (GFR) and low tubular reabsorption rates, while actively reabsorbing most ions at high rates. The excreted product has a high urine flow rate (UFR) with a dilute composition. In SW, GFR is greatly reduced, and the tubules reabsorb as much water as possible, while actively secreting divalent ions. The excreted product has a low UFR, and is almost isosmotic to the blood plasma, with Mg2+, SO42-, and Cl- as the major ionic components. Early studies at the organismal level have described these basic patterns, while in the last two decades, studies of regulation at the cell and molecular level have been implemented, though only in a few euryhaline groups (salmonids, eels, tilapias, and fugus). There have been few studies combining the two approaches. The aim of the review is to integrate known aspects of renal physiology (reabsorption and secretion) with more recent advances in molecular water and solute physiology (gene and protein function of transporters). The renal transporters addressed include the subunits of the Na+, K+- ATPase (NKA) enzyme, monovalent ion transporters for Na+, Cl-, and K+ (NKCC1, NKCC2, CLC-K, NCC, ROMK2), water transport pathways [aquaporins (AQP), claudins (CLDN)], and divalent ion transporters for SO42-, Mg2+, and Ca2+ (SLC26A6, SLC26A1, SLC13A1, SLC41A1, CNNM2, CNNM3, NCX1, NCX2, PMCA). For each transport category, we address the current understanding at the molecular level, try to synthesize it with classical knowledge of overall renal function, and highlight knowledge gaps. Future research on the kidney of euryhaline fishes should focus on integrating changes in kidney reabsorption and secretion of ions with changes in transporter function at the cellular and molecular level (gene and protein verification) in different regions of the nephrons. An increased focus on the kidney individually and its functional integration with the other osmoregulatory organs (gills, skin and intestine) in maintaining overall homeostasis will have applied relevance for aquaculture.

AB Bird migration patterns are changing worldwide due to current global climate changes. Addressing the effects of such changes on the migration of birds in South America is particularly challenging because the details about how birds migrate within the Neotropics are generally not well understood. Here, we aim to infer the potential effects of future climate change on breeding and wintering areas of birds that migrate within South America by estimating the size and elevations of their future breeding and wintering areas. We used occurrence data from species distribution databases (VertNet and GBIF), published studies, and eBird for 3 thrush species ( Turdidae; Turdus nigriceps, T. subalaris, and T. flavipes) that breed and winter in different regions of South America and built ecological niche models using ensemble forecasting approaches to infer current and future potential distributions throughout the breeding and wintering periods of each species. Our findings point to future shifts in wintering and breeding areas, mainly through elevational and longitudinal changes. Future breeding areas for T. nigriceps, which migrates along the Andes Mountains, will be displaced to the west, while breeding displacements to the east are expected for the other 2 species. An overall loss in the size of future wintering areas was also supported for 2 of the species, especially for T. subalaris, but an increase is anticipated for T. flavipes. Our results suggest that future climate change in South America will require that species shift their breeding and wintering areas to higher elevations in addition to changes in their latitudes and longitude. Our findings are the first to show how future climate change may affect migratory birds in South America throughout the year and suggest that even closely related migratory birds in South America will be affected in different ways, depending on the regions where they breed and overwinter.

AB Homoeologs are pairs of genes or chromosomes in the same species that originated by speciation and were brought back together in the same genome by allopolyploidization. Bioinformatic methods for accurate homoeology inference are crucial for studying the evolutionary consequences of polyploidization, and homoeology is typically inferred on the basis of bidirectional best hit (BBH) and/or positional conservation (synteny). However, these methods neglect the fact that genes can duplicate and move, both prior to and after the allopolyploidization event. These duplications and movements can result in many-to-many and/or nonsyntenic homoeologs-which thus remain undetected and unstudied. Here, using the allotetraploid upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) as a case study, we show that conventional approaches indeed miss a substantial proportion of homoeologs. Additionally, we found that many of the missed pairs of homoeologs are broadly and highly expressed. A gene ontology analysis revealed a high proportion of the nonsyntenic and non-BBH homoeologs to be involved in protein translation and are likely to contribute to the functional repertoire of cotton. Thus, from an evolutionary and functional genomics standpoint, choosing a homoeolog inference method which does not solely rely on 1:1 relationship cardinality or synteny is crucial for not missing these potentially important homoeolog pairs.

AB The current unprecedented rates of environmental perturbation, particularly in rain forest ecosystems, are jeopardizing the persistence of a variety of tropical species. The development of adequate conservation programs requires incorporating the evolutionary history and population genetic information of species, especially in those threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Mexican mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata mexicana) represent the northernmost distribution of primates in America, a Critically Endangered species mainly inhabiting forest remnants. We assessed historical and contemporary patterns of genetic variation in A. p. mexicana populations from five regions across its geographic distribution in Mexico. We employed non-invasive sampling techniques and evaluated microsatellite loci and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences from 127 individuals from 15 wild and two semi-captive populations. Our data demonstrate negative genetic effects on A. p. mexicana as a result of isolation, fragmentation, and small effective population size. Results revealed two mitochondrial lineages and three genetically differentiated nuclear clusters, along with reduced nuclear genetic diversity, limited gene flow, and significant inbreeding, associated with concurrent processes of historical dispersion and contemporary landscape changes. Accordingly, we argue that A. palliata mexicana in Mexico is an independently evolving unit that meets the criteria for being assigned as an Evolutionarily Significant Unit, crucial for the preservation of the howler monkeys' phylogenetic and functional diversity. The three genetic clusters identified are essential for the maintenance of the adaptive diversity and long-term survival of this howler subspecies. Our genetic approach and conservation recommendations may be useful for other endangered primates inhabiting fragmented populations.

AB Aim To assess the relative importance of wind intensity and direction in explaining wetland invertebrate metacommunity organization.
   Location Seventy-eight wetland ponds in Patagonia (Argentina) covering a study area of 3.5 x 10(5) km(2).
   Time period Ponds were sampled once between 2006 and 2014.
   Major taxa studied One hundred and fifty-eight taxa of wetland aquatic invertebrates.
   Methods We generated two beta diversity matrices (based on flying and non-flying invertebrates) and six predictor matrices, including three environmental distance matrices, a topographic distance between ponds, and two wind pairwise matrices differing in wind speed. Using Moran spectral randomization of Mantel (MSR-Mantel) tests (which account for spatial autocorrelation), we assessed the relationship between the response and the predictor matrices. We used a network-constrained version of the nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill (NODF), to assess if wind anisotropy (i.e., direction-dependent) affected community nestedness among ponds.
   Results Flying dispersers' dissimilarity was significantly explained by environmental variables, whereas non-flying invertebrates' dissimilarity was not significantly explained by any of the distances tested. When wind direction was ignored, wind speed had a negligible effect on both types of communities, whereas when it was considered a consistent nested pattern emerged, with the eastern ponds (downwind) communities being subsets of those from the western ponds (upwind).
   Main conclusions We found that the invertebrate communities were mainly assembled by a combination of environmental factors and wind directionality, although this depended on the dispersal ability of the organisms.

AB Transposable elements (TEs) are major components of eukaryotic genomes and represent approximately 45% of the human genome. TEs can be important sources of novelty in genomes and there is increasing evidence that TEs contribute to the evolution of gene regulation in mammals. Gene duplication is an evolutionary mechanism that also provides new genetic material and opportunities to acquire new functions. To investigate how duplicated genes are maintained in genomes, here, we explored the TE environment of duplicated and singleton genes. We found that singleton genes have more short-interspersed nuclear elements and DNA transposons in their vicinity than duplicated genes, whereas long-interspersed nuclear elements and long-terminal repeat retrotransposons have accumulated more near duplicated genes. We also discovered that this result is highly associated with the degree of essentiality of the genes with an unexpected accumulation of short-interspersed nuclear elements and DNA transposons around the more-essential genes. Our results underline the importance of taking into account the TE environment of genes to better understand how duplicated genes are maintained in genomes.

AB Current carbon pricing and trading mechanisms, despite their efficacy in reducing GHG emissions from industry, will not be sufficient to achieve Net Zero targets. Current mechanisms that redress emissions are largely economic disincentives, in effect financial penalties for emitters. In order to attain Net Zero futures, financial incentives for activities that sequester carbon from the atmosphere are needed. Herein, we present the environmental and economic co-benefits of soil re-carbonization and justify support for soil carbon remuneration. With increasing momentum to develop green economies, and projected increases in carbon price, growth in the global carbon market is inevitable. The establishment of a soil-based carbon economy, within this emerging financial space, has the potential to deliver a paradigm shift that will accelerate climate change mitigation, and concurrently realize net gains for soil health and the delivery of soil ecosystem services. Pivotal to the emergence of a global soil carbon economy will be a consensus on certification instruments used for long-term soil carbon storage, and the development of robust institutional agreements and processes to facilitate soil carbon trading.

DE alpha and gamma diversity; community; eDNA; nestedness; turnover
AB Information on alpha- (local), beta- (between habitats), and gamma- (regional) diversity is fundamental to understanding biodiversity as well as the function and stability of community dynamics. Methods like environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding are currently considered useful to investigate biodiversity.
   We compared the performance of eDNA metabarcoding with visual and capture surveys for estimating alpha- and gamma-diversity of river fish communities, and nestedness and turnover in particular.
   In five rivers across west Japan, by comparison to visual/capture surveys, eDNA metabarcoding detected more species in the study sites (i.e. alpha-diversity). Consequently, the overall number of species in the region (i.e. gamma-diversity) was higher. In particular, the species found by visual/capture surveys were encompassed by those detected by eDNA metabarcoding.
   Estimates of community diversity within rivers differed between survey methods. Although we found that the methods show similar levels of community nestedness and turnover within the rivers, visual/capture surveys showed more distinct community differences from upstream to downstream. Our results suggest that eDNA metabarcoding may be a suitable method for community assemblage analysis, especially for understanding regional community patterns, for fish monitoring in rivers.

AB Global decline of coral reefs has led to a widespread adoption of asexual propagation techniques for coral restoration, whereby coral colonies are fragmented and allowed to re-grow before being returned to the reef. While this approach has become increasingly popular and successful, many questions remain regarding best practices to maximize restoration speed, efficiency, and survival. Two variables that may influence growth and survival of asexually fragmented colonies include coral genet and growth substrate. Here, we evaluate the effects of genet and substrate (commercially available ceramic vs. in-house made cement) on the survival and growth of 221 microfragments of elkhorn coral Acropora palmata over 193 days. All corals survived the experimental period, and doubled their initial size in 45 days, with an average growth of 545% over the study duration. Growth was generally linear, though the growth of some corals more closely matched logistic, logarithmic, or exponential curves. Both genet and substrate had significant effects on coral growth, though the two factors did not interact. Genet had a stronger influence on coral growth than substrate, with the fastest genet growing at 216% the rate of the slowest genet. Corals on cement substrate grew at 111.9% the rate of those grown on ceramic. This represents both a significant cost savings and elimination of logistical challenges to restoration practitioners, as the cement substrate ingredients are cheap and globally available. Our work shows that both genet and substrate should be considered when undertaking asexual restoration of Acropora palmata to maximize restoration speed and efficiency.

ID ROLES
AB Nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) are carnivorous fungi that prey on nematodes under nutrient-poor conditions via specialized hyphae that function as traps. The molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions between NTF and their nematode prey are largely unknown. In this study, we conducted forward genetic screens to identify potential genes and pathways that are involved in trap morphogenesis and predation in the NTF Arthrobotrys oligospora. Using Ethyl methanesulfonate and UV as the mutagens, we generated 5552 randomly mutagenized A. oligospora strains and identified 15 mutants with strong defects in trap morphogenesis. Whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatic analyses revealed mutations in genes with roles in signaling, transcription or membrane transport that may contribute to the defects of trap morphogenesis in these mutants. We further conducted functional analyses on a candidate gene, YBP-1, and demonstrate that mutation of that gene was causative of the phenotypes observed in one of the mutants. The methods established in this study might provide helpful insights for establishing forward genetic screening methods for other non-model fungal species.

AB The tropics is an area with high incidence of wildfire all over the world in recent years, and the forest ecosystem in the tropics is extremely fragile. Thus, it is very important to identify drivers of wildfire in the tropics for developing effective fire management strategy. In this paper, global logistic regression (GLR) and geographically weighted regression (GWLR) models were employed to analyze the spatial distribution and drivers of tropical wildfires in Xishuangbanna and Leizhou Peninsula in tropical China from 2001 to 2018. The results show that the overall distribution of wildfire in Xishuangbanna and Leizhou Peninsula from 2001 to 2018 was spatially aggregated. In these tropical seasonal forest ecosystems, wildfire was mainly driven by meteorological factors, particularly by daily temperature range and precipitation. In Xishuangbanna (inland) peninsula, the impact of driving factors tended to be global, and the GLR model predicted the probability of wildfire occurrence better than the GWLR model. Drivers of wildfire in Leizhou Peninsula (coastal area) had clear spatial variation, and the GWLR model better explained the relationship. Furthermore, wildfire in Leizhou was more driven by human activities, especially management of agricultural lands. Our results demonstrate that effective forest management practice needs to adopt fire management practices with regional characteristics. The forest management strategy and traditional agriculture production system should pay more attention to changes in these driving factors and their relationship with wildfire.

SO MED
LA English
DT Article
ID ROC
AB Background: To develop a sensitive risk score predicting the risk of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using complete blood count (CBC).
   Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study from a total of 13,138 inpatients with COVID-19 in Hubei, China, and Milan, Italy. Among them, 9,810 patients with >= CBC records from Hubei were assigned to the training cohort. CBC parameters were analyzed as potential predictors for all-cause mortality and were selected by the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM).
   Findings: Five risk factors were derived to construct a composite score (PAWNN score) using the Cox regression model, including platelet counts, age, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. The PAWNNscore showed good accuracy for predicting mortality in 10-fold cross-validation (AUROCs 0.92-0.93) and subsets with different quartile intervals of follow-up and preexisting diseases. The performance of the score was further validated in 2,949 patients with only 1 CBC record from the Hubei cohort (AUROC 0.97) and 227 patients from the Italian cohort (AUROC 0.80). The latent Markov model (LMM) demonstrated that the PAWNN score has good prediction power for transition probabilities between different latent conditions.
   Conclusions: The PAWNN score is a simple and accurate risk assessment tool that can predict the mortality for COVID-19 patients during their entire hospitalization. This tool can assist clinicians in prioritizing medical treatment of COVID-19 patients.

AB Tarakihi (Nemadactylus macropterus) is a demersal fish that supports valuable commercial, recreational, and customary fisheries in New Zealand. However, little is known about its stock structure. The population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and demographic history of N. macropterus were investigated using the hypervariable region one of the mitochondrial control region. 370 samples from 14 locations around New Zealand were collected. While weak genetic breaks were detected between Hawke's Bay and East Northland and between the west and east coasts of South Island, no clear genetic structure was detected for the overall New Zealand area (CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EFST = 0.002, P = 0.18), indicative of a panmictic genetic structure. N. macropterus display a high level of genetic diversity and appear to have a historically large and stable population with a long evolutionary history. Bayesian skyline analysis indicates that the historic population has gone through two expansions, likely caused by repeated glacial cycles during the second half of the Pleistocene. The addition of 15 king tarakihi samples (Nemadactylus n.sp.) collected from the Three Kings Islands showed a clear genetic differentiation between the two morphotypes. These findings can inform the future management of N. macropterus and N. n.sp. to ensure a sustainable harvest.

AB Effective and robust ways to describe, quantify, analyse, and test for change in the structure of biological communities over time are essential if ecological research is to contribute substantively towards understanding and managing responses to ongoing environmental changes. Structural changes reflect population dynamics, changes in biomass and relative abundances of taxa, and colonisation and extinction events observed in samples collected through time. Most previous studies of temporal changes in the multivariate datasets that characterise biological communities are based on short time series that are not amenable to data-hungry methods such as multivariate generalised linear models. Here, we present a roadmap for the analysis of temporal change in short-time-series, multivariate, ecological datasets. We discuss appropriate methods and important considerations for using them such as sample size, assumptions, and statistical power. We illustrate these methods with four case-studies analysed using the R data analysis environment.

AB Background Equatorward, rear-edge tree populations are natural monitors to estimate species vulnerability to climate change. According to biogeographical theory, exposition to drought events increases with increasing aridity towards the equator and the growth of southern tree populations will be more vulnerable to drought than in central populations. However, the ecological and biogeographical margins can mismatch due to the impact of ecological factors (topography, soils) or tree-species acclimation that can blur large-scale geographical imprints in trees responses to drought making northern populations more drought limited. Methods We tested these ideas in six tree species, three angiosperms (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur, Quercus petraea) and three gymnosperms (Abies alba, Pinus sylvestris and Pinus uncinata) by comparing rear-edge tree populations subjected to different degrees of aridity. We used dendrochronology to compare the radial-growth patterns of these species in northern, intermediate, and southern tree populations at the continental rear edge. Results and conclusions We found marked variations in growth variability between species with coherent patterns of stronger drought signals in the tree-ring series of the southern populations of F. sylvatica, P. sylvestris, and A. alba. This was also observed in species from cool-wet sites (P. uncinata and Q. robur), despite their limited responsiveness to drought. However, in the case of Q. petraea the intermediate population showed the strongest relationship to drought. For drought-sensitive species as F. sylvatica and P. sylvestris, southern populations presented more variable growth which was enhanced by cool-wet conditions from late spring to summer. We found a trend of enhanced vulnerability to drought in these two species. The response of tree growth to drought has a marked biogeographical component characterized by increased drought sensitivity in southern populations even within the species distribution rear edge. Nevertheless, the relationship between tree growth and drought varied between species suggesting that biogeographical and ecological limits do not always overlap as in the case of Q. petraea. In widespread species showing enhanced vulnerability to drought, as F. sylvatica and P. sylvestris, increased vulnerability to climate warming in their rear edges is forecasted. Therefore, we encourage the monitoring and conservation of such marginal tree populations.

AB The establishment of grazing exclosures is widely practiced to restore degraded agricultural lands and forests. Here, we evaluated the potential of grazing exclosures to contribute to the "4 per 1000" initiative by analyzing the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and sequestration (SCS) rates after their establishment on degraded communal grazing lands in Tigray region of Ethiopia. We selected grazing areas that were excluded from grazing for 5 to 24 years across the three agroecological zones of the region and used adjacent open grazing lands (OGLs) as control. Soil samples were collected from two depths (0-15 cm and 15-30 cm) and SOC and aboveground C stocks were quantified in both exclosures and OGLs. The mean SOC stock and SCS rate in exclosures (0-30 cm) were 31 Mg C ha(-1) and 3 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), which were respectively 166% and 12% higher than that in the OGLs, indicating a positive restoration effect of exclosures on SOC storage. With increasing exclosure age, SOC stock and SCS rate increased in the exclosures but decreased in the OGLs. Higher SOC stock and SCS rate were recorded in 0-15 cm than in 15-30 cm. The relative (i.e., to the SOC stock in OGLs) rates of increase in SOC stocks (70-189% year(-1)) were higher than the 4% year(-1) and were initially high due to low initial SOC stock but declined over time after a maximum value of SOC stock is reached. Factors such as aboveground biomass, altitude, clay content and precipitation promoted SOC storage in exclosures. Our study highlights the high potential of exclosures for restoring SOC in the 0-30 cm soil depth at a rate greater than the 4% value. We argue that practices such as grazing exclosure can be promoted to achieve the climate change mitigation target of the "4%" initiative. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY
LA English

DE Barriers; Gene flow; Relatedness; Reproductive mode; Salamandra

AB The riverine barrier hypothesis (RBH) posits that rivers comprise geographical barriers to gene flow for terrestrial organisms, thus promoting genetic differentiation between populations. Here, we explored the RBH on larviparous and pueriparous populations of the live-bearing fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). While larviparous fire salamanders exhibit a semi-aquatic life cycle (females deposit pre-metamorphic larvae on water), pueriparous salamanders present a fully terrestrial life cycle (females deliver terrestrial juveniles) and, therefore, a greater independence from water for survival and reproduction. We performed a fine-scale sampling of opposite transects in 11 rivers (six and five for larviparous and pueriparous populations, respectively) to test the hypothesis that rivers are more effective barriers for pueriparous salamanders due to their terrestrial life cycle. We carried out individual- and population-based genetic analyses using 14 microsatellites and a mitochondrial marker to examine the extent to which rivers hinder short- and long-term gene flow. We found that rivers are semi-permeable obstacles for both larviparous and pueriparous salamanders, although they appear to be more effective barriers for the latter when rivers with similar attributes are compared. We also found that river width and possibly the presence of crossing structures may influence the genetic barrier effects of rivers in fire salamanders. This is one of the very few studies in amphibians showing how different reproductive strategies influence the barrier effects imposed by rivers.

AB Many animals live in societies where individuals frequently interact socially with each other. The social structures of these systems can be studied in depth by means of network analysis. A large number of studies on animal social networks in many species have in recent years been carried out in the biological research field of animal behaviour and have provided new insights into behaviour, ecology and social evolution. This line of research is currently not so well connected to the field of complex systems as could be expected. The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to animal social networks for complex systems scientists and highlight areas of synergy. We believe that an increased integration of animal social networks with the interdisciplinary field of complex systems, and networks would be beneficial for various reasons. Increased collaboration between researchers in this field and biologists studying animal social systems could be valuable in solving challenges that are of importance to animal social network research. Furthermore, animal social networks provide the opportunity to investigate hypotheses about complex systems across a range of natural real-world social systems. In this article, we describe what animal social networks are and main research themes where they are studied; we give an overview of the methods commonly used to study animal social networks; we highlight challenges in the study of animal social networks where complex systems expertise may be particularly valuable; and we consider aspects of animal social networks that may be of particular interest to complex systems researchers. We hope that this will help to facilitate further interdisciplinary collaborations involving animal social networks and further integration of these networks into the field of complex systems.

AB The host contact network structure results from the movement and behaviour of hosts (e.g. degree of sociability; vagility and greater or lesser fidelity of shelters), which can generate heterogeneity in the transmission of parasites and influence the parasitic burden of individual hosts. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the burdens of Gigantolaelaps oudemansi mites are related to the characteristics of the transmission networks of individuals of Oecomys paricola, a solitary rodent. The study was carried out in a savannah habitat in north-eastern Brazil. In the dry season, the rodent network presented sub-groups of rodent individuals interacting with each other, whereas in the wet season, no modules were formed in the network. Mite burden was positively related to the number of connections that an individual host had with other host individuals in the dry season. The pairwise absolute difference between the mean mite burdens among individual rodents was negatively correlated with the similarities of node interactions. No relationships were observed during the wet season. There was a higher heterogeneity of mite burden among hosts in the dry season compare to that in the wet season. In solitary species, spatial organization may show seasonal variation, causing a change in the opportunities of host contacts, thereby influencing the transmission and dispersion of their ectoparasite burdens.

AB Although gene duplications provide genetic backup and allow genomic changes under relaxed selection, they may potentially limit gene flow. When different copies of a duplicated gene are pseudofunctionalized in different genotypes, genetic incompatibilities can arise in their hybrid offspring. Although such cases have been reported after manual crosses, it remains unclear whether they occur in nature and how they affect natural populations. Here, we identified four duplicated-gene based incompatibilities including one previously not reported within an artificial Arabidopsis intercross population. Unexpectedly, however, for each of the genetic incompatibilities we also identified the incompatible alleles in natural populations based on the genomes of 1,135 Arabidopsis accessions published by the 1001 Genomes Project. Using the presence of incompatible allele combinations as phenotypes for GWAS, we mapped genomic regions that included additional gene copies which likely rescue the genetic incompatibility. Reconstructing the geographic origins and evolutionary trajectories of the individual alleles suggested that incompatible alleles frequently coexist, even in geographically closed regions, and that their effects can be overcome by additional gene copies collectively shaping the evolutionary dynamics of duplicated genes during population history.

AB The Mediterranean basin constitutes one of the largest global biodiversity hotspots, hosting more than 11,000 endemic plants, and it is recognised as an area with a high proportion of threatened taxa. Nevertheless, only a tiny fraction of the threatened Mediterranean endemics have their genetic diversity assessed, and we are unaware if and how climate change might impact their conservation status. This is even more pronounced in Eastern Mediterranean countries with a rich endemic flora, such as Greece, which hosts a large portion of the plant taxa assessed at the European level under the IUCN criteria. Using inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers and species distribution models, we analysed the genetic diversity and investigated the impacts of climate change on four critically endangered and extremely narrow and rare Greek island endemic plants, namely Aethionema retsina, Allium iatrouinum, Convolvulus argyrothamnos, and Saponaria jagelii. All four species are facing intense anthropogenic threats and display moderate genetic diversity (uHe: 0.254-0.322), while climate change is expected to have a profound impact on their range size during the coming decades. A combination of in- and ex-situ measures, such as population reinforcement and seed bank conservation, are urgently needed in order to preserve these highly threatened and rare Greek endemics.

AB Contemporary intraspecific patterns of genetic variation reflect the historical effects of population subdivision-expansion and forces like drift, gene flow, and selection. We investigated the population structure of anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) in the Lower Northwest Passage (LNWP), Nunavut, using 3074 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms markers (SNPs). Overall, the genetic differentiation was weak to moderate among 18 sampling locales (global F-ST = 0.037). Populations were structured hierarchically, with a deeper genetic division between King William Island (global F-ST = 0.018) and mainland populations similar to 200 km away to the south (global F-ST = 0.018), and some evidence of genetic subgroups within the former. These findings suggest a role for char migratory behaviour in shaping contemporary genetic population structure, with demographic modelling favouring an isolation with migration over a strict isolation scenario. Twenty-two SNPs were identified as potentially under divergent selection with putative functions including neurotransmission and bone development and growth during late embryogenesis. Our study is the first survey of Arctic char in the LNWP using genomics and provides baseline data for the development of a sustainable fishery within this region.

AB Pampus minor is an important commercial fish. Due to the similarity of external morphological characteristics among the genus Pampus species, P. minor has often been identified as the juvenile group of both P. cinereus and P. argenteus. While little genetic background on this species is known, this study was based on control region sequences and provided the first evaluation of the genetic signature of 264 individuals of P. minor from 11 populations along the coasts of China and Malaysia. The results indicate high genetic haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity in this species. Additionally, two differentiated haplotype lineages were identified in the P. minor populations. However, phylogenetic structures corresponding to the geographical locations were unable to be established. Analysis of molecular variance identified a vast majority of the genetic variation occurring within populations. F-statistic test value (F-ST) of pairwise indicated that great differences existed between the Chinese and Malaysian P. minor populations. For the Chinese populations, the genetic differences were insignificant with the exception of the Xiamen population, which is a marginal population. During the late Pleistocene, a population expansion of P. minor occurred. These expanded populations originated from the glacial refugium in the South China Sea and then rapidly occupied and adapted to their new habitat. The results of this study provide genetic information for ensuring the protection and management of P. minor resources.

AB This study examined tree species diversity, distribution, and community differentiation patterns along an elevation gradient in pine-oak forest in the Sierra Norte mountains in Oaxaca, Mexico. Pine and oak are ecologically and economically valuable both locally and globally, but their dynamics are poorly understood in seasonally dry montane forests. This is a biome that is both widespread, with high human use and importance, and widely understudied. The community-managed forest we studied contained high levels of tree diversity (32 total species), with especially high levels of oak (10 species) and pine (eight species) diversity compared to other pine-oak forests in Mexico. Tree communities in the study area demonstrated high levels of species turnover across sites, especially at mid and low elevations, as well as high levels of oak species coexistence within communities, with a mean of three oak species per 1000 m(2). We identified three distinct tree vegetation types using multivariate ordination and cluster analyses and found that both tree distributions and community assemblages are primarily differentiated by elevation, but also by soil type, topography, and likely successional disturbance from historical land use. Oak communities in the study area followed patterns of phylogenetic overdispersion with species from different sections (red and white) co-occurring more frequently than species from the same section, and demonstrated differences in reported reproductive phenology, with coexisting species alternately fruiting in rainy and dry seasons. This differentiation in both oak species' environmental associations and in fruiting phenology has important management and conservation implications as Mexico becomes more arid with climate change. This study also provided key information for local management as different forest types should have different silvicultural management regimes, as well as essential baseline data useful for a broader theoretical understanding of how closely related species coexist in communities.

AB Recent theories of intergroup relations suggest that factors relevant to disease, disgust, and contagion predict prejudice towards ethnic outgroups. The current research explored the influence of contextual pathogen threat and individual differences in threat sensitivity on outgroup prejudice and avoidance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from a sample of British adults in June 2020 (N = 524). A multi-level approach was employed to capture differences in confirmed COVID-19 cases across different regions in the UK. Results demonstrated that even in a "strong" pandemic context, individual differences in both disgust sensitivity (DS) and intergroup disgust sensitivity (ITG-DS) explained variability in outgroup distancing. Subjective perceptions of contextual pathogen prevalence, but not actual infection rates, also predicted greater outgroup avoidance. However, a significant cross-level interaction revealed that DS predicted outgroup distancing in regions with higher numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, but not in areas of lower infection. Thus, individual differences in pathogen avoidance may be especially influential under high situational pathogen stress. There was also some evidence that pathogen threat also predicted greater ingmup attraction. Results provide important insights into factors that promote or inhibit positive intergroup relations during pandemics.

AB Continuous movement monitoring is a powerful tool for evaluating reintroduction techniques and assessing how well reintroduced animals are adjusting to the wild. However, to date, continuous monitoring has only occurred for large-bodied species capable of carrying heavy tracking devices. In this study we used an automated VHF radio telemetry array to investigate the exploratory behavior and movement patterns of critically endangered ?Alal? (Corvus hawaiiensis), reintroduced to the Island of Hawai?i in 2017. The 11 juvenile ?Alal? we tracked exhibited high site fidelity and initial survival. Over time the birds showed decreased time spent at the supplemental feeders, and transitioned to more focused use of the landscape, suggesting increased foraging on wild food items. Birds with seemingly less spatial neophobia at release also made larger post-release exploratory movements. This study provides the first evidence that 1) supplemental feeding can support site fidelity for reintroduced ?Alal? without restricting a transition to independent foraging, and 2) that pre-release personality metrics may be useful predictors for predicting post-release movements of ?Alal?. Our work is the first to demonstrate the utility and power of automated telemetry for monitoring the reintroduction of small species.

AB A large number of prospective climate scenarios rely on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies to limit global warming below 2 degrees C. To date, however, a comprehensive understanding of the overall life-cycle environmental impacts of CDR technologies is missing. We present a critical review on conducted Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of a comprehensive set of CDR technologies: afforestation and reforestation, biochar, soil carbon sequestration, enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and direct air carbon capture and storage. One of the key observations is that emissions avoided due to substitution of certain processes (due to system expansion in LCA) can be easily misinterpreted as negative emissions, i.e. as carbon removal from the atmosphere. Based on the observed inconsistencies and shortcomings, we recommend to interpret available CDR LCA results with caution. To improve the understanding of environmental implications of CDR deployment, we recommend (1) to conduct LCAs with multiple environmental impact categories, (2) to consider the temporal aspect of emissions in biomass-related CDR technologies, (3) to focus on so far overlooked CDR technologies, (4) to be as transparent as possible regarding methodological choices, (5) to capture environmental side-effects, and (6) to distinguish between 'avoided emissions' and 'negative emissions' - only negative emissions correspond to permanent removal from the atmosphere. We conclude that more comprehensive and rigorous LCAs are needed to help inform the design of CDR technology portfolios and to aid in anticipatory governance.

AB Understanding the distribution of genetic variation is central for both population biology and conservation genetics. Genetic population structure can be primarily affected by the species' dispersal ability, which is assumed to be limited in many amphibians. In this study, we estimated allelic differentiation metrics and F-ST indices to investigate genetic variation among natural breeding ponds of smooth newts (Lissotriton vulgaris) over a small spatial scale. Based on six microsatellite loci, we found a small, but significant allelic differentiation among clusters of natural breeding ponds (i.e. 'local regions'), which result was in line with the calculation of corresponding hierarchical F-ST values. Analysis of molecular variance also indicated significant between-region variation in the study area. Pairwise estimations showed that only the furthermost regions differed from each other in both differentiation measures, but this difference was not attributable to geographic distances between ponds. Our results provide evidence that hierarchical genetic structure can be characteristic to breeding ponds of smooth newts on a small spatial scale in their natural breeding habitat, but dispersal distance may be less limited than previously thought in these philopatric caudates.

AB This paper is mainly concerned with the forced waves and gap formations for a Lotka-Volterra competition model with nonlocal dispersal and shifting habitats. We first show that there exist two positive numbers c(1)* and c(2)* such that the system admits a forced wave provided that the forcing speed c is an element of (-c(2)*, c(1)*) by the iterative techniques combining with some known results for the forced moving KPP equations. Meanwhile, we use some delicate analysis to obtain the asymptotic behaviors at infinity of the forced waves with nonzero forcing speed c is an element of (-c(2)*, 0) boolean OR (0, c(1)*). Then, based on the comparison argument, we prove that the gap formations exist for c > c(1)* and c < -c(2)*. Finally, some numeric simulation results are presented to confirm our theoretical results, which also contains the critical cases of c = c(1)* and c = -c(2)*. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The population genetics of ferns, which results from initiation of individuals in a new location (often via long-distance dispersal) plus a wide range of mating systems, merit continued study. In the case of species in the subfamily Botrychioideae (specifically the genera Botrychium and Botrypus), previous work using allozyme and isozyme techniques revealed low genetic diversity and weak population genetic structure. This lack of genetic differentiation between populations is in spite of underground fertilization in the genus resulting in high levels of inbreeding and primarily fixed heterozygosity in tetraploids. In the present study, Amplified Fragment-Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to examine population genetics and structure of three species in the genus Botrychium and one species in the genus Botrypus. Measures of population genetic diversity were generally low, with the highest measures in the relatively common Botrypus virginianus. Across all species, measures of population differentiation were low and most genetic variation was contained within populations. Bayesian analysis of population structure using the program STRUCTURE corroborated these findings, with inferred genetic clusters that generally did not correspond to geographic collecting locations. These results agree with previous studies, with low genetic diversity within and among populations likely due to selffertilization that limits outcrossing and long-distance spore dispersal that results in genetically similar populations.

DT Review
AB The chemistry of humic substances (HSs) occurs hidden from our sight, but is of key importance to agriculture and the environment, and nowadays even to medicine and technology. HSs are nowadays not only natural, but extracted and engineered, and in the past 20 years such products have been widely used in soil improvement and environment governance. In this review, we collate and summarize the applications and working principles of such HSs in agriculture and environmental ecology, mainly to elaborate the multiple roles of this functional polymer along with physical chemical quantification. Then several of the latest synthesis technologies, including hydrothermal humification technology (HTH), hydrothermal carbonization technology (HTC) and hydrogen peroxide oxidation technology (HOT) are presented, which were introduced to prepare artificial humic substances (A-HSs). The availability of reproducible and tunable synthetic A-HSs is a new chemical tool, and effects such as solubilization of insoluble phosphorus minerals, recovery of phosphorus, improvement of soil fertility for crop growth and reduction of toxicity of typical pollutants, can now be analyzed in detail and quantified. As a result, we can provide an effective chemical technology for utilizing biomass side products ("biowaste") to generate A-HSs of different types, thus realizing improvement in agricultural production and control of environmental pollution by the macro-synthesis of A-HSs-.

AB Ecological niche models are frequently used in ensembles for forecasting range shifts for species under scenarios of climate change or biological invasion. In such applications, maximizing predictive power of model transfers across temporal and spatial dimensions is crucial. Among methods used to produce ensemble models, weighted averages are most widely used, with weights usually based on metrics of interpolative performance of models. Yet model extrapolative ability is not related directly to interpolative ability. Here, we assess and evaluate this often-overlooked aspect of ensemble forecasting. We designed virtual species with six populations distributed across six continents, this allowed us to assess model transferability across global geographic spaces, as opposed to simple expansion into adjacent new environments or shifts into suitable conditions within the same general area. Individual niche models were calibrated on each continent and transferred to the other five continents for evaluation. Performance of consensus and individual models, together with the methods (mean, median, weight average, and PCAm) that were used to produce consensus models, were compared using AUC metrics and commission and omission errors across the spectrum of model thresholds. We found that consensus models reflected the central tendency of the individual model but did not outperform all individual models. Among methods used to generate consensus models, PCAm generally ranked higher than weighted averages, whereas mean and median were impacted by individual models. We highlight pitfalls in weighting individual models for ensemble models produced for model transfers. Regardless of whether models are to be transferred, we recommend using PCAm rather than weighted average for producing consensus models, as it outperformed other approaches and inherently reflects the constituent models' central tendency sought in ensemble forecasting.

AB The phytohormone auxin are important in all aspects of plant growth and development. The Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) gene responds to auxin induction as auxin early response gene family. Despite the physiological importance of the Aux/IAA gene, a systematic analysis of the Aux/IAA gene in Acer rubrum has not been reported. This paper describes the characterization of Acer rubrum Aux/IAA genes at the transcriptomic level and Acer yangbiense Aux/IAA genes at the genomic level, with 17 Acer rubrum AUX/IAA genes (ArAux/IAA) and 23 Acer yangbiense Aux/IAA (AyAux/IAA) genes identified. Phylogenetic analysis shows that AyAux/IAA and ArAux/IAA family genes can be subdivided into 4 groups and show strong evolutionary conservatism. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to test the expression profile of ArAux/IAA genes in different tissues under indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) treatment. Most ArAux/IAA genes are responsive to exogenous auxin and have tissue-specific expression. Overall, these results will provide molecular-level insights into auxin metabolism, transport, and signaling in Acer species.

AB Urbanization is increasing globally and causing rapid taxonomic and functional changes in biological communities. Its effects through time in the same communities have not been addressed properly. Here, we evaluate the temporal changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles between greenspace (Cerrado stricto sensu) and residential sites in an urban landscape in the Brazilian Cerrado. We sampled dung beetles across 3 years (2013-2015) during the rainy season in the same sites. We evaluated these temporal changes using Temporal Beta Index and beta diversity partitioning into its components of replacement and gain/loss. We expected that residential sites will be taxonomically and functionally poorer compared to greenspace sites over the years. We found a general loss of species and abundance-per species from 2013 to 2015, which was more pronounced in residential sites than greenspace sites, since greenspace sites showed some gain of species from 2014 to 2015. Functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence did not change over the years, but were always lower in residential sites than greenspace sites. Functional beta-diversity did not change over the years, but was always higher in residential sites than greenspace sites, with similar contribution of functional replacement and nestedness-resultant components. We demonstrate that greenspace sites are taxonomically and functionally more stable, temporally, than residential sites. Implications for insect conservation
   We advocate that public policies aimed at conservation and management of greenspace sites are important tools for maintaining dung beetle diversity and their ecosystem functions in urbanized landscapes in the Brazilian Cerrado.

AB Parasitic worms (i.e. helminths) commonly infect multiple hosts in succession before reproducing. At each life cycle step, worms may fail to infect the next host, and this risk accumulates as life cycles include more successive hosts. Risk accumulation can be minimized by having high establishment success in the next host, but comparisons of establishment probabilities across parasite life stages are lacking. We compiled recovery rates (i.e. the proportion of parasites recovered from an administered dose) from experimental infections with acanthocephalans, cestodes and nematodes. Our data covered 127 helminth species and 16 913 exposed hosts. Recovery rates increased with life cycle progression (11%, 29% and 46% in first, second and third hosts, respectively), because larger worm larvae had higher recovery, both within and across life stages. Recovery declined in bigger hosts but less than it increased with worm size. Higher doses were used in systems with lower recovery, suggesting that high doses are chosen when few worms are expected to establish infection. Our results indicate that growing in the small and short-lived hosts at the start of a complex life cycle, though dangerous, may substantially improve parasites' chances of completing their life cycles.

AB Bio-derived dielectrics have drawn extensive attention for microwave absorption and shielding because of renewability and environmental friendliness. In this work, foam-like bio-carbon has been obtained from wheat straw waste and its microwave absorption performance has been studied. By controlling the precursor ratio of KOH, the optimized morphology of bio-carbon has been realized. The 3D carbon foam obtained at 600 degrees C with KOH and biomass ratio 1:1 (AC-600 (1:1), presents decent microwave reflection loss. Especially, with a low absorber ratio (10 wt%), the effective absorption bandwidth (RL <-10 dB) can reach 8.8 GHz (7.2-16 GHz) at a matching thickness of 2.5 mm. 3D porous network, interface effect, defects in carbon network, and dipolar relaxation make a good contribution towards broadband and excellent reflection loss. The eco-friendly, lightweight, and low-cost bio-carbon foam has great application prospects of microwave absorption.

AB Successful recovery of populations of endangered plant species requires conservation of existing populations as well as the creation of new populations through reintroduction. However, the ecological requirements of many rare plant species are poorly understood, and many reintroduced populations are unable to survive long term. Effective reintroduction of rare plants, such as the federally endangered Astragalus bibullatus, may depend on developing a greater understanding of the symbiotic relationships that these rare species form with the soil microbiome, as well as determining whether these are species- and site-specific. We inoculated seedlings of A. bibullatus, its more widespread congener A. tennesseensis, and the common grass Schizachyrium scoparium, with soil biota collected from five glade sites where A. bibullatus is historically present (HP) and four glade sites where the species is historically absent (HA). We examined the impacts of soil microbes from HP and HA glade sites as well as from each species on the growth, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization, and formation of root nodules of A. bibullatus and its congener A. tennesseensis. Astragalus bibullatus grew significantly larger when grown in soil from HP glade sites compared to its growth in soil from HA glade sites. Astragalus bibullatus also formed significantly more root nodules when grown in HP soil, but no difference was detected in AMF colonization based on glade history. Our findings suggest that the successful establishment of rare plant species may depend on species-specific associations with soil mutualists such as nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria and should consider whether essential microbes are present.

AB Genetic studies are increasingly detecting cryptic taxa that likely represent a significant component of global biodiversity. However, cryptic taxa are often criticized because they are typically detected serendipitously and may not receive the follow-up study required to verify their geographic or evolutionary limits. Here, we follow-up a study of Eucalyptus salubris that unexpectedly detected two divergent lineages but was not sampled sufficiently to make clear interpretations. We undertook comprehensive sampling for an independent genomic analysis (3,605 SNPs) to investigate whether the two purported lineages remain discrete genetic entities or if they intergrade throughout the species' range. We also assessed morphological and ecological traits, and sequenced chloroplast DNA. SNP results showed strong genome-wide divergence (F-ST = 0.252) between two discrete lineages: one dominated the north and one the southern regions of the species' range. Within lineages, gene flow was high, with low differentiation (mean F-ST = 0.056) spanning hundreds of kilometers. In the central region, the lineages were interspersed but maintained their genomic distinctiveness: an indirect demonstration of reproductive isolation. Populations of the southern lineage exhibited significantly lower specific leaf area and occurred on soils with lower phosphorus relative to the northern lineage. Finally, two major chloroplast haplotypes were associated with each lineage but were shared between lineages in the central distribution. Together, these results suggest that these lineages have non-contemporary origins and that ecotypic adaptive processes strengthened their divergence more recently. We conclude that these lineages warrant taxonomic recognition as separate species and provide fascinating insight into eucalypt speciation.

AB Semiarid forests may face future challenges because of climate change-exacerbated soil droughts. Because the risk and rate of tree mortality from soil drying can vary widely between co-occurring species, inter-specific differences in tree response need to be evaluated for designing science-driven best-management strategies specifically tailored to iconic sky-island ecosystems. We analyzed sap flow of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), and limber pine (Pinus flexilis) for five consecutive years (2014-2018) at a remote, high-elevation site in the North American Great Basin. Our results revealed species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture. For quaking aspen, multi-year sap-flow trajectories mimicked growing-season depletion of soil moisture. Ample cool-season precipitation in 2017 diminished the summer drought impact on sap flow of Engelmann spruce and limber pine, indicating that the two conifers could tap a deeper soil water reservoir than the deciduous species. Since species-specific transpiration response to soil droughts was driven by shifting precipitation regimes, our findings suggest niche partitioning in the rhizosphere among coexisting tree species. In addition, spruce and pine rapidly downregulated canopy conductance with decreasing soil water availability, whereas aspen canopy conductance was insensitive to soil drying. This physiological characteristic allows quaking aspen to maximize resource acquisition when growing conditions are favorable, but poses a risk of hydraulic failure and subsequent mortality under soil drying. Overall, we found contrasting hydrological niches and physiological strategies between co-occurring tree species in semiarid, high-elevation ecosystems. We also emphasize the value of long-term, in-situ observations to determine species-specific susceptibility to environmental changes in remote mountain areas.

AB The increased availability of genomic resources for many species has expanded perspectives on problems in conservation by helping to design management strategies for threatened species. Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) are an iconic and endangered marsupial with an intensively managed breeding program aimed at preventing extinction in the wild caused by devil facial tumour disease. Between 2015 and 2017, 85 devils from this program were released to three sites in Tasmania to support wild populations. Of these, 26 were known to have been killed by vehicles shortly after release. A previous analysis indicated that increased generations in captivity was a positive predictor of vehicle strike, with possible behavioural change hypothesised. Here we use 39 resequenced devil genomes to characterise diversity at 35 behaviour-associated genes, which contained 826 single nucleotide polymorphisms (24 were non-synonymous). We tested for a predictor of survival by examining three genes (AVPR1B, OXT and SLC6A4) in 62 released devils with known fates (survived, N = 39; died, N = 23), and genome-wide associations via reduced-representation sequencing (1727 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), in 55 devils with known fates (survived, N = 38; died, N = 17). Overall, there was little evidence of an association between genetic profile and probability of being struck by a vehicle. Despite previous evidence of low genetic diversity in devils, the 35 behaviour-associated genes contained variation that may influence their functions. Our dataset can be used for future research into devil behavioural ecology, and adds to the increasing body of research applying genomics to conservation problems.

AB Although protocols exist for the recovery of ancient DNA from land snail and marine bivalve shells, marine conch shells have yet to be studied from a paleogenomic perspective. We first present reference assemblies for both a 623.7 Mbp nuclear genome and a 15.4 kbp mitochondrial genome for Strombus pugilis, the West Indian fighting conch. We next detail a method to extract and sequence DNA from conch shells and apply it to conch from Bocas del Toro, Panama across three time periods: recently-eaten and discarded (n = 3), Late Holocene (984-1258 before present [BP]) archaeological midden (n = 5), and mid-Holocene (5711-7187 BP) paleontological fossil coral reef (n = 5). These results are compared to control DNA extracted from live-caught tissue and fresh shells (n = 5). Using high-throughput sequencing, we were able to obtain S. pugilis nuclear sequence reads from shells across all age periods: up to 92.5 thousand filtered reads per sample in live-caught shell material, 4.57 thousand for modern discarded shells, 12.1 thousand reads for archaeological shells, and 114 reads in paleontological shells. We confirmed authenticity of the ancient DNA recovered from the archaeological and paleontological shells based on 5.7x higher average frequency of deamination-driven misincorporations and 15% shorter average read lengths compared to the modern shells. Reads also mapped to the S. pugilis mitochondrial genome for all but the paleontological shells, with consistent ratios of mitochondrial to nuclear mapped reads across sample types. Our methods can be applied to diverse archaeological sites to facilitate reconstructions of the long-term impacts of human behaviour on mollusc evolutionary biology.

AB From regional to global scales, anthropogenic environmental change is causing biodiversity loss and reducing ecosystem functionality. Previous studies have investigated the relationship between plant diversity and functional insect communities in temperate and also in tropical grasslands and forests. However, few studies have explored these dynamics in subtropical forests. Here, cavity-nesting Hymenoptera and associated parasitoids were collected across a controlled tree diversity experiment in subtropical China to test how predatory wasps, bees and parasitoids respond to tree species richness. Abundance and species richness of predatory wasps and parasitoids were positively correlated with tree species richness, while bee abundance and bee species richness were unrelated to tree species richness. Our results indicate that tree species richness increases the abundance and species richness of important communities such as predators and parasitoids. Moreover, the results highlight the importance of subtropical forests in maintaining abundance and species richness of key functional insect groups

AB Addition of biochar and straw has constituted an effective way to improve soil fertility in tobacco fields. However, little is known about the effects of these amendments on CH4 and N2O emissions and their potential microbial mechanisms. Here, we conducted an experiment in tobacco-planted soil using four treatments: mineral fertilizers only (F), biochar with mineral fertilizers (BF), wheat straw with mineral fertilizers (SF), and biochar + wheat straw with mineral fertilizers (BSF). Soil physical and chemical parameters, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions, and the related microorganisms and functional genes (pmoA, mcrA, amoA, nirS, nirK, and nosZ) were analyzed. The results showed that biochar and straw addition significantly increased the uptake of CH4 by 34.2%, 9.3%, and 22.1%, respectively, and significantly increased the relative abundance of pmoA. Compared to the F treatment, the SF and BSF treatments significantly increased cumulative N2O emissions by 1.2- and 1.1-fold, respectively, while the BF treatment significantly decreased N2O emissions from the soil by almost 30%. Correspondingly, decreased relative abundance of amoA-ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), nirS, nirK, and nosZ genes in response to biochar amendment were observed, whereas the relative abundance of amoAammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) increased. Conversely, straw addition increased the relative abundance of amoA-AOA and nirS, nirK, and nosZ. Compared to SF, BSF significantly increased the relative abundance of nosZ and decreased the number of denitrifying bacteria. A structural equation model indicated that the important factors affecting N2O emissions were NH4+-N, NO3--N, pH, and amoA-AOA and nirK genes, while the important factors affecting CH4 emissions were bulk density, pH, SMBC, and pmoA and mcrA genes. Biochar amendment could significantly reduce CH4 and N2O emissions by regulating functional microorganisms and soil physicochemical properties. By contrast, returning straw to the field would increase N2O emissions by increasing the relative abundance of denitrification-related genes.

AB Monitoring of wild bees is becoming more and more popular in nature conservation because of the high indicator value of this insect group. However, uncertainties about the sampling performance of different methods still exist, especially in areas of limited accessibility. We therefore compared four commonly applied sampling methods across vineyard fallows in a species diverse study area over two successive years: hand netting along variable transects (HN), pan traps (PT), trap nests (TN) and Malaise traps (MT). The chosen method significantly affects the number of sampled bee species and individuals, with PT sampling by far the largest number of species and individuals, and HN sampling the most diverse bee fauna. HN samples contained a significantly higher proportion of males, red-listed, large and social Bombus species than PT, but HN and PT samples contained a significantly lower proportion of male individuals compared to MT and TN. PT colour had a significant effect on the number of sampled individuals and species, with yellow PT sampling the largest numbers, while blue PT sampled the largest number of individuals of social Bombus species. The HN sampling results of an experienced and a less-experienced observer differed remarkably, with the turnover component of the Jaccard distance being significantly higher compared to the nestedness component. Our findings indicate that PT was the most efficient method for sampling bees in our study system. Due to species-specific differences in attractivity, sets of different PT colours should be used. However, if the study focus is on red-listed species or male individuals, HN represents a more efficient method. When HN is applied, observer bias should be considered as much as possible, especially with regard to differences in sampling experience. Due to different shortcomings, MT and TN cannot be seen as appropriate methods for standard monitoring of bees.

AB Agricultural intensification is a threat to terrestrial ecosystems around the world. Agricultural areas, especially monocultures, create homogenous landscapes for wildlife. However, certain crops, such as sugarcane, are harvested in phases, creating a mosaic of fields in different stages of growth. We investigated changes in avian communities across four different sugarcane growth stages: emerging, short, medium and tall sugarcane, as well as control sites that represented native savanna habitat in northeast Eswatini prior to conversion to agriculture. In total, we sampled nine sites in sugarcane fields (at different growth stages) and three in native savanna. We conducted bird counts at 5-week intervals along 200m line transects over both the breeding and non-breeding seasons. We recorded a total of 124 bird species belonging to 58 families. Bird species richness and diversity were higher in savannas compared to any stages of growth in sugarcane. In contrast, functional beta diversity and uniqueness were higher in sugarcane than in savanna. Community composition was also different between the two land-uses. While there was overlap in bird species composition between different sugarcane growth stages, there was high beta diversity and high turnover between sites, indicative of the high temporal and spatial variability in bird communities in sugarcane fields. We demonstrated that the spatial and temporal variability created by the different growth stages of sugarcane promotes the occurrence of species with different traits, which may contribute to ecosystem functioning and promote the conservation of bird species as sugarcane fields can provide resource complementation for species with different needs.

AB Anthropogenic land use changes have broad impacts on biological diversity, often resulting in shifts in community composition. While many studies have documented negative impacts on occurrence and abundance of species, less attention has been given to native species that potentially benefit from anthropogenic land use changes. For many species reaching high densities in human-dominated landscapes, it is unclear whether these environments represent higher quality habitat than more natural environments. We examined the influence of landscape ecological integrity on relative abundance and body condition of two native generalist freshwater turtle species that are prevalent in anthropogenic systems, the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) and red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). Relative abundance was negatively associated with ecological integrity for both species, but the relationship was not strongly supported for painted turtles. Body condition was positively associated with ecological integrity for painted turtles, with no strong association for red-eared sliders. Our study suggests that both species benefitted at the population level from reduced ecological integrity, but individual-level habitat quality was reduced for painted turtles. The differing responses between these two habitat generalists could partially explain why red-eared sliders have become a widespread exotic invasive species, while painted turtles have not.

TI Geostatistical significance of differences for spatial subsurface
   phenomenon
SO JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DE Geostatistical significance; Spatial bootstrap; Spatial data analytics;
   Bayes factor bound; Estimation graphics
ID AUTOCORRELATION; TESTS; GUIDE
AB Optimum subsurface development decision-making depends on uncertainty models that integrate all informa-tion, data, and interpretations. Failure to account for the spatial context of subsurface data may lead to naive and overconfident estimations of uncertainty. These assumptions negatively impact the optimality of subsurface development decision-making and, ultimately, the economics of subsurface projects. An essential component is determining the significance of observed local differences in spatial datasets. New and practical methods are required to assess the significance of the difference in local expectation of spatial measures. Then, to determine if the difference is geostatistically significant, we introduce significance measures that account for the spatial context.
   Demonstrations of applications with geostatistical significance cover three unique spatial applications. The demonstrations use realistic synthetic data to account for stationary (i.e., statistics of interest are invariant under translation) and geological trends of a spatial feature, porosity. All examples utilize random function fields constrained by the histogram, two-point semivariogram, local conditioning data, and expert-mapped secondary information. The proposed workflow performs spatial bootstrap to empirically assess the null distribution and uncertainty in the difference in means based on the spatial context for the locally unconditional and conditional cases. The resulting empirically derived uncertainty distributions are applied to calculate p-values for the spatial version of null hypothesis significance testing. Nevertheless, decisions based solely on p-values suffer from misinterpretation and lack of reproducibility. To address this problem, we propose an alternative workflow that computes the Bayes factor bound and estimation graphics to comprehensively analyze the results and provide evidence to support decision making.
   The suggested workflow for geostatistical significance supports other subsurface applications such as trend modeling, stress testing decisions of stationarity checking, and model accuracy against input spatial statistics checks. While presented for subsurface porosity modeling, the proposed workflow is compatible with a wide range of spatial/subsurface settings: soil erosion monitoring, groundwater contamination mitigation, sustainable forestry, mining grade control, design of well pads, etcetera. Furthermore, the proposed workflow offers an improved assessment of uncertainty and robust standards to conclude whether an observed difference over spatial sample data is meaningful.

AB Maintaining genetic diversity and genetic structure in threatened species is recognised as important, but genetic data are frequently missing from management plans. We use a panel of 11 highly polymorphic microsatellites to describe genetic diversity and genetic structure in the Great Spotted Kiwi/Roroa (Apteryx haastii) (GSK). This flightless bird still occupies the majority of its historical range, but its population has become increasingly fragmented due to human activities. Using the most spatially continuous sample set yet collected for this species, we show that extant GSK exhibit high genetic diversity and clear signals of isolation by distance, where there is a strong correlation between genetic similarity and geographic distance between individuals. This suggests that most GSK do not disperse particularly far (15-20 km) and are most likely to settle and mate with close neighbours, promoting fine-scale genetic structuring and high genetic diversity overall. These findings are important for the management of GSK, as current efforts seek to rebuild depleted populations and restore the species back to its full range prior to human arrival in New Zealand. Our data have already been integrated into the GSK recovery plan, informing policy on translocations and other restoration opportunities.

AB PREMISE: Gypsum soils in the Mediterranean Basin house large numbers of edaphic specialists that are adapted to stressful environments. The evolutionary history and standing genetic variation of these taxa have been influenced by the geological and paleoclimatic complexity of this area and the long-standing effect of human activities. However, little is known about the origin of Mediterranean gypsophiles and the factors affecting their genetic diversity and population structure.
   METHODS: Using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches based on microsatellites and sequence data from nuclear and chloroplast regions, we evaluated the divergence time, genetic diversity, and population structure of 27 different populations of the widespread Iberian gypsophile Lepidium subulatum throughout its entire geographic range.
   RESULTS: Lepidium subulatum diverged from its nearest relatives similar to 3 million years ago, and ITS and psbA/matK trees supported the monophyly of the species.These results suggest that both geological and climatic changes in the region around the Plio-Pleistocene promoted its origin, compared to other evolutionary processes. We found high genetic diversity in both nuclear and chloroplast markers, but a greater population structure in the chloroplast data. These results suggest that while seed dispersal is limited, pollen flow may be favored by the presence of numerous habitat patches that enhance the movement of pollinators.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite being an edaphic endemic, L. subulatum possesses high genetic diversity probably related to its relatively old age and high population sizes across its range. Our study highlights the value of using different markers to fully understand the phylogeographic history of plant species.

AB Many Northeast (NE) Pacific fishes and invertebrates survived Pleistocene glaciations in northern refugia, but the extent that kelps survived in northern areas is uncertain. Here, we test the hypothesis that populations of sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) persisted in the Gulf of Alaska during ice-age maxima when the western margin of the Cordilleran ice sheet covered coastal areas around the NE Pacific Ocean. We estimated genetic diversities within and phylogeographical relationships among 14 populations along 2,800 km in the NE Pacific and Bering Sea with partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA 5 '-cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI, bp = 624, n = 543), chloroplast DNA ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit-3 ' (rbcL, bp = 735, n = 514), and 11 microsatellite loci. Concatenated sequences of rbcL and COI showed moderate levels of within-population genetic diversity (mean h = 0.200) but substantial differences among populations (phi(ST) = 0.834, p < .0001). Microsatellites showed moderate levels of heterozygosity within populations (mean H-E = 0.391). Kelps in the same organellar lineage tended to cluster together, regardless of geographic origins, as indicated in a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of microsatellite genotypes. The PCoA also showed evidence of nuclear hybridizations between co-occurring organellar lineages. Individual admixture plots with population clusters of K = 2, 6, and 9 showed increasing complexity with considerable historical admixture between some clusters. A time-calibrated phylogeny placed divergences between rbcL-COI lineages at 1.4 million years at most. The time frames of mutation in the rbcL-COI lineages and microsatellite population clusters differed among locations. The existence of ancient lineages in the Gulf of Alaska, moderate levels of genetic diversity, and the absence of departures from neutrality are consistent with northern refugia during multiple Croll-Milankovitch climate cycles in the Pleistocene Epoch.

AB Spatial variation in community composition may be driven by a variety of processes, including environmental filtering and dispersal limitation. While work has been conducted on the relative importance of these processes on various taxa and at varying resolutions, tests using high-resolution empirical data across large spatial extents are sparse. Here, we use a dataset on the presence/absence of breeding bird species collected at the 10 km x 10 km scale across the whole of Britain. Pairwise spatial taxonomic and functional beta diversity, and the constituent components of each (turnover and nestedness/richness loss or gain), were calculated alongside two other measures of functional change (mean nearest taxon distance and mean pairwise distance). Predictor variables included climate and land use measures, as well as a measure of elevation, human influence, and habitat diversity. Generalized dissimilarity modeling was used to analyze the contribution of each predictor variable to variation in the different beta diversity metrics. Overall, we found that there was a moderate and unique proportion of the variance explained by geographical distance per se, which could highlight the role of dispersal limitation in community dissimilarity. Climate, land use, and human influence all also contributed to the observed patterns, but a large proportion of the explained variance in beta diversity was shared between these variables and geographical distance. However, both taxonomic nestedness and functional nestedness were uniquely predicted by a combination of land use, human influence, elevation, and climate variables, indicating a key role for environmental filtering. These findings may have important conservation implications in the face of a warming climate and future land use change.

AB When animals prefer to make efforts to obtain food instead of acquiring it from freely available sources, they exhibit what is called contrafreeloading. Recently, individual differences in behavior, such as exploration, were shown to be linked to how prone an individual may be to contrafreeload. In this work, our main objective was to test whether and how individual differences in range use of free-range broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were related to the individual motivation to contrafreeload. We also verified whether other behavioral variations could relate to range use. To that aim, over three different periods (before range access, first weeks of range access, and last weeks of range access), chickens with different ranging levels (low and high rangers) were submitted to a contrafreeloading test and had different behaviors recorded (such as foraging, resting, locomotion) in their home environment. During the contrafreeloading test, chickens were conditioned to one chamber presenting a foraging substrate and mealworms, while in the other chamber, mealworms were freely available on the floor. During testing trials, chickens had access to both empty chambers, and the time spent in each chamber was quantified. On average, low rangers preferred the chamber where mealworms were easily accessible (without the foraging substrate), while high rangers preferred the chamber where mealworms were accessible with difficulty, showing greater contrafreeloading. Out of ten behaviors recorded in chickens' home environment, foraging was the only one that differed significantly between our two ranging groups, with low rangers foraging, on average, significantly less than high rangers. These results corroborate previous experiences suggesting that range use is probably linked to chickens' exploratory trait and suggest that individual differences in free-range broiler chickens are present even before range access. Increasing our knowledge of individual particularities is a necessary step to improve free-range chicken welfare on the farm.

AB Mangroves can store more sediment organic carbon (SOC) than freshwater and salt marshes. Understanding how mangroves have responded to historical sea-level rise (SLR) is fundamental to assessing their resilience and capacity to store carbon as SLR accelerates. We quantified landscape-level temporal and spatial trends in historical coastal wetland sediment accumulation and associated SOC content (i.e., storage) along coastal-to-inland gradients in Southeast Florida. The observed trends were transgressive and attributed to the historical rise in sea level. Our results indicate an overall significant increase in the SOC content of the historic wetland sediment succession caused by the vertical accumulation and landward migration of carbon-rich mangrove-dominated plant communities (mean = 0.08 g cm(-3)) into and over carbon-poor wet prairie plant communities (mean = 0.02 g cm(-3)). The observed historical increase in SOC is predicted to diminish over time as the difference between rates of SLR and vertical sediment accumulation increases and because the landward migration of mangrove-dominated plant communities is now obstructed by a shore-parallel flood-control levee. These results are likely to unfold in other low-latitude coastal wetlands where they are sandwiched between rising seas and an urbanized landscape.

AB When environmental conditions change, species usually face three options: adaptation, range shifts, or extinction. In the wake of climate change, it is generally believed that range shifts are the norm in mobile species such as birds, resulting in poleward range shifts. The European Bee-eater is a predominantly Mediterranean species which has expanded its range to higher latitudes over the last decades. Germany in particular has seen a surge in breeding pairs and foundation of new colonies. However, while many experts suggest climate warming as the main driver behind this range expansion, an explicit quantification remains open. Here, we use an ensemble modelling approach to study the recent climatic niche suitability of the European Bee-eater across Europe with a special focus on Germany and project its predicted Palaearctic breeding distribution onto the year 2050 using two global circulation models and two representative concentration pathways. Models were able to predict the current European range of the species with some underestimated areas in Central and Eastern Europe, depending on the selected model. We found a strong relationship between climatic suitable areas and estimated population sizes across European countries that is reflected in most algorithms. In particular, the German population size is in line with climate suitability in the country suggesting a strong climate-population relationship and a high degree of niche filling. Most future predictions point to an ongoing northward expansion of the species while areas in Southern Europe and the Maghreb area remain largely suitable. The strong climate-population relationship makes the European Bee-eater an appropriate indicator species for climate change. Yet the high variability of modelling algorithms also call for caution of using these techniques without careful inspection.

   distribution modelling; vegetation modelling; water balance
AB Background In explaining and predicting spatial vegetation patterns, ecologists have increasingly favoured the use of climatic water balance variables, including actual evapotranspiration (AET) and climatic water deficit (CWD), for representing the hydrologic and energetic environment experienced by plants. Much of the interest in these variables lies in their hypothesized potential to characterize biologically relevant environmental variation more directly than simple climate variables, such as precipitation and temperature. Practically, obtaining AET and CWD values across space requires hydrologic process models that involve assumptions, including assumptions about vegetation transpiration rates. However, transpiration parameter values are rarely known with precision and can vary several-fold within and among vegetation types.
   Approach We evaluate the extent to which assumptions about vegetation physiology in water balance models affect (a) relative spatial variation in modelled water balance values and (b) ecological inferences that are derived from analyses using water balance variables. We demonstrate an approach for identifying inferences that are robust to these assumptions.
   Results Assumptions about vegetation physiology can substantially affect relative spatial variation in modelled water balance values. More importantly, such assumptions can also substantially affect the inferences (e.g., expected vegetation distributions) drawn from ecological analyses that use water balance variables as predictors. Water balance variables are less sensitive to assumptions in environmental settings with abundant water supply, where AET variation is driven primarily by available energy (e.g., temperature and insolation), but they can be highly sensitive to assumptions in drier environments.
   Conclusion Because of their sensitivity to assumptions, water balance variables are not unambiguously superior to simpler climatic and topographic variables, such as precipitation and temperature. However, they retain some advantages, primarily related to their mechanistic incorporation of interactions between water and energy, which may support their use in applications where sensitivity to hydrologic modelling assumptions is low or of minor concern.

TI No-till technology has limited potential to store carbon: How can we
   enhance such potential?
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB No-till is a top soil conservation practice, but if it will be used as a C sequestration strategy, it needs enhancement. Companion practices including N fertilization and irrigation do not often result in net C sequestration or some are unavailable (i.e., biochar) for a large-scale application. Adoption of aggressive or transformative no -till companion practices that genuinely remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and sequester it in the soil as C should be considered. Enhancing both cover crops and crop rotation complexity can be an aggressive biological strategy to boost no-till performance; yet this has not been much discussed. Enhancing cover crops by increasing both the cropland area under no-till cover crops and cover crop biomass production through biomass yield maximization strategies can store more C in the soil than current no-till cover crop management practices. Additionally, inserting multi-year perennial or forages including grasses and legumes into existing no-till row crop rotations could store an additional amount of C. These no-till enhancement practices may not only increase C sequestration in the soil but also boost the overall resilience and ecosystem services from agricultural lands. Their potential can be particularly greater in low C (below C saturation) than high C (at or near C saturation) no-till soils.

AB Context. Most of the effort dedicated to the conservation of biodiversity in the European Union is applied through the establishment and maintenance of the Natura 2000 network, the world's most extensive network of conservation areas. European Member State must actively manage these sites and report the state of the species listed in the Annexes of the Habitat and Birds Directives. Fulfilling these duties is a challenging task, especially when money available for conservation is limited. Consequently, how to optimise the use of the available economic resources is a primary goal for reserve managers.
   Aims. In the present study, we focussed on data-sharing, and we analysed whether data-sharing among institutions may boost the performance of habitat suitability models (HSMs).
   Methods. We collected presence data about three species of reptiles in three different protected areas of northern Italy. Then, we built HSMs under the following two different data-sharing policies: data-sharing of species' occurrence among the different managers of the protected areas, and not sharing the occurrence data among the different managers. To evaluate how sharing the occurrence data influences the reliability of HSMs in various situations, we compared model performances under several sampling-effort levels.
   Key results. Results show that data-sharing is usually the best strategy. In most cases, models built under the datasharing (DS) strategy showed better performance than did data-un-sharing (DU) models. The data-sharing strategy showed advantages in model performance, notably at low levels of sampling effort.
   Conclusions. Overcoming administrative barriers and share data among different managers of protected areas allows obtaining more biologically meaningful results.

AB Aim California's Central Valley, one of the most productive agricultural regions worldwide, is home to a high number of at-risk species due to habitat conversion. Amplifying the issue, the Central Valley faces severe droughts, creating water scarcity in surrounding natural areas. At least 14 insectivorous bat species live in this region, and prior studies show mixed results regarding the impact of agriculture and drought on bats. The aim of this study was to investigate how bats use agricultural areas during drought.
   Location Central Valley, California, United States.
   Methods We deployed ultrasonic acoustic detectors at 274 sites from March through July of 2016, the final year of an extreme drought, and 2017, one of the wettest years on record. We identified bats to species, used single-species occupancy models including biologically relevant covariates and created spatial projections of ecoregion-wide occupancy for each species.
   Results We modelled occupancy for eight bat species. Long-distance migrants in the study area contracted their geographic range during the drought, while resident species did not. Five of the eight bats in this analysis were more likely to occupy areas with orchard crop cover. Lastly, arid-adapted bats used cultivated landscapes during the drought but retracted their range after the drought ended.
   Main conclusions Migratory bats appeared to shift occupancy more during drought than resident bats, possibly because of lower roost fidelity. Additionally, the effects of drought on some bat species in the Central Valley may be buffered by agricultural landscapes acting as drought refugia. Overall, this study demonstrates the benefits of broad-scale acoustic studies which can serve as a tool to track changing bat distributions on the landscape and provide baseline occupancy for acoustically detectable species.

AB One of the challenges in modern ecology is reconciling how biotic interactions and abiotic factors are interwoven drivers of community assembly. beta-diversity is a measure of the variation in species composition across space and time. The drivers of variability in beta-diversity are thus responsible for dictating the trajectory of assembling communities. With data from multiscale surveys conducted in three marine intertidal sandflats, we aimed to determine the relative importance and interdependencies of biotic engineering, environment and spatial distances for beta-diversity. In each sandflat, macrofauna and environmental properties were assessed in 400 samples collected at different spatial distances over 300 000 m(2). The role of environmental variability in driving patterns in beta-diversity and species turnover was dependent on the abundances of ecosystem engineers and spatial connectivity among seascapes as shown by the variance explained by the interaction terms in the variance partitioning. Our results highlight the interdependence between space, environment and species interactions in driving community assembly. Given that most models aiming to explain beta-diversity variation only consider abiotic factors, our findings call for the incorporation of biotic interactions into these models and we argue that this is essential for understanding resilience to environmental change. The degree of interdependence between environment, space and biotic interactions in driving ecological assembly is pivotal to our understanding of how biodiversity will respond to predicted changes in habitats, environment and key species distributions.

AB Context While land use change is the main driver of biodiversity loss, most biodiversity assessments either ignore it or use a simple land cover representation. Land cover representations lack the representation of land use and landscape characteristics relevant to biodiversity modeling. Objectives We developed a comprehensive and high-resolution representation of European land systems on a 1-km(2) grid integrating important land use and landscape characteristics. Methods Combining the recent data on land cover and land use intensities, we applied an expert-based hierarchical classification approach and identified land systems that are common in Europe and meaningful for studying biodiversity. We tested the benefits of using this map as compared to land cover information to predict the distribution of bird species having different vulnerability to landscape and land use change. Results Next to landscapes dominated by one land cover, mosaic landscapes cover 14.5% of European terrestrial surface. When using the land system map, species distribution models demonstrate substantially higher predictive ability (up to 19% higher) as compared to models based on land cover maps. Our map consistently contributes more to the spatial distribution of the tested species than the use of land cover data (3.9 to 39.1% higher). Conclusions A land systems classification including essential aspects of landscape and land management into a consistent classification can improve upon traditional land cover maps in large-scale biodiversity assessment. The classification balances data availability at continental scale with vital information needs for various ecological studies.

AB Accelerating climate and land-use change are rapidly transforming Earth's biodiversity. While there is substantial evidence on the exposure and vulnerability of biodiversity to global change at the species level, the global exposure of intraspecific genetic diversity (GD) is still unknown. Here, we assess the exposure of mitochondrial GD to mid-21st century climate and land-use change in terrestrial mammal assemblages at grid-cell and bioclimatic region scales under alternative narratives of future societal development. We used global predictions of mammal GD distribution based on thousands of georeferenced mitochondrial genes for hundreds of mammal species, the latest generation of global climate models from the ongoing sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), and global future projections of land-use prepared for CMIP6. We found that more than 50% of the genetically poorest geographic areas (grid-cells), primarily distributed in tundra, boreal forests/taiga and temperate bioclimatic regions, will be exposed to mean annual temperature rise that exceeds 2 degrees C compared to the baseline period under all considered future scenarios. We also show that at least 30% of the most genetically rich areas in tropical, subtropical and montane regions will be exposed to an increase of mean annual temperature > 2 degrees C under less optimal scenarios. Genetic diversity in these rich regions is also predicted to be exposed to severe reductions of primary vegetation area and increasing human activities (an average loss of 5-10% of their total area under the less sustainable land-use scenarios). Our findings reveal a substantial exposure of mammal GD to the combined effects of global climate and land-use change. Meanwhile the post-2020 conservation goals are overlooking genetic diversity, our study identifies both genetically poor and highly diverse areas severely exposed to global change, paving the road to better estimate the geography of biodiversity vulnerability to global change.

DE Biotic homogenisation; community assembly; metacommunity; spatial
   heterogeneity; species turnover; temporal ecology
AB The last two decades have witnessed unprecedented changes in beta diversity, the spatial variation in species composition, from local to global scales. However, analytical challenges have hampered empirical ecologists from quantifying the extinction and colonisation processes behind these changing beta diversity patterns. Here, we develop a novel numerical method to additively partition the temporal changes in beta diversity into components that reflect local extinctions and colonisations. By applying this method to empirical datasets, we revealed spatiotemporal community dynamics that were otherwise undetectable. In mature forests, we found that local extinctions resulted in tree communities becoming more spatially heterogeneous, while colonisations simultaneously caused them to homogenise. In coral communities, we detected non-random community disassembly and reassembly following an environmental perturbation, with a temporally varying balance between extinctions and colonisations. Partitioning the dynamic processes that underlie beta diversity can provide more mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal organisation of biodiversity.

AB Land use changes rank among the highest threats to biodiversity, but assessment of their ecological impact is impaired by data paucity in vast regions of the world. For birds, land use changes may mean habitat loss or fragmentation, changes in resource availability, and disruption of biotic interactions or dispersal pathways. As a result, avian population sizes and assemblage diversity decline in areas subjected to urbanization, agricultural intensification, and land abandonment worldwide. This threat is especially sensitive in hotspots such as the Mediterranean basin, where avifaunas of several biogeographic origins meet, encompassing numerous endemic taxa, and ecological specialists with low resilience to habitat modifications. Here, we correlated several facets of bird taxonomic and functional diversity to a fine-grained land-use change classification, in order to identify priority areas in need for enforced protocoled bird sampling in a conservation prospect. For this, we computed the species richness, functional richness, originality and specificity of 211 bird assemblages based on bird extent-of-occurrence data for 279 species and 10 ecological traits. We used a spatialized regression model to correlate bird diversity patterns with bioclimatic gradients and land use change between 1992 and 2018, assessed from an unsupervised clustering on 2 km resolution data. We showed that species-rich bird assemblages are subjected to agricultural intensification, while functionally diverse assemblages are mainly undergoing desertification and land abandonment. Unfortunately, most of these changes occur in areas where protocoled bird surveys with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution are lacking. In light of these results, we urge for the setting of bird monitoring programs targeted mainly on parts of North-Africa and the Levant, in order to allow a region-level evaluation of the threat posed by recent land use changes on the exceptional avifaunistic diversity of the basin. Fostering such regional-scale evaluations of congruences between human threats and centers of diversity is a necessary preliminary step for a pragmatic response to data deficiencies and ultimately setting appropriate responses to avoid the collapse of avian assemblages.

AB Many social networks exhibit community structure, where individuals form discrete subgroups. The composition of such groupings is important for numerous research directions, but their characterization is challenged by data sampling issues. In wild populations, where individuals range over large distances and observation can be limited, social data required to resolve community structure are difficult to collect. Recent studies used simulated data sets to determine the robustness of individual level network metrics under suboptimal sampling conditions, but the sensitivity of community detection algorithms to imperfect sampling has not been assessed. Here, we used simulated data sets to determine how sampling effort and skew influence the ability of three community detection algorithms (fastgreedy, walktrap and louvain) to recover the ?true? community structure of networks under two sampling regimes (field-based observational sampling and sampling through biologgers, e.g. proximity detectors). We also examined the robustness of a measure of uncertainty in estimated community structure (rcom). We based our simulated societies on contact patterns in wild male African elephants, a model system reflecting common sampling challenges of large wild populations. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the algorithms improved with increasing sampling effort and decreasing sampling skew. Under the field sampling regime, when sampling effort is constrained, mid-levels of sampling skew may provide a reasonable compromise between maximizing the mean numbers of observation per individual and minimizing sampling skew. Even with skewed data, rcom can provide a reliable measure of uncertainty in the estimated community assignments, but it should be interpreted cautiously with highly skewed data. The network structures explored represent common sampling challenges for wild populations, but unexplored sampling regimes may drive somewhat different dynamics. Our simulations indicate that adequate sampling even when skewed can be informative and maximization of the number of observations among all individuals should be a general objective. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Isotopic niche indices are increasingly used for assessing food web responses to ecological stress. Understanding the trophic mechanisms that result in 'smaller' or 'larger' isotopic niche space limits the utility of isotopic niche-based metrics. In this study, individual-level diet patterns were quantified for a meso-predatory fish (Gobiomorphus breviceps) in two contrasting lakes, one with stable macrophyte beds and the other a filamentous green algae dominated system. Metabarcoding of gut contents and stable isotope data from 48 fish were compared to abundance and isotopic compositions of macroinvertebrate prey communities. We examined whether: i) niche contraction occurs in response to reduced basal resource breadth and, ii) trophic niche contraction is caused by individual fish transitioning from diet-specialization to diet-generalism. Isotope niche contraction within the meso-predatory fish diet reflected altered macroinvertebrate food web structure within the low-macrophyte lake and additional population-level diet patterns. Niche contraction was associated with increased diet generalism; fish had more taxa (sequenced taxa) in their diet resulting in population-level diet homogenization. Isotopic and diet taxa composition dissimilarity were positively related indicating the isotopic niche reflects diet diversity between individuals. Resource partitioning analysis within populations demonstrated that the meso-predator population diet composition exhibited a non-random distribution of prey. Diet-specialization between individuals, or lack of, determined population trophic structure suggesting that food web structure was driven by diet compartmentalization. These findings illuminate food webs respond to disturbances such as macrophyte loss and suggest observed attributes of food web structure may be scale-independent emergent properties occurred-occurring at lower levels of trophic organization.

AB Urbanization reduces diversity and alters avian assemblages worldwide. Urban greenspaces can alleviate this effect by promoting habitat for some species, but the relevance of urban greenspaces for megadiverse, Neotropical avifauna is misunderstood. Here, we evaluated whether bird diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) and composition would vary with urban greenspace features (size, degree of isolation, heterogeneity and noise) in seven urban greenspaces in southeastern Brazilian coast. Taxonomic diversity was positively related to greenspace size and habitat heterogeneity. Phylogenetic diversity metrics and functional dispersion were not associated with urban greenspace features. Urban greenspaces were dominated by common urban exploiter and non-native species (e.g. Feral Pigeon, Columbia livia, and House Sparrow, Passer domesticus), tanagers (Thraupidae) and tyrants (Tyrannidae), insectivorous and ground foragers, and habitat generalists (only 6 % of forest specialists). Large (and probably more forested) and quiet greenspaces favored forest-dependent species. Species turnover was high among greenspaces (beta = 0.64) but was not related to greenspace features. Our results suggest that the number of urban greenspaces, and the larger and/or heterogeneous urban greenspaces, favor higher taxonomically diverse bird communities; and that noise or a noise-related urban feature can erode abundance of forest-dependent species in urban, Neotropical landscapes.

AB In order to reach carbon neutrality, GHG emissions from all sectors of society need to be strongly reduced. This especially applies to the construction sector. For those emissions that remain hard to reduce, removals or compensations are required. Such approaches can also be found within the built environment, but have not yet been systematically utilized. This paper presents a review of possible carbon storage technologies based on literature and professional experience. The existing technologies for storing carbon can be divided into 13 approaches. Some are already in use, many possess the potential to be scaled up, while some presently seem to only be theoretical. We propose typologies for different approaches, estimate their net carbon storage impact and maturity, and suggest a ranking based on their applicability, impact, and maturity. Our findings suggest that there is an underutilized potential for systematically accumulating atmospheric carbon in the built environment.

AB A body of literature has demonstrated that the right auditory cortex (AC) plays a dominant role in fine pitch processing. However, our understanding is relatively limited about whether this asymmetry extends to perceptual learning of pitch. There is also a lack of causal evidence regarding the role of the right AC in pitch learning. We addressed these points with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), adapting a previous behavioral study in which anodal tDCS over the right AC was shown to block improvement of a microtonal pitch pattern learning task over 3 days. To address the physiological changes associated with tDCS, we recorded MEG data simultaneously with tDCS on the first day, and measured behavioral thresholds on the following two consecutive days. We tested three groups of participants who received anodal tDCS over their right or left AC, or sham tDCS, and measured the N1m auditory evoked response before, during, and after tDCS. Our data show that anodal tDCS of the right AC disrupted pitch discrimination learning up to two days after its application, whereas learning was unaffected by left-AC or sham tDCS. Although tDCS reduced the amplitude of the N1m ipsilaterally to the stimulated hemisphere on both left and right, only right AC N1m amplitude reductions were associated with the degree to which pitch learning was disrupted. This brain-behavior relationship confirms a causal link between right AC physiological responses and fine pitch processing, and provides neurophysiological insight concerning the mechanisms of action of tDCS on the auditory system.

AB Species distribution models (SDM) have been increasingly developed in recent years, but their validity is questioned. Their assessment can be improved by the use of independent data, but this can be difficult to obtain and prohibitive to collect. Standardized data from citizen science may be used to establish external evaluation datasets and to improve SDM validation and applicability.
   We used opportunistic presence-only data along with presence-absence data from a standardized citizen science program to establish and assess habitat suitability maps for 9 species of amphibian in western France. We assessed Generalized Additive and Random Forest Models' performance by (1) cross-validation using 30% of the opportunistic dataset used to calibrate the model or (2) external validation using different independent datasets derived from citizen science monitoring. We tested the effects of applying different combinations of filters to the citizen data and of complementing it with additional standardized fieldwork.
   Cross-validation with an internal evaluation dataset resulted in higher AUC (Area Under the receiver operating Curve) than external evaluation causing overestimation of model accuracy and did not select the same models; models integrating sampling effort performed better with external validation. AUC, specificity, and sensitivity of models calculated with different filtered external datasets differed for some species. However, for most species, complementary fieldwork was not necessary to obtain coherent results, as long as the citizen science data were strongly filtered.
   Since external validation methods using independent data are considered more robust, filtering data from citizen sciences may make a valuable contribution to the assessment of SDM. Limited complementary fieldwork with volunteer's participation to complete ecological gradients may also possibly enhance citizen involvement and lead to better use of SDM in decision processes for nature conservation.

AB Genotype-environment association (GEA) methods have become part of the standard landscape genomics toolkit, yet, we know little about how to best filter genotype-by-sequencing data to provide robust inferences for environmental adaptation. In many cases, default filtering thresholds for minor allele frequency and missing data are applied regardless of sample size, having unknown impacts on the results, negatively affecting management strategies. Here, we investigate the effects of filtering on GEA results and the potential implications for assessment of adaptation to environment. We use empirical and simulated data sets derived from two widespread tree species to assess the effects of filtering on GEA outputs. Critically, we find that the level of filtering of missing data and minor allele frequency affect the identification of true positives. Even slight adjustments to these thresholds can change the rate of true positive detection. Using conservative thresholds for missing data and minor allele frequency substantially reduces the size of the data set, lessening the power to detect adaptive variants (i.e., simulated true positives) with strong and weak strengths of selection. Regardless, strength of selection was a good predictor for GEA detection, but even some SNPs under strong selection went undetected. False positive rates varied depending on the species and GEA method, and filtering significantly impacted the predictions of adaptive capacity in downstream analyses. We make several recommendations regarding filtering for GEA methods. Ultimately, there is no filtering panacea, but some choices are better than others, depending on the study system, availability of genomic resources, and desired objectives.

AB Stomatal regulation serves as an important strategy for plants to adapt to drought. However, the understanding of how complexes of plant-functional traits vary along the continuum from isohydry to anisohydry remains insufficient. In this study, we investigated a proxy of the degree of iso/anisohydry-the water potential at stomatal closure-and a series of functional traits of leaves and branches in 20 temperate broadleaf species planted in an arid limestone habitat in northern China. The results showed that the water potential at stomatal closure was significantly correlated with many functional traits. At the anisohydric end of the spectrum, species had a higher leaf carbon content and vein density, a greater stomatal length, a thicker lower leaf epidermis, higher embolism resistance, higher wood density, a greater Huber value, a greater ratio of fiber wall thickness to xylem lumen diameter, a larger proportion of total fiber wall area to xylem cross-sectional area, a lower water potential at the turgor loss point (TLP), a smaller relative water content at the TLP, a lower osmotic potential at full turgor and a smaller specific leaf area. It is concluded that a continuum of coordination and trade-offs among co-evolved anatomical and physiological traits gives rise to the spectrum from isohydry to anisohydry spanned by the 20 tree species, and the anisohydric species showed stronger stress resistance, with greater investment in stems and leaves than the isohydric species to maintain stomatal opening under drought conditions.

AB Most zooplankton species inhabiting seasonal ponds produce dormant stages to overcome the dry seasons. Zooplankton specimens emerging from the sediment contribute to the ecological dynamics of these ecosystems, because they constitute important energy sources for higher trophic levels in aquatic food webs. In contrast to snapshot studies of the active communities, studying the ecological correlates of the distribution of the egg bank can help identify the potential drivers of zooplankton composition. We tested the association of local (habitat structure and water chemistry), climatic and spatial predictors with the alpha and beta diversity of zooplankton hatchling communities in subtropical seasonal ponds. Incubation experiments were conducted with sediment samples from 11 ponds distributed along an approximately 500-km latitudinal gradient in southern Brazil. We assessed the patterns for the total community, Cladocera only and Rotifera only. The alpha diversity of the total community and Cladocera were primarily related to substrate heterogeneity. Annual rainfall and substrate heterogeneity jointly influenced the beta diversity of the total community. Annual rainfall solely influenced the beta diversity of Cladocera, while substrate heterogeneity influenced the overall beta diversity of Rotifera. Overall, the distinct relationships of the total hatchling community and Cladocera and Rotifera with the explanatory datasets suggest differing sensitivities of the zooplankton groups to impacts in habitat structure and climatic conditions in subtropical seasonal ponds.

AB Members of a social species need to make appropriate decisions about who, how, and when to interact with others in their group. However, it has been difficult for researchers to detect the inputs to these decisions and, in particular, how much information individuals actually have about their social context. We present a method that can serve as a social assay to quantify how patterns of aggression depend upon information about the ranks of individuals within social dominance hierarchies. Applied to existing data on aggression in 172 social groups across 85 species in 23 orders, it reveals three main patterns of rank-dependent social dominance: the downward heuristic (aggress uniformly against lower-ranked opponents), close competitors (aggress against opponents ranked slightly below self), and bullying (aggress against opponents ranked much lower than self). The majority of the groups (133 groups, 77%) follow a down-ward heuristic, but a significant minority (38 groups, 22%) show more complex social dominance patterns (close competitors or bullying) consistent with higher levels of social information use. These patterns are not phylogenetically constrained and different groups within the same species can use different patterns, suggesting that heuristic use may depend on context and the structuring of aggression by social information should not be considered a fixed characteristic of a species. Our approach provides opportunities to study the use of social information within and across species and the evolution of social complexity and cognition.

TI A multiscale view of the Phanerozoic fossil record reveals the three
   major biotic transitions
SO COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The hypothesis of the Great Evolutionary Faunas is a foundational concept of macroevolutionary research postulating that three global mega-assemblages have dominated Phanerozoic oceans following abrupt biotic transitions. Empirical estimates of this large-scale pattern depend on several methodological decisions and are based on approaches unable to capture multiscale dynamics of the underlying Earth-Life System. Combining a multilayer network representation of fossil data with a multilevel clustering that eliminates the subjectivity inherent to distance-based approaches, we demonstrate that Phanerozoic oceans sequentially harbored four global benthic mega-assemblages. Shifts in dominance patterns among these global marine mega-assemblages were abrupt (end-Cambrian 494 Ma; end-Permian 252 Ma) or protracted (mid-Cretaceous 129 Ma), and represent the three major biotic transitions in Earth's history. Our findings suggest that gradual ecological changes associated with the Mesozoic Marine Revolution triggered a protracted biotic transition comparable in magnitude to the end-Permian transition initiated by the most severe biotic crisis of the past 500 million years. Overall, our study supports the notion that both long-term ecological changes and major geological events have played crucial roles in shaping the mega-assemblages that dominated Phanerozoic oceans. Rojas et al. present a new multi-scale model that reveals the three major biotic transitions of the Phanerozoic fossil record. This new model supports the hypothesis that both long-term ecological changes and major geological events played crucial roles in shaping ocean mega-assemblages through the Phanerozoic.

AB Being independent contributors to bone mechanical resistance at the apparent level, quality and quantity of bone primary constituents are essential factors in better fracture risk assessment. Raman spectroscopy (RS) holds great potential for being a clinical tool with providing quality and quantity measurements of the bone mineralized matrix. Beyond mineral quality and quantity, recent years have revealed newly developed RS-derived bone compositional measurements focusing on organic matrix and water though their associations with bone mechanics have not been fully established yet. Herein, the author reported first thorough characterization study investigating associations between twenty different RS-derived measurements and mechanical properties of human cortical bone (i.e., yield and ultimate strength, elastic modulus, toughness, post-yield toughness, and post-yield strain). Forty-five rectangular human cortical beams harvested from all four anatomical quadrants of two male donors were tested under three-point bending. Raman spectra of each specimen were collected at the spectral range of 800 to 4000 cm(1). While correlations were tested among RS-derived measurements via Spearman's rank correlations, multivariate linear regression using mixed effects were used to determine the best RS-derived measurement or the combination of RS-derived measurements in predicting various mechanical properties of human cortical bone. Most of the RS-derived measurements were associated with the mechanical properties (Rm(2) ranges from 8.9 to 68.3%, p < 0.05). The various linear combinations of six RS-derived measurements focusing on different aspects of bone matrix (i.e., nu 1PO4/Amide I, nu 1PO4/Amide III, Carbonate/nu 1PO4, similar to I-1670/I-1640, similar to I-3453/I-2949, similar to I-3584/I-2949) improved the prediction (Rm(2) = 43.5 to 70.2%, p < 0.05). While a causal relationship still needs to be investigated, RS has a great potential to establish a robust patient-specific fracture risk prediction with the latest advances in technologies.

AB Based on microsatellite markers and non-lethal sampling of orchid bee males, we assessed the genetic diversity and population structure of three species, Euglossa pleosticta, Euglossa imperialis, and Eulaema nigrita, collected from forest remnants in the Brazilian savanna biome. Among these species, El. nigrita has being acknowledged as more tolerant to savanic areas, since it is more frequently found in these habitats than the other two species. Thus, we hypothesized that species more associated with forest areas would show lower levels of genetic diversity and higher levels of population structure, since open areas could represent a barrier to the movement of these species. We observed lower levels of genetic diversity (H-E ) in the species highly associated with forest areas (Eg. pleosticta, H-E = 0.66; Eg. imperialis, H-E = 0.44) compared to El. nigrita (H-E = 0.81). Concerning the genetic structure, it was only remarkable among samples of Eg. pleosticta, a species strongly associated with the forest remnants. Despite the documented dispersal capacity of euglossine bees, maintenance of the connections among forest areas in this biome seems to be critical for their conservation in the Brazilian savanna.

AB Much like humans, chimpanzees occupy diverse habitats and exhibit extensive behavioural variability. However, chimpanzees are recognized as a discontinuous species, with four subspecies separated by historical geographic barriers. Nevertheless, their range-wide degree of genetic connectivity remains poorly resolved, mainly due to sampling limitations. By analyzing a geographically comprehensive sample set amplified at microsatellite markers that inform recent population history, we found that isolation by distance explains most of the range-wide genetic structure of chimpanzees. Furthermore, we did not identify spatial discontinuities corresponding with the recognized subspecies, suggesting that some of the subspecies-delineating geographic barriers were recently permeable to gene flow. Substantial range-wide genetic connectivity is consistent with the hypothesis that behavioural flexibility is a salient driver of chimpanzee responses to changing environmental conditions. Finally, our observation of strong local differentiation associated with recent anthropogenic pressures portends future loss of critical genetic diversity if habitat fragmentation and population isolation continue unabated. Lester and colleagues use faecal samples and genetic analyses to investigate the genetic connectivity across chimpanzees. Their results indicate that the global pattern of genetic diversity in chimpanzees is largely characterized by a pattern of isolation by distance with several isolated populations exhibiting strong local differentiation.

AB Increasing evidence shows that structural variants represent an overlooked aspect of genetic variation with consequential evolutionary roles. Among those, copy number variants (CNVs), including duplicated genomic regions and transposable elements (TEs), may contribute to local adaptation and/or reproductive isolation among divergent populations. Those mechanisms suppose that CNVs could be used to infer neutral and/or adaptive population genetic structure, whose study has been restricted to microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA and Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in the past and more recently the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Taking advantage of recent developments allowing CNV analysis from RAD-seq data, we investigated how variation in fitness-related traits, local environmental conditions and demographic history are associated with CNVs, and how subsequent copy number variation drives population genetic structure in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We collected 1538 DNA samples from 35 sampling sites in the north Atlantic Ocean and identified 6620 putative CNVs. We found associations between CNVs and the gonadosomatic index, suggesting that six duplicated regions could affect female fitness by modulating oocyte production. We also detected 105 CNV candidates associated with water temperature, among which 20% corresponded to genomic regions located within the sequence of protein-coding genes, suggesting local adaptation to cold water by means of gene sequence amplification. We also identified 175 CNVs associated with the divergence of three previously defined parapatric glacial lineages, of which 24% were located within protein-coding genes, making those loci potential candidates for reproductive isolation. Lastly, our analyses unveiled a hierarchical, complex CNV population structure determined by temperature and local geography, which was in stark contrast to that inferred based on SNPs in a previous study. Our findings underline the complementarity of those two types of genomic variation in population genomics studies.

TI Dung beetle communities of altitudinal Atlantic forest remnants:

AB The Altitudinal Atlantic Forest is comprised of humid forest enclaves on top of the mountains surrounded by the Caatinga's xeric shrubland vegetation. It is considered a humidity refuge of endemism in semi-arid regions, and it is under intense anthropogenic pressure. Dung beetle communities are widely used as an ecological indicator of environmental conservation. However, dung beetle communities of the Altitudinal Atlantic Forest are poorly studied, and their value for biodiversity conservation in semi-arid regions is unknown. We describe and compare dung beetle communities of Altitudinal Atlantic Forest remnants located in the Brazilian Northeast semi-arid region to evaluate whether diversity patterns and species composition differ among the remnants. We captured 1,333 beetles belonging to 24 species. Only one remnant showed a statistically significant difference in diversity based on species richness and abundance, and beta diversity showed a high dissimilarity among remnants. The remnants had in common only one species, and the dominant species were distinct among them. Species composition was 16% similar among the sampled remnants, and we registered species commonly found in the Atlantic Forest, the Caatinga, and Amazonia. The structure of the dung beetle community in each remnant could be related to the historical origin and maintenance of the Altitudinal Atlantic Forest. Species compositions changed as a result of geographic location and surrounding environments, which act as filters to dung beetle species flow and establishment. We highlight the importance of the Altitudinal Atlantic Forest for the conservation and maintenance of biodiversity in the semi-arid region.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

AB Longhorn beetles are extremely rich wood-boring insects possessing larvae that feed on the xylem of trees and/or lianas, which have detrimental effects on plants; in turn, the hosting plants may play a fundamental role in shaping the longhorn beetle community assemblage. However, factors determining the community assemblage of wood-boring longhorn beetles, particularly along the multiple spatial scales is still in need of further exploration. In this study, we designed an experiment across several spatial scales (from local to macro scales) from tropical to temperate climate gradients in Yunnan province, southwest China to examine to what extend the attributes of host-specificity is shaping the community assemblage along different spatial scales. This study concludes that (1) the wood-boring longhorn beetles showed attributes of host-specificity to a certain degree at the community level, (2) biotic (host plant specificity) and abiotic (climatic gradients) factors jointly shaped community composition of this species along the multiple spatial scales, (3) biotic interactions have a prominent effect on the community composition of this species at local-scale while macroclimatic gradients impose the major control on it at macro-scale. Thus, this study highlights the significance of host specificity in affecting the wood-boring longhorn beetle community assemblage, particularly at local scales.

AB Peanut is typically a geocarpic plant. The developing gynophore (?peg?) in air could not swell normally until it buries into soil, indicating light-to-dark conversion is necessary for early pod development in peanut. As the subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs) are key regulators involved in light signaling pathways, and play crucial roles in plant growth and development. In the current study, a total of 14 AhPIFs were identified in cultivated peanut genome (Arachis hypogaea L., AABB), while seven AdPIFs and six AiPIFs were discovered in the two wild diploids (A. duranensis (AA), A. ipaensis (BB)) respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that peanut PIFs were clustered into four distinct clades, and members within the same subgroup had conserved motifs and displayed similar exon?intron distribution patterns. Gene synteny analysis indicated most of the PIFs exhibit one-to-one homology relationship between AA and BB subgenome in A. hypogaea, as well as among the three peanut species. Gene duplication detection showed that segmental duplication and purifying selection contributed to the expansion and evolution of peanut PIF gene family. Transcript profiles combined with subcellular localization analysis suggested AhPIF3A4 and AhPIF3B4 may possibly be involved in regulation of peanut early pod development. This study could further facilitate functional characterization of PIFs in peanut and other legumes.

AB Questions The taxonomic and functional composition of plant communities captures different dimensions of diversity. Functional diversity (FD) - as calculated from species traits - typically increases with species richness in communities and is expected to be higher in less extreme environments, where a broader range of functional strategies can persist. Further, woody and herbaceous plant families may contribute disproportionately to FD in different bioregions. To build an understanding of these questions using Australia as a case study, we aimed to quantify how FD varies: (a) with species richness, (b) with climate, and (c) between major plant families representing different growth forms.
   Location Australia.
   Methods Data on species distribution and functional traits for 14,003 species were combined and FD approximated using hypervolumes (i.e. multidimensional species assemblage trait niche) based on three traits key to understanding plant ecological strategies: leaf size, seed mass and adult height. Plant assemblage hypervolumes were calculated including all species with suitable habitat in each 10 x 10 km grid cell across Australia, and in each of 85 bioregions. Within bioregions FD was also calculated separately for a suite of largely woody and herbaceous plant families. Relationships between FD, species richness and climate were explored.
   Results As predicted, FD was positively related to species richness and annual precipitation, and negatively related to summer maximum temperature, both in analyses of 10 km x 10 km grid cells and of bioregions (all p < 0.005). However, FD was lowest at intermediate winter minimum temperatures. Patterns identified in families representing different growth forms varied to those observed for all species analysed together.
   Conclusions Strong links between FD and climate could mean significant shifts in the FD of ecosystems with climate change. Monitoring changes in FD and associated ecosystem functions requires a detailed understanding of FD, which we begin to develop in this study.

AB Climate change is regarded as one of the most important threats to plants. Already species around the globe are showing considerable latitudinal and altitudinal shifts. Helen's bee orchid (Ophrys helenae), a Balkan endemic with a distribution center in northwestern Greece, is reported to be expanding east and southwards. Since this southeastern movement goes against the usual expectations, we investigated via Species Distribution Modelling, whether this pattern is consistent with projections based on the species' response to climate change. We predicted the species' future distribution based on three different climate models in two climate scenarios. We also explored the species' potential distribution during the Last Interglacial and the Last Glacial Maximum. O. helenae is projected to shift mainly southeast and experience considerable area changes. The species is expected to become extinct in the core of its current distribution, but to establish a strong presence in the mid- and high-altitude areas of the Central Peloponnese, a region that could have provided shelter in previous climatic extremes.

AB We report for the first time the herpetological biodiversity (amphibians and reptiles) of the Caramoan Island Group (CIG), Maqueda Channel, southern Luzon Island, the Philippines. Herpetofaunal biodiversity assessment, using the standard field-based methodology for survey work, was conducted at nine sites in the CIG, off the northeast coast of the Bicol Peninsula of southern Luzon. The overall species richness (s) in the CIG is 22 (three amphibians, 12 lizards, and seven snakes) represent new island records for a variety of the native species, ten of which are endemic to the Philippines. Beta diversity (beta-diversity) of the CIG is 0.84 reflecting a relatively high degree of local area turnover of species when among-site comparisons were quantified; this finding most likely reflects habitat variability which is consistent with our observation emphasizing how a high proportion of faunal diversity is associated with, or confined, to very specific microhabitats (limestone areas, lower-montane forests, mangroves, beach coastal forests, etc.). The overall community similarity index of the archipelago was 0.545 implying that CIG has moderate overlap of amphibian and reptilian species composition. Our findings provide baseline information on the unique composition of herpetofauna in the CIG, which highlights a general paucity of knowledge about the Peninsula's herpetofaunal diversity.

AB There is great heterogeneity in parasite communities among hosts, understanding the nature and drivers of such variations is still a great scientific quest. Here, we analyse the variation in parasite communities by addressing the following questions: (i) What is the beta-diversity component (nestedness or turnover) that most contributes to beta diversity in parasite communities among anuran species? (ii) Does the beta diversity of parasite communities follow a non-random pattern? (iii) Is the dissimilarity in composition of parasite communities related to the phylogenetic or functional dissimilarity among hosts? We found that turnover in parasite assemblages was the main component of beta diversity, but the variation observed both in the total beta diversity and in its components did not differ from the respective null models. The dissimilarity among parasite communities was not related to the phylogenetic species variability or functional dissimilarity among anuran species for most localities. In short, our findings may indicate a process of resource tracking by the parasite species, in which the resource may not necessarily be conserved phylogenetically in their hosts.

AB Learning about the roles that duplicate genes play in the origins of novel phenotypes requires an understanding of how their functions evolve. A previous method for achieving this goal, CDROM, employs gene expression distances as proxies for functional divergence and then classifies the evolutionary mechanisms retaining duplicate genes from comparisons of these distances in a decision tree framework. However, CDROM does not account for stochastic shifts in gene expression or leverage advances in contemporary statistical learning for performing classification, nor is it capable of predicting the parameters driving duplicate gene evolution. Thus, here we develop CLOUD, a multi-layer neural network built on a model of gene expression evolution that can both classify duplicate gene retention mechanisms and predict their underlying evolutionary parameters. We show that not only is the CLOUD classifier substantially more powerful and accurate than CDROM, but that it also yields accurate parameter predictions, enabling a better understanding of the specific forces driving the evolution and long-term retention of duplicate genes. Further, application of the CLOUD classifier and predictor to empirical data from Drosophila recapitulates many previous findings about gene duplication in this lineage, showing that new functions often emerge rapidly and asymmetrically in younger duplicate gene copies, and that functional divergence is driven by strong natural selection. Hence, CLOUD represents a major advancement in classifying retention mechanisms and predicting evolutionary parameters of duplicate genes, thereby highlighting the utility of incorporating sophisticated statistical learning techniques to address long-standing questions about evolution after gene duplication.

AB By the end of their first year, infants can interpret many different types of complex dynamic visual events, such as caused-motion, chasing, and goal-directed action. Infants of this age are also in the early stages of vocabulary development, producing their first words at around 12 months. The present work examined whether there are meaningful individual differences in infants' ability to represent dynamic causal events in visual scenes, and whether these differences influence vocabulary development. As part of the longitudinal Language 0-5 Project, 78 10-month-old infants were tested on their ability to interpret three dynamic motion events, involving (a) caused-motion, (b) chasing behaviour, and (c) goal-directed movement. Planned analyses found that infants showed evidence of understanding the first two event types, but not the third. Looking behaviour in each task was not meaningfully related to vocabulary development, nor were there any correlations between the tasks. The results of additional exploratory analyses and simulations suggested that the infants' understanding of each event may not be predictive of their vocabulary development, and that looking times in these tasks may not be reliably capturing any meaningful individual differences in their knowledge. This raises questions about how to convert experimental group designs to individual differences measures, and how to interpret infant looking time behaviour.

AB A large number of natural products, especially those used in ethnomedicine of malaria, have shown varying in-vitro antiplasmodial activities. Cheminformatics involves the organization, integration, curation, standardization, simulation, mining and transformation of pharmacology data (compounds and bioactivity) into knowledge that can drive rational and viable drug development decisions. This chapter will review the application of two cheminformatics techniques (including molecular scaffold analysis and bioactivity predictive modeling via Machine learning) to natural products with in-vitro and in-vivo antiplasmodial activities in order to facilitate their development into antimalarial drug candidates and design of new potential antimalarial compounds.

AB Freshwater ecosystems in North America have been greatly affected by invasive species, including invasive amphipods, which has motivated the development of predictive models to inform where invaders are likely to establish. Here, we provide the first predictive model using freshwater-specific habitat layers for the non-native amphipod Apocorophium lacustre (Vanhoffen, 1911) in the Mississippi, Laurentian Great Lakes, and Upper Saint Lawrence river basins, USA, and evaluate its current distribution in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), Illinois, USA. In the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019, we sampled for A. lacustre at 45 sites in the CAWS. Next, we used boosted regression trees to develop an ensembled species distribution model combining A. lacustre occurrence data with the EarthEnv GIS layers to model habitats suitable for this species. We did not find A. lacustre at any of our sampling sites in the CAWS in 2017 nor 2018, but we did find the species at 7 sites in 2019. Our ensemble species distribution model evaluated habitat associations and predicted the potential distribution of A. lacustre with an average area-under-the-curve value of 0.996 and an average true skills statistic of 0.956. The model predicts that A. lacustre could establish throughout much of the Mississsippi River basin and in the Upper Saint Lawrence River basin. These predictions of habitat suitability for A. lacustre can guide management efforts by facilitating monitoring and early detection to prevent further spread and establishment of this species.

AB Hydraulic capacitance and carbohydrate storage are two drought adaptation strategies of woody angiosperms. However, we currently lack information on their associations and how they are associated with species' degree of isohydry. We measured total stem xylem nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration in the dry and wet seasons, xylem hydraulic capacitance, native leaf water potentials, pressure-volume curve parameters and photosynthetic performance in 24 woody understory species differing in their degree of isohydry. We found a trade-off between xylem water and carbohydrate storage both in storage capacitance and along a spectrum of isohydry. Species with higher hydraulic capacitance had lower native NSC storage. The less isohydric species tended to show greater NSC depletion in the dry season and have more drought-tolerant leaves. In contrast, the more isohydric species had higher hydraulic capacitance, which may enhance their drought avoidance capacity. In these species, leaf flushing in the wet season and higher photosynthetic rates in the dry season resulted in accumulation rather than depletion of NSC in the dry season. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms through which xylem storage functions determine co-occurring species' drought adaptation strategies and improve our capacity to predict community assembly processes under drought.

AB Simple Summary
   This study assesses for the first time all the vascular endemic plant taxa of Greece, according to their decline and rarity. Phylogenetic analysis and its spatial overview highlight areas for conservation prioritization. Several of the Greek endemics are threatened with extinction and fourteen of them need to be prioritized, due to their evolutionary distinctiveness. This assessment could act as the baseline and supporting tool for conservation actions, decision- and policy-making for biodiversity, while highlighting the need for a new Red Data Book for the Greek flora.
   Human-induced biodiversity decline has been on the rise for the past 250 years, due to various causes. What is equally troubling, is that we are unaware which plants are threatened and where they occur. Thus, we are far from reaching Aichi Biodiversity Target 2, i.e., assessing the extinction risk of most species. To that end, based on an extensive occurrence dataset, we performed an extinction risk assessment according to the IUCN Criteria A and B for all the endemic plant taxa occurring in Greece, one of the most biodiverse countries in Europe, in a phylogenetically-informed framework and identified the areas needing conservation prioritization. Several of the Greek endemics are threatened with extinction and fourteen endemics need to be prioritized, as they are evolutionary distinct and globally endangered. Mt. Gramos is identified as the most important conservation hotspot in Greece. However, a significant portion of the identified conservation hotspots is not included in any designated Greek protected area, meaning that the Greek protected areas network might need to be at least partially redesigned. In the Anthropocene era, where climate and land-use change are projected to alter biodiversity patterns and may force many species to extinction, our assessment provides the baseline for future conservation research, ecosystem services maintenance, and might prove crucial for the timely, systematic and effective aversion of plant extinctions in Greece.

AB Buruli ulcer caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) is identified by a pain-free cyst or edema which develops into a massive skin ulcer if left untreated. There are reports of chemoresistance, toxicity, noncompliance, and poor efficacy of current therapeutic options. Previously, we used cheminformatics approaches to identify potential antimycobacterial compounds targeting major receptors in M. ulcerans. In this paper, we sought to identify potential bioactive compounds by targeting Cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS) MetB, a key receptor involved in methionine synthesis. Inhibition of methionine synthesis restricts the growth of M. ulcerans. Two potent inhibitors Juglone (IC50 0.7 +/- 0.7 mu mol/L) and 9-hydroxy-alpha-lapachone (IC50 0.9 +/- 0.1 mu mol/L) were used to generate 3D chemical feature pharmacophore model via LigandScout with a score of 0.9719. The validated model was screened against a pre-filtered library of 2530 African natural products. Compounds with fit scores above 66.40 were docked against the structure of CGS to generate hits. Three compounds, namely Gentisic 5-O glucoside (an isolate of African tree Alchornea cordifolia), Isoscutellarein (an isolate of Theobroma plant) and ZINC05854400, were identified as potential bioactive molecules with high binding affinities of -7.1, -8.4 and -8.4 kcal/mol against CGS, respectively. Novel structural insight into the binding mechanisms was elucidated using LigPlot+ and molecular dynamics simulations. All three molecules were predicted to possess antibacterial, anti-ulcerative, and dermatological properties. These compounds have the propensity to disrupt the methionine synthesis mechanisms with the potential of stagnating the growth of M. ulcerans. As a result of reasonably good pharmacological profiling, the three drug-like compounds are potential novel scaffolds that can be optimized into antimycobacterial molecules.

AB The stingless bees of the genus Melipona play an important role as pollinators of wild and cultivated plants in the Neotropics, contributing to forest maintenance and food production. Similar to other bees, meliponids are threatened by anthropogenic impacts on the environment, such as habitat conversion and climate change. Here, we apply ecological niche models to estimate the habitat suitability for ten stingless bee species from Brazil. We quantify the impacts of land use change and climate change on their distribution. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of the Brazilian protected areas (PAs) for the conservation of these species. We found that the predicted species range increased in agricultural lands and decreased in natural vegetation between 2000 and 2014. Our models predict that seven species will face a reduction and three species an increase in their suitable habitat in the coming years. The Brazilian PAs fail in safeguarding the majority of climatically suitable habitats for the stingless bee species studied. Our findings suggest that land use and climate change pose a serious risk for the conservation of stingless bees and their pollination services in Brazil.

AB Avian malaria and related haemosporidians (genera Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon) infect most clades of bird. Although these parasites are present in almost all continents, they have been irregularly studied across different geographical regions. Despite the high bird diversity in Asia, the diversity of avian haemosporidians in this region is largely unknown. Moreover, anthropogenic changes to habitats in tropical regions may have a profound impact on the overall composition of haemosporidian communities. Here we analyzed the diversity and host association of bird haemosporidians from areas with different degrees of anthropogenic disturbance in Myanmar, revealing an unexplored diversity of these parasites (27% of newly-discovered haemosporidian lineages, and 64% of new records of host-parasite assemblages) in these tropical environments. This newly discovered diversity will be valuable for detecting host range and transmission areas of haemosporidian parasites. We also found slightly higher haemosporidian prevalence and diversity in birds from paddy fields than in individuals from urban areas and hills, thus implying that human alteration of natural environments may affect the dynamics of vector-borne diseases. These outcomes provide valuable insights for biodiversity conservation management in threatened tropical ecosystems.

AB There is consensus that greater biodiversity is essential to maintain the ecosystem function and stability. Variation in spatial plant community heterogeneity (beta diversity) affects productivity and ecosystems function; however, relatively few studies have addressed how beta diversity and its components (i.e. species turnover and nestedness) may relate to ecosystems function. In this study, we assessed plant community diversity (richness and evenness) and spatial heterogeneity along a productivity gradient in different bioclimatic regions including desert-steppe, steppe, semi-steppe and Mediterranean rangelands in south west of Iran, and tested (1): how and to what extent the different components of plant diversity affect aboveground biomass (AGB; as ecosystem productivity) and (2): the mechanisms underlying the relationship between beta diversity and ecosystem productivity; i.e. niche complementary and selection effects. Sampling was executed in each bioclimatic region by choosing eight sites and estimating AGB of plant species in 2 x 2 m plots nested within 3 macro plots of 30 x 30 m.
   The results showed that AGB was significantly predicted by species richness; positively in desert-steppe, steppe and semi-steppe rangelands and negatively in Mediterranean rangeland. Furthermore, AGB was negatively predicted by evenness in desert-steppe and semi-steppe rangelands. There were significantly negative relationships between beta diversity and AGB in desert-steppe, steppe and semi-steppe rangelands, while, the significantly positive relationship was found for Mediterranean rangeland. The AGB was significantly and positively related to the turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity in Mediterranean rangeland. However, a negative relationship was found with turnover in desert-steppe and semi-steppe rangelands.
   Our results indicate that niche complementarity may play a critical role in providing and provision ecosystems productivity in steppe and Mediterranean rangelands, while, both selection effects and niche complementarity hypotheses could be verified in low-productive regions (desert-steppe and semi-steppe rangelands). Comparing the strength of species diversity with beta diversity in predicting ecosystems productivity across different bioclimatic regions, our results revealed that beta diversity predict ecosystems productivity more effectively and provide support for biodiversity-ecosystems function theories.

AB Biochar can enhance crop production and sequester carbon, but there have been few studies with tree crops. Rubber plantations cover more than 8 million hectares in Southeast Asia, so we assessed the feasibility of biochar application in these plantations with a pot trial. Rubber seedlings were planted in soil with four concentrations (0, 1.25%, 2.5% and 5%, w/w) of biochar combined with two concentrations of compound fertilizer (0 kg/ha and 300 kg/ha). Soil properties and seedling growth were measured, and a leaching experiment was conducted in the rainy season. Our results show that biochar increased pH, water content (27.4-65.1%), total carbon (25.4-53.6%), nitrate nitrogen, and available phosphorus in the soil, and decreased bulk density (3.2-23.9%). Biochar treatment reduced leaching of ammonium nitrogen and ortho-P. Biochar increased seedling nutrient uptake (C, N, P and K), with 2.5% and 5% biochar showing the largest effects, but seedling biomass was the highest with 1.25%, and declined in 2.5% and 5%. Our results suggest that biochar addition is an effective way to improve rubber plantation soils, sequester more carbon and decrease nutrient leaching, but the optimum application rate under field conditions needs further research.
