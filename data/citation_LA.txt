AB The Atlantic and Amazon rainforests have a shared but unclear past, with intermittent connections resulting from historical climate change. We investigate these connections by studying the phylogeography and climatic niche of the disjunct distributed frog Lithobates palmipes. We sequenced two fragments of mitochondrial DNA from Atlantic Forest (AtF) and Amazonia (AmF) individuals and evaluated how genetic diversity is distributed in space and whether past demographic changes occurred. Also, we evaluated the existence of past suitable connections between biomes for L. palmipes through ecological niche models (ENM) and tested for niche divergence. The AtF group is nested within the AmF group and closely related to individuals from eastern Amazonia, a pattern recovered in many species that used northeast connection routes. We found evidence of recurrent use of connections in different directions and time during the Pleistocene, resulting in genetic structure between biomes, with no signal of demographic change and evidence of niche divergence across both genetic groups. ENMs indicated suitable areas connecting forests throughout northeastern Brazil during the Pleistocene. Mitochondrial lineages do not match biomes exactly. One lineage is composed of AtF populations and eastern Amazonia individuals. The other is composed of western Amazonia individuals, suggesting an effect of past climatic heterogeneity within the Amazonia forest. This is the first evidence that this route drove genetic and ecological diversity for amphibians recently, a group with habits and ecological requirements different from other vertebrates that have been shown to use this putative corridor.

AB Tropical dry forests are among the most threatened and yet the most biodiverse Neotropical ecosystems. However, current patterns of biological occupancy in these forests remain poorly studied. Here, we document the diversity, patterns of seasonal turnover and change of species composition over time of birds in a highly exploited but protected tropical dry forest of southwestern Ecuador, Bosque Protector Puyango. Using a combination of mist netting, song recording and direct observations, we surveyed the study site over a 2-month period of fieldwork during both the dry and rainy seasons. We then performed a literature review of the species reported in this site and compared the changes in composition over time using a historical survey. One hundred sixty-one species of birds belonging to 40 families were recorded inside the area. One hundred and six species were found in this survey and 55 were recovered from the literature. Seasonality did not significantly affect species abundance and richness; however, species dominance changed notably. Although the overall species richness of the site has been maintained, we found an overwhelming change of species composition during the last two decades in this forest. Our results show that this highly threatened forest still hosts a unique high avian diversity. Conservation actions should be encouraged in the region, motivating the local communities to develop non-extractive economic practices, such as birdwatching and ecotourism.

AB Soil microbes regulate the storage of carbon (C) in peatlands, which is facilitated by nutrients. To date, few researchers have examined the spatial distribution of soil microbial biomass, microbial community structure, and their metabolic nutrient limitations in mountain peatlands at different altitudes. This study aimed to improve the knowledge of how and why soil microbial biomass and their metabolic nutrient limitations varied with altitude. We investigated the phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and enzymatic stoichiometry in surface (0-20 cm) and subsurface (20-50 cm) soil from peatlands with different types of vegetation in the Changbai Mountains. Overall, the soil microbial PLFAs were higher in the sedge-dominated peatlands than in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The soil microbial PLFAs in the sedge-dominated peatlands were elevated at high altitudes but decreased with altitude in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The soil fungal/bacterial ratios (F/B) in the surface soil increased with altitude in the sedge-dominated peatlands but not in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacteria ratios (G+/G-) in the surface soil decreased with altitude in the sedge-dominated and shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The soil F/B ratios were higher, but the G+/ G- ratios were lower in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands than in the sedge-dominated peatlands. The soil pH and nutrient ratios explained most of the differences in soil bacterial and fungal PLFAs, respectively. However, the total nutrients of soil were the primary regulators of soil F/B and G+/G-. The soil microbial activities suffered from C- and phosphorus (P)- limitations in the mountain peatlands. The limitations were worse in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands than in the sedge-dominated peatlands. The P limitations were greater at high altitude than at low altitude in both types of peatlands. The C and P limitations on soil microbial metabolism were primarily controlled by soil physical properties and nutrient ratios, respectively.

AB Management of tropical forest in the form of timber harvesting is a viable alternative to deforestation in Ama-zonia. Nevertheless, a significant challenge for timber management in the Amazon is the maintenance or establishment of commercial timber species, after logging operations are completed. This is because fast-growing non-commercial pioneer species outcompete the slower growing timber species. To determine the challenges posed to commercial species in the context of the cutting cycle in the Brazilian Amazon of 25-35 years, growth and cumulative survival rates of six abundant pioneer species were assessed. This was accomplished with 30 years of growth data from permanent plots established in the Central Amazon in the 1980 ' s and logged in 1987 and 1988 at various intensities. In terms of relative growth rates, pioneer species dominated the post-logging site by 2 to 5 times, when compared to commercial species, throughout the evaluation period. This was regardless of the various logging intensities of 5, 8 or 16 trees harvested per hectare. Two commercial pioneer species, Jacaranda copaia and Simarouba amara, presented rapid growth rates similar to non-commercial pioneer species. Three pioneer species survived beyond 30 years to continue into a potential 2nd cutting cycle. Therefore, to maintain or establish commercial timber species while there is a continued and expanding site occupancy of non-commercial pioneer species after logging presents numerous challenges for sustainable forest management.

AB Invasive alien plant species (IAPS) in urban ecosystems can significantly impact ecosystems and human wellbeing. However, our knowledge on the IAPS in urban ecosystems are limited due to the small number of studies. In this study, we examined features of the invasion process of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) by using a comparative study approach and genetic population methods. We conducted field surveys in 19 prefecture-level cities in East China and collected samples of 37 urban and 18 non-urban populations in 16 cities. Using information from six microsatellite loci and two chloroplast spacers extracted from the samples, we tested hypotheses on the source, genetic diversity, and genetic patterns of urban populations of common ragweed. We found that urban populations of common ragweed had more modern and diverse invasion sources than that of non-urban populations. Also, urban populations had more complex genetic patterns than non-urban populations as we identified seven genetic clusters in urban populations and four genetic clusters in non-urban populations. Nevertheless, no significant difference was found between the genetic diversity of urban and non-urban populations. In addition, we observed a significant isolation by distance (IBD) pattern in non-urban populations (Mantel test, R2 =0.160, p-value=0.001) but not in urban populations (R2 =0.003, p-value=0.253). The patterns may be shaped by the long-distance dispersal of seeds of common ragweed in urban environments through human activities such as transportation. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the invasion process of IAPS in urban ecosystems.

AB Understanding how human-dominated landscapes affect biodiversity and ecosystems is essential for effective conservation planning. This work aims to understand the relationship between the acoustic diversity of forested landscapes, and descriptors of habitat structure, composition, and anthropogenic pressure, as well as to identify the characteristic scale at which acoustic community diversity relates to those metrics in central Massachusetts. Ten passive acoustic recorders were placed within forest areas in central Massachusetts, during the breeding season. Mono audio recordings were collected during the dawn chorus. The relationship between acoustic indices (AI), and core habitat quality, connectivity, vegetation productivity, percent tree cover, human edge, artificial illumination, and traffic noise were assessed. Significant relationships were found between AI and variables related to habitat structure and human pressure. Sounds related to biota (biophony) and acoustic complexity were positively correlated with core habitat quality, connectivity, and vegetation while negatively correlated with human pressure variables, including nighttime lights, traffic noise, and human edge. AI can therefore act as successful indicators of habitat quality in highly modified landscapes The highest correlations were found at buffers between 1.5 and 3 Km. This response of AI to the broad spatial context and not to the local site characteristics indicate that they can act as robust landscapescale indicators. The large characteristic scale indicates that urban planning should consider potential impacts acting at scales beyond site planning. Moreover, conservation planning can benefit from managing the context matrix to support biodiversity, particularly traffic noise and artificial illumination reduction initiatives.

AB We present a taxonomic revision of maned sloths, subgenus Bradypus (Scaeopus), a taxon endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and currently composed of a single species, the vulnerable Bradypus torquatus. Our review is based on coalescent species delimitation analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, morphological analyses, and field observations. Our integrative approach demonstrates that two species of maned sloth can be recognized: the northern maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus) occurring in the Brazilian states of Bahia and Sergipe, and the southern maned sloth (Bradypus crinitus), occurring in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo states. The two species diverged in the Early Pliocene and are allopatrically distributed. We discuss the biogeographic pattern of the two maned sloth species, comparing it with other Atlantic Forest mammals. We also suggest that the conservation status of both maned sloths needs to be reassessed after this taxonomic rearrangement.

AB Aims Plant-plant interactions are determined by resource availability. However, its responses to differences in soil phosphorus (P) and water and the rhizospheric driving mechanism have not been systematically revealed. Methods A pot-culture experiment was conducted in monoculture and in mixture with maize and grass pea. Resource stress treatments were created by organic and inorganic P applications (phytate and KH2PO4) as well as drought and well-watered treatments to address the above issue. Results Intercropping increased system yield and biomass by 3.5% and 4.5% on average in soils with sufficient P and water, and by 12.0% and 11.7% under stressful conditions respectively. With increasing water and P availability, the yield-based interaction types transited from mutually facilitated to maize facilitated with grass pea as facilitator. Comparatively, the biomass-based facilitation shifting from maize facilitated and grass pea neutral to both being facilitated with increasing stress. This shift was probably mediated by complementary use of soil water in the two species, and rhizospheric acidification in grass pea. Also, rhizospheric interactions promoted phosphatase secretion by 5.3-22.2%, and mobilized organic P to buffer P limitation under P-deficient soils. Regardless of crop species, reproductive and vegetative biomass fell into a typical allometric pattern (alpha > 1). The rhizospheric interactions drove the differentiated biomass allocation patterns and the species-specific interaction transition. Conclusion High P and water environments intensified the asymmetric interspecific competition. The trait-dependent facilitation shift was mechanically driven by rhizospheric interaction in intercropping systems. The findings update the understanding on stress gradient hypothesis in a modified model.

AB The Cerrado-Amazon transition (CAT) is located between the two largest biogeographic domains of the Neotropical region, coinciding with the "Arc of Deforestation", an agricultural frontier that expands towards the Amazon. Fire plays an important role in the landscape changes that have been occurring in this transition. Thus, the objectives of this study were (i) evaluate the accuracy of different algorithms/techniques in predicting fires in the CAT; (ii) investigate the season of highest fire probabilities in the CAT; and (iii) identify, among anthropic, climatic, topographic and soil variables, the main drivers of fires spatial distribution in the CAT. Fire occurrence data (active fire pixels) from the MODIS sensor were used as input data in species distribution models. The SDM allowed the construction of monthly fire probability models for the study area. The model's quality was assessed by R-squared, RMSE, AUC and TSS metrics. In addition, we assessed the weight of variables in building the models. To obtain the fire seasonality, we used the bootstrap technique to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) about the mean. As result, we found that all algorithms obtained satisfactory performance, as well as the ensemble model technique used, which obtained an average AUC of 0.812 +/- 0.001. The algorithm with the best individual performance was Random Forest, with a mean AUC 0.851 +/- 0.002. Similar patterns were found when considering TSS metrics. The predicted and observed fire occurrences showed strong association (R-2 = 0.81). The high fire probability area was higher during the dry season (15304.37 +/- 41.65), showing a significant difference (p-value <= 0.05) from the rainy season. The variables that most explained the fire occurrences along the CAT were 'Silt Fraction', 'Distance from Agriculture' and 'Maximum Temperature'. In addition, 'Distance from Roads', 'Distance from Protected Areas' and Elevation' were relevant for the monthly models. Anthropogenic variables were more important during the dry season. The results demonstrate that SDMs can be adequately used in fire prediction. Protected areas have shown an important role in acting as a fire barrier. However, many of these areas are vulnerable, surrounded by high fire probabilities during the dry season, predominantly anthropic, putting the natural dynamics of fire in the region and the local biodiversity at risk. Our approach can be useful in environmental protection and monitoring, in addition to facilitating the understanding about the CAT ecological complexity and the high anthropogenic pressure happening there.

AB Second-growth forests (SGF) are critical components for limiting biodiversity loss and climate change mitigation. However, these forests were established after anthropic disturbances such as land use for planting, and in highly human-modified landscapes. These interventions can decrease the ability of biological communities to recover naturally, and it is necessary to understand how multiple drivers, from local scale to landscape scale influence the diversity and carbon stock of these forests in natural regeneration. For this, we used data from 37 SGF growing on areas previously used for eucalyptus plantations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, after the last cut cycle. For each SGF, the forest tree species diversity was calculated based on the Hills number, and we also calculated the aboveground carbon stock. Then, we evaluated the influence of multiple environmental factors on these indexes: soil properties, past-management intensity, patch configuration, and landscape composition. Little influence of soil properties was found, only soil fertility negatively influenced above-ground carbon stock. However, pastmanagement intensity negatively influenced tree species diversity and carbon stock. The isolation of other forests and tree species propagules source distance (>500 ha) also negatively influenced the diversity of species. This is probably due to the favoring of tree pioneer species in highly human-modified landscapes because they are more tolerant of environmental changes, less dependent on animal dispersal, and have low carbon stock capacity. Thus, areas with higher past-management intensity and more isolated areas are less effective for passive restoration and may require intervention to recover tree diversity and carbon stock in the Atlantic Forest. The approach, which had not yet been applied in the Atlantic Forest, brought similar results to that found in other forests, and serves as a theoretical basis for choosing priority areas for passive restoration in the biome.

AB Despite much research on mimicry, little is known about the ecology of dynamic mimetic signals involving mimicry of multiple species. Some of the most conspicuous examples of phenotypically plastic mimicry are produced by oscine passerines, where vocal production learning enables some species to mimic multiple models and flexibly adjust what they mimic and when. While singing from a perch, male superb lyrebirds (Menura novaehollandiae) accurately imitate multiple songs and calls of over 20 species of bird. However, at key moments within their multimodal displays performed on display arenas on the forest floor, males mimic a small number of mobbing-alarm calls creating the acoustic illusion of a mixed-species mobbing flock ('D-song'). Using observations from camera footage and a field-based playback experiment, we tested six hypotheses for alarm call model selection within D-song. Mimicked species were remarkably invariant, with 79% of D-song made up of imitations of just three different bird species. Males did not mimic the most common species in their general environment, but neither did they mimic rare species. Instead, males imitated the mobbing-alarm calls of heterospecific birds that foraged on or near the forest floor. Indeed, males primarily mimicked the alarm calls of heterospecific species that foraged alongside lyrebirds and were likely to appear together in experimentally-induced, terrestrial mobbing flocks. These findings support the hypothesis that males mimic a cue of a terrestrial predatory threat to lyrebirds, most likely to exploit the antipredator behaviour of female lyrebirds. Our study illustrates the importance of investigating the drivers of model selection in dynamic multi-model mimicry.

AB The ecological functions restoration in agricultural areas is a major challenge on a landscape scale. In the specific case of active restoration through Agroforestry Systems (AFS), the absence of a specific direction hinders ecological restoration processes, especially in regions that prefer intensive agriculture. Thus, this study aims to develop a Spatial Indicator of Priority Areas to guide Agroforestry Systems implementation in agricultural landscapes. A spatial multicriteria decision analysis (MDCA) was carried out based on environmental factors: soil, geology and slope (which determine the natural vulnerability of the land) and anthropogenic factors: land use and land cover, forest fragments, potential land use capacity and legal protected areas in rural properties (which reflects human pressure and land use suitability). Subsequently, four priority levels were classified for agroforestry interventions: (1) Low priority; (2) Average priority; (3) High priority; (4) Extreme priority. A final map was made to identify priority areas for landscape recovery in 9 cities located at the mouth of the Mogi Guacu River Hydrographic Basin, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Considering the natural vulnerability of the land and the multifunctional aspects of the landscape, the scenarios projection allowed a consensus for forest conservation and agricultural suitability perspectives. A final combination of the explored aspects culminated in the spatial indicator, which model foresees 22,300 ha available for urgent actions for restoration, reforestation and sustainable exploitation through agroforestry systems. We emphasize the challenges in reconciling the socioeconomic and ecological functions in the agroecosystem, however, the metric provides a more inclusive and assertive management strategy for natural resources and advances towards the goal of reforestation and implementation of payment for environmental services (PES) schemes.

AB In invasion scenarios, native and introduced species co-occur creating new interactions and modifying existing ones. Many plant-plant and plant-insect interactions are mediated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs), however, these have seldom been studied in an invasion context. To fill this knowledge gap, we explored some interactions mediated by VOCs between native and introduced plants and insects in a New Zealand system. We investigated whether a native plant, Leptospermum scoparium (manuka), changes its volatile profile when grown adjacent to two European introduced plants, Calluna vulgaris (heather) and Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom), in a semi-field trial using potted plants without above- or below-ground physical contact. We also investigated the influence of plant cues on the host-searching behaviour of two beetles, the native Pyronota festiva (manuka beetle), and the introduced biocontrol agent Lochmaea suturalis (heather beetle), by offering them their host-plant and non-host volatiles versus clean air, and their combination in a Y-tube olfactometer. As a follow-up, we performed preference/feeding tests in Petri dishes with fresh plant material. Results of the semi-field experiment show a significant reduction in green leaf volatiles, sesquiterpenes and total volatile emissions by manuka plants neighbouring heather. In the Y-tube assays, the native beetle P. festiva performed poorly in discriminating between host and non-host plants based on plant volatile cues only. However, it performed relatively well in the Petri dish tests, where other cues (i.e., visual, gustatory or tactile) were present. In contrast, the introduced beetle L. suturalis showed high host-specificity in both Y-tube and Petri dish assays. This study illustrates the importance of VOCs in mediating interactions between introduced and native species, suggesting that invasive plants can disrupt native plants' communication and affect the host-searching behaviour of native insects. It also reinforces the relevance of regular host testing on introduced weed biocontrol agents to avoid unwanted host shifts or host-range expansion.

AB High levels of genetic diversity and connectivity are crucial for the persistence of local populations, especially at the edge of species' distribution ranges. Here, we assessed the potential and realized connectivity of populations of the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica at its easternmost distribution using physical modelling and genetic analyses. Genetic assessments of diversity and gene flow among populations were carried out with 18 microsatellite loci, while oceanographic connectivity was assessed via Lagrangian dispersal simulations. Levels of genetic and clonal diversities were prevalent among shallow and deep sites without signs of reproductive isolation. Both approaches identified two main clusters corresponding to "Aegean" populations along the western Turkey coast and "Levantine" populations along the southern Turkey coast. Aegean populations were genetically homogeneous, connected by high levels of gene flow, whereas Levantine populations were genetically heterogeneous. Within-sea patterns of genetic connectivity did not fully overlap with those derived from physical modelling; the realized connectivity was greater than that predicted by ocean-current simulations, especially in the Aegean Sea. Lagrangian dispersion dynamics cannot necessarily explain genetic connectivity patterns among populations, which are shaped over longer temporal scales and can be affected by human activities and local environmental conditions.

AB Despite Orchidaceae is a key component of the epiphytic flora of tropical and subtropical forests, phenological studies of this group are rare, mainly due to technical difficulties in observing epiphytes, the reduced abundance of wild specimens, and to the evergreen characteristic of these plants. We monitored shoot and root production of translocated young plants of the epiphytic orchid Cattleya intermedia Graham at the edge and in the interior of a subtropical Atlantic Forest fragment, and investigated their relationship with temperature, luminosity, photoperiod, rainfall and air humidity. Individuals propagated in vitro were translocated in the spring and inspected monthly for 3 years for shoot and root production. Shoot production at the edge of the forest was positively related with photoperiod and luminosity. In the interior, this relationship was characterised by a 1-month time delay. The highest concentrations of plants with shoot production occurred in spring and summer in both environments. Interior plants were more likely to produce roots in spring and summer, while edge plants were more likely to produce roots in summer. Edge plants produced fewer roots when rainfall was high, while interior plants produced more roots when interior air humidity was high. The influence of light availability for translocated plants was demonstrated by the different responses of shoot growth at the edge and in the interior of the forest and by the relationship with the seasonal variation of this variable. Thus, light becomes a key factor for the establishment of translocated C. intermedia and must be considered in the choice of their habitats.

AB Schistosomiasis is a tropical neglected disease commonly associated with rural areas; however, urban schistosomiasis has been reported worldwide, and increasing urbanization is one of the most important demographic shifts of the 20th and now 21st centuries. The pattern of urbanization is not uniform so that within the same city the rates and sources of population increase vary. Here, we report on the parasite composition in one neighbourhood in the metropolitan area of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Using epidemiological data and population genetics, we find evidence for local transmission and maintenance of Schistosoma mansoni infection within an urban population and little contribution from rural-urban migration. Our findings provide direction for local mitigation strategies and to assist the public living in this neighbourhood to interrupt the local transmission cycle.

AB The edge effect, triggered by habitat fragmentation, alters forest microclimates and influences the life cycle of plants. Phenology may indicate the first changes in phenological patterns in response to the effects of climate change. Climate regulates the phenology of ferns and climatic triggers influence plants in tropical and subtropical regions differently. This study analyzed and compared the phenology of fern communities of three sub-areas - natural edge, artificial edge, and forest interior - of a fragment of Araucaria Forest in the Floresta Nacional de Sao Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and its relationship with meteorological, astronomical, and edaphic variables. Abiotic and edaphic data were monitored concomitantly with phenological data (leaf renewal and senescence and sporangia formation) in each sub-area over a biennium. Temperature, air humidity, and soil moisture, which undergo changes with the edge effect, influenced edge plants. Leaf renewal was the main phenophase showing strong indication of changes in vegetative patterns in natural and artificial edge communities. Among the communities, that of the artificial edge signaled phenological changes that could compromise the development of ferns if effects intensify over time. In this respect, the phenology of artificial edge ferns differed from that of plants growing in originally natural formations (natural edge and forest interior), showing that exogenous transformations represent a new environmental situation for ferns to develop.

AB Rafflesia species (Rafflesiaceae) are among the flagship plants of South-East Asian countries in which they occur. Three species of Rafflesia, i.e. Rafflesia patma, R. rochussenii, and R. zollingeriana, are known from Java, Indonesia. All three species are threatened with extinction due to human activities that cause habitat loss and fragmentation. Conservation efforts such as determining conservation units for prioritization of those species have been difficult due to the lack of data on their population genetics. Availability of genetic information is important to develop appropriate conservation measures. Our study evaluates genetic diversity and structure of the three Rafflesia species using a total of 166 samples across the island. We used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers obtained via MIG-seq. The three species of Rafflesia in Java bear much lower genetic diversity compared to what was previously shown for R. speciosa and R. lagascae on Borneo, the Philippines and the Malayan Peninsula. Low genetic diversity within the Javanese Rafflesia species, particularly in R. patma and R. zollingeriana, is attributed to bottleneck events and population expansion in the past. We also provide evidence of clonality and existence of different genotypes within Tetrastigma host plants in two species of Rafflesia. Scattered and fragmented populations as reconstructed in the genetic structure analyses are important to be considered in designing appropriate conservation strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the establishment of Rafflesia ex-situ collections can conserve genetic diversity that may no longer be present in nature and could be used in future reintroduction programs.

AB The contribution of sapling banks to the coexistence of species with different shade tolerance under the "wave regeneration" regime has not been researched extensively. This study first assessed spatial and temporal variations in the relative dominance of two Abies species, Abies veitchii and Abies mariesii, with different shade tolerance in a wave-regenerated forest. Second, we present the age structure and its spatial variation in young Abies stands (sapling stage) to exhibit the prevalence and variability of regeneration from sapling banks (defined as trees established 10 years before canopy opening). The relative dominance of A. mariesii, the more shade-tolerant species, compared to that of A. veitchii, did not change over a period of 10 years, irrespective of stand developmental stages, indicating the importance of initial dominance in determining the local species composition. The tree ages at the sapling stage were significantly higher for A. mariesii than for A. veitchii. Approximately, 30% of all trees were likely to arise from a sapling bank, and 86% of them were A. mariesii. Age structure significantly varied between 5 x 5 m quadrats; some quadrats were dominated by A. mariesii originating from sapling banks, while others were dominated by A. veitchii that were established at the time of canopy opening. These results indicate that regeneration from sapling banks contributes to the dominance of A. mariesii and that the spatial variation in the abundance of trees originating from sapling banks is essential for the coexistence of A. mariesii with A. veitchii.

AB Despite the recent advances in the systematics of snakes, the diversity of several Neotropical groups of species remains poorly understood. The lack of studies focused on the phylogenetic relationship within most of the 20 tribes of Dipsadidae precludes a better understanding of the evolution of this diverse family. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Tachymenini, a heterogeneous tribe that comprises 36 viviparous species of dipsadids, grouped in seven genera based on morphological similarities. The tribe is widely distributed throughout South America presenting very distinctive phenotypes, habitats, and behaviours. The phylogenetic relationship among tachymenins is a well-recognized challenge regarding the systematics of the South American dipsadids. The similar morphotype of some generalist species, combined with the very derived morphology of some strict specialists, creates a complexity of traits that has prevented the comprehension of the systematics of the group. To address such a challenge, we combine molecular (six loci) and morphological (70 characters) datasets in an integrative phylogenetic approach. The resultant phylogenetic trees indicate, with strong support, that three of the seven current recognized genera (Tachymenis, Tomodon, and Thamnodynastes) are non-monophyletic and, consequently, we propose a new systematic arrangement for Tachymenini. We revalidate two genera, Dryophylax and Mesotes, and we describe three additional monotypic genera, Apographon gen. n., Tachymenoides gen. n., and Zonateres gen. n. to accommodate Tomodon orestes, Tachymenis affinis, and Thamnodynastes lanei, respectively. We also include Tomodon ocellatus and Pseudotomodon trigonatus in Tachymenis and describe a new genus, Galvarinus gen. n., to accommodate the Tachymenis chilensis species group. Furthermore, we also provide an evolutionary scenario for the speciation events based on a time-calibrated tree, commenting on the diversification and origin of the tribe, and on the probable existence of undescribed species of Mesotes and Dryophylax.

AB The patterns of variation at 12 microsatellite loci are used to determine whether Snapper, Chrysophrys auratus, is genetically homogeneous across its range in Western Australian waters and to elucidate the extent to which the genetic composition of this exploited sparid varies among regions in Australasia. Chrysophrys auratus was collected from seven locations in Western Australia (WA), southwards from Carnarvon (2505-15'S, 11325-35'E) on the mid-west coast and eastwards to Esperance (3430'S, 12210'E) on the south coast. The levels of genetic differentiation among samples extending 1350 km from Carnarvon to Albany (3520'S, 11750'E) on the south coast, but not to Esperance ~ 410 km further east, were low and non-significant (e.g. DEST = 0.003; P = 0.167). This implies that C. auratus is genetically homogeneous along the majority of its extensive range in WA. It is proposed that this reflects wide-spread dispersal of the early life stages (ELS), facilitated by the southward-flowing Leeuwin current and northward-flowing, wind-driven inshore currents, supplemented by movements of juveniles and adults. The genetic composition of the sample of C. auratus from Gulf St Vincent on the south coast (central) of Australia (3450'S, 13810'E) was similar to those from Albany and Esperance on the south coast (west) but typically distinct from those from the south coast (east), west and east coasts of Australia. This genetic structure is presumably related to how the eastwards-flowing Leeuwin current and/or the westwards-flowing Flinders currents disperse ELS. Microsatellite data imply that C. auratus from the Port Phillip Bay on the south coast (east), Sydney on the east coast and from Hauraki Gulf in New Zealand each represent distinct genetic stocks. The genetic composition of C. auratus from the Port Phillip Bay is particularly distinct, indicating that this population is relatively isolated and thus potentially more susceptible to exploitation. The results of the present and other studies indicate, however, that gene flow in C. auratus is typically sufficient to maintain genetic homogeneity over 100s of kilometres, as occurs in Western Australia. Thus, C. auratus spawned in one area can potentially act as a source of recruits for other areas and thereby ameliorate the impacts of fishing.

AB Trees regenerating in the understory respond to increased availability of light caused by gap formation by undergoing a range of morphological and physiological adjustments. These adjustments include the production of thick, sun-type leaves containing thicker mesophyll and longer palisade cells than in shade-type leaves. We asked whether in the shade-regenerating tree Acer pseudoplatanus, the increase in leaf thickness and expansion of leaf tissues are possible also in leaves that are already fully formed, a response reported so far only for a handful of species. We acclimated potted seedlings to eight levels (from 1 to 100%) of solar irradiance and, in late summer, transferred a subset of them to full sunlight. Within 30 days, the pre-shaded leaves increased leaf mass per area and became thicker mostly due to the elongation of palisade cells, except for the most shaded individuals which suffered irreversible photo-oxidative damage. This anatomical acclimation was accompanied by a transient decline in photosynthetic efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-M), the magnitude of which was related to the degree of pre-shading. The F-v/F-M recovered substantially within the re-acclimation period. However, leaves of transferred plants were shed earlier in the fall, indicating that the acclimation was not fully effective. These results show that A. pseudoplatanus is one of the few known species in which mature leaves may re-acclimate anatomically to increased irradiance. This may be an important mechanism enhancing utilization of gaps created during the growing season.

Three new species are described, Augochloropsis peruviana n. sp., Augochloropsis ticuna n. sp. and Augochloropsis atrocyanea n. sp. and the type species, Augochloropsis ornata (Smith, 1879), is re-described. The descriptions were based on females collected in the Amazon Basin forests from Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. The disjunct distribution exhibited by A. (Glyptochlora) with respect its nearest phylogenetic group Augochloropsis (Glyptobasia), with species only present in the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil, is discussed in light of current knowledge about other taxa with similar distribution pattern. This is new evidence for an already well-established pattern of disjunct distributions of some bee taxa between these two biomes. An identification key for the species and a distribution map are also provided.

AB Invasive parasites are major threats to biodiversity. The honey bee ectoparasite, Varroa destructor, has shifted host and spread almost globally several decades ago. This pest is generally considered to be the main global threat to Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, although the damages it causes are not equivalent in all its new host's populations. Due to the high virulence of this parasite and the viruses it vectors, beekeepers generally rely on acaricide treatments to keep their colonies alive. However, some populations of A. mellifera can survive without anthropogenic mite control, through the expression of diverse resistance and tolerance traits. Such surviving colonies are currently found throughout the globe, with the biggest populations being found in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Recently, genetic differences between mite populations infesting surviving and treated A. mellifera colonies in Europe were found, suggesting that adaptations of honey bees drive mite evolution. Yet, the prevalence of such co-evolutionary adaptations in other invasive populations of V. destructor remain unknown. Using the previous data from Europe and novel genetic data from V. destructor populations in South America and Africa, we here investigated whether mites display signs of adaptations to different host populations of diverse origins and undergoing differing management. Our results show that, contrary to the differences previously documented in Europe, mites infesting treated and untreated honey bee populations in Africa and South America are genetically similar. However, strong levels of genetic differentiation were found when comparing mites across continents, suggesting ongoing allopatric speciation despite a recent spread from genetically homogenous lineages. This study provides novel insights into the co-evolution of V. destructor and A. mellifera, and confirms that these species are ideal to investigate coevolution in newly established host -parasite systems.

AB Gradients in biodiversity are often considered a result of environmental variables like temperature, precipita-tion, ecological disturbance regimes, and species coexistence. This study aimed at investigating the genetic diversity and structure of natural populations of Eugenia uniflora growing in two different biomes in southern Brazil (Atlantic Forest and Pampa biomes), as well as in the transition zone between them. A novel set of 11 SSR loci from E. uniflora was validated and employed to test the hypothesis that the allelic composition of the populations changes gradually along the environmental gradient sampled, with a characteristic genetic structure within each biome and an intermediary allelic composition in the transition zone. The results revealed high polymorphism of the validated markers and significant genetic structure of the different popu-lations. The main source of genetic variation observed is the individual samples, but there was a considerable amount of variation among populations, and regions. We suggested that the genetic structure of the studied populations presents distinct patterns which may be related to adaptation to local environmental conditions, or at least related to the transition among them. Our study provides evidence that even environments neglected regarding the information on their biodiversity and the transition zones may hold important levels of genetic diversity. Thus, the distribution of genetic diversity should be interpreted in the light of the life traits of the species and the local environment since valuable diversity may be found both in a hotspot of diversity and in neglected forest formations.(c) 2022 SAAB.

AB Across the U.S.A., as across many countries, families, individuals, trusts, estates, and family partnerships, collectively referred to as family forest ownerships, own a plurality of the forestland. The Montreal Process Criteria and Indicators (C & I) were used to assess the sustainability of these lands. There are currently 109 million ha of family forestland across the conterminous U.S.A., but this area is decreasing by 1 million ha yr(-1) with 64% of this acreage going to non-forest uses and the rest going to other forest ownership classes. While forest-type groups have remained relatively constant, the area of forestland in smaller stand sizes has been decreasing and the area in larger stand sizes has been commensurately increasing. These forests provide critical habitat for many species with an average of 3.3 at-risk species per location. There is an estimated 12.7 billion m(3) of wood on these lands with annual timber harvests of 160 million m(3). For most species, the ratio of net growth to removals is well above 1.0, but there are notable exceptions, often associated with insects, changing fire regimes, or other departures from historical conditions. Looking only at timber harvesting, family forests are annually supporting an estimated 47.4 thousand jobs with combined wages of USD$2 billion. Land regulations, taxation, and incentives vary considerably across the U.S.A. with regulations ranging from regulatory to voluntary. Overall, the C & I indicate a mixed prognosis for the sustainability of America's family forests: while many of the general ecological and productivity indicators are positive, the loss of family forestland is of notable concern as are the threats posed by specific disturbances and for specific species. To maintain the sustainability of America's family forest, the analysis suggests focusing on policies, such as conservation easements and preferential property tax programs, aimed at keeping family forests as family forests.

AB Small habitat patches can be important reservoirs for biodiversity, capable of hosting unique species that are largely absent from the surrounding landscape. In cases where such patches owe their existence to the presence of particular soil types or hydrologic conditions, local-scale edaphic variables may be more effective components for models that identify patch location than regional-scale macroclimatic variables often used in habitat and species distribution models. We modeled the edaphic soil conditions that support pine barren, sandplain, and related ecosystems in New York State with the purpose of identifying potential locations for biodiversity conservation. We quantified soil percent sand and soil depth of 156 known high-quality remnant pine barren and sandplain ecosystems to calculate threshold soil characteristics. We then mapped all soils in the state that were at least as sandy and deep as the threshold values we calculated. The total area of our map of suitable soil conditions was over 9500 km(2), made up of forested (57%), urban (26%), agricultural (13%), and open (4%) land covers. Our analysis nearly doubled the recognized area of barren, shrubland, and grassland habitat on deep, sandy soils in New York State. Extensive forested and even agricultural cover on these soils could also be the subject of restoration to further support the biodiversity of these unique ecosystems. The presence of extensive soils in coastal and interior New York that, with the appropriate disturbance regime, have the potential to host pine barren and sandplain ecosystems offers a new perspective on these ecosystems' distribution in the past-and about how to better align conservation and restoration to preserve the future.

AB Land-use change is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide, but its negative effects can vary depending on the spatial scale analyzed. Considering the continuous expansion of agricultural demand for land, it is urgent to identify the drivers that shape biological communities in order to balance agricultural production and biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes. We used a patch-landscape design and a multimodel inference approach to assess the effects of landscape composition and configuration at two spatial scales (patch and landscape) on the structure of dung beetle assemblages. We performed our study in the Caatinga, the largest dry forest in South America. We sampled 3,526 dung beetles belonging to 19 species and 11 genera. At patch scale, our findings highlight the positive relationship of forest cover and landscape heterogeneity with dung beetle diversity, which are the major drivers of beetle assemblages. Edge density, in turn, is a major driver at the landscape scale and has a negative effect on beetle diversity. Our results support the hypothesis that landscapes combining natural vegetation remnants and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes are the most effective at conserving the biodiversity of dung beetles in the Caatinga landscapes. Directing efforts to better understand the dynamics of dung beetles in agricultural lands can be helpful for policymakers and scientists to design agri-environment schemes and apply conservation strategies in tropical dry forests.

AB The Cerrado complex is covered by twelve physiognomies characterized by a gradient of grassland, savanna and forest formations. We assessed the recruitment (RI) and mortality (MI) of individuals and the gain (BG) and loss (BL) of basal area in the Cerrado complex. We used 26 sites classified into savanna (15) and forest formations (11); dry (19) and moist environments (7); non-disturbed (14) and disturbed areas (12) that were recovered from the literature. The median of the vegetation dynamics varied as follows: MI = 3.95, RI = 2.99, BL = 3.08 and the BG = 3.99. MI exceeded RI at 13 sites, and forests formation comprised 70% of the sites with high MI. The median RI was 2.2 times higher in savanna than in forest formations, while it was 1.7 times higher in disturbed areas than in non-disturbed ones. Although the vegetation dynamics have been studied for decades in Cerrado, the studies of disturbances are majority focused on fire and fragmentation effects, indicating that the research should go beyond it. Generalized additive models (GAMs) showed that the MI, RI, BL and BG differ in their responses to three environmental gradients: (1) elevation + temperature, (2) precipitation and (3) precipitation seasonality, even across sites with similar environmental conditions.

AB Spatial targeting plays a key role in improving the efficiency of payment for ecosystem services (PES). However, the risk of grassland degradation after implementing PES increases uncertainty about the efficiency of PES. Here, we identified the spatial heterogeneity of grassland degradation risk using Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model, then incorporated grassland degradation risk as a criterion into PES spatial targeting using cost-benefit analysis and ranking optimization. The framework was applied to a case study of the Three-River-Source National Park, China. We found that grasslands in the study area continued to degrade between 2015 and 2025, and the area of degraded grasslands increased by 26%. Compared with spatial targeting of PES without considering grassland degradation risk, PES spatial targeting that considered grassland degradation risk was significantly different (the overlap area accounted for only 75%, 82%, and 94% of the PES area within 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total protection cost budget). When the grassland degradation risk was considered as a targeting criterion, PES efficiency increased by 154%, 116%, 124%, and 99%, respectively, within 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the total protection cost budget. Our results demonstrate that considering grassland degradation risk in the spatial targeting of PES increases efficiency because it helps to target areas with greater environmental benefits.

AB The Quercus wutaishanica forest influences the ecological environment and climate characteristics and plays an important ecological role in the Loess Plateau region. However, we still know relatively little about the genetic diversity and spatial distribution of Q. wutaishanica. Here, we assessed the genetic diversity of Q. wutaishanica using simple sequence repeats and used the point pattern method to analyze the spatial distribution patterns as well as intraspecific relationships. Our results indicate that the diameter structure of the Q. wutaishanica population was inverted J-type, showing a growing population. In addition, the population maintained high genetic diversity on a small scale. Due to dispersal constraints, the spatial distribution pattern of Q. wutaishanica seedlings (DBH < 1 cm) tended to aggregate at small scales and the degree of aggregation decreased with increasing spatial scale. However, trees (DBH > 5 cm) and saplings (1 cm <= DBH < 5 cm) showed more random distribution at the scale, indicating that Q. wutaishanica individuals shift from aggregation to random distribution at the spatial scale. In addition, although individuals of different diameter classes showed facilitative (trees vs. saplings, 5-6.5 m) and competitive effects (trees vs. seedlings, 13.5-16 m) on some scales, they showed no correlation on other scales, especially for saplings and seedlings, where they were not correlated on any scale. The results contribute to revealing the status and dynamics of Q. wutaishanica in the Loess Plateau, thereby providing a theoretical basis for further study on the maintenance mechanism of the population.

AB Vegetation is a key biosphere component to supporting biodiversity on Earth, and its maintenance and proper functioning are essential to guarantee the well-being of humankind. From a broad perspective, a fundamental goal of vegetation ecology is to understand the roles of abiotic and biotic factors that affect vegetation floristic composition, structure, distribution, diversity, and functioning, considering the relevant spatial and temporal scales. In this contribution, we reflect on the difficulties and opportunities to accomplish this grand objective by reviewing recent advances in the main areas of vegetation ecology. We highlight theoretical and methodological challenges and point to alternatives to overcome them. Our hope is that this contribution will motivate the development of future research efforts that will strengthen the field of vegetation ecology. Ultimately, vegetation science will continue to provide a strong knowledge basis and multiple theoretical and technological tools to better face the current global environmental crisis and to address the urgent need to conserve, use, and restore sustainably the vegetation cover of our planet in the Anthropocene.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of shade screens on the physiological activity, growth parameters and fruit characteristics of the paprika (Capsicum annuum L.) plant. Plants were grown in a protected greenhouse and treated under two different shade screens, S1 (single screen) and S2 (double screens; 10% low light intensity compared to S1), during summer at a particular time of the day. The results revealed that the plant height was significantly enlarged by the S2 treatment. However, the number of leaves, leaf fresh weight and leaf dry weight were significantly decreased under S2-treated plants compared to those grown in the S1 treatment. The stem diameter and shoot fresh weight were not significantly different between the treatments. The sap flow and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were higher in S1-treated plants than in those grown in the S2 treatment. The chlorophyll fluorescence fluctuated in both treatments. The fruit fresh weight, number of fruits, fruit pericarp thickness, fruit firmness, fruit volume, sugar content and acidity were significantly higher in S1-treated plants than in S2. Hunter values a and b were significantly higher in S2-treated plants. Moreover, the fruit length and width were not significantly different between the two treatments. The sugar content and acidity of paprika showed a positive correlation. These results suggest that, compared to a double screen for shade in the greenhouse, a single screen is suitable for the growth of paprika plants and enhanced their fruit production.

AB Nature conservation relies largely on peoples' rule adherence. Nevertheless, non-compliance with regulations threatens in situ conservation in nearly every protected area (PA) and remains an intractable issue. We reviewed the available published scholarly literature on non-compliant biological resource-use in terrestrial protected areas (TPAs) of sub-Saharan Africa. The focus is on two objectives, firstly, to disentangle the complex drivers behind the various types of deviant behaviour observed in these PAs, and secondly, to assess the strategies deployed on the ground to deter such illegalities. Using 72 selected journal articles published between 2001 and 2021, we recorded nine types of deviant behaviour or illegal resource extraction that were reported. Poaching activity overshadowed all other criminal behaviours. Drivers varied according to the type of crime perpetrated or resources targeted. Poverty was the most cited driver of non-compliance, particularly for illegal bushmeat hunting. PA resentment prompted by destructive errant wildlife was almost as strong a motivation as material poverty. To deter offenders from committing a crime, a combination of interventions, i.e., law enforcement and a spectrum of non-enforcement approaches, such as Reformed Poachers Associations, long-term research sites and resource-access agreements, were deployed. Our synthesis demonstrates that the growing sub-Saharan African literature on non-compliant biological resource-use in TPAs is dominated by bushmeat poaching drivers. Other motives for PA offences by border villagers are scarcely dealt with in the peer-reviewed literature. Future studies of wildlife crime need to address PA transgression multidimensionality, not just bushmeat poaching, to reveal further drivers of transgressive behaviour and ultimately allow for evidence-informed conservation intervention design.

AB This article discusses Costa Rica's policies and institutions created by the state to redistribute land during the 1960s and 1970s, when Latin American was implementing agrarian reforms. The paper also addresses the creation of the national parks system and forest conservation state policy supported by different scientific organisations during the same period. Within this context, this research seeks to explore the interface between the agrarian question (surrounding land and agrarian reform) and the ecological question (related to forest, national parks and conservation policies). The study examines how the transformations in land tenure and forest conservation have led to the structuring of a 'new agrarian question', which encompasses the concentration of land as well as the concentration of payments for environmental services.

AB Host shifting in insect-plant systems was historically important to the development of ecological speciation theory, yet surprisingly few studies have examined whether host shifting drives diversification of marine herbivores. When small-bodied consumers feed and also mate on a preferred host, disruptive selection can split a population into host races despite gene flow. Support for host shifts is notably lacking for invertebrates associated with macroalgae, where the scale of dispersal by planktonic larvae often far exceeds the grain of host patchiness, and adults are typically less specialized than terrestrial herbivores. Here, we present a candidate example of ecological speciation in a clade of sea slugs that primarily consume green algae in the genus Caulerpa, including highly invasive species. Ancestral character state reconstructions supported 'sea grapes' (C. racemosa, C. lentillifera) as the ancestral host for a tropical radiation of 12 Elysia spp., with one shift onto alternative Caulerpa spp. in the Indo-Pacific. A Caribbean radiation of three species included symaptric host shifts to Rhipocephalus brevicaulis in the ancestor of E. pratensis Ortea & Espinosa, 1996, and to C. prolifera in E. hamanni Krug, Vendetti & Valdes 2016, plus a niche expansion to a range of Caulerpa spp. in E. subornata Verrill, 1901. All three species are broadly sympatric across the Caribbean but are host-partitioned at a fine grain, and distinct by morphology and at nuclear loci. However, non-recombining mtDNA revealed a history of gene flow between E. pratensis and E. subornata: COI haplotypes from E. subornata were 10.4% divergent from E. pratensis haplotypes from four sites, but closely related to all E. pratensis haplotypes sampled from six Bahamian islands, indicating historical introgression and localized "mitochondrial capture. " Disruptive selective likely fueled divergence and adaptation to distinct host environments, indicating ecological speciation may be an under-appreciated driver of diversification for marine herbivores as well as epibionts and other resource specialists.

AB Geographic genetic differentiation measures are used for purposes such as assessing genetic diversity and connectivity, and searching for signals of selection. Confirmation by unrelated measures can minimize false positives. A popular differentiation measure, Bray-Curtis, has been used increasingly in molecular ecology, renamed AFD (hereafter called BCAFD). Critically, BCAFD is expected to be partially independent of the commonly used Hill "Q-profile" measures. BCAFD needs scrutiny for potential biases, by examining limits on its value, and comparing simulations against expectations. BCAFD has two dependencies on within-population (alpha) variation, undesirable for a between-population (beta) measure. The first dependency is derived from similarity to GST and FST. The second dependency is that BCAFD cannot be larger than the highest allele proportion in either location (alpha variation), which can be overcome by data-filtering or by a modified statistic (A)A or "Adjusted AFD". The first dependency does not forestall applications such as assessing connectivity or selection, if we know the measure's null behavior under selective neutrality with specified conditions-which is shown in this article for (A)A, for equilibrium, and nonequilibrium, for the commonly used data type of single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) in two locations. Thus, (A)A can be used in tandem with mathematically contrasting differentiation measures, with the aim of reducing false inferences. For detecting adaptive loci, the relative performance of (A)A and other measures was evaluated, showing that it is best to use two mathematically different measures simultaneously, and that (A)A is in one of the best such pairwise criteria. For any application, using (A)A, rather than BCAFD, avoids the counterintuitive limitation by maximum allele proportion within localities.

AB Climatic changes are altering precipitation patterns in the Amazon and may influence soil methane (CH4) fluxes due to the differential responses of methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms. However, it remains unclear if these climate feedbacks can amplify land-use-related impacts on the CH4 cycle. To better predict the responses of soil CH4-cycling microorganisms and emissions under altered moisture levels in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon, we performed a 30-day microcosm experiment manipulating the moisture content (original moisture; 60%, 80%, and 100% of field capacity - FC) of forest and pasture soils. Gas samples were collected periodically for gas chromatography analysis, and methanogenic archaeal and methanotrophic bacterial communities were assessed using quantitative PCR and metagenomics. Positive and negative daily CH4 fluxes were observed for forest and pasture, indicating that these soils can act as both CH4 sources and sinks. Cumulative emissions and the abundance of methanogenesis-related genes and taxonomic groups were affected by land use, moisture, and their interaction. Pasture soils at 100% FC had the highest abundance of methanogens and CH4 emissions, 22 times higher than forest soils under the same treatment. Higher ratios of methanogens to methanotrophs were found in pasture than in forest soils, even at field capacity conditions. Land use and moisture were significant factors influencing the composition of methanogenic and methanotrophic communities. The diversity and evenness of methanogens did not change throughout the experiment. In contrast, methanotrophs exhibited the highest diversity and evenness in pasture soils at 100% FC. Taken together, our results suggest that increased moisture exacerbates soil CH4 emissions and microbial responses driven by land-use change in the Amazon. This is the first report on the microbial CH4 cycle in Amazonian upland soils that combined one-month gas measurements with advanced molecular methods.

AB China's ecological compensation (EC) is based on the property rights structure of public ownership of natural resources, which should be based on the spatial planning, which is defined by local government as the boundary of property right management and the distribution of development power. This study combined spatial planning and ecosystem service value (ESV) accounting to design a decision-making framework of EC, which includes "Subject choice, Value accounting, Priority evaluation, Policy supply ". We selected 32 counties (districts) in the Yangtze River Delta region as the research object with the consideration of spatial planning and expert advice, and found that the implementation of EC slowed down the urbanization process and promoted the increase of ecological space. We conducted an accounting and sensitivity analysis on the spatial and temporal changes of ESV in the region from 2000 to 2019, and finally determined the amount and priority of accepting EC. The research results show that the ESV in the study area shows a general trend of increasing and then decreasing in time, and a spatial pattern of high in the south and low in the north and high in the east and low in the west. Forestland and water area are the main providers of ESV in the study area. The sensitivity coefficients of each type of ESV do not change much in each period, but the coefficients between the types have large differences. The total amount of EC in the Yangtze River Delta ecological barrier (YRDEB) is RMB 38,098.11 billion, and Shitai County is the area with the highest priority for compensation. We believe that this decision-making framework has the potential to be applied to the implementation of EC in other regions of China. At the same time, it can also be used to enrich the international views on EC research.

AB Past climatic change as a driving force of marine diversification is still largely unclear, particularly for Southern Hemisphere species. Here, we present a case using the brown fur seal, Arctocephalus pusillus, assessing the geographical structure and demographic history using mitochondrial and nuclear data. Results show the two previously defined subspecies (one from Australia and the other from southern Africa) are phylogeographically distinct. Migration analyses based on nuclear data suggest the absence of migrants among the two genetically close assemblages. The demographic history of A. pusillus is characterized by a glacial population expansion (approx. 18 kya) in the southern African lineage, which coincides with time estimates of population expansion of prey species of seals. Approximate Bayesian calculations support an eastward dispersal event during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were lower, followed by a postglacial divergence event, approximately 13 kya. The demographic history of the brown fur seal in the Southern Oceans provides support that recent palaeoclimatic changes could have facilitated expansions in some marine species and that postglacial sea-level rise may have acted as a dispersal barrier for species mostly confined to continental shelves.

AB Deforestation is the most important cause of biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems. Epiphytic species, lichens and bryophytes, are very sensitive to environmental changes, including those produced by conversion of primary forests into secondary vegetation. However, little is known about the differences between different secondary forests and plantations regarding the epiphytic biota. We compared epiphytic communities among different secondary forests and non-native plantations in southern Ecuador. Four forest types were considered: non-native Pinus patula plantations, monospecific secondary forests of Alnus acuminata, monospecific secondary forests of Andesanthus lepidotus and mixed secondary forests. Within each forest type, two stands were surveyed, establishing a total of 80 plots and analyzing four trees per plot. We estimated lichen and bryophyte cover in four inventories per tree and calculated and compared different metrics for taxonomic and functional diversity, as well as community composition. The results revealed forest type as the major predictor for the species and functional traits richness, and for diversity and composition. In total, 422 taxa were identified (312 lichens and 110 bryophytes), with mixed secondary forests having the richest communities (194 species) and non-native plantations having the lowest richness (105 species). Bryophyte richness was highest in A. lepidotus forests. Taxonomic and functional diversity, and species composition differed greatly among forest types and followed a different pattern depending on the organism considered. Lichens were the most sensitive indicators of environmental conditions associated with different tropical forest types.

AB Context Agricultural land-use conversion has fragmented prairie wetland habitats in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), an area with one of the most wetland dense regions in the world. This fragmentation can lead to negative consequences for wetland obligate organisms, heightening risk of local extinction and reducing evolutionary potential for populations to adapt to changing environments. Objectives This study models biotic connectivity of prairie-pothole wetlands using landscape genetic analyses of the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) to (1) identify population structure and (2) determine landscape factors driving genetic differentiation and possibly leading to population fragmentation. Methods Frogs from 22 sites in the James River and Lake Oahe river basins in North Dakota were genotyped using Best-RAD sequencing at 2868 bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Population structure was assessed using STRUCTURE, DAPC, and fineSTRUCTURE. Circuitscape was used to model resistance values for ten landscape variables that could affect habitat connectivity. Results STRUCTURE results suggested a panmictic population, but other more sensitive clustering methods identified six spatially organized clusters. Circuit theory-based landscape resistance analysis suggested land use, including cultivated crop agriculture, and topography were the primary influences on genetic differentiation. Conclusion While the R. pipiens populations appear to have high gene flow, we found a difference in the patterns of connectivity between the eastern portion of our study area which was dominated by cultivated crop agriculture, versus the western portion where topographic roughness played a greater role. This information can help identify amphibian dispersal corridors and prioritize lands for conservation or restoration.

AB Aim Coastal infrastructures are increasing at different latitudes, and their deployment often results in a complete replacement of natural habitats. Although infrastructure provides novel habitats, ecological engineering can increase their similarity to natural rocky habitats. One hurdle for effective design of greener infrastructure is the scarce information on the processes that underpin differences in the structure of communities between built and natural habitats. Using long-term data of intertidal community structure, we tested whether the magnitude of between-habitat differences changes with breakwater age and across latitudes, and we examined the role of topographic microhabitats (i.e., rock pools) in driving these differences. Location Nine locations distributed from 18 to 41 degrees S. Time period 2016-2020. Methods We sampled the mid-intertidal community structure on breakwaters of different age and on natural rocky habitats (platforms and boulder fields) and assessed the availability of microhabitats, such as crevices and rock pools, along a coastline spanning 23 degrees of latitude. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we assessed the effect of the different factors on species diversity and functional group abundances. Results Age since construction was a poor predictor of differences between breakwaters and natural habitats. Communities on older breakwaters bore a poor resemblance to the species composition or functional group abundances found in natural habitats. The magnitude of differences between breakwaters and natural habitats varied with latitude, with season and with the type of natural habitat attributable to differences in microhabitats, especially in rock pool availability. Conclusions Our results indicate that replacement of rocky habitats with breakwaters will cause permanent alterations to coastal ecosystems. Our findings suggest that the availability of microhabitats able to shelter species from stressful environmental conditions is more important at lower and intermediate latitudes; hence, they should be incorporated primarily into infrastructures in tropical or subtropical areas. These strategies could help to compensate for the impacts on rocky ecosystems associated with increases in coastal urbanization.

AB Context. Sex and age are frequently proposed as drivers of a number of behavioural and demographic patterns that can have important consequences for population dynamics including access to mates, sexual selection, parental care and lifetime productivity. Sex and age might also be important in shaping the movement patterns and colonisation processes of social species moving into vacant habitat. Such information is critical for the management of strongly interacting species such as the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), which structure ecological communities through aggressive exclusion of other taxa from areas that they occupy. Aims. In Manorina colonies, young females are usually dispersive, while males remain in the natal colony as the philopatric sex. Following removal of individuals from an area, we aimed to determine whether female-biased dispersal, particularly of young females, would result in a more equal sex ratio and a younger age structure in the recolonising population. Methods. These predictions were tested by anatomically ageing and sexing 1856 noisy miners that had been experimentally culled in two regions of New South Wales, Australia, to reduce the aggressive impact of this species on other native species. Key results. Prior to removal, noisy miner populations were significantly male-biased in both regions (57% and 60%); however sex ratios after each of two removal episodes no longer differed from parity. Immature birds were a dominant feature (65%) of recolonising populations in both regions, however, the age structure of recolonising populations was different in each region, mostly likely due to the respective timing of culls during the year. Furthermore, the culling response in terms of age-specific sex ratio varied between regions. After the final cull, the sex ratio of mature birds had fallen to parity in one region but had become even more male biased (68%) in the other region. There was no sex-ratio bias among immature birds before or after culling. Conclusion. These results confirm the expectation that immature birds are more likely to be colonisers, but the expectation of greater female dispersal was equivocal.

AB To survive, all organisms must sense and respond to information from their environment. This is true of many organisms, including plants, which need to do all the things that other organisms do while operating under the limitations of being sessile and lacking a central nervous system. In this article, we explore how information theory can apply to plants and briefly review the types and sources of information and the mechanisms that plants use to perceive and respond to their environment. We identify and describe three primary modes by which a plant receives information: chemical, electromagnetic and mechanical. We describe how plants integrate information to detect the state of their neighbors, capture resources and regulate growth and metabolism. Overall, we find that plants interpret information from their surroundings as an emergent property of distributed information processed by a network of cells. We end with a prospectus of directions for future research including decoding signal from noise, storage of information, additional means of information transmission and two-way information signaling with biotic partners.

AB Context. Empirical studies of intraspecific genetic diversity and population structure can inform the evolutionary and demographic history of individual species and of landscapes at the bioregional level. Aims. We aimed to assess intraspecific genetic variation at macroevolutionary and microevolutionary temporal scales for Mirbelia viminalis, a key species present on the Hamersley Range in the ancient and highly diverse landscape of the Pilbara bioregion of northwest Western Australia. Methods. We sampled extant populations and assessed diversity and structure using sequences (chloroplast DNA, 1759 base pairs) and microsatellite markers (nuclear DNA, 15 loci) data. Key results. Significant phylogeographic structure and a lack of historical demographic signals of population contraction or expansion suggest historical population persistence. Moderate chloroplast haplotype diversity (h = 15) and moderate divergence among extant haplotypes indicates a degree of historical connectivity via seed dispersal across central populations on the Hamersley Range. Levels of nuclear genetic diversity were low to moderate (allelic richness = 3.554, expected heterozygosity = 0.489, observed heterozygosity = 0.462) and depauperate compared to another member of the Mirbelia genus present further south in the Midwest region. Nuclear diversity revealed a strong signal of isolation by distance with localised admixture among populations and some contemporary genetic clustering along a north-west to south-east transect of the Hamersley Range. Conclusions. Low nuclear genetic diversity may be related to recent reductions in population size for M. viminalis. Historical population persistence with few barriers to dispersal other than geographic distance may be common for members of the Fabaceae across the Hamersley Range.

AB Combining metabolic and maximum entropy theories of ecology, the authors derive an equation of state capable of capturing the relationships between multiple ecological variables across varied spatial scales and habitats.
   To advance understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem function, ecologists seek widely applicable relationships among species diversity and other ecosystem characteristics such as species productivity, biomass, and abundance. These metrics vary widely across ecosystems and no relationship among any combination of them that is valid across habitats, taxa, and spatial scales, has heretofore been found. Here we derive such a relationship, an equation of state, among species richness, energy flow, biomass, and abundance by combining results from the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology and the Metabolic Theory of Ecology. It accurately captures the relationship among these state variables in 42 data sets, including vegetation and arthropod communities, that span a wide variety of spatial scales and habitats. The success of our ecological equation of state opens opportunities for estimating difficult-to-measure state variables from measurements of others, adds support for two current theories in ecology, and is a step toward unification in ecology.

AB Habitat loss represents a major threat to biodiversity, however, the modulation of its effects by the nonhabitat matrix surrounding habitat patches is still undervalued. The landscape matrix might change community assembly in different ways. For example, low-quality matrices can accentuate environmental filtering by reducing resource availability and/or deteriorating abiotic conditions but they may also excessively limit dispersal of organisms and make communities more prone to ecological drift. To understand how matrix quality modulates the effects of habitat loss, we quantified the relative importance of environmental filter and ecological drift in bird communities across more local (400 m buffer around sampling sites) and broader (2 km focal landscapes) gradients of habitat loss embedded in low- and high-quality matrices. We used a trait-based approach to understand habitat loss filtering effects on occurrences of forest specialist and habitat generalist birds. We found that low-quality matrices, composed mainly of low-productive pasturelands, increased the severity of habitat loss filtering effects for forest specialist birds, but only at the landscape scale. Bird occurrences were in general higher in high-quality matrices, that is, more heterogeneous and with low-contrasting edges, indicating the role of the matrix quality in attenuating species extinction risks at the landscape scale, probably due to mass effect. Moreover, forest specialists presented a strong negative response to habitat loss filtering across different functional traits, while generalists presented a high variability in traits response to habitat loss. Synthesis and applications: We raised evidence in supporting that landscape habitat loss filtering may be relaxed or reinforced depending on the quality of the matrix, evidencing that matrix quality has a strong impact in modulating community assembly processes in fragmented landscapes. In practical terms, it means that improving matrix quality may help in maintaining the high diversity of birds even without any increase in native forest cover.

AB In the Southern Ocean, the living environment of organisms has changed due to the dramatic increase in melting sea ice and the loss of glaciers, which have consequently caused substantial changes in biodiversity. Samples of pelagic ciliates from 13 sites were collected as bioindicators to demonstrate the relationship between spatial distribution patterns and environmental heterogeneity affected by sea ice melting and to reveal the community assembly mechanisms in the Ross Sea. Univariate analyses and multivariate analyses were effective tools demonstrating clear spatial patterns and providing a sufficient explanation to interpret strong correlations between pelagic ciliate communities and environmental variations, especially the distribution pattern of nutrients and Chl a. Moreover, environmental heterogeneity might affect the co-occurrence network complexity of ciliate communities. Furthermore, our results also indicated that stochastic processes play a significant role in the community assembly of pelagic ciliates. This study examined the controlling mechanisms of environmental heterogeneity affected by sea ice melting on pelagic ciliate communities and provided explanations for the community assembly of pelagic ciliates in polar marine ecosystems.

AB Supportive breeding programmes are becoming increasingly crucial for the conservation of many declining freshwater fishes such as the European common nase, Chondrostoma nasus. However, small relict populations are genetically highly vulnerable, and supportive breeding can have a detrimental impact on the genetic composition of the cultured offspring (e.g. as a result of inbreeding, genetic drift, and adaptation to captivity). This study monitored the genetic effects of a continuing supportive breeding programme of common nase by comparing the genetic diversity of two wild spawning populations with the respective wild offspring and the progeny from captive breeding originating from spawners of the two wild populations, considering genetic variability, genetic differentiation, and inbreeding effects using nine microsatellite markers. Despite low genetic differentiation, the offspring from captive breeding and from one of the natural populations (River Sims) were remarkably different genetically, as indicated by pairwise analyses of genetic divergence (F-ST from 0.028 to 0.070; Jost's D-EST from 0.080 to 0.205) and the discriminant analysis of principal components. The mean number of alleles and mean allelic richness in the captive-bred offspring and also in the wild offspring of the River Sims were lower than for wild populations of spawners and natural offspring of the River Mangfall, and signs of inbreeding effects were detected (F = 0.106 for captive bred and 0.048 for natural offspring). The observed effects can probably be attributed to the limited number of spawners (two females and three males) used for captive breeding. In addition, the results support previous evidence on recruitment problems of the Sims population, such as a reduced hatching success. Collecting fertilized eggs from the wild and rearing them in captivity (repatriation approach) could be an alternative to stripping a limited number of spawners and thereby to improve the conservation of genetic diversity of natural populations.

AB A range of functional trait-based approaches have been developed to investigate community assembly processes, but most ignore how traits covary within communities. We combined existing approaches - community-weighted means (CWMs) and functional dispersion (FDis) - with a metric of trait covariance to examine assembly processes in five angiosperm assemblages along a moisture gradient in Australia's subtropics. In addition to testing hypotheses about habitat filtering along the gradient, we hypothesized that trait covariance would be strongest at both ends of the moisture gradient and weakest in the middle, reflecting trade-offs associated with light capture in productive sites and moisture stress in dry sites. CWMs revealed evidence of climatic filtering, but FDis patterns were less clear. As hypothesized, trait covariance was weakest in the middle of the gradient but unexpectedly peaked at the second driest site due to the emergence of a clear drought tolerance-drought avoidance spectrum. At the driest site, the same spectrum was truncated at the 'avoider' end, revealing important information about habitat filtering in this system. Our focus on trait covariance revealed the nature and strength of trade-offs imposed by light and moisture availability, complementing insights gained about community assembly from existing trait-based approaches.

AB Biomass allocation in plants is fundamental for understanding and predicting terrestrial carbon storage. Here, the authors conduct a meta-analysis showing that warming effect on plant root:shoot is influenced by precipitation and the type of mycorrhizal fungi associated.
   Biomass allocation in plants is fundamental for understanding and predicting terrestrial carbon storage. Yet, our knowledge regarding warming effects on root: shoot ratio (R/S) remains limited. Here, we present a meta-analysis encompassing more than 300 studies and including angiosperms and gymnosperms as well as different biomes (cropland, desert, forest, grassland, tundra, and wetland). The meta-analysis shows that average warming of 2.50 degrees C (median = 2 degrees C) significantly increases biomass allocation to roots with a mean increase of 8.1% in R/S. Two factors associate significantly with this response to warming: mean annual precipitation and the type of mycorrhizal fungi associated with plants. Warming-induced allocation to roots is greater in drier habitats when compared to shoots (+15.1% in R/S), while lower in wetter habitats (+4.9% in R/S). This R/S pattern is more frequent in plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, compared to ectomycorrhizal fungi. These results show that precipitation variability and mycorrhizal association can affect terrestrial carbon dynamics by influencing biomass allocation strategies in a warmer world, suggesting that climate change could influence belowground C sequestration.

AB Fragmented forests contain natural edges, including riparian zones, and anthropogenic edges. Edges generally have lower plant density and fewer large trees than forest interior. Riparian edges, however, contain gap-specialist trees yielding leaves with high protein content, providing primates with important resources. We examined mantled howler monkeys' behavioral responses to riparian and anthropogenic edges at La Suerte Biological Research Station (LSBRS), Costa Rica. We predicted the monkeys would spend more time resting and feeding and less time traveling, and be less spatially cohesive, in both anthropogenic and riparian edges compared to forest interior due to lower resource abundance in edges, and in anthropogenic compared to riparian edge due to higher leaf quality in riparian zones. From 2017 to 2020, we collected data across forest zones on activity and spatial cohesion patterns via focal sampling, recording data every 2 min. Howler monkeys were significantly more likely to rest and significantly less likely to travel in both anthropogenic and riparian edges compared to forest interior; however, there were no differences between these edge types. There were significantly more monkeys within a 5-m radius of focal subjects in both anthropogenic and riparian edges compared to forest interior, but no differences between these edge types. While prior research found no differences across zones when only anthropogenic edge and forest interior were compared, results of this study demonstrate that howler monkeys at LSBRS modify their activity patterns in anthropogenic and riparian edge zones compared to forest interior, highlighting the importance of focusing on both natural and anthropogenic edge zones to fully understand primates' behavioral responses in fragmented landscapes.

AB Insular environments are among the most endangered ecosystems as they face a myriad of anthropogenic stressors. Forest mammals perform a wide range of ecological services, with their persistence being vital for ecosystem functionality in both natural and artificial islands. Studies revealed that shrinkage in island size usually leads to the decay of mammal species richness and abundance in patchy landscapes. However, mammal species-area (SARs) and abundance-area (AARs) relationships can differ among insular environments: oceanic, fluvial, artificial, and land-bridge islands (i.e., natural islands connected to the mainland). Large dams create vast insularized landscapes after river impoundment, leading to pervasive habitat loss and potentially causing even worse biodiversity losses than other insular systems. We conducted an extensive literature search and used meta-analysis techniques to quantify the magnitude of SAR and AAR for forest mammals across different archipelago landscapes worldwide. After a screening process, we ended up with 26 studies comprising 55 different effect sizes representing the magnitude of SARs and AARs. Our global analysis unveiled a positive relationship between effect sizes and island area, with mammal species richness and abundance increasing in fluvial, oceanic, and artificial islands accordingly with island area, but not in land-bridge islands. These results demonstrate that, except for land-bridge islands, SAR and AAR are still fair models to predict mammal diversity. These results could improve the prediction of SAR and AAR in insular environments under habitat loss scenarios and propose sound conservation strategies since the rate at which insular communities have been lost is presently unknown.

AB Domestic dogs are the most abundant carnivore globally and have demonstrable negative impacts to wildlife; yet, little evidence regarding their functional roles in natural food webs exists. Adding dogs to food webs may result in a net loss (via suppression of naturally occurring species), net gain (via mesopredator release), or no change (via functional replacement) to ecosystem function. Scavenging is a pivotal function in ecosystems, particularly those that are energetically supported by carrion. Dogs also scavenge on animal carcasses, but whether scavenging by dogs influences the structural and functional properties of food webs remains unclear. Here we used camera traps baited with carrion to test the effect of dogs on the composition and diversity of the vertebrate scavenger guild, as well as carrion detection and consumption rates. We conducted this work in sandy beach ecosystems, which rely on the import of marine organic matter (i.e. stranding of dead marine animals). Diversity of the scavenger community was similar on beaches without dogs. Dogs increased the time it took for carcasses to be detected and decreased the proportion of carrion consumed. This 'dog suppression effect' on scavenging was stronger for nocturnal mammalian scavengers, presumably being driven by indirect trait-mediated effects, which raises further questions about the broader ecological consequences of domestic dogs in natural systems.

AB Background Tropical tree species can maintain high growth rates on low-phosphorus (P) soils. However, the physiological basis of the high growth rates of tropical tree species remains unknown. Scope Here, we examine how traits related to P uptake and use efficiency might account for this phenomenon. Based on a comparison of plant physiological responses to P and nitrogen (N) limitation, we hypothesize that distinct evolutionary processes have occurred on strongly weathered tropical soils characterized by low P availability relative to weakly and moderately weathered temperate soils characterized by low N availability. Efficient P-use arises through the synthesis of galactolipids rather than phospholipids, small genome size, preferential and flexible P allocation to leaves, efficient P resorption from wood and leaves, tissue longevity, and a decrease in P allocation to reproduction. Efficient P uptake mechanisms include synthesis of phosphatase in roots to acquire organic P from phosphodiesters and phytate, association with mycorrhizal fungi efficient at acquiring P, secretion of organic anions from roots to mobilize soil P, increased mass flow, and modifications of root depth distribution and structure. Conclusions Despite the prevalence of low P soils throughout the tropics, few studies have explored P-use efficiency and acquisition mechanisms in tropical trees. We predict that the wide range of mechanisms by which plants can efficiently acquire and use P maintains productivity and promotes species diversity on low P soils in the tropics and elsewhere.

AB Considering the high rate of primary forest degradation and loss in the tropics, the ability to conserve plant diversity within alternative forest landscape components is critical to biodiversity conservation. This study compares the restoration potential of old forest plantations and secondary forests. We assessed and compared the floristics, plant species diversity, conservation value, and structure of old (42-47 years) timber plantations of Aucoumea klaineana Pierre, Cedrela odorata L., Tarrietia utilis Sprague, and Terminalia ivorensis A. Chev. and similar-aged secondary forests with nearby primary (old-growth) forests in the moist and wet forest zones of Ghana. We established a systematic sampling set-up of ninety-three 20 m x 20 m plots in total on 11 sites, with smaller nested subplots for saplings and ground vegetation. The floristic composition of the plantation and secondary forest stands were similar to that of the primary forests, with many rare and restricted-range species shared by the three forest types. Approximately 77% and 60% of primary forest plant species also occurred in plantation and secondary forests, respectively. Species diversity, measured by the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (H') and Simpson Index (S), for the primary forest (H'=3.07, S = 0.91) was not statistically different from the plantation (H'=2.85, S = 0.87) or secondary (H'=2.95, S = 0.88) forests. Overall, species richness was higher in the primary and secondary forests compared to the plantations. At the tree stratum (>= 10 cm DBH), the assessed diversity indices were significantly different between the primary forest and the plantations. However, such differences did not exist among the saplings (10 cm > DBH >= 2 cm) and ground vegetation (< 2cm DBH). The plantations and secondary forests were similar to the primary forests for all the structural characteristics assessed. However, basal area and bole volume were significantly higher in the plantations compared with secondary forests. Conservation value (using Genetic Heat Index as an indicator) was highest in one of the C. odorata plantations (W-CO). Our study demonstrates that plantation and secondary forests can develop into structurally complex and floristically diverse self-organized stands similar to primary forests. Passive conversion of plantations to more natural ecosystems is an effective and low-cost forest restoration strategy leading to diverse ecosystems with high conservation value.

AB The diversity of resistance challenges the ability of pathogens to spread and to exploit host populations. Yet, how this host diversity evolves over time remains unclear because it depends on the interplay between intraspecific competition among host genotypes and coevolution with pathogens. Here we study experimentally the effect of coevolving phage populations on the diversification of bacterial CRISPR immunity across space and time. We demonstrate that the negative-frequency-dependent selection generated by coevolution is a powerful force that maintains host resistance diversity and selects for new resistance mutations in the host. We also find that host evolution is driven by asymmetries in competitive abilities among different host genotypes. Even if the fittest host genotypes are targeted preferentially by the evolving phages, they often escape extinctions through the acquisition of new CRISPR immunity. Together, these fluctuating selective pressures maintain diversity, but not by preserving the pre-existing host composition. Instead, we repeatedly observe the introduction of new resistance genotypes stemming from the fittest hosts in each population. These results highlight the importance of competition on the transient dynamics of host-pathogen coevolution.
   This experimental study shows how the interplay between bacteria-phage coevolution and competition among bacterial genotypes results in increased diversity of bacterial CRISPR immunity.

As the homogenizing effects of biological invasions on community and ecosystem processes can be subtle, they may require the use of functional diversity indices to be properly evidenced. Starting from the listing of major functional diversity indices, alongside the presentation of their strengths and limitations, we focus on studies pertaining to the effects of invasive species on native communities and recipient ecosystems using functional diversity indices. By doing so, we reveal that functional diversity of the recipient community may strongly vary at the onset of the invasion process, while it stabilizes at intermediate and high levels of invasion. As functional changes occurring during the lag phase of an invasion have been poorly investigated, we show that it is still unknown whether there are consistent changes in functional diversity metrics that could indicate the end of the lag phase. Thus, we recommend providing information on the invasion stage under consideration when computing functional diversity metrics. For the existing literature, it is also surprising that very few studies explored the functional difference between organisms from the recipient communities and invaders of the same trophic levels, or assessed the effects of non-native organism establishment into a non-analogue versus an analogue community. By providing valuable tools for obtaining in-depth diagnostics of community structure and functioning, functional diversity indices can be applied for timely implementation of restoration plans and improved conservation strategies. To conclude, our work provides a first synthetic guide for their use in hypothesis testing in invasion biology.

AB Developing meaningful agroecosystem soil P inventories necessitates moving beyond single measures of readily extractable inorganic P (Pi) limited to surface depths. We drew on a long-term (36 year) experimental field trial in the US Maize Belt (northwestern Illinois) to evaluate how crop rotation [maize-maize (Zea mays L.) vs maizesoybean (Glycine max L. Merr.)] and N fertilization (0 vs 269 kg N ha-1) impact P dynamics throughout the soil profile by using sequential fractionation and phosphatase activity assays, contextualized by soil P stocks and agronomic P balances. Distribution of P fractions by depth (0-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-90 cm) indicate that management effects were limited to the surface soil layers (0-30 cm). Soil P fractions differed more by depth than by experimental treatments. Long-term N fertilization significantly decreased pH concurrently with labile organic P (Po) and phosphodiesterase activity. Soil labile inorganic P (Pi) was two-fold lower under N fertilization compared to zero N fertilization, reflecting greater yield and thus P export via grain harvest. Under N fertilization, integration of soybean elevated soil phosphodiesterase activity and decreased water-extractable Po. Higher stocks of soil Po than labile Pi at surface depths (0-30 cm) corroborated a hypothesized appreciable pool size of soil Po relative to the labile Pi pool to which most agronomic assessments are limited. Large negative agronomic balances over the 36-year period (-426 to -945 kg P ha-1) are suggestive of legacy P from preexperiment manure application and high native P stocks, with net P export equivalent to 11-35% of soil P stocks at 0-90 cm depth at the initiation of the experiment. These results contribute to a better understanding how N fertilization and rotation practices influence soil P cycling and stocks, thereby informing P budgets for comprehensive agroecosystem P management.

AB Context Despite the importance of secondary forests for the maintenance of biodiversity, the impact of pioneer trees on habitat loss and fragmentation is poorly understood. Objectives We analyzed the effects of landscape structure on genetic variability (node level analyses) and genetic differentiation (link level analyses) of the pioneer tree Cecropia hololeuca in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. At the node level, we analyzed the effects of landscape structure (forest and pasture amount, compositional heterogeneity, number and shape of patches, and matrix dominance), topography (slope and elevation), and effective population size (Ne) on allelic richness (AR), genetic diversity (He) and inbreeding coefficient (f). At the link level, we analyzed the effect of four resistance surfaces (isolation by geographic distance, land cover, elevation, and slope) on genetic differentiation between populations (F-ST, G'(ST), Jost's D). Methods We genotyped 257 individuals of C. hololeuca using eight microsatellite loci. At the node level, we calculated landscape and topographic variables at six spatial scales. At the link level, we optimized the resistance surfaces using ResistanceGA. We used a model selection approach to select the most parsimonious models. Results At the node level, matrices dominated by pastures had higher AR than landscapes dominated by Eucalyptus at the 1500 m spatial scale. At the link level, F-ST was best explained by slope, with lower values imposing more resistance. All resistance surfaces explained G'(ST). Conclusions In addition to conserving and restoring habitats, management practices that improve matrix permeability should be adopted to favor the movement of dispersers, consequently improving natural regeneration, increasing allelic richness, and decreasing genetic differentiation of natural populations.

AB Macrobenthos taxonomic and functional diversity are key indicators of ecosystem health. River-lake ecotones are key macrobenthos habitats. However, we don't fully understand macrobenthos biodiversity patterns in these ecotones. We studied water environment, sediment heavy metal contents, and macrobenthos community, which we sampled simultaneously from 29 sampling sites along the Fu River-Baiyangdian Lake gradient in Northern China with five field surveys from 2018 to 2019. Six trait classes resolved into 25 categories were allocated to macrobenthos through a binary coding system. We used the RLQ framework (R, environmental variables; L, species of taxa; Q, traits) and fourth-corner analyses to evaluate the relationship between environmental variables and macrobenthos traits. Finally, we carried out variance partitioning to assess the contributions of environmental variables to variation of macrobenthos diversities. As the results, TN and TP contents in the river and lake mouths were lower than those in the adjacent river and lake, indicating that the river-lake ecotones played a role in purifying the water and buffering pollution. High taxonomic diversity of macrobenthos in the lake mouth and the presence of unique taxa in the two ecotones revealed edge effects, but the macrobenthos abundance and biomass were extremely low compared with those in the adjacent river and lake. We found no significant correlation between the taxonomic and functional diversity indices in the river and lake mouths. Water depth, water transparency, TN, and TP were the main water environmental drivers of macrobenthos taxonomic and functional diversity, explaining up to 45.5% and 56.2% of the variation, respectively. Sediment Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn contents explained 15.1% and 32.8%, respectively, of macrobenthos taxonomic and functional diversity. Our results suggest that functional diversity approaches based on biological traits can complement taxonomic approaches in river-lake ecotones. Furthermore, improving water depth, transparency, eutrophication, and heavy metal pollution will improve macrobenthos diversity in these ecotones and maintain ecosystem health.

AB Since coexisting invasive and native plant species are exposed to similar environmental circumstances and selection pressures, variation in the morpho-functional, resource allocation and reproductive performance of these species could reflect the strategies adopted by the former for their invasion success. This study observed general differences in the morphological and physiological traits between invasive Ageratina adenophora and its co-occurring other invasive (Bidens pilosa) and native (Galinsoga ciliata) aster species in roadside populations of Kumaun Himalayan region. Plant samples were collected during their peak growth period. For the collection of plant and soil samples, five plots of 50 m x 2 m size were established at regular interval on the Nainital-Kathgodam road between 1800 and 1900 m asl. Five quadrats of 1 m x 1 m size were randomly placed at each of these plots, and from these quadrat, five individuals of each species were randomly collected. Soil was collected from 0 to 15 cm depth from all the five study plots. The results showed that soil properties did not vary among study plots and were of same nature. A. adenophora showed higher plant height and total biomass than its neighboring species and allocated more biomass to stem (76%) than G. ciliata (44%) and B. pilosa (38%) which reflects the competitive superiority of this plant over nearby vegetation for light harvesting. In contrast, highest biomass to leaves was allocated by G. ciliata (27%) followed by B. pilosa (26%) and A. adenophora (6%). The root/shoot ratio was lowest in A. adenophora and highest in B. pilosa. Specific leaf area was reported least for A. adenophora, while specific leaf weight was maximum reflecting the strategy of A. adenophora to survive in water stress conditions. High leaf dry matter content represented the physical strength and conservative strategy of A. adenophora in addition to protection from natural and biological hazards, whereas the highest seed number and reproductive index represented the superior reproductive efficiency than its co-occurring two species. Plant functional traits were positively or negatively correlated with each other and did not always exhibit higher values for A. adenophora. These findings suggest that A. adenophora possess superior traits associated with resource acquisition and resource conservation strategies in addition to advanced reproductive performance, which strongly influence the invasive success of this plant in comparison with other co-occurring native and invasive species.

AB Here, we aimed to evaluate the existence of temporal variation in the jaguar's diet and to determine if the adjustments in the diet apply to all prey or if there are species that are more important independently of temporal aspects. The study was carried out in one of the last Atlantic Forest remnants where all potential jaguar's prey are present. We analyzed fecal samples collected in three periods: 1996 (n=101 samples), 2006-2008 (n=32), and 2017-2019 (n=74). Twenty-seven types of prey were identified, and the diet varied temporally regarding composition (11-22 taxa/period) and importance of each prey. Medium- or large-sized prey and mammals were more representative. The main prey (percentage of occurrence > 5%) accounted for most consumed items in each period (68.4-82.2%). Thirteen types of prey (48.1%) were consumed in two or three periods (=regular), and 14 (51.9%) were consumed in only one period (= exclusive). Main and regular prey may represent key prey for jaguar, although the species needs diversification of secondary prey to complement its diet. We suggested that the jaguar's foraging strategy could be mediated by a combination of morphological, ecological, and behavioral aspects of prey, highlighting the importance of Tayassuidae and coati in all periods. Temporal variation of the diet may have been driven by environmental changes and variations in the abundance of prey, demonstrating the opportunistic feeding habit of jaguars. The existence of key prey may be a vulnerability factor for large predators, and the conservation of potential prey could contribute to the long-term conservation of jaguar, as well as to other big cats.

AB Understanding complex morphological shape differences has been revolutionized by the marriage of three-dimensional morphometric techniques and micro-computed tomography scanning. In animals, a major focus of this work has been the vertebrates, particularly the axial skeleton, while shape diversity in arthropods, by comparison, is less well explored. For example, the chelicerae (fanged, jaw-like mouthpart appendages) of spiders exhibit a wide degree of variation and may be expected to differ across the diversity of spider sizes and hunting strategies (e.g., active hunters versus relying on a web to intercept and capture prey) as well as in comparison to other structures on the same organism. We characterize and quantify the shapes of the carapace and chelicerae of 40 spiders across the spider tree of life and look for differences based on how those spiders attain their prey and whether their shapes coevolved or are modular. We found evidence for differences in cheliceral shape and related structures in spiders with different predation strategies as well as evidence for both integration and modularity in those structures. This suggests different pressures on the chelicerae including but not limited to predation mode. Furthermore, while differences in the structures were observed, they still must work in concert.

AB BACKGROUND Salsola tragus is a widespread and problematic weed of semi-arid wheat production globally, and in the inland Pacific Northwest region of the USA. The species exhibits high levels of phenotypic diversity across its range and, at least in California USA, previous work has described cryptic diversity comprising a multi-species complex. Such cryptic diversity could suggest the potential for a differential response to management inputs between groups, and have important implications for the spread of herbicide resistance or other adaptive traits within populations. We used a genotyping-by-sequencing approach to characterize the population structure of S. tragus in the inland Pacific Northwest. RESULTS Our results indicated that the population in this region is comprised of a single, tetraploid species (S. tragus sensu latu) with weak population structure on a regional scale. Isolation-by-distance appears to be the primary pattern of structure, but an independent set of weakly differentiated clusters of unknown origin were also apparent, along with a mixed mating system and high levels of largely unstructured genetic diversity. CONCLUSIONS Despite considerable phenotypic variability within S. tragus in the region, agronomic weed managers can likely consider it as a single entity across the region, rather than a collection of cryptic subgroups with possible differential responses to management inputs or agroecosystem conditions. A lack of strong barriers to migration and gene flow mean that adaptive traits, such as herbicide resistance, can be expected to spread rapidly through populations across the region.

AB Tropical rain forest fragmentation is considered one of the principal drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide. Fragmentation and defaunation of tropical rain forests affect the maintenance of their biodiversity in a myriad of ways. Old-growth forest plant and animal species are more likely to suffer from local extinction, not only because fragments frequently represent low quality habitats but also because of the loss of biotic interactions such as seed dispersal. In this study, we evaluated the maintenance of tree species diversity in the face of habitat fragmentation in southern Mexico using different approaches. Firstly, we used community phylogeny at different tree life stages (i.e., seeds, seedlings and adults). Secondly, we categorised plant species in different life stages into functional groups according to seed size (small seeds < 1 cm length and large seeds > 1 cm length) and, finally, by dispersal syndrome (predominantly primate dispersed). We searched for three sites of continuous forest as experimental controls where two important seed dispersers coexist, the howler (Alouatta pigra) and spider (Ateles geoffroyi) monkeys, and six forest fragments of similar sizes (ca. 3-6 ha). Three fragments were occupied only by howler monkeys, and three had no primates. We compared entire assemblages as well as assemblages of small-seeded and large-seeded species separately to determine the phylogenetic structure and patterns of species richness and the density of adult trees (> 10 cm dbh), seedlings (10-100 cm tall) and seed assemblages. Fragments and continuous forest differed in taxonomic species richness and density at all life stages when large-seeded species mainly dispersed by primates were solely considered, with numbers in unoccupied fragments being consistently lower than in continuous forests and occupied fragments. Phylogenetic clustering occurred in all habitats and for all life stages, predominantly for the seedling stage, indicating that the understory community is assembled via environmental filtering (including both biotic and abiotic processes). Habitats occupied by primates tended to present a higher phylogenetic clustering than unoccupied fragments, sug-gesting that primates select phylogenetically-related species in their diets and, importantly, that these foraging behaviours influence seedling recruitment patterns. The loss of taxonomic and functional biodiversity and the non-random extinction of tree species principally dispersed by primates, represents part of the evolutionary history that is being lost throughout fragmentation.

AB Introduction: Infrastructure projects or development activities often generate a loss of biodiversity and reduce the quality of the environment's services to human societies. Fortunately, many of these impacts can be reduced, controlled, or compensated through mitigation, rehabilitation, and compensation measures, which usually rely on the environmental legal framework of the countries or states where they are implemented. This review provides a theoretical vision of using environmental compensation as a legal/technical instrument integrated into natural environment management.Methodology: We reviewed the global literature on the subject using the GoogleScholar and SciELO reference search engines using various indicators in English and Spanish.Results: We found 244 references on environmental compensation, showing a clear increasing pattern in the last decade. Environmental compensation constitutes a legal/technical instrument that allows offsets for environmen-tal losses and often is part of the Environmental Impact Studies regulated by the state. Several methodological strategies are used to establish compensatory actions, each of them based on one of four possible approaches: economic, ecological, political, and cultural. The ecological equivalence between the impacted environmental elements and compensation is sought within the ecological approach, ensuring no net loss. Thus, this approach allows the incorporation of multiple criteria for the evaluation of damage and compensation actions: it can be applied in different situations. Nevertheless, compensatory measures are not exempt from criticism. There are situations in which the singularity of the impacted elements makes an adequate compensation for losses impossible.Conclusions: Compensation is highly relevant in environmental management and must favor the universal right to a healthy environment. However, its practical application requires clear procedures and close vigilance to prevent losses or even a net environmental gain.

AB Seedling performance in the early stage is crucial to natural forest restoration, and functional traits have been widely employed in exploring plant adaptation under field conditions. However, the responses and variabilities of leaf traits have not been clearly defined at the light gradients that are used in restoration practices. We evaluated the variation in leaf treats in species and community levels in a controlled field plot with shading treatments. We found that the variation characteristics differed across different species and trait types along shading gradients. Individuals of most species had a larger leaf area (LA) and specific leaf area (SLA) in the shaded habitats, while only a few tree species showed significant responses in their leaf shape and chlorophyll concentration. Although LA and SLA showed similar directions and trends of changes in the trait mean, four response models were observed based on the light points corresponding to initial responses and following trends. The extent of within-species trait variation for each treatment was similar at the community level due to diverse changes in the direction and degrees of variation in co-occurring species. Intraspecific variation was limited within each shading treatment, while it noticeably contributed to the local adaptation in the entire heterogeneous restoration community. Our findings indicate that species with different trait combinations will have different responses to light gradients, and that the mean and degree of variation in leaf traits will also lead to distinctive strategies being created to match the different shading conditions. Vegetation restoration should consider the adaptive traits and their response diversity when selecting species and for habitat management with specific trait-environment interactions.

AB Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs: similar to 30 to 100+ m depth) may be older and more stable than shallow coral ecosystems that are more prone to disturbances in both the long term (glacial sea level cycles) and short term (heavy weather and anthropogenic activities). Here, we assess the phylogeography of two MCE fishes, the soldierfish Myripristis chryseres (N = 85) and the squirrelfish Neoniphon aurolineatus (N = 74), with mtDNA cytochrome oxidase C subunit I. Our goal is to resolve population genetic diversity across the Central and West Pacific and compare these patterns to three shallow-reef species in the same taxonomic family (Holocentridae). Significant population structure (phi(ST) = 0.148, p = 0.01) was observed in N. aurolineatus, while no structure was detected in M. chryseres (phi(ST) = -0.031, p = 0.83), a finding that matches the shallow-water congener M. berndti (phi(ST) = -0.007, p = 0.63) across the same range. Nucleotide diversity in the MCE fishes was low (pi = 0.0024-0.0028) compared to shallow counterparts (pi = 0.003-0.006). Coalescence times calculated for M. chryseres (similar to 272,000 years) and N. aurolineatus (similar to 284,000 years) are more recent or comparable to the shallow-water holocentrids (similar to 220,000-916,000 years). We conclude that the shallow genetic coalescence characteristic of shallow-water marine fishes cannot be attributed to frequent disturbance. We see no evidence from holocentrid species that MCEs are older or more stable habitats.

AB Connectivity among populations of widespread marine species is expected to be correlated with their dispersal potential but the evolution of reproductive barriers may account for variations in spatial genetic patterns. Marine benthic hydroid species are traditionally considered widespread, with long-distance rafting presumably increasing their dispersal potential. In this study, we investigated the relationship between genetic, morphological and environmental variability within three benthic marine hydroid species to evaluate current patterns of genetic variation and assess the existence of cryptic speciation. Although a long-lived planktonic stage is absent in all the lineages sampled and they have an overlapping geographical ranges, we observed contrasting patterns of genetic and phenotypic divergence: Orthopyxis sargassicola showed little genetic variation, while O. caliculata and O. crenata each contained high genetic differentiation, primarily suggesting limited dispersal potential. Significant covariation was observed between phenotypic and environmental data in all lineages, but different environmental variables were responsible for explaining morphological variation in each case. Genetic and morphological patterns within O. caliculata and O. crenata are suggestive of cryptic speciation, while phenotypic variation in O. sargassicola may be plastic. Thus, morphological and genetic patterns may potentially vary among related marine lineages with shared life history traits and habitat.

AB Lianas are self-supporting systems that are increasing their dominance in tropical forests due to climate change. As lianas increase tree mortality and reduce tree growth, one key challenge in ecological remote sensing is the separation of a liana and its host tree using remote sensing techniques. This separation can provide essential insights into how tropical forests respond, from the point of view of ecosystem structure to climate and environmental change. Here, we propose a new machine learning method, derived from Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting) algorithms, to separate lianas and trees using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) point clouds. We test our method on five tropical dry forest trees with different levels of liana infestation. First, we use a multiple radius search method to define the optimal radius of six geometric features. Second, we compare the performance of RF and XGBoosting algorithms on the classification of lianas and trees. Finally, we evaluate our model against independent data collected by other projects. Our results show that the XGBoosting algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 0.88 (recall of 0.66), and the RF algorithm has an accuracy of 0.85 (recall of 0.56). Our results also show that the optimal radius method is as accurate as the multiple radius method, with F1 scores of 0.49 and 0.48, respectively. The RF algorithm shows the highest recall of 0.88 on the independent data. Our method provides a new flexible approach to extracting lianas from 3D point clouds, facilitating TLS to support new studies aimed to evaluate the impact of lianas on tree and forest structures using point clouds.

AB Using 16 STR markers, the genetic structure of sable populations in the north of the Central Siberian Plateau and the right bank of the Lena River was studied. They were from typical taiga habitats and atypical tundra habitats directly adjacent to the coast of the Arctic Ocean. At present, the species is in the stage of settlement; in recent years, the sable has penetrated deeply into the tundra zone. Since 2000, an increase in the number of sable and an increase in migratory activity have been recorded in this region; in connection with this, the level of differentiation between the "historical" sable populations has been studied. Data on the geographical distribution of sable genotypes show that groups related to the Olenek sable population inhabit the tundra zone. Evidence of the formation of a sable subpopulation structure in a new habitat has been revealed. Another conclusion: the "historical" populations of the Central Siberian Plateau did not undergo a restructuring of the genetic structure under the influence of migration flows and are significantly genetically differentiated. The appearance of sables in the tundra indicates the active development of new territories that were not previously typical of the species.

AB Ecological mechanisms governing inheritance of bacterial and fungal communities from seed to seed in rice are revealed. The inherited microbes dominate each community at the ripening stage, and parental seeds and stem endosphere are major sources.
   Vertical transmission of microbes is crucial for the persistence of host-associated microbial communities. Although vertical transmission of seed microbes has been reported from diverse plants, ecological mechanisms and dynamics of microbial communities from parent to progeny remain scarce. Here we reveal the veiled ecological mechanism governing transmission of bacterial and fungal communities in rice across two consecutive seasons. We identify 29 bacterial and 34 fungal members transmitted across generations. Abundance-based regression models allow to classify colonization types of the microbes. We find that they are late colonizers dominating each community at the ripening stage. Ecological models further show that the observed temporal colonization patterns are affected by niche change and neutrality. Source-sink modeling reveals that parental seeds and stem endosphere are major origins of progeny seed microbial communities. This study gives empirical evidence for ecological mechanism and dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities as an ecological continuum during seed-to-seed transmission.

AB Information on genetic population structure provides important knowledge for species conservation. Yet, few studies combine extensive genetic data to evaluate the structure and population dynamics of transboundary populations. Here we used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), microsatellites and mitochondrial haplotypes to analyze the genetic population structure of wolverines (Gulo gulo) across Fennoscandia using a long-term monitoring dataset of 1708 individuals. Clear population subdivision was detected between the Scandinavian and the eastern Finnish population with a steep cline in the contact zone. While the Scandinavian population showed isolation by distance, large swaths of this population were characterized by high connectivity. Areas with high resistance to gene flow are likely explained by a combination of factors, such as historical isolation and founder effects. From a conservation perspective, promoting gene flow from the population in eastern Finland to the northwest of Scandinavia could augment the less variable Scandinavian population, and increase the demographic resilience of all subpopulations. Overall, the large areas of low resistance to gene flow suggest that transboundary cooperation with aligned actions of harvest and conflict mitigation could improve genetic connectivity across Finland, Sweden, and Norway.

AB Conservation genetics provides wildlife managers powerful tools to assist conservation planning, being recognized as an important biodiversity component. Nevertheless, communication between wildlife conservation actors is still not effective. Furthermore, wildlife conservation funds are often allocated to conservation actions incompatible with thorough long-term genetic research. In the Neotropics, the political organization of the territory, the complex socio-economic context, and the environmental heterogeneity impose additional challenges to the use of genetics for wildlife conservation. Here we present an assessment of the state-of-the-art on the conservation genetics of the giant anteater, as a study case. We use this species to discuss key wildlife threats and challenges along nine major Neotropical biomes. We review the main scientific research on the species, comprising and analyzing genetic data, and focusing on each biome and its region-specific threats. Our genetic meta-analysis reveals low levels of genetic diversity for the species, signs of population differentiation and dissimilar demographic trends per biome. Large-scale investigations are needed to disclose between hypotheses of panmixia, population structure and local adaptation, and to better assess the species demography. The limited information available for a known Vulnerable species perfectly illustrates the need for greater and internationally concerted investment in genetic/genomic research in the Neotropics. Finally, we describe the main wildlife conservation challenges per biome assessed, and present open research questions to which genetics could be of paramount importance.

AB Gap-scale disturbances drive successional and structural development patterns in most forest ecosystems. Although fire-maintained Pinus palustris woodlands are less light limited than closed canopy forests, gap-scale disturbance processes may still influence successional and developmental pathways. We quantified biophysical characteristics of 50 canopy gaps in a montane Pinus palustris woodland to analyze gap-scale disturbance patterns and processes. We found most gaps (64%) were caused by the death of a single tree. Snag-formed gaps were most common (38%) followed by snapped stems (32%). We hypothesized that insect-induced mortality, perhaps in combination with drought periods, resulted in the high frequency of snag- and snapped stem-formed gaps. We did not find significant differences in gap size or shape based on gap formation or closure mechanisms. Most gaps (74%) were projected to close by lateral crown expansion of gap perimeter trees. We hypothesized most gaps projected to close via subcanopy recruitment would be captured by a P. palustris stem. The majority of gaps were small and gap frequency declined with increased gap size. We found gaps were significantly clustered through the woodland at distances of 8-36 m from gap edge to gap edge but were randomly distributed beyond 36 m.

AB Across the globe, non-native plant species have become abundant in many tropical forests, resulting in altered patterns of biological diversity and species composition, and impacting important ecosystem functions. However, long-term experimental research on the efficacy of non-native tree removal for tropical forest restoration remains limited. We investigated the removal of non-native tree species in a mesic tropical forest in Hawai'i, where rates of endemism and endangerment of plant species is high and multiple non-native tree species are abundant. As a collaboration between resource managers and researchers, we tested the effects of non-native tree removal on overstory and understory metrics of restoration using three restoration approaches: "total cut " (cutting all non-native trees); "girdle " (girdle of all non-native trees); and "selective cut " (cutting approximately 50% of nonnative trees). Prior to removal, we established permanent plots (four 10 x 10 m plots per restoration treatment, with 10 1 x 1 m subplots in each), then monitored them over 10 years. Across all treatments, canopy openness increased significantly post restoration, peaked after three years, then decreased to pre-treatment levels or lower. The increase was largest for the total cut treatment, but there was large variation within treatments. By the end of the experiment, the total cut and girdle treatments performed similarly for all our metrics of restoration, including survival, growth, density, and basal area of native trees; density and richness of native species in the understory; and total weed biomass. The selective treatment performed worse, showing lower relative gains in basal area of native trees and density of native understory individuals. Overall, tree removal was effective in restoring a native canopy. However, understory native species richness and density remained at pre-treatment levels, likely due to limited seed dispersal, seed predation by non-native rodents, and continued competition from non-native herbaceous species. Nonetheless, subplots with the best starting conditions performed the best. More intensive and longer-term weeding of non-native species in the understory, focused on areas with the best starting conditions and combined with out-planting of native seeds, seedlings and/or saplings, is likely necessary to foster effective native species regeneration. Overall, our research shows that removal of non-native trees using the total cut and girdle techniques can foster native forest restoration in the mesic forests of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, but that ongoing long-term management in the understory is critical.

AB Knowledge of the leaf trait-growth rate relationship is essential for assessing plant physiological performance in forest ecosystems. Intraspecific leaf trait variation may have different effects on tree growth at various spatial and temporal scales. Plant functional-group and life-stage approaches have the potential to clarify the specific roles to understand the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. Our research determined the significance of leaf traits and soil variation in broadleaf and coniferous tree growth across different life stages and habitat types. In a 9 ha Liangshui forest dynamic plot in Northeast China, we used linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to model tree growth as a function of leaf traits and soil variables in three habitat types with different soil organic matter and slope conditions. Tree growth in the broadleaf saplings was more significantly influenced by leaf traits and soil variation than that in the adults. On the other hand, the growth of coniferous adults was more significantly influenced by leaf traits and soil variation than that of the saplings. The influence of leaf traits on the growth of broadleaf saplings was dependent on the habitat type. Soil variation had positive effects on the growth of broadleaf saplings and coniferous adults in the high-nutrient habitat type. Different functional types can provide different insights into the influence of leaf traits on tree growth. To apply leaf traits to forest management, the relationships of plant functional types, life stages, and local environments with tree growth need to be carefully considered, particularly in mixed-species forests with varying tree sizes.

AB With increasing concerns about sustainable exploitation of tropical timber, there is a need for developing independent tools to check their origin. We evaluated the potential of tree-ring stable isotopes for identifying four Cedrela species (C. balansae, C. fissilis, C. odorata, and C. saltensis) and for identifying geographic origin of C. fissilis and C. odorata, two of the most intensively exploited species. We studied differences in delta C-13 and delta O-18 of wood among 11 forest sites (163 trees). We quantified isotope composition of 10-year bulk samples, and for a subset we also evaluated isotopic annual fluctuations for the last 10 years. Although annual isotopic variability was not correlated to precipitation or elevation, we found a significant relationship between the 10-year bulk stable-isotope composition and average precipitation and elevation. However these relationships were not consistent across all sites. We also explored isotopic site and species differentiation using Kernel Discriminant Analyses. Site discrimination was low: 30% accuracy for C. odorata, and 40% for C. fissilis sites. However, species discrimination was 57.5% for C. odorata and 95.3% for C. fissilis. These results suggest that although delta C-13 and delta O-18 isotopic analyses hold potential to verify species identification, discrimination of geographical origin within a country may still be challenging.

AB The objective of the present study is to understand the forest recovery and soil replenishment of fallow after shifting cultivation. Currently, the cycle of shifting cultivation has been shortened to 3-4 years, which affects the recovery potential of the forest. So, it is important to study the changes in vegetation and soil nutrient status in fallow areas of different ages. Based on the year of abandonment, 12 experimental plots of 30 m x 30 m were established, 4 shifting-cultivation fallows (FP) (i.e., 0-3, 4-7, 8-11 and 12-15 years old) and another 3 experimental plots were established in natural undisturbed forest (NF) for comparison. Phytosociological indices and soil properties were studied to understand the changes in relation to fallow age.& nbsp;Species composition varied among the fallow ages. The 12-15 year old FP had the highest number of tree individuals as well as number of species among all FP. The study showed an increase in the tree component, while the herbaceous and shrub component decreased with increasing age of FP, and the major effect was noticeable after 11 years FP. Soil properties differed significantly among all the study sites. Our study shows that longer the FP, the higher is the forest recovery and soil replenishment of fallows.

AB The Panamic Clingfish Gobiesox adustus is widely distributed in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), from the central Gulf of California, Mexico to Ecuador, including the oceanic Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Isla del Coco. This cryptobenthic species is restricted to very shallow rocky-reef habitats. Here, we used one mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA markers from 155 individuals collected across the distribution range of the species in order to evaluate if geographically structured populations exist and to elucidate its evolutionary history. Phylogenetic analyses recovered a monophyletic group, with four well-supported, allopatric subgroups. Each subgroup corresponded to one of the following well-known biogeographic regions/provinces: 1) the Revillagigedo Archipelago, 2) the Cortez + Mexican provinces (Mexico), 3) the Panamic province (from El Salvador to Ecuador), and 4) Isla del Coco. A molecular-clock analysis showed a mean date for the divergence between clade I (the Revillagigedos and Cortez + Mexican provinces) and clade II (Panamic province and Isla del Coco) in the Pliocene, at ca. 5.33 Mya. Within clade I, the segregation between the Revillagigedos and Cortez + Mexican province populations was dated at ca. 1.18 Mya, during the Pleistocene. Within clade II, the segregation between samples of Isla del Coco and the Panamic province samples was dated at ca. 0.77 Mya, during the Pleistocene. The species tree, Bayesian species delimitation tests (BPP and STACEY), the Phi(ST), AMOVA, and the substantial genetic distances that exist between those four subgroups, indicate that they are independent evolutionary units. These cladogenetic events seem to be related to habitat discontinuities, and oceanographic and geological processes that produce barriers to gene flow for G. adustus, effects of which are enhanced by the intrinsic ecological characteristics of this species.

AB The Riverine Barrier Hypothesis (RBH) predicts that tropical rivers can be effective barriers to species dispersion, affecting different scales of biological organization, from genes to assemblages. We disentangled the latitudinal from the river presence effect to test the hypothesis that the Doce river mouth acted as a geographical, historical barrier for insects through North and South directions of the Brazilian coast, affecting the current community structure. We sampled dung beetle communities. In 16 Coastal Sand-dune Forest ( "Restinga ") patches, across the Doce River Basin in the Brazilian coastline, nine through the South and seven through the North direction of the Doce River's mouth. We analyzed the relationship between the community composition and richness relative to the river (North and South regions) and latitude using linear modeling over a distance matrix (DistLM) approach. The latitude explained 17.74% of the total variation in dung beetle species composition, and the regional position relative to Doce River's mouth exhibited a significant effect (Pseudo F = 2.8479; p = 0.005) only after removing the latitudinal effect, here representing the habitat filtering. Both variables explained together with a total of 32.52% of the variability in dung beetles composition at coastal sand dune forests. The geographical position alone explained 48% of the richness difference between the North and South regions of the Doce River's mouth (Pseudo F = 16.534; p < 0.01). Meanwhile, the latitudinal position of the sites exhibited no significant rela-tionship with species richness. Our findings highlight the role of Doce River as a biogeographical filter in the Doce river basin, while it represents the primary determinant of geographical segregation of the two key-species central to the dung beetle community structure.

AB In the present study, on the basis of the analysis of 17 microsatellite loci, 866 horses from nine breeds, including Altai, Tuvan, Kushum, Pechora, Mezen, Transbaikal, Buryat, Russian Riding, and Mongolian breeds, were examined. The studied breeds were characterized by the high level of observed heterozygosity (from 0.699 to 0.798), which did not cause concern. A total of 183 alleles were identified, including 15 private ones. In Mongolian horses of the Tes breed, rare allele D of the AHT4 locus and a previously undescribed allele were identified. Phylogenetic relationships, structure, and interaction of the gene pools of Mongolian and Russian horses were demonstrated. The polymorphism analysis of the mtDNA control region (D-loop) in 142 horses provided identification of 16 haplotypes, of which four, found in the Mongolian, Buryat, Transbaikal, and Tuvan breeds, were previously found only in ancient horse samples from Europe and Asia. Haplotypes X2 and D3 turned out to be the most common among the studied breeds. The hypothesis that the majority of mtDNA haplotypes were not associated with the particular breed or geographic region was confirmed. Horse populations were different only in the haplotype sets and frequencies. High polymorphism of horse mtDNA is thought to be associated with multiple domestication events, as well as active horse movements across the world and their breeding history.

AB Almost all world's forest areas are predicted to be near edges by 2100, making the detection and prediction of biodiversity responses to edges an urgent need. Yet, idiosyncratic observations across studies have hampered general inferences on the main drivers of edge effects. We provide a global meta-analysis on 674 forest edge -interior comparisons of plant and animal communities, considering both global and local drivers as well as their interactions, to predict the direction and magnitude of edge effects on species richness. We found a clear latitudinal gradient in both the direction and magnitude of edge effects, with edges in temperate regions having more species than interior forests, while tropical communities generally had fewer species at edges. Unexpect-edly, communities near high-contrast edges had higher richness at edges more frequently than near low-contrast edges. In addition, richness decreases at edges were weaker in regions subjected to historical disturbance than regions without historical disturbance. These patterns were modulated by distance from the edge and became clearer when comparing more distant sampling locations. Our results provide possible explanations for the variable impacts of edge effects and thereby forest fragmentation on biodiversity, showing that a combination of local and global predictors are able to partially predict variation in edge effects.

AB Some studies suggest that canopy gaps are not crucial for woody species recruitment in typhoon-disturbed forests because of frequently defoliated forest crowns and invariant high-light levels under the forest canopy. Here we examined this speculation focusing on seedling establishment stages and forest floor light in a forest with annual return frequencies of typhoons. We monitored light (photosynthetically active radiation; PAR) and seedling dynamics in 75 seedling quadrats (each 1 x 1 m(2)) for eight years in Nanjenshan tropical lowland forest, Taiwan (2043 newly recruited seedlings; 199 advance regeneration seedlings). Due to attenuation by the understorey vegetation, only 24% of the PAR that penetrated the forest canopy reached the forest floor. We found that PAR transmittance on the forest floor was heterogeneous temporally, ranging from 0.01 to 15.6%. Nonetheless, shade-intolerant species established at relatively high median values of light transmittance, compared to species of the moderate and tolerant groups, indicating that light is a crucial resource at the establishment stage. However, many seedlings died in relatively high-light conditions, suggesting that factors other than low light were more critical for survival. The generally low-light environment on the forest floor also resulted in similar composition and slow growth of seedlings across quadrats, except for a few in extraordinary high-light quadrats. In conclusion, the temporal light environment below the understorey layer was heterogeneous and was critical for differentiated establishment and growth patterns of newly recruited seedlings. Thus, besides canopy gaps, the light attenuation effect caused by understorey vegetation plays an essential role in the early establishment stage of seedlings in a forest frequently disturbed by typhoons.

AB Animal movements reflect temporal and spatial availability of resources as well as when, where, and how individuals access such resources. To test these relationships for a predatory reptile, we quantified the effects of prey abundance on the spatial ecology of invasive brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) on Guam. Five months after toxicant-mediated suppression of a brown treesnake population, we simultaneously used visual encounter surveys to generate relative rodent abundance and radiotelemetry of snakes to document movements of surviving snakes. After snake suppression, encounter rates for small mammals increased 22-fold and brown treesnakes had smaller mean daily movement distances (24 +/- 13 m/day, (x) over bar +/- SD) and activity areas (5.47 +/- 5 ha) than all previous observations. Additionally, snakes frequenting forest edges, where our small mammal encounters were the highest, had smaller mean daily movement distances and three-dimensional activity volumes compared to those within the forest interior. Collectively, these results suggest that reduced movements by snakes were in part a response to increased prey availability. The impact of prey availability on snake movement may be a management consideration when attempting to control cryptic invasive species using tools that rely on movement of the target species to be effective.

AB Context. Many grassland forb populations have greatly diminished because their habitat coincides with prime agricultural land and remnants lack appropriate disturbance regimes. Aim. The aim of the current study is to examine the survivorship, vegetative recruitment, biomass and sexual reproduction of S. papaverifolium in response to burning in one of a few natural surviving populations in Queensland. Methods. We monitored the survivorship, vegetative recruitment, and reproduction of a rare native forb, Solanum papaverifolium, within a randomised replicated experiment by using 14 circular plots measuring 12.56 m(2) (2 m radius). Key results. Plant survival rate after 5 months was greater in the burnt plots (56%) than the unburnt plots (44%). Vegetative recruitment from suckers in the burnt plots was almost twice that in the unburnt plots. The probability of flowering was also enhanced by burning. Fruit set in new recruits was higher in the burnt plots (20%) than in the unburnt plots (5%). Whereas fruiting did not occur in unburnt plots for surviving plants that flowered, only 1% fruited in the burnt plots. Seedling production was not observed. Conclusion. Previous studies have demonstrated that the subtropical grassland flora in the study region is unaffected by burning, whereas the present study suggests that some grassland species respond positively to burning. Implications. Although fire increased flowering in this species, suggesting that fire may be a useful tool to stimulate sexual reproduction, ongoing research is required to understand the precise factors that promote flowering after burning and the barriers to seedling reproduction.

AB Species occurrence in the landscape is influenced by habitat characteristics such as vegetation structure and resource availability. Habitat fragmentation causes a reduction or elimination of required resources, leading to the decline or disappearance of populations and species. Among carnivores, variables such as vegetation characteristics, prey availability, and human infrastructure were strongly associated with species occupancy. However, the relationship between these variables and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) occupancy in fragmented landscapes remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of habitat characteristics, prey availability, and human infrastructure on ocelot occupancy in the protected areas of Sao Paulo. We sampled 55 sites using unbaited camera traps from October 2012 to August 2017 with a sampling effort of 10.175 trap-nights. We fitted models to determine how vegetation characteristics, prey availability, and human infrastructure affect ocelot occupancy. Ocelots were detected in 40% of sites, with a higher occupancy probability in sites with a greater relative abundance of prey and a farther distance from urban areas; however, there was no significant relationship with native vegetation. Thus, preservation of the ocelot requires the reduction of human impacts on these landscapes.

AB Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is the basis of the lucrative confectionery industry with "fine or flavour" cocoa attracting higher prices due to desired sensory and quality profiles. The Amazonas Region (north Peru) has a designation of origin, Fine Aroma Cacao, based on sensory quality, productivity and morphological descriptors but its genetic structure and ancestry is underexplored. We genotyped 143 Fine Aroma Cacao trees from northern Peru (Bagua, Condorcanqui, Jaen, Mariscal Caceres, and Utcubamba; mainly Amazonas Region), using 192 single nucleotide polymorphic markers. Identity, group, principal coordinate, phylogenetic and ancestry analyses were conducted. There were nine pairs of matched trees giving 134 unique samples. The only match within 1,838 reference cacao profiles was to a putative CCN 51 by a Condorcanqui sample. The "Peru Uniques" group was closest to Nacional and Amelonado-Nacional genetic clusters based on F-ST analysis. The provinces of Bagua and Utcubamba were genetically identical (D-est = 0.001; P = 0.285) but differed from Condorcanqui (D-est = 0.016-0.026; P = 0.001-0.006). Sixty-five (49%) and 39 (29%) of the Peru Uniques were mixed from three and four genetic clusters, respectively. There was a common and strong Nacional background with 104 individuals having at least 30% Nacional ancestry. The fine aroma of cacao from Northern Peru is likely due to the prevalent Nacional background with some contribution from Criollo. A core set of 53 trees was identified. These findings are used to support the continuance of the fine or flavour industry in Peru.

AB Avian nectar-robbing is common in some floras but its impact on plant-pollinator mutualisms, flowering phenology, and the evolution of floral traits remains largely unexplored. Surprisingly, there have been no quantitative studies of the topography and extent of floral damage inflicted on any flowering species by nectar-robbing birds. I studied nectar-robbing of orchard oriole (Icteridae: Icterus spurius) on the large reddish-orange flowers of trumpet creeper (Bignoniaceae: Campsis radicans), an ornithophilous liana of eastern North America. Floral traits that inhibit nectar-robbery by hummingbirds and bees, such as the thickened calyx and sympetalous corolla, are ineffective in deterring orioles. Orioles target the zygomorphic trumpet-shaped corollas at the 11:00 h or 01:00 h positions with a closed-bill puncture and then enlarge the incision with bill-gaping to reach the nectary. More than 92% of flowers were robbed when orioles were present. Fruit set was nil until orioles departed on fall migration in late July-early August. The timing suggests oriole nectary-robbery may be a potent selection agent for an extended flowering season or delay in the onset of flowering. The biological and geographic attributes of the Campsis-Icterus association make it a promising model system for studying the consequences of avian nectar-robbery on pollination biology and floral trait evolution.

AB The 'Critically Endangered' Black-winged Trumpeter Psophia obscura is endemic to the Belem Centre of Endemism in extreme eastern Amazonia and has a declining population and range. Here we report on a five-year (2016-2020) systematic camera-trap (n = 61) study of the species in Gurupi Biological Reserve, one of its most important conservation areas. We used a multi-season occupancy model to identify factors affecting occupancy rates and to assess occupancy trends in the reserve. Occupancy was negatively related to elevation and site-level tree density, and was positively related to post-logging recovery times. Average annual occupancy rates remained stable throughout the study period (ranging between 0.57 and 0.67) and this stability was largely driven by high between-year survival rates. Results confirm that the Black-winged Trumpeter is an interior-forest specialist that is highly sensitive to forest disturbance, which underlines the importance of the Gurupi Biological Reserve as a core site for the conservation of the species. However, the species is long-lived, so continuous monitoring is needed to further clarify population trends. We also recommended that the status of the species in other forest remnants, most of which remain unprotected, is assessed.

AB Disturbances elicit both positive and negative effects on organisms; these effects vary in their strength and their timing. Effects of disturbance interval (i.e., the length of time between disturbances) on population growth will depend on both the timing and strength of positive and negative effects of disturbances. Climate change can modify the relative strengths of these positive and negative effects, leading to altered optimal disturbance intervals (the disturbance interval at which population growth rate is highest) and changes in the sensitivity of population growth rate to disturbance interval. While we know that climate may alter impacts of disturbance in some systems, we have a poor understanding of which effects of disturbance and which vital rates might drive an altered response to disturbance interval in a changing climate. We use demographic monitoring of natural populations of Dionaea muscipula, the Venus flytrap, that have experienced natural and managed fires, combined with realistic past and future climate projections, to construct climate- and fire-driven integral projection models (IPMs). We use these IPMs to compare the effect of fire return interval (FRI) on population growth rate in past and future climates. To dissect the mechanisms driving FRI response, we then construct IPMs with demographic data from an experimental manipulation of fire effects (ash addition, neighbor removal) and an accidental fire. Our results show that an FRI of 10 years is optimal for D. muscipula in past climate conditions, but a longer FRI (12 years) is optimal in future climate conditions. Further, deviations from optimal FRI reduce population growth rate dramatically in the past climate, but this reduction is muted in a future climate (future minus past sensitivity = 0.006, 95% CI [0.002, 0.011]). Finally, our experimental work suggests that fire effects are driven in part by positive, additive effects of competitor removal and ash addition immediately following a fire; for one population, both these treatments significantly increased population growth rate. Our work suggests that climate change can alter the response of populations to disturbance, highlighting the need to consider the interacting effects of multiple abiotic drivers when projecting future population growth and geographical distributions.

AB Many tree planting programmes have long been initiated to increase forest cover to mitigate the effects of global climate change. Successful planting requires careful planning at the project level, including using suitable species with favourable traits. However, there is a paucity of improvement data for tropical tree species. An experimental common garden of Shorea leprosula was established to study traits related to growth performance which are key factors in planting success. Seedlings of S. leprosula were collected from nine geographical forest reserves. To study the effects of genetic variation, seedlings were planted in a common environment following a randomized complete block design. From performance data collected 2017-2019, one population showed the highest coefficient for relative height growth, significantly higher than most of the other populations. Interestingly, this population from Beserah also exhibited the lowest coefficient for scale insect infestation. This study provides preliminary results on growth performance and susceptibility to scale insect infestation in S. leprosula and the first common garden experiment site conducted on dipterocarp species. It lays a foundation for future genome-wide studies.

AB Primates can respond to food availability shortages by increasing the energy they invest in searching for alternative food resources or by conserving energy by altering their diet while reducing movement. To gain information on the ecological flexibility of Beni titi monkeys (Plecturocebus modestus), we assessed seasonal variation in the behavior and ranging and feeding patterns of two focal groups across a year. We recorded group behaviors using instantaneous group scan sampling and used all occurrence sampling to collect ranging and feeding data (1,178 observation hours in the dry season, and 1,202 in the wet season). We collected data on food availability via monthly phenology monitoring. We found that during the fruit-scarce dry season, these frugivorous primates significantly reduced their monthly investment in moving and increased their consumption of flowers. They also showed some decrease in fruit consumption, home ranges and daily path length. Our observations of a diet shift to a high intake of alternative foods and reduction of time spent on moving suggest that the P. modestus groups that we studied used an energy-area minimizing strategy when fruits were less available. While we found that P. modestus could find food in the naturally fragmented forests, high levels of ongoing anthropogenic forest fragmentation may lead to reductions in important food resources, threatening the survival of these Endangered primates. This study shows the ecological flexibility of primates and provides important information to be incorporated in the design of specific effective conservation actions for this threatened an endemic species, as well as highlights the importance of mitigating the current threats to these forest ecosystems.

AB Social behavior studies in mammals are commonly found in the literature. However, nothing is known on the hierarchical relationships of American marsupials, which are mainly composed of cryptic, nocturnal species. We aim to examine the existence of a domination and subordination relationship among Didelphis aurita females. For such purpose, we used capture and recapture data of five resident female individuals in a forest patch for 1 year. Comparative analyses among females were performed in relation to the temporal variation in body size, the spatial segregation in their home ranges, and the individual differences in their diets, all focusing on hierarchical relationships. Behavioral differences were observed between the hypothetically dominant female and other resident females, corroborating the hypothesis of hierarchy among D. aurita females. The dominant female presented larger home range, larger territory, stronger dominance over the patch center, and a mostly different diet regarding young females. Its diet changed from specific food items to a more diversified strategy in the following season, possibly due to the increased competition among adult females during the breeding season. After the disappearance of the dominant female, the central patch area was invaded by another large-sized, well-conditioned, and older female that lived in peripheral areas of the patch. Although the data are from a limited number of individuals and while we think that dominance hierarchy is the most likely explanation for the patterns observed, other interpretations are also possible, and further studies with more data and individuals are needed, to confirm the existence of dominance hierarchy in this species.

AB We used data on the species composition of regional assemblages of fleas and their small mammalian hosts from 6 biogeographic realms and applied a novel method of step-down factor analyses (SDFA) and cluster analyses to identify biogeographic (across the entire globe) and ecological (within a realm across the main terrestrial biomes) clusters of these assemblages. We found that, at the global scale, the clusters of regional assemblage loadings on SDFA axes reflected well the assemblage distribution, according to the biogeographic realms to which they belong. At the global scale, the cluster topology, corresponding to the biogeographic realms, was similar between flea and host assemblages, but the topology of subtrees within realm-specific clusters substantially differed between fleas and hosts. At the scale of biogeographic realms, the distribution of regional flea and host assemblages did not correspond to the predominant biome types. Assemblages with similar loadings on SDFA axes were often situated in different biomes and vice versa. The across-biome, within-realm distributions of flea vs host assemblages suggested weak congruence between these distributions. Our results indicate that dispersal is a predominant mechanism of flea and host community assembly across large regions.

AB This study seeks to use machine learning to investigate the role of meteorological and climate variables on wildfire occurrence in the Arctic and the global tropical forests biomes. Using monthly fire counts observed by the MODIS satellites in combination with temperature and precipitation data, indices of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic anomalies (teleconnections), and global temperature anomalies (GT), a combined wavelet-machine learning approach is developed to identify drivers of variability in global wildfire counts on a monthly scale. Precipitation and temperature are found to be the most important predictors of wildfire count in all regions. In addition, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and GT are identified as the two major drivers of wildfire occurrence. Results indicate that the record-breaking 2019 wildfires in the Asian Arctic can be attributed to unusually warm and dry weather, while the recent increase in wildfires in Amazonia rather can be attributed to regional human activities.

AB The relationships between plant traits and soil properties in forest edges can provide insights into tree species recovery in edge habitats. In this study, we investigated the relationships between plant functional traits and soil condi-tions related to tree species recovery at the edges of two seasonally dry forests, a mixed deciduous forest (MDF) and a deciduous dipterocarp forest (DDF) in northern Thailand. We analyzed differences in functional trait diver-sity and community-level trait values between forests and performed RLQ analysis to assess the associations among species abundance, plant traits, and soil variables. We found that the MDF site had greater functional diversity and was dominated by plants with high specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry-matter content (LDMC) at the community level, whereas the DDF site had lower diver-sity and was dominated by plants with high wood density (WD) and leaf thick-ness (LT). The RLQ results indicated that at the MDF site, tree species with greater SLA (e.g., Pterocarpus macrocarpus, Dalbergia cultrata, and Phanera bracteata) were associated with soil clay content and nutrient status (i.e., ni-trogen and calcium). Species with greater LDMC and leaf size (e.g., Xylia xylo-carpa, Schleichera oleosa, and Chukrasia tabularis) were associated with soil organic matter content. At the DDF site, species with greater WD and LT (e.g., Dipterocarpus obtusifolius, Shorea siamensis, and Buchanania lanzan) were associated with soil sand content and bulk density. These patterns reflect the interplay between soil conditions and plant traits in the edge habitats of sea-sonally dry forests. Our results indicate that the edge effects on plant commu-nities within seasonally dry forests depend on soil conditions and species-spe-cific plant traits.

AB Plant competition experiments commonly suggest that larger species have an advantage, primarily in terms of light acquisition. However, within crowded natural vegetation, where competition evidently impacts fitness, most resident species are relatively small. It remains unclear, therefore, whether the size advantage observed in controlled experiments is normally realized in habitats where competition is most intense. We characterized the light environment and tested for evidence of a size advantage in competition for light in an old-field plant community composed of perennial herbaceous species. We investigated whether larger species contributed to reduced light penetration (i.e., greater shading), and examined the impact of shade on smaller species by testing whether their abundance and richness were lower in plots with less light penetration. Light penetration in plots ranged from 0.3% to 72.4%. Significant effects were more common when analyses focused on small plants that reached reproduction (i.e., flowering rooted units); focusing on only flowering plants (i.e., excluding nonflowering rooted units) can clarify community patterns. Plots with a greater mean species height had significantly lower light penetration, and plots with lower light penetration had significantly lower flowering abundance and richness of small species. However, the impact of shade on the flowering abundance and richness of small species was relatively small (R-2 values between 8% and 15%) and depended on how we defined "small species." Synthesis: Our results confirm that light penetration in herbaceous vegetation can be comparable to levels seen in forests, that plots with taller species cast more shade, and that flowering smaller species are less abundant and diverse in plots where light penetration is low. However, variation in mean plot height explained less than 10% of variation in light penetration, and light penetration explained between 5 and 15% of variation in the flowering abundance and richness of small species. Coupled with the fact that flowering small species were present even within the most heavily shaded plots, our results suggest that any advantage in light competition by large species is limited. One explanation is that at least some small species in these communities are shade-tolerant. Shade tolerance in predominantly herbaceous communities, particularly among small plant species, requires further research.

AB Tree aboveground biomass (e.g., bole, branches, and foliage), M, plays key roles in forest management as it is the basis for evaluating the sink and flux of, for example, carbon and nitrogen, stand productivity, dendro-energy, litter & root biomass, hydrological parameters, among others. With the aim of further simplifying and understanding M, the central objective of this research was to review available techniques to develop, test, and validate two independent novel non-destructive, semi-empirical models using four major M datasets: (i) the shape dimensional bio-physical, M-SD; and (ii) the restrictive mathematical, M-NR, models. The proposed models advance and test how each of both approaches: (i) constant or (ii) variable scalar coefficients perform when predicting M with major assumptions bearing bio-physical principles. Results showed that M has to be predicted eventually with variable scalar coefficients; both models predicted compatible M figures; the evaluations matched the conventional equation well; and the independent data sets were well validated; the coefficients of determination, r(2), and the standard errors, Sx%, had values >96% and <20%, respectively, for most tested conifer tree species. In spite of demonstrating empirically and physically the ontogenetic-dependency of scalar coefficients, the M-NR model, with constant beta-scalar and variable a-intercept coefficients, performed slightly better, and precision appeared to be a function of the tree species growing in different forest ecosystems. Therefore, better parameterization advances for the testing and validation of the M-SD model that uses variable scalar coefficients, which are consistent with ontogenetic principles, are preliminarily recommended for M assessments. The updated revision of models, the independent development, the construction using different assumptions, the individual mathematical and bio-physical parameterization, the consistency on M assessments, and the bearing of physical and biological properties are key pieces of scientific information presented in this report are required in modern forest management when predicting M and associated variables and attributes.

AB Question The Cerrado is a global biodiversity hotspot, highly threatened by changes in land use. Alterations in species composition and the colonization of Cerrado grasslands by woody species can lead to long-term changes in these communities. In this study, we investigated changes over 20 years in three grassland areas, in terms of species richness and diversity and growth-form cover, as well as the effects of shrub and grass encroachment on species richness. Location Cerrado Brazilian savanna, moist grassland and dry shrub grassland. Areas under low and high anthropogenic pressure. Methods Plant species composition and cover were sampled on seven occasions between the years 2000 and 2020, in permanent line-transects. We compared plant cover, richness, diversity and growth-form cover between the periods for each area. Next, we developed mixed-effect linear models to test whether species richness in grasslands at the latest sampling event was altered by species representing 70% of the species cover at this time. Results Grasslands located in areas under higher anthropogenic pressure presented reduced richness and diversity, and cover concentrated on a few species of shrubs and large tussock grasses. Moist grassland undergoing encroachment by the native shrub Trembleya parviflora had lost over 50% of its diversity since encroachment. In the same area, a shrub grassland undergoing encroachment by native shrub Raulinoreitzia tremula, three native grass species and one exotic grass presented significantly reduced species richness. The moist grassland in an area under low anthropogenic pressure showed a reordering of the species cover over time, but a decrease in species richness. Conclusion We observed changes in plant richness, diversity, cover, composition and growth-form cover over a period of 20 years in grassland communities. We found, however, different trajectories in the three grassland areas sampled, mainly due to the encroachment of a few species, leading to floristic homogenization in grasslands located in areas under high anthropogenic pressure.

AB We investigated how different degrees of shading affected growth, morphology, and biomass allocation in seedlings from two coniferous and three broadleaved species. The experiment was conducted in a shade house over a 1-year period. Our results showed that under increasing shade, seedlings from most species exhibited lower total biomass, net assimilation rates, relative growth rates, root mass ratios, and root/shoot ratios. In contrast, the slenderness quotients, leaf area ratios, and specific leaf areas increased with increasing shade. For coniferous species, growth traits were relatively more plastic (responsive to shade) than morphology or biomass allocation traits, whereas for broadleaved species, growth and biomass allocation were the most shade-sensitive traits. When comparing coniferous versus broadleaved species, the former had a higher growth plasticity index and lower allocation plasticity than the latter. Root biomass and stem mass ratio were the most and least plastic traits in response to shading. Our results indicate that shade differentially affects coniferous and broadleaved species in terms of their growth, morphology, and biomass allocation. These findings have important implications for the establishment and maintenance of mixed-species stands.

AB Elevational gradients as well as habitat variability provide variation in environmental conditions enabling plants to alter their functional traits with respect to their surroundings on the way to sustain and better perform. Phenotypic plasticity has been suggested as one of the foremost mechanisms that invasive species implement to endure and invade wide geographical areas. The present study was performed to understand the leaf functioning and reproductive approaches adopted by the invasive weed Ageratina adenophora in response to different habitats of Kumaun Himalaya along elevational ranges. ANOVA showed significant effects of elevational ranges, habitats and their interactions on most of the investigated traits. A wide range in leaf area (367-1278 cm(2)/plant) and seed number (2803-12,240 seeds/plant) across the elevational zones indicated high plastic responses. Linear regression analysis revealed that the specific leaf area (r =-0.279; p < 0.05) and leaf area ratio (r =-0.255; p < 0.05) decreased significantly with increasing elevation. Reproductive traits like seed number (r =-0.284; p < 0.05) and reproductive index (r =-0.416; p < 0.05) also decreased significantly with increasing elevation. The results revealed that this species responds to heterogeneous environments via altering its leaf traits and reproductive performance. The large differences in trait values between habitats and elevations suggested a high degree of plasticity, which is leading to the successful encroachment and establishment of A. adenophora across an elevational gradient without undergoing adaptive evolution.

AB In this study, we used retrospective dendroclimatological analyses to explore whether El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and local precipitation patterns have an influence on tree growth in Suriname, a country located on the Guiana Shield, as annual precipitation patterns on the Guiana Shield are related to ENSO. Discs were taken from 20 trees of Cedrela odorata, whose stem forms very distinct annual growth rings, for tree ring analyses. The trees grew in unmanaged tropical wet forests of Suriname. The tree-ring series of individual trees started between 1836 and 1931 and extended over a period of 84-180 years. The 20 dated series were utilized for constructing a tree-ring chronology. Unlike many other studies that used local anomalies such as flood pulse, precipitation, and drought events to describe the influence of El Nino on tree growth, we used monthly precipitation and ENSO indices as predictors of tree growth to calculate response and correlation functions. The study observed that tree ring growth of Cedrela odorata is influenced by precipitation in August and June of the current year and in August of the previous year, as well as by the ENSO indices SSTA, TSA, TNA, and NAO. Systematic increases in the strength of the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection due to climate change could affect the growth of trees on the Guiana Shield.

AB Widespread plant species are expected to maintain genetic diversity and gene flow via pollen and seed dispersal. Stature is a key life history trait that affects seed and potentially pollen dispersal, with limited stature associated with limited dispersal and greater genetic differentiation. We sampled Hill's tabletop wattle (Acacia hilliana) and curry wattle (Acacia spondylophylla), two co-distributed, widespread, Acacia shrubs of low stature, across the arid Pilbara region of north-western Australia. Using chloroplast sequence and nuclear microsatellite data we evaluated patterns of population genetic and phylogeographic diversity and structure, demographic signals, ratios of pollen to seed dispersal, evidence for historical refugia, and association between elevation and diversity. Results showed strong phylogeographic (chloroplast, G(ST) = 0.831 and 0.898 for A. hilliana and A. spondylophylla, respectively) and contemporary (nuclear, F-ST = 0.260 and 0.349 for A. hilliana and A. spondylophylla, respectively) genetic structure in both species. This indicates limited genetic connectivity via seed and pollen dispersal associated with Acacia species of small stature compared to taller tree and shrub acacias across the Pilbara bioregion. This effect of stature on genetic structure is superimposed on moderate levels of genetic diversity that were expected based on widespread ranges (haplotype diversity h = 25 and 12; nuclear diversity He = 0.60 and 0.47 for A. hilliana and A. spondylophylla, respectively). Contemporary genetic structure was congruent at the greater landscape scale, especially in terms of strong genetic differentiation among geographically disjunct populations in less elevated areas. Measures of diversity and connectivity were associated with traits of greater geographic population proximity, population density, population size, and greater individual longevity, and some evidence for range expansion in A. hilliana. Results illustrate that low stature is associated with limited dispersal and greater patterns of genetic differentiation for congenerics in a common landscape and highlight the complex influence of taxon-specific life history and ecological traits to seed and pollen dispersal.

AB Rapid urbanization has widely induced fragmented landscapes and further negatively affected ecological functions. The edge effect is an approach commonly used to investigate these negative impacts. However, edge effect research tends to focus on the impacts that a certain landscape receives from its adjacent lands rather than to assess all the influences of the landscape edges in a region, even though the latter is critical for regional ecological planning. To fill in this gap, the concept of neighboring effect is raised and analyzed in this paper with a case study of Xintai City in Northern China. Results show that the neighboring effects are generally negative for ecological functions, especially in regions that experience rapid urbanization or heavy human activities. The U-shaped relationship between the neighboring effect of a patch and its distance to the nearest township center indicates that the border region of urban and built-up areas suffers the most negative influences due to the intense interactions between different land uses. The heterogeneous effects of influencing factors in urban and rural areas were revealed by the regression results. Socioeconomic development has more important influence on neighboring effects on ecological functions in rural areas than in urban areas, and local cadres' support of environmental protection matters only in rural areas for a less ecological functional loss. This study quantitatively examined the negative ecological effects of landscape fragmentation during rapid urbanization and calls for more attention to ecological planning at the local scale.

AB Determination of reclamation status of secondary forests is particularly urgent in human impacted landscapes for conservation of biodiversity and other ecosystem services. However, there is a lack of a quantitative method to estimate the recovery status of secondary forest globally. In the present work, the authors have attempted to estimate the recovery status of a dry secondary forest of Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India quantitatively with a nearby primary forest. We have formulated an equation (measure of climax stage) to estimate the secondary forest for its possible climax stage (early climax stage/mid climax stage/stable climax stage/non climax stage) based on species richness. For this study, the value of "measure of climax stage " between 0 and 0.2 is considered as stable climax stage, 0.2-0.6 as mid climax stage and 0.6-1 as early climax stage. On the other hand, the value > 1 was considered as a non-climax stage of the forest. Accordingly, the studied secondary forest was estimated as to be in mid climax stage (measure of climax stage = 0.4230) even after c. 25 years of successional stage. We have also estimated the recovery stage of a secondary dry forest in SBR by fitting it with a suitable equation and found that the time frame for the stable climax stage is more than 50 years. ANOVA analysis indicates that there is no significant difference observed in the case of soil nutrient contents (except Electrical Conductivity) between primary and secondary forest sites. This developed equation may be implicated in the evaluation of reclamation status of secondary and degraded forest lands globally. Further, in-depth study is encouraged for the development of a modern climax concept to understand the ecological restoration process in a better way.

AB The Dagestan Mountain (DM) cattle breed was established to provide cheese and milk products to mountain dwellers in the specific conditions of the Republic of Dagestan in Southern Russia. Only 650 head of DM cattle were registered in 2020, and their "breed purity" is questionable. We aimed to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of modern DM cattle using short tandem repeat (STR) markers. The sample included 150 animals collected from private owners in Dagestan during a scientific expedition (n = 32) and provided by a gene pool farm (n = 118). An additional 166 samples from other cattle breeds distributed in the breeding zone of DM cattle were used as the comparison groups. The genotypes for the 11 STR loci recommended by ISAG were obtained using a genetic analyzer. We identified a high level of genetic diversity as revealed by allelic richness calculations (Ar = 6.82 vs. 4.38-5.82 in other cattle breeds) and observed heterozygosity indices (uHe = 0.76 vs. 0.65-0.72). Based on the STRUCTURE results, animals with low levels of admixture with other breeds were found within the DM cattle, which can be considered as candidates for use in germplasm conservation programs.

AB Identifying the mechanisms that underlie the assembly of plant communities is critical to the conservation of terrestrial biodiversity. However, it is seldom measured or quantified how much deterministic versus stochastic processes contribute to community assembly in alpine meadows. Here, we measured the decay in community similarity with spatial and environmental distance in the Zoige Plateau. Furthermore, we used redundancy analysis (RDA) to divide the variations in the relative abundance of plant families into four components to assess the effects of environmental and spatial. Species assemblage similarity liner declined with geographical distance (p < .001, R-2 = .6388), and it decreased significantly with increasing distance of total phosphorus (TP), alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), available potassium (AK), nitrate nitrogen (NO3+-N), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N). Environmental and spatial variables jointly explained a large proportion (55.2%) of the variation in the relative abundance of plant families. Environmental variables accounted for 13.1% of the total variation, whereas spatial variables accounted for 11.4%, perhaps due to the pronounced abiotic gradients in the alpine areas. Our study highlights the mechanism of plant community assembly in the alpine ecosystem, where environmental filtering plays a more important role than dispersal limitation. In addition, a reasonably controlled abundance of Compositae (the family with the highest niche breadth and large niche overlap value with Gramineae and Cyperaceae) was expected to maintain sustainable development in pastoral production. These results suggest that management measures should be developed with the goal of improving or maintaining suitable local environmental conditions.

AB Little is known about the competition between and niche differentiation of water and nutrients between angiosperm and gymnosperm tree species under prolonged drought stress, especially in fragile environments. We imposed 21 d drought and competition treatments on Broussonetia papyrifera and Platycladus orientalis and measured water, N, and P contents, the isotopic composition of N and C, the activity of P assimilation enzymes, and stomatal conductance under solo planting and mixed planting to characterize resource diversity and competition in response to treatments. The N content, delta C-13, delta N-15, phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, g(s), and foliage water content were significantly affected by the soil water content. The delta N-15 content in young leaves showed that N competition between these two plants could be alleviated through niche differentiation, but the changes in the PDE: PME ratio for these two plants indicated that they lost the niche differentiation of the P source under drought stress. Additionally, it was observed that foliage water content, WUE, N contents, and N and P sources were significantly affected by interspecific competition, and Broussonetia papyrifera benefited from water competition under moderate drought. Our results indicate that plants have different competition and niche differentiation modes to different nutrients under drought stress, and the effect of interspecific water competition should be seriously considered in mixed forests in semiarid areas.

AB We study the probability of fixation in a stochastic two-species competition model. By identifying a naturally occurring fast timescale, we derive an approximation to the associated backward Kolmogorov equation that allows us to obtain an explicit closed form solution for the probability of fixation of either species. We use our result to study fitness tradeoff strategies and show that, despite some tradeoffs having nearly negligible effects on the corresponding deterministic dynamics, they can have large implications for the outcome of the stochastic system.

AB In some karst mountainous areas, with the urban expansion driven by rapid urbanization, a large number of natural mountains that were not suitable for development and construction were embedded into the urban built environment, forming urban remnant mountains(URMs). In this study, we conducted a indicator system to explore the relationship between morphological characteristics of URM and its plant species diversity. The results showed that: (i) The two boundary plane morphological indicators of URMs were significantly associated with its plant species alpha and beta diversity; among the overall morphological indicators, mountain form factor (MFF) was significantly associated with plant species alpha and beta diversity, mountain size coefficient (MSC) was negatively related to Margalef (R) index, and mountain volume density (MVD) had no significant relationship with plant diversity. Additionally, surface morphological indicators were significantly negatively correlated with the Pielou (Jgi) index, and positively correlated with Jaccard (Cj) and Sorenson (Cs) indices. (ii) There were also differences in the influence of morphological characteristic indicators of URMs on the plant species diversity of its different slope position and slope direction. Mountain shape index (MSI), mountain fractal dimension (MFD) and MFF had significant influence on plant species alpha and beta diversity indices of different slope position and slope direction; All surface indicators of URMs morphological characteristics were significantly associated with plant species alpha and beta diversity indices on the southern slope of URMs. (iii) The effects of URMs morphological indicators on plant diversity of different life forms were different, and the influence of herb plant diversity was more significant. (iiii) The multiple regression analysis showed that the URM morphological characteristic indicators could explain the difference of plant species alpha diversity among different URMs, while the interpretation of plant species beta diversity among URMs was poor. In general, the three-dimensional characteristics of the URM are complex and particularity, and the quantitative indicators of different dimensions all showed the impact on the plant species diversity of the URMs. This study demonstrated that the ecological processes of the URM habitats have more complex patch effects in response to interference as compared to the general remnant habitat.

AB Conceptual gaps and imprecise terms and definitions may obscure the breadth of plant-animal dispersal relationships involved in directed dispersal. The term 'directed' indicates predictable delivery to favourable microsites. However, directed dispersal was initially considered uncommon in diffuse mutualisms (i.e. those involving many species), partly because plants rarely influence post-removal propagule fate without specialized adaptations. This rationale implies that donor plants play an active role in directed dispersal by manipulating vector behaviour after propagule removal. However, even in most classic examples of directed dispersal, participating plants do not influence animal behaviour after propagule removal. Instead, such plants may take advantage of vector attraction to favourable plant microsites, indicating a need to expand upon current interpretations of directed dispersal. We contend that directed dispersal can emerge whenever propagules are disproportionately delivered to favourable microsites as a result of predictably skewed vector behaviour. Thus, we propose distinguishing active and passive forms of directed dispersal. In active directed dispersal, the donor plant achieves disproportionate arrival to favourable microsites by influencing vector behaviour after propagule removal. By contrast, passive directed dispersal occurs when the donor plant takes advantage of vector behaviour to arrive at favourable microsites. Whereas predictable post-removal vector behaviour is dictated by characteristics of the donor plant in active directed dispersal, characteristics of the destination dictate predictable post-removal vector behaviour in passive directed dispersal. Importantly, this passive form of directed dispersal may emerge in more plant-animal dispersal relationships because specialized adaptations in donor plants that influence post-removal vector behaviour are not required. We explore the occurrence and consequences of passive directed dispersal using the unifying generalized gravity model of dispersal. This model successfully describes vectored dispersal by incorporating the influence of the environment (i.e. attractiveness of microsites) on vector movement. When applying gravity models to dispersal, the three components of Newton's gravity equation (i.e. gravitational force, object mass, and distance between centres of mass) become analogous to propagules moving towards a location based on characteristics of the donor plant, the destination, and relocation processes. The generalized gravity model predicts passive directed dispersal in plant-animal dispersal relationships when (i) animal vectors are predictably attracted to specific destinations, (ii) animal vectors disproportionately disperse propagules to those destinations, and (iii) those destinations are also favourable microsites for the dispersed plants. Our literature search produced evidence for these three conditions broadly, and we identified 13 distinct scenarios where passive directed dispersal likely occurs because vector behaviour is predictably skewed towards favourable microsites. We discuss the wide applicability of passive directed dispersal to plant-animal mutualisms and provide new insights into the vulnerability of those mutualisms to global change.

AB Tropical forests worldwide have succumbed to rapid conversion into agricultural landscapes, but the local- and landscape-scale drivers of functional diversity and consequently ecosystem functioning remain poorly known, which limits management and conservation strategies. Here, we quantitatively assess how biofuel croplands affect taxonomic and functional diversity as well as trait-composition of dung beetle assemblages in a hyper-fragmented landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest dominated by sugarcane plantations. We also examine to what extent changes in patch attributes (patch scale forest loss), landscape composition (landscape scale forest loss) and landscape configuration (degree of fragmentation and forest edge density), induced by the establishment of sugarcane plantations, affect the functional reorganization of dung beetle assemblages. We estimated taxonomic and functional diversity (functional richness, evenness and redundancy) of dung beetle assemblages at 50 sampling sites across a sugarcane dominated hyper-fragmented landscape. In general, sugarcane plantations showed lower functional diversity than forest sites. Large-bodied coprophagous tunnelers were dominant across all forest sites, while small-bodied generalist-rollers were more abundant in sugarcane plantations. Functional evenness and dispersion were negatively affected by landscape composition, while landscape configuration and forest loss played a minor role. Our findings indicate that changes at both the patch and landscape scales induced by the establishment of sugarcane plantations exert strong impacts on the taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles. Implications for insect conservation These shifts in functional diversity can disrupt ecological functions served by these insects which, in turn, can accelerate the collapse of ecosystem functioning across tropical landscapes immersed in sugarcane plantations.

AB Background The tradeoff between negative and positive interactions of facilitated species and facilitators may depend on the degree of resource availability in agroecosystems. However, the rhizospheric mechanisms driving trade-offs that occur along phosphorus (P) and water availability gradients have not yet been systematically clarified. We established three types of root isolation conditions (no barrier, nylon barrier and solid barrier) at different P and water addition levels to address the above issue in a maize-grass pea intercropping system. Results The total yield and biomass net effect (NE) and the relative interaction index (RII) were significantly higher than 0 under all environmental conditions, demonstrating that plant-plant interactions generated positive effects in the intercropping system. The maize yield and biomass RII were 0.029-0.095 and 0.018-0.066, respectively, which indicated that maize growth was constantly facilitated. However, the RII for grass pea yield and biomass exhibited a different trend in comparison with maize. It was higher than 0 (as the facilitated species) under low soil P and moisture conditions and transitioned to values lower than 0 (facilitator species) under high P and moisture conditions, which showed that the type and intensity of plant-plant interactions steadily shifted with the applied stressors. Direct interactions decreased the maize rhizospheric soil pH by 1.5% and 1.9% under Low-P conditions. Notably, the rhizospheric soil acid and alkaline phosphatase secretions of maize and grass pea increased by 17.4-27.4% and 15.3-27.7%, respectively, in P-deficient soils. These results show that plant-plant interactions can effectively relieve P stress by mineralizing organophosphorus in P-deficient soils. Furthermore, the above tendency became more pronounced under drought-stressed conditions. The nylon barrier partially restricted the exchange and utilization of available nutrients and decreased the total yield and biomass by 1.8-7.8% and 1.1-7.8%, respectively. The presence of a solid barrier completely restricted interspecific rhizospheric interactions and decreased the total yield and biomass by 2.1-13.8% and 1.6-15.7%, respectively. Phytate and KH2PO4 addition intensified asymmetric interspecific competition, and grass pea was consistently subjected to competitive pressures. Conclusion Briefly, the tradeoff between facilitation and competition was driven by rhizospheric interactions, and the transition in the intensity and type of interaction was highly dependent on resource availability in a biologically diverse system.

AB Marine microbial communities are extremely complex and diverse. The number of locally coexisting species often vastly exceeds the number of identifiable niches, and taxonomic composition often appears decoupled from local environmental conditions. This is contrary to the view that environmental conditions should select for a few locally well-adapted species. Here we use an individual-based eco-evolutionary model to show that virtually unlimited taxonomic diversity can be supported in highly evolving assemblages, even in the absence of niche separation. With a steady stream of heritable changes to phenotype, competitive exclusion may be weakened, allowing sustained coexistence of nearly neutral phenotypes with highly divergent lineages. This behaviour is robust even to abrupt environmental perturbations that might be expected to cause strong selection pressure and an associated loss of diversity. We, therefore, suggest that rapid evolution and individual-level variability are key drivers of species coexistence and maintenance of microbial biodiversity.

AB This systematic review analysed scientific publications to identify relevant research about the impact of alien polychaete species around the world, using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) guide. The criterion for inclusion was studies published in English, with the key terms (e.g. 'impact', 'alien species', 'polychaetes') in the title, abstract and keywords. The literature search was conducted in Scopus and Web of Science from April to December 2020. The search resulted in 150 papers that included information about impact of alien polychaete species. Of these studies, 98% were published in the last 25 years, reporting on the impact of 40 species in 18 regions of the world. Sixty-one per cent of the research was conducted in the Baltic Sea, South-west Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. The most frequent type of study was field surveys (46%) and the most studied system was open coast areas (36%). The species with the highest number of publications about their impacts were Ficopomatus enigmaticus, Marenzelleria viridis, Sabella spallanzanii and Boccardia proboscidea. Based on evidence of their most severe documented impacts in their introduced ranges, the impact mechanisms (IMos) of the alien polychaete species were strongly related to their biology and lifestyles. We found that species that build conspicuous reefs and tube-dwellers mainly showed physical and structural impact on ecosystems; shell-borers, mainly parasitism and infauna species, showed mainly chemical, physical and structural impacts on ecosystems. Some recommendations for the study of alien polychaete species are discussed.

AB Understanding the effects of island shape and dispersal limitation on species assemblages is important for the conservation of bryophytes in fragmented landscapes. In order to explore the comparative contributions of dispersal limitation vs environmental filtering, island shape vs other island attributes to bryophyte species assemblages in fragmented landscapes, we investigated bryophyte flora and environmental variables (island shape, area, elevation, and isolation degree) of 71 islands in the Zhoushan Archipelago in the East China Sea. We used redundancy analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and generalized linear mixed models to explore comparative contributions of dispersal limitation vs environmental filtering, shape vs other explanatory variables to bryophyte species composition and species richness. Dispersal limitation independently accounted for 15% of the total variation in species composition, which was higher than environmental filtering (6.6%). When island shape was the only constraining explanatory variable, it explained 22.5% of the total species richness variation. Variance partitioning showed that island shape per se explained 3.8% of the total variation in species richness and 18.7% of the variation was confounded by island shape and other variables. Island shape combined with area and elevation was a good predictor of bryophyte species richness, independently explaining 40% of the total SR variation. Among twenty tested bryophyte categories, eighteen categories had positive relationships of their species richness with island shape irregularity, their species richness linearly increasing with island shape irregularity to varying extents. Island shape irregularity exerted a stronger effect on the species richness of acrocarpous mosses than that of pleurocarpous mosses. Therefore, dispersal limitation exerted significant effects on bryophyte species assemblages, and island shape imposed a significant and taxon-specific effect on bryophyte species richness. Our findings implied that a forest reserve with a high irregular shape is favourable for bryophyte conservation.

AB The collective construction of environmental management and natural resource conservation strategies can empower and reduce marginalized communities' material and political dependence. Local participation is key to the success of these strategies. This research applies connectivity and hydrological efficiency analyses to support local water capture and soil restoration strategies in four marginalized indigenous communities in the tropical region of Mexico. We used the connectivity index (IC) and lateral hydrological efficiency index (LHEI) to identify plots where the configuration of landscape elements favors water and sediment transfer and priority areas for intervention. We analyzed 39 water capture and soil restoration infrastructures through satellite imagery to determine the water persistence (WP) and used correlation analysis and regression trees to identify significant correlations between WP and IC/LHEI values. The data were shared with local actors through participatory workshops, and we identified 11 intervention points with similar IC/LHEI characteristics in collaboration with community residents. This approach highlighted the utility of hydrological connectivity analysis to strengthen decision-making focused on food production systems and ecosystem restoration.

AB Background Deep-sea mussels in the subfamily Bathymodiolinae have unique adaptations to colonize hydrothermal-vent and cold-seep environments throughout the world ocean. These invertebrates function as important ecosystem engineers, creating heterogeneous habitat and promoting biodiversity in the deep sea. Despite their ecological significance, efforts to assess the diversity and connectivity of this group are extremely limited. Here, we present the first genomic-scale diversity assessments of the recently discovered bathymodioline cold-seep communities along the U.S. Atlantic margin, dominated by Gigantidas childressi and Bathymodiolus heckerae. Results A Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RADSeq) approach was used on 177 bathymodiolines to examine genetic diversity and population structure within and between seep sites. Assessments of genetic differentiation using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data revealed high gene flow among sites, with the shallower and more northern sites serving as source populations for deeper occurring G. childressi. No evidence was found for genetic diversification across depth in G. childressi, likely due to their high dispersal capabilities. Kinship analyses indicated a high degree of relatedness among individuals, and at least 10-20% of local recruits within a particular site. We also discovered candidate adaptive loci in G. childressi and B. heckerae that suggest differences in developmental processes and depth-related and metabolic adaptations to chemosynthetic environments. Conclusions These results highlight putative source communities for an important ecosystem engineer in the deep sea that may be considered in future conservation efforts. Our results also provide clues into species-specific adaptations that enable survival and potential speciation within chemosynthetic ecosystems.

AB Development and implementation of effective protected area management to reduce deforestation depend in part on identifying factors contributing to forest loss and areas at risk of conversion, but standard land-use-change modeling may not fully capture contextual factors that are not easily quantified. To better understand deforestation and agricultural expansion in Amazonian protected areas, we combined quantitative land-use-change modeling with qualitative discourse analysis in a case study of Brazil's Jamanxim National Forest. We modeled land-use change from 2008 to 2018 and projected deforestation through 2028. We used variables identified in a review of studies that modeled land-use change in the Amazon (e.g., variables related to agricultural suitability and economic accessibility) and from a critical discourse analysis that examined documents produced by different actors (e.g., government agencies and conservation nonprofit organizations) at various spatial scales. As measured by analysis of variance, McFadden's adjusted pseudo R-2, and quantity and allocation disagreement, we found that including variables in the model identified as important to deforestation dynamics through the qualitative discourse analysis (e.g., the proportion of unallocated public land, distance to proposed infrastructure developments, and density of recent fires) alongside more traditional variables (e.g., elevation, distance to roads, and protection status) improved the predictive ability of these models. Models that included discourse analysis variables and traditional variables explained up to 19.3% more of the observed variation in deforestation probability than a model that included only traditional variables and 4.1% more variation than a model with only discourse analysis variables. Our approach of integrating qualitative and quantitative methods in land-use-change modeling provides a framework for future interdisciplinary work in land-use change.

AB Understanding how environmental filtering and biotic interactions structure communities across elevational and latitudinal gradients is still a matter of debate. To provide insight into their relative importance, we explore the mismatch between three dimensions of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic), and compare their patterns to null models of random community assembly. We focus on a highly diverse tropical group: the tree frogs (hylids) of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. For that, we combined geographic distribution data with phylogenetic and trait information for 158 species to produce maps of the three dimensions of diversity. We show that communities of tree frogs of the Hylidae family tend to have high functional richness along the Atlantic Forest, potentially driven by niche partitioning. However, environmental filtering gains importance in extreme environments, both at high elevations and higher latitudes. In these areas of the forest, clustering of both functional and phylogenetic diversity is observed. Trait overdispersion is found in areas of contact between vegetation types, or of adjacent biomes, reflecting the encounter of amphibian species adapted to distinct environmental conditions and landscape configurations. Considering all three dimensions of diversity along with multiple axes of environmental variation allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the processes shaping amphibian community assembly in this biodiversity hotspot.

AB This study examines global zoogeographic patterns of estuary-associated fishes using meta-assemblages compiled at the marine ecoregion scale. The classification of biogeographic regions based on estuary-associated fish species is assessed in relation to marine and freshwater zoogeographic patterns. Historical (palaeobiogeographic) and contemporary environmental factors that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of these regions are also discussed. Global patterns in estuary-associated fish species richness demonstrated that tropical ecoregions are more diverse and richer in species than temperate ecoregions; the tropical Indo-Pacific and the tropical western Atlantic were two major centres of high global species richness. Multivariate analyses identified several ecoregion groupings that broadly corresponded with both freshwater and marine biogeographic regions. These groupings could also be related to global marine palaeobiogeographic processes such as the closure of the Tethys Sea linkage during the Cenozoic as well as contemporary factors such ocean currents, upwelling areas and climatic factors, particularly rainfall and runoff.

AB Background Shifting cultivation is a major agriculture practice in the Nagaland state of India. This study examines the effect of shifting cultivation and the length of the fallow period on soil quality index (SQI). Four sites were selected for the study, viz., a shifting cultivation site (SCS), a 3-year-old fallow land (FL-3), a 7-year-old fallow land (FL-7), and a 12-year-old fallow land (FL-12). Soil parameters were recorded seasonally and SQI was calculated from the minimum data set. Results With the increase in the fallow period, the values of conductivity, soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, moisture, clay, and cation exchange capacity of soil increased. Meanwhile, soil pH and bulk density decreased with fallow duration. The additive SQI(a) values were in the order SCS < FL-3 < FL-12 < FL-7; meanwhile, the weighted SQI(w) values were in the order SCS < FL-3 < FL-7 < FL-12. It is also observed that the SQI value decreases with the increase in soil depth under both the weighted and additive indexes. SCS with the lowest SQI value reflects the reduced soil organic carbon (SOC) and macronutrients. Increased SOC levels in site FL-12 (2.88-3.94%) may be one reason for its higher SQI value. Conclusions Our study highlights that unsustainable practices of shifting cultivation and reduction in the fallow period negatively affect soil quality. Furthermore, the study also recommends the use of the weighted method of SQI as it agrees with the reports of land use causing alteration in the soil quality. Our findings may be utilized to quickly access and disseminate information to the stakeholders and aid in constructing local soil quality index maps of the region. There is an urgent need for a rapid, cost and resource-efficient soil quality assessment and SQI may be one tool that achieves this goal.

AB A better understanding of long-term effects of climate and historical anthropogenic changes is needed to define effective conservation measures of endangered forest inhabiting managed landscapes. Diversification and distribution of Mediterranean firs are attributed to the global climate change during the Miocene and Quaternary as well as to the effects of human-driven deforestation. We evaluated the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities in shaping the genetic diversity and structure of Abies pinsapo Boiss. (Pinaceae), a relict fir endemic from SW Spain. We genotyped a total of 440 individuals from 44 populations by using two different molecular markers (cpSSRs and nSSRs). Overall, low genetic structure was found; however, incipient differentiation appeared within mountain ranges. Analyses suggest that the effects of isolation by distance and lithological or topographical diversity were not enough to structure the populations of the different mountain ranges. The combined role of genetic drift in the small populations and the anthropogenic action associated with forest management has shaped the current genetic pattern of this fir species in the study area. Demographic inference analyses pointed to a very recent synchronic divergence (eleventh-sixteenth century) of the ancestral A. pinsapo population into its current scattered distribution range. Although population bottlenecks were supported by several analyses, the conservation of this endangered species seems not to be limited by lacking genetic diversity, while threats of current climate change and habitat loss must be regarded.

AB Species are often arranged along a continuum from "specialists" to "generalists". Specialists typically use fewer resources, occur in more patchily distributed habitats and have overall smaller population sizes than generalists. Accordingly, the specialist-generalist variation hypothesis (SGVH) proposes that populations of habitat specialists have lower genetic diversity and are genetically more differentiated due to reduced gene flow compared to populations of generalists. Here, expectations of the SGVH were tested by examining genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure and contemporary gene flow in two sympatric woodpecker species differing in habitat specialization. Compared to the generalist great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), lower genetic diversity was found in the specialist middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocoptes medius). Evidence for recent bottlenecks was revealed in some populations of the middle spotted woodpecker, but in none of the great spotted woodpecker. Substantial spatial genetic structure and a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances were found in the middle spotted woodpecker, but only weak spatial genetic structure and no significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances in the great spotted woodpecker. Finally, estimated levels of contemporary gene flow did not differ between the two species. Results are consistent with all but one expectations of the SGVH. This study adds to the relatively few investigations addressing the SGVH in terrestrial vertebrates.

AB Differences in disease susceptibility among species can result from rapid host-pathogen coevolution and differences in host species ecology that affect the strength and direction of natural selection. Among 2 sympatric pinniped species that differ in sociality and putative disease exposure, we investigate observed differences in susceptibility through an analysis of a highly variable, duplicated gene family involved in the vertebrate immune response. Using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we characterize diversity at the 2 exons that encode the peptide binding region of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) gene in harbor (N = 60) and gray (N = 90) seal populations from the Northwest Atlantic. Across species, we identified 106 full-length exon 2 and 103 exon 3 sequence variants and a minimum of 11 duplicated MHC-I loci. The sequence variants clustered in 15 supertypes defined by the physiochemical properties of the peptide binding region, including a putatively novel Northwest Atlantic MHC-I diversity sublineage. Trans-species polymorphisms, dN/dS ratios, and evidence of gene conversion among supertypes are consistent with balancing selection acting on this gene. High functional redundancy suggests particularly strong selection among gray seals at the novel Northwest Atlantic MHC-I diversity sublineage. At exon 2, harbor seals had a significantly greater number of variants per individual than gray seals, but fewer supertypes. Supertype richness and private supertypes are hypothesized to contribute to observed differences in disease resistance between species, as consistently, across the North Atlantic and many disease outbreaks, gray seals appear to be more resistant to respiratory viruses than harbor seals.

AB The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are among the best candidates for studying adaptive variation driven often by pathogen-mediated selection. However, diversity of these genes might be differently shaped by selective and non-selective evolutionary mechanisms. In this study, we assessed the spatial distribution of MHC class II DRB exon 2 gene diversity in hares from Tunisia (Lepus capensis) across a steep ecological gradient and tried to disentangle the driving mechanisms shaping the observed diversity. We also compared the current data with previous results from the MHC class II DQA and DQB loci of the same individuals. We found a relatively high level of diversity and spatial differentiation similar to that observed earlier for DQA and DQB. We also detected clear evidence of positive selection acting on the DRB gene. Nevertheless, recombination was considered as a more important process shaping the evolution of the DRB locus. Our information theory-based models revealed statistically meaningful climate effects on the occurrence of some alleles (i.e., protein variants), regardless of their geographical distribution patterns, supposedly reflecting adaptation to spatial pathogen variation.

AB Lianas are increasing in abundance in many tropical forests. This increase can alter forest structure and decrease both carbon storage and tree diversity via antagonistic relationships between lianas and their host trees. Climate change is postulated as an underlying driver of increasing liana abundances, via increases in dry-season length, forest-disturbance events, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations; all factors thought to favour lianas. However, the impact of climate change on liana reproductive phenology, an underlying determinant of liana abundance, has been little studied, particularly outside of Neotropical forests. Over a 15-year period (2000-2014), we examined the phenological patterns of a liana community in intact rainforests of the Wet Tropics bioregion of Australia; a World Heritage Area and hotspot of floral diversity. Specifically, we assessed (1) flowering and fruiting patterns of liana species; (2) potential climate drivers of flowering and fruiting activity; and (3) the influence of El Nino-related climatic disturbances on liana phenology. We found that flowering and fruiting of the studied liana species increased over time. Liana reproduction, moreover, rose in apparent response to higher temperatures and reduced rainfall. Finally, we found flowering and fruiting of the liana species increased following El Nino events. These results suggest that liana reproduction and abundance are likely to increase under predicted future climate regimes, with potentially important impacts on the survival, growth, and reproduction of resident trees and thus the overall health of Australian tropical rainforests.

AB Phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate salts) can constitute a large fraction of the organic P in soils. As a more recalcitrant form of soil organic P, up to 51 million metric tons of phytate accumulate in soils annually, corresponding to similar to 65% of the P fertilizer application. However, the availability of phytate is limited due to its strong binding to soils via its highly-phosphorylated inositol structure, with sorption capacity being similar to 4 times that of orthophosphate in soils. Phosphorus (P) is one of the most limiting macronutrients for agricultural productivity. Given that phosphate rock is a finite resource, coupled with the increasing difficulty in its extraction and geopolitical fragility in supply, it is anticipated that both economic and environmental costs of P fertilizer will greatly increase. Therefore, optimizing the use of soil phytate-P can potentially enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture production. To increase phytate-P availability in the rhizosphere, plants and microbes have developed strategies to improve phytate solubility and mineralization by secreting mobilizing agents including organic acids and hydrolyzing enzymes including various phytases. Though we have some understanding of phytate availability and phytase activity in soils, the limiting steps for phytate-P acquisition by plants proposed two decades ago remain elusive. Besides, the relative contribution of plant- and microbe-derived phytases, including those from mycorrhizas, in improving phytate-P utilization is poorly understood. Hence, it is important to understand the processes that influence phytate-P acquisition by plants, thereby developing effective molecular biotechnologies to enhance the dynamics of phytate in soil. However, from a practical view, phytate-P acquisition by plants competes with soil P fixation, so the ability of plants to access stable phytate must be evaluated from both a plant and soil perspective. Here, we summarize information on phytate availability in soils and phytate-P acquisition by plants. In addition, agronomic approaches and biotechnological strategies to improve soil phytate-P utilization by plants are discussed, and questions that need further investigation are raised. The information helps to better improve phytate-P utilization by plants, thereby reducing P resource inputs and pollution risks to the wider environment.

AB Interpretations of values of the F-ST measure of genetic differentiation rely on an understanding of its mathematical constraints. Previously, it has been shown that F-ST values computed from a biallelic locus in a set of multiple populations and F-ST values computed from a multiallelic locus in a pair of populations are mathematically constrained as a function of the frequency of the allele that is most frequent across populations. We generalize from these cases to report here the mathematical constraint on F-ST given the frequency M of the most frequent allele at a multiallelic locus in a set of multiple populations. Using coalescent simulations of an island model of migration with an infinitely-many-alleles mutation model, we argue that the joint distribution of F-ST and M helps in disentangling the separate influences of mutation and migration on F-ST. Finally, we show that our results explain a puzzling pattern of microsatellite differentiation: the lower F-ST in an interspecific comparison between humans and chimpanzees than in the comparison of chimpanzee populations. We discuss the implications of our results for the use of F-ST.This article is part of the theme issue 'Celebrating 50 years since Lewontin's apportionment of human diversity'.

AB 'The apportionment of human diversity' (1972) is the most highly cited research article published by geneticist Richard Lewontin in his career. This study's primary result-that most genetic diversity in humans can be accounted for by within-population differences, not between-population differences-along with Lewontin's outspoken, politically charged interpretations thereof, has become foundational to the scientific and cultural discourse pertaining to human genetic variation. The article has an unusual bibliometric trajectory in that it is much more salient in the bibliographic record today compared to the first 20 years after its publication. Here, we highlight four factors that may have played a role in shaping the paper's fame: (i) citations in influential publications across several disciplines; (ii) Lewontin's own popular books and media appearances; (iii) the renaissance of population genetics research of the early 1990s; and (iv) the serendipitous collision of scientific progress, influential books and papers, and heated controversies around the year 1994. We conclude with an analysis of Twitter data to characterize the communities and conversations that continue to keep this study at the centre of discussions about race and genetics, prompting new challenges for scientists who have inherited Lewontin's legacy.This article is part of the theme issue 'Celebrating 50 years since Lewontin's apportionment of human diversity'.

AB Although the typical interaction between non-native invasive species and native species is considered to be negative, in some cases, non-native species may facilitate native species. Zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) are aggressive invaders in freshwater systems, and they can alter energy flow by diverting nutrients from pelagic to benthic food-webs. In the last two decades, quagga mussels have largely replaced zebra mussels in shallow regions of the Laurentian Great Lakes and colonized deeper waters previously devoid of all dreissenids. Here, we aim to characterize potential positive effects of dreissenids in relation to depth on the benthic community in lakes Michigan and Huron. For this study, we used benthic survey data collected from Lake Michigan in 2015 and Lake Huron in 2017 and annual U.S. EPA Great Lakes National Program Office Long-term Biology Monitoring Program data for both lakes from 1998 to 2019. Benthic species richness and abundance (excluding dreissenids) in both lakes were almost threefold higher in the nearshore (<70 m) compared to offshore (>70 m) communities. We found that, even though abundance of benthic invertebrates decreased with increased depth, total benthos density and biomass were higher in the presence than in the absence of quagga mussels in both lakes. Moreover, increased quagga mussel density and biomass with depth offset the lower benthos density and biomass at deeper depths, and samples with dreissenids had high densities of oligochaetes in both nearshore and offshore communities. These patterns are consistent with facilitative effects of quagga mussels on both shallow and deep-water benthic communities.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

ID HYBRIDIZATION; ORIGIN
AB Nuphar sagittifolia (Nymphaeaceae), Cape Fear spatterdock, is an aquatic macrophyte endemic to the Atlantic Coastal Plain and of conservation concern in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia in the United States. The existence of populations of unclear taxonomic identity has precluded assessment of the number of populations, distribution, and conservation needs of N. sagittifolia. The circumscription of the species was re-assessed using morphological and genetic analyses. Approximately 30 individuals from each of 21 populations of Nuphar across the N. sagittifolia range were included in genetic and morphological analyses, along with the type populations for three taxa. Genetic diversity was assessed by genotyping individuals across 26 SNP loci identified for this study, and morphological variation was assessed through measurement of 31 leaf, flower, and fruit characters. STRUCTURE analysis identified three genetic groups with corresponding morpho-logical differences in the N. sagittifolia range: N. sagittifolia, N. advena subsp. advena, and a third group in the Chowan-Roanoke River drainage that requires further study. A revised key based on Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Bayesian analyses identifies N. sagittifolia based on a leaf sinus-to-leaf length ratio <0.22, leaves not emergent, and leaf length-to-width ratio usually greater than 2.4. Genetic analyses within the N. sagittifolia group as indicated by the revised key indicated relatively low clonality, low gene flow, and low allelic differentiation among populations. Observed heterozygosity was higher than expected heterozygosity in all populations, an observation consistent with a combination of limited clonal reproduction and sexual reproduction resulting in long-lived genets.

AB Mimicry has long been a focus of research, but little is known about how and why many species of bird incorporate imitations of heterospecific sounds into their vocal displays. Crucial to understanding mimetic song is determining what sounds are mimicked and in what contexts such mimicry is produced. The superb lyrebird, Menura novaehollandiae, is a large oscine passerine with a lek-like mating system. Both sexes are accurate and versatile vocal mimics of the vocalizations of other species, but little is known about how males deploy their repertoire of mimicked sounds across contexts. Using extended focal watches, we recorded adult males displaying during the breeding season. We found that males mimicked heterospecific songs and nonalarm calls during 'recital' displays usually performed while they were perched and visually inconspicuous. In contrast, during visually conspicuous 'dance' displays, commonly performed on display mounds, males only mimicked heterospecific alarm calls. While much rarer than recital displays, dance displays were associated with the final stages of mate choice preceding copulation. These results provide the first evidence of any species varying its repertoire of mimicked sounds with different sexual contexts. Previous work suggests that mimicry in dance displays functions deceptively to manipulate the antipredator responses of females during the final stages of courtship. However, the structure and context of recital mimicry closely resembles the sexual advertisement song performed by nonmimicking songbirds. Given the importance of mimicry in the acoustic ecology of lyrebirds, our results suggest that with recital song males advertise the quality of their mimicry as it likely benefits both male and female offspring. Our finding that male superb lyrebirds mimic functionally distinct heterospecific vocalizations during different modes of courtship suggests that the evolution and maintenance of avian vocal displays are more complex than previously thought.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We assessed the understory vegetation types in temperate Kashmir Himalayan coniferous forests, their species composition and what function ecological drivers execute in shaping compositional trends using a multivariate statistical approach. The agglomerative clustering analysis depicted eight discrete plant associations in terms of herb species composition with simple underlying indicator species and ecological drivers. At one extreme, we found alpine and subalpine areas (Tanacetum multicaule Sch.Bip. - Aconitum heterophyllum Wall. ex Royle - Lomatogonium caeruleum (Royle) Harry Sm. ex B.L. Burtt community (TAL)) occupying high elevations (2961.88 +/- 205.56 m) with notable species richness (6.04), while lower (2459.36 +/- 94.07 m) areas are inhabited by Thalictrum minus L. - Galium aparine L. - Achillea millefolium L. (TGA) community. The Poa pratensis L.- Senecio chrysanthemoides DC. - Clinopodium umbrosum (M.Bieb.) Kuntze (PSC) community was most diverse, supported higher species diversity (Shannon=2.22 +/- 0.07; Simpson=0.84 +/- 0.01; Fisher's alpha=4.51 +/- 0.30) and also exhibited a maximum number of trails crossing the plot. Canonical Correspondence analysis (CCA) examined the species ecological interactions and displayed a significant role of most studied environmental variables in the species distribution patterns. The latter in the decreasing significance order comprised precipitation (F = 2.3; p = 0.001), latitude (F = 2.15; p = 0.001), grazing (F = 1.56; p = 0.01), longitude (F = 1.63; p = 0.013), slope (F = 1.33; p = 0.07), elevation (F = 1.32; p = 0.07), aspect (F = 0.1; p = 0.47), trails (F = 0.78; p = 0.85) and mean monthly minimum temperature (F = 1.23; p = 0.172). The variance partitioning used to evaluate the comparative significance of topographic, climatic and disturbance factors on understory vegetation composition depicted that topography (14.26%) strongly partitioned the vegetation distribution subsequently followed by climatic (11.52%) and disturbance (4.49%) factors.

AB Specific factors that determine whether hummingbirds feed from flowers matching their bill morphology are not well understood. Here, we asked whether long-billed hummingbirds at tropical mid-elevations visit flowers that match their bill morphology more often when those flowers are more energetically profitable in terms of nectar concentration compared to short-corolla flowers. We measured visitation rates by hummingbirds in 3 experiments involving feeders with 5 flower morphologies and 2 nectar concentrations in the mountains of Costa Rica. Not surprisingly, all species tended to prefer higher nectar concentration when given the choice across all available flower morphologies. When nectar concentration was the same across all flower morphologies, hummingbirds with bills shorter than 28 mm generally avoided long-corolla flowers (30 mm) and fed more frequently from short-corolla flowers (10 mm), while species with longer bills did not show a preference. When nectar concentration was higher in long-corolla flowers compared to short-corolla flowers (30% vs 10% m/v), short-billed species showed the same visitation rates as above, but long-billed species (>28 mm) changed their visitation patterns and visited long-corolla flowers significantly more often than short-corolla flowers. Our results suggest that visitation rates of long-billed hummingbirds to long-corolla flowers might be influenced more by nectar properties than by flower morphology at mid-elevations in the tropics.

AB Human activities are transforming landscapes and altering the structure and functioning of ecosystems worldwide and often result in sharp contrasts between human-dominated landscapes and adjacent natural habitats that lead to the creation of hard edges and artificial boundaries. The configuration of these boundaries could influence local biotic interactions and animal behaviours. Here, we investigate whether boundaries of different degrees of 'hardness' affect space utilization by migratory species in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We deployed camera traps along transects perpendicular to the national park boundary at three different locales. The transects were located in areas that consisted of two types of human-wildlife interface: a sudden transition from the national park into agro-pastoral land use (termed a 'hard' boundary) and a more gradual transition mediated by a shared usage area (termed a 'soft' boundary). Camera traps were placed at 2 km intervals along each 10 km transect from the edge towards the core of the park and were programmed to collect images hourly between dawn and dusk between June 2016 and March 2019. We used a deep neural network to detect the presence of wildlife within images and then used a Bayesian model with diffuse priors to estimate parameters of a generalized linear model with a Bernoulli likelihood. We explored the binomial probability of either wildebeest or zebra presence as a function of distance to the boundary, the rate of grass greening or drying (dNDVI) and the concentration of grass protein. There was a strong negative effect of distance to boundary on the probability of detecting wildebeest or zebra; however, this was only observed where the transition from human-dominated landscape to protected areas was sudden. Conversely, soft boundaries had little to no effect on the probability of detecting wildebeest or zebra. The results suggest that boundary type affects migratory species occurrence. The implications of these findings suggest that hard boundaries reduce the effective size of conservation areas; for many species, the area used by wildlife is likely less than the gazetted area under protection. The impacts may be severe especially for narrow protected areas or dispersal corridors.

AB In recent decades, land use/land cover change caused by rapid economic development has led to a sharp decline in the values of ecosystem service. Based on the land use/land cover change images of the PRD in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, the land use change was analyzed and the corresponding Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) were evaluated. In addition, a future land use simulation model was developed to simulate multiple scenarios in 2030. The results show that the area of construction land increased nearly 166.05% from 1990 to 2020, and the total ESVs decreased by 11.20 billion yuan. The contribution order of the four types ecosystem service to ESVs is regulating services > supporting services > provisioning services > cultural services. Compared with 2020, the values of ecosystem service of all the five scenarios shows a downward trend, and the order is the Ecological protection scenario (EPS) > the Natural development Scenario (NDS) > the Carbon neutral scenario (CNS) > the Production priority scenario (PPS) > the Economic development scenario (EDS). The CNS may be the most suitable scenario for the PRD region among the five scenarios.

AB With the increasing global human activities, local microbial communities will be dramatically changed and impaired. Sea-crossing bridges have been constructed worldwide with the rapid economic development. However, knowledge about impacts of bridge constructions on diversity and functional shifts of local microbiota is lacking. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics were implemented to compare changes of microbial communities between sediments influenced by sea-crossing bridge construction (EG group) and the surrounding control sediments (CG group). High levels of beta diversity in EG group indicated environmental changes and bridge construction increased local microbial diversity. Comparative analyses revealed significant changes in microbial composition and abundance and a total of 17 indicator species were detected using LEfSe approach. The predicted functional attributes of microbiota revealed most of which were involved in metabolism, environmental and genetic information processing. Notably, annotated pathways involved in human diseases were significantly enriched in EG group, revealing potential deleterious effects of public health security influenced by bridge construction. For the first time, our study revealed significant changes in local microbial communities affected by sea-crossing bridge construction. We suggested local biodiversity and human health should be specifically noticed in engineering construction process. These results may greatly enhance our understanding of the microbial responses to marine infrastructure and civil engineering. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes are an increasingly important approach that often try to achieve triple bottom line solutions - achieving biodiversity conservation and social equity-, while minimizing costs. However, when planning for multiple objectives with a limited budget, spatial mismatches and trade-offs between objectives are likely to exist. Here, we present a framework for evaluating the potential spatial trade-offs among different objectives for sound policy-and decision-making. We explore the trade-offs: 1) between water and above-ground carbon storage ecosystem services; 2) among ecosystem services (both individually and when they are considered simultaneously) and biodiversity; and 3) among ecosystem services, biodiversity, and social equity in Colombia. We found that there are clear trade-offs between water services and biodiversity, and between social equity and biodiversity, suggesting that PES schemes targeting just one of these objectives may lead to poor outcomes for the others. However, there are a minimal trade-off between carbon and biodiversity, indicating that PES schemes targeted at biodiversity likely also contribute to carbon sequestration objectives. The framework we employ here can be used in other contexts to navigate the potential trade-offs in PES designed for triple bottom line solutions to allow decision-makers to better target where to prioritize PES investment.

AB Some of the elements in the rocky intertidal zone, such as boulders, act as a refuge, mating, feeding and nursery area for marine fauna. In the present study, we analysed the population structure of the intertidal stone crab Xantho poressa in a human-restricted area, between March 2019 and February 2020, comprised of a rocky shore along the SW Atlantic Spanish coast. The study aims to provide information about the size distribution and identify which environmental factors shape the distribution, sex ratio and mating system of the species. The males were significantly larger than the females and no significant difference in size was observed between ovigerous and non-ovigerous females. The sex ratio was biased towards females. Groups constituted by one large male and several females were observed coexisting under a boulder. Other groups of two or more males and various females were also observed during the study. The distribution of the species is mainly determined by the size and weight of the boulder. The complexity of the study area, and the key role of boulders in the distribution of the species, suggests that X. poressa might have a refuge-defence polygynous mating system.

AB The facilitatory role that isolated trees play in the regeneration of degraded areas that are not under the cover of invasive exotic plants is well recognized. In contrast, the influence of isolated trees in restoring sites invaded by exotic plants has hardly been studied. Such studies are needed because conditions that favor native tree regeneration under isolated trees, such as microclimate amelioration, increased nutrient levels, and facilitated dispersal, may also be favorable to certain species of exotic plants. Using transects, we studied species richness, abundance and resilience (as indicated by re-sprouting) of trees regenerating underneath the crowns of 15 isolated native trees that are emergent over a near continuous canopy of paper mulberry Broussonetia papyrifera in a degraded area of Mabira Forest, Uganda. Data collected beneath emergent tree crowns were matched by control data from the area immediately beyond the crowns. Native tree species abundance and richness were significantly higher beneath than beyond crowns; while the opposite was true of the density of B. papyrifera seedlings and saplings. Species richness was significantly higher beneath than beyond crowns for late-, but not early-succession trees. Polynomial regressions of species richness and abundance showed that B. papyrifera abundance increased significantly from stem bases to crown edges and leveled-off beyond crowns; while the density of native tree species was constant from stem bases to crown edges and decreased thereafter. Native tree species richness peaked at crown edges. The proportion of re-sprouts assigned to cutting of native tree species was significantly higher beyond than beneath crowns. We attribute the higher abundances and species richness of native species underneath crowns to both facilitation by isolated trees and the apparent shade-intolerance of B. papyrifera. Significantly higher levels of re-sprouting by native tree species could be an indication that the regeneration underneath crowns is less resilient to disturbance than that beyond, or that less resilient species occur beneath crowns. Overall, the results suggest that in sites invaded by mulberry, isolated trees have potential to accelerate recovery of native tree species while suppressing mulberry. Peaking of species richness at crown edges is not a commonly reported finding for isolated trees and needs to be further investigated.

AB How and when to upscale and finance nature-based solutions in watersheds in order to improve downstream urban water security is a global concern. In this paper we address such challenge by providing a novel method for planning the expansion of a chosen set of nature-based solutions that couples optimization of sequential decision making, hydrology modelling and hydroeconomics in a single modeling framework. The benefits were considered the avoided costs of water scarcity and water treatment perceived downstream. The optimal expansion schedule of decisions was then defined under the objective function of minimizing total cost. We demonstrated the framework by applying it to a set of benchmark alternative scenarios for the Sinos River watershed (Brazil). We found that the optimal schedule of nature-based solutions expansion is sensitive to the initial land use and future drivers. Treatment cost reduction was the greatest feature in some scenarios, confirming it as a strategy for addressing water quality issues of degraded watersheds. But the accounting of water scarcity cost introduced a tradeoff: expansion of nature-based solutions in well-preserved watersheds may not worth the investment. Future research may improve current limitations in scope and models without structural changes in the framework. Practical implications of this work arise from the funding of watershed payments for environmental services projects by institutions and governments, which demand evidence-based policies to support investment of public resources.

AB The translation of scientific data, analyses, and conclusions into public policy and social action almost always contains an implication of the investigator's ethics and values. Direct statements of these values are often deeply considered, but the ethical implications of structural constraints and upstream analytical choices are often hidden. This is relatively uncontroversial from a philosophical point of view, and well-known to scholars in environmental ethics. However, many practitioners in ecology and evolution without such training (ourselves included) may not have realized that by asserting the value of biodiversity conservation in either general or specific terms, they are stating a "normative postulate:" a value judgment taken to be true and foundational to further thinking. These assumptions are based on some theory of value and ethical reasoning, but often one that has not been made fully explicit. Consequently, many theories and metrics in empirical scientific research may be founded on hidden normative postulates of which practitioners are often unaware. We consider five cases where this may be the case: local vs. global diversity, prioritization based on evolutionary distinctness, species concepts, extinction by hybridization, and non-native species. Conflicts over the interpretation of data driven by different parties holding to different conceptions of ethics and philosophy are possible, with little guidance on how they can best be adjudicated. To the extent this is true, there exists a "normative postulate problem" for biodiversity researchers.

AB The Hyrcanian forests of Iran are mainly managed with the single-selection silvicultural technique. Despite significant ecological benefits associated with selection cutting, this type of forest management leads towards more challenging situations where it is difficult to maintain and practice successful forestry than in even-aged systems. Therefore, this study provides relevant management tools in the form of models to estimate low growth levels in Hyrcanian forests. In the present study, estimation of the population growth rate and then the allowable cut rate of these forests using a matrix model have been calculated in the Gorazbon district. For this purpose, the data of 256 permanent sample plots measured during the years between 2003 and 2012, as well as the data recorded about the trees harvested according to the forestry plan, have been used. As a first step, the most frequently occurring tree species were divided into four groups (beech, hornbeam, chestnut-leaved oak, and other species). Compartments of the district were divided into two groups of logged and unlogged compartments. The purpose of this division was to estimate the allowable cut and compare its volume with the volumes of observed and predicted allowable cuts obtained from forestry plans. The results showed that the total operated allowable cut (OAC) in logged compartments was more than the estimated allowable cut (EAC). In unlogged compartments, the total predicted allowable cut (PAC) was more than EAC. A comparison of EAC and OAC showed that hornbeam has been harvested more than its potential. However, chestnut-leaved oak and other species group have depicted opposite trends. Our models provide important advancements for estimating allowable cut that can enhance the goal of practicing sustainable forestry.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance has left the world's forests highly fragmented, with a significant proportion of edge-affected area. Abiotic changes at forest edges are likely to affect forest soil carbon cycling, as higher temperatures and lower moisture availability in edge environments have well-documented effects on soil respiration. The present study sought to quantify persistent changes in soil carbon cycling in the fragmented broadleaf forests of southeastern Pennsylvania. At three sites with >80-year-old forest-field edges, three 100-m transects perpendicular to the edge were established. Monthly measurements of soil respiration, temperature, and moisture were made at fixed distances along each transect throughout the growing season. Soil carbon storage from 0 to 20 cm depth, litter biomass, and decomposition rates were also assessed. Soil respiration was significantly higher at forest edges, relative to the interior, and this effect penetrated 60 m into the forest. Significantly elevated surface soil temperature and decreased soil moisture were also observed in edge environments. Despite elevated soil respiration at the edge, soil carbon storage, litter biomass, and decomposition rates were invariant along edge to interior gradients. The temperature responsiveness of soil respiration was significantly higher in the forest interior (100 m), relative to locations <= 60 m from the edge. Edge effects altering elements of the soil carbon cycle were apparent in the forests of southeastern Pennsylvania, and principally manifest as increased soil respiration rates and decreased temperature responsiveness of soil respiration. Lack of variation in soil carbon pools and decomposition rates from the forest edge to interior suggests that increased soil respiration may be related to changes in root and rhizosphere respiration at the edge. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence documenting increased soil respiration in the edge environments of temperate broadleaf forests. Discounting the alterations imposed by forest fragmentation on carbon cycling has the potential to produce misleading estimates of land-atmosphere CO2 exchange and terrestrial carbon storage.

AB Fire plays an important role in maintaining grassy forests, and reduced fire frequency has been linked to encroachment of woody plants into grassy forests and woodlands globally. In Australia a range of threatened animals, including the northern population of the endangered eastern bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus), are dependent on grassy forests. We examined this issue by collating three decades of detailed monitoring and fire data for 43 current and historically-occupied bristlebird sites, and examined the relationships among fire history, bristlebird occupancy and habitat patch size/condition. Habitat patch size declined by over 50% between 1980 and 2009 due to woody plant encroachment. Bristlebird occupancy was associated with reduced habitat loss and time since fire, while reduced fire frequency was the main predictor of decline in grassy cover, a critical habitat element for bristlebirds. Our models suggested habitat loss was strongly influenced by fire history, particularly fire frequency, with reduced habitat loss associated with more-frequent burning. Native grass cover can return quickly, and remained high until 5-10 years post-fire; densest grass cover was found at sites with fire intervals of between 3.5 and 7 years. Active fire management, including regular ecological burning, is imperative for conservation of the eastern bristlebird and other threatened fauna that depend on these grassy forests. The massive changes in global patterns of fire currently occurring, and the threat this poses to biodiversity, make understanding the nuances of fire ecology, including the role of fire frequency, essential to improving conservation management.

AB Marrubium L., is a problematic genus of Lamiaceae family with approximately 40 taxa that some of its species grow in Iran. In the current study, we studied infrageneric taxonomic relationships among six Iranian Marrubium species using morphological and anatomical traits, and molecular genetic techniques, including inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR), chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS). We investigated five individuals per each species. Most of the studied qualitative and quantitative morphological characteristics differed significantly (P <= 0.001) among these species, and we found five morphotype groups in the PCA plot of morphological traits. Leaf blade anatomical structure was dorsi-ventral in all species. Meanwhile, we observed a significant variation in most of the studied anatomical variables. Based on anatomical features, these species were clustered into three groups. Results of ISSR study revealed that the total genetic diversity at the species level (Ht) was higher than within each species (Hs). These findings were supported by the results of AMOVA test, Gst and Nm values. According to STRUCTURE analysis and Nei's genetic distance, these species were divided into 5 genotype groups. The studied species were clustered separately in cpDNA and ITS trees of phylogenetic studies. We observed a high level of infraspecific divergence in the evaluated species. In addition, the employed taxonomical markers have enough potential to separate the investigated species. However, the clustering patterns of the species based on the examined techniques were not the same, except those for M. parviflorum Fisch. & C.A. Mey., and M. crassidens Bioss., that were clustered closely in most cases. It can be concluded that the evaluated species revealed a taxonomically complex group resulting from high infraspecific variation, polyploidy and hybridization.

AB Functional traits have become important tools for evaluating the response of epiphytic lichens to environmental changes. In this study, we evaluated which predictors related to fragmentation, habitat quality and climate were driving the richness and cover of lichen growth form, type of photobiont and reproduction traits, at both fragment and plot levels in a Temperate-Mediterranean area dominated by Quercus forests. At fragment level, patch size and summer rainfall positively contributed to richness in most of the traits, while tree diameter and slope were the most important drivers, especially for the type of reproduction and growth form at plot scale. High coverage of growth forms especially sensitive to fragmentation were indicative of high values of total species richness, while early-colonizers indicated the opposite. These results provide important information on how lichen traits respond to environmental conditions in an ecotone area where a shift towards a drier climate is more likely to occur.

AB Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) populations are the focus of rehabilitation efforts across the Great Lakes. Although historical fisheries were a major cause of population collapses, habitat fragmentation and/or loss and reduced access to spawning and juvenile habitat impose contemporary challenges for population recovery. The loss of connectivity between habitat types required by different life stages may particularly limit recruitment rates, inhibiting population increase towards recovery targets. We used microsatellite DNA genotyping to assess population structure, diversity, and historical connectivity of lake sturgeon in the Black Sturgeon River watershed, a major tributary of Black Bay, Lake Superior with both historical and contemporary dams. Genotype data from lake sturgeon sampled above and below an existing major barrier, as well as from lakes in the upper watershed, showed evidence of historical connectivity throughout the watershed. Despite the existing barrier fragmenting the river and preventing upstream migration, lake sturgeon from the Black Sturgeon watershed showed clear membership to a single ancestral gene pool. Estimates of genetic effective population size (N-e) for the above-and below-barrier population segments were reduced compared to the larger (watershed level) gene pool. Although the longevity of lake sturgeon has largely enabled the retention of historical genetic diversity for the population in the watershed, the reduced productive capacity of this significant tributary may have implications for recovery rates for the regional Lake Superior metapopulation. Restoring connectivity among habitats would benefit the long-term conservation and management of this species throughout this river system, and potentially the regional metapopulation.

AB The asymptotic height (H-max) and the size-scaling exponent (beta), proxies of tree size and important forest architectural parameters of the relationships between height and tree diameter of forests, play important roles in the carbon (C) stocks and fluxes of forest ecosystems. However, the patterns and drivers of these values in continental China are not well known. Based on a national forest database of China, we explored the geographic patterns and ecological drivers of H-max and beta and their dynamic relationships with the C sequestration capabilities of the studied ecosystems, including the C stock and allocation, net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and mean ecosystem C turnover time. At the ecosystem scale, the H-max values ranged from 10.37 to 37.07 m, with a mean value of 25.41 m, showing a decreasing trend with increasing latitude. However, beta ranged from 0.598 to 0.73, with a mean value of 0.66, showing an increasing trend with latitude. The spatial patterns of the forest H-max and beta at the national scale were largely controlled by the mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and forest age. These patterns were verified using biomass and forest C sequestration data, showing that the total vegetation C stock as a whole, in aboveground or belowground components, was significantly and positively correlated with H-max (p < 0.05), revealing apparent "faster first, slower later" increasing trends with H-max (R-2 = 0.759, 0.821, and 0.527, respectively). In addition, for forest >20 m, NEP showed a significant strong negative correlation with H-max (by -0.967% per 1 m of H-max, R-2 = 0.504, p < 0.05), and a 10-m increase in H-max resulted in a decrease in mean ecosystem C turnover time by 16.9% (7.43 years). Taller forests might indeed be expected to have higher autotrophic respiration consumption rates but lower mean ecosystem C turnover time and NEP values than shorter forests. The discovery that community-level asymptotic height could be used as a comparative predictor of ecosystem C sequestration capacity and its difference among forest biomes underpins the fundamentals of ecological theories and modeling, which has important implications for forest restoration, policy, and management.

AB Non-native species can become deleterious or potentially beneficial as components of novel ecosystems. The non-native red macroalga Gracilaria vermiculophylla may provide nursery habitat where eelgrass Zostera marina has been extirpated in Chesapeake Bay. A mensurative experiment was conducted monthly May-October 2013 and 2014 in the York River, Chesapeake Bay, to evaluate hypotheses that Gracilaria (1) can compensate for the loss of seagrass nurseries by colonizing habitats where seagrass has been eliminated by environmental stress, and (2) is utilized by juvenile blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) as nursery habitat. We quantified Gracilaria presence, percent cover, and biomass as a function of region (upriver, midriver, and downriver) and seagrass presence or absence using stratified random sampling, 20-m transects, and 0.0625-m(2) quadrats. Gracilaria volume was measured and converted to dry weight. Effects of the factors and covariates temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, month, and year were analyzed using generalized linear models. Juvenile blue crab density was quantified in summer 2013 using suction sampling in Gracilaria and seagrass. A model with the collective effect of region and seagrass presence or absence (downriver seagrass, downriver unvegetated bottom, midriver unvegetated bottom) best predicted Gracilaria abundance. Gracilaria presence, percent cover, and biomass were highest in downriver seagrass, followed by downriver unvegetated bottom, and then midriver unvegetated bottom, where seagrass has been extirpated, supporting hypothesis (1). Gracilaria did not occur upriver, likely due to a lack of recruitment. Seagrass and Gracilaria housed similar densities of juvenile blue crabs, supporting hypothesis (2). We estimated that a single 40-ha cove system with Gracilaria could house 200,000 juvenile crabs as would a single 2.4-ha seagrass bed. Consequently, the numerous midriver and downriver cove systems in the York River could support millions of young juvenile blue crabs and thereby compensate for the loss of seagrass in the river and in other areas of Chesapeake Bay. At present, Gracilaria has no widespread negative impacts on seagrass in the York River or most regions of Chesapeake Bay, likely because percent cover and biomass are not excessively high at present. We posit that Gracilaria has become an important alternative nursery habitat for the blue crab in Chesapeake Bay and can potentially mitigate impacts of climate change on seagrass nursery habitats.

AB Climate and soil factors induce substantial controls over plant biodiversity in stressful ecosystems. Despite of some studies on plant biodiversity in extreme ecosystems including rocky outcrops, simultaneous effects of climate and soil factors have rarely been studied on different facets of biodiversity including taxonomic and functional diversity in these ecosystems. In addition, we know little about plant biodiversity variations in such extreme ecosystems compared to natural environments. It seems that environmental factors acting in different spatial scales specifically influence some facets of plant biodiversity. Therefore, we studied changes in taxonomic and functional diversity along precipitation and soil gradients in both landscapes (i) rocky outcrops and (ii) their nearby rangeland sites in northeast of Iran. In this regard, we considered six sites across precipitation and soil gradients in each landscape, and established 90 1m(2) quadrates in them (i.e. 15 quadrats in each site; 15 x 6 = 90 in each landscape). Then, taxonomic and functional diversity were measured using RaoQ index, FDis and CWM indices. Finally, we assessed impacts of precipitation and soil factors on biodiversity indices in both landscapes by performing regression models and variation partitioning procedure. The patterns of taxonomic diversity similarly showed nonlinear changes along the precipitation and soil factors in both landscapes (i.e. outcrop and rangeland). However, we found a more negative and significant trends of variation in functional diversity indices (except for CWMSLA) across precipitation and soil factors in outcrops than their surrounding rangelands. Variations of plant biodiversity were more explained by precipitation factors in surrounding rangelands, whereas soil factors including organic carbon had more consistent and significant effects on plant biodiversity in outcrops. Therefore, our results represent important impacts of soil factors in structuring plant biodiversity facets in stressful ecosystems. While, environmental factors acting in regional and broad scales such as precipitation generally shape vegetation and plant biodiversity patterns in natural ecosystems. We can conclude that rocky outcrops provide suitable microenvironments to present plant species with similar yields that are less able to be present in rangeland ecosystems.

AB Research on resource partitioning in plant-pollinator mutualistic systems is mainly concentrated at the levels of species and communities, whereas differences between males and females are typically ignored. Nevertheless, pollinators often show large sexual differences in behaviour and morphology, which may lead to sex-specific patterns of resource use with the potential to differentially affect plant reproduction and diversification. We investigated variation in behavioural and morphological traits between sexes of hummingbird species as potential mechanisms underlying sex-specific flower resource use in ecological communities. To do so, we compiled a dataset of plant-hummingbird interactions based on pollen loads for 31 hummingbird species from 13 localities across the Americas, complemented by data on territorial behaviour (territorial or non-territorial) and morphological traits (bill length, bill curvature, wing length and body mass). We assessed the extent of intersexual differences in niche breadth and niche overlap in floral resource use across hummingbird species. Then, we tested whether floral niche breadth and overlap between sexes are associated with sexual dimorphism in behavioural or morphological traits of hummingbird species while accounting for evolutionary relatedness among the species. We found striking differences in patterns of floral resource use between sex. Females had a broader floral niche breadth and were more dissimilar in the plant species visited with respect to males of the same species, resulting in a high level of resource partitioning between sexes. We found that both territoriality and morphological traits were related to sex-specific resource use by hummingbird species. Notably, niche overlap between sexes was greater for territorial than non-territorial species, and moreover, niche overlap was negatively associated with sexual dimorphism in bill curvature across hummingbird species. These results reveal the importance of behavioural and morphological traits of hummingbird species in sex-specific resource use and that resource partitioning by sex is likely to be an important mechanism to reduce intersexual competition in hummingbirds. These findings highlight the need for better understanding the putative role of intersexual variation in shaping patterns of interactions and plant reproduction in ecological communities.

AB Dominant theorizing and research surrounding the operation of intersexual selection in evolutionary psychology tends to be guided by an adaptationist framework and aligned with models of sexual selection involving direct benefits (e.g., parental care) and indirect "good gene" and condition-dependent benefits. In this way, evolutionary psychologists more often espouse Alfred Russel Wallaces' utilitarian viewpoint that traits become attractive because they honestly signal vigor and vitality, which gives priority to natural selection. In doing so, Darwin's esthetic perspective originally articulated in The Descent of Man and alternative models of sexual selection (e.g., Fisherian runaway), are given less consideration. This is despite some informative reviews on the topic in evolutionary psychology. In the current conceptual analysis, we discuss the potential of Prum's Lande-Kirkpatrick (LK) null model of sexual selection to help make sense of some of the mixed evidence regarding the links between attractive traits and purported markers of phenotypic and genetic condition. We then consider how the implications of the LK null model can help to shift theoretical assumptions and guide future work in evolutionary psychology on intersexual selection.

AB The fire regime is essential in creating a mosaic of plant structure and diversity in South American open savannas, especially favouring herbs. However, studies investigating diversity patterns in Neotropical savannas rarely focus on the herb-subshrub layer. This study investigated the variation of the herb-subshrub layer under contrasting fire regimes in the most conserved site within the Cerrado Domain, the Jalapao region, Brazil. We selected four sites of open savanna physiognomy with similar topographic, climatic and edaphic features: three burned every 2 years, while the fourth site has remained unburned for at least the last 10 years. We randomly distributed 15 plots of 4 m(2) in each site and identified all herbs and subshrubs in each plot to estimate density, richness, alpha diversity and species composition. The unburned site had lower herb-subshrub density, richness and diversity than the frequently burned sites. Species composition varied between frequently burned and unburned sites, partially explained by the fire frequency across sites. Although other ecological factors may explain the patterns detected, we cannot rule out the importance of fire in structuring plant communities in the Jalapao region. As in other savannas, our study in the Cerrado Domain reinforces the essential role of the fire regimes in modifying and maintaining the diversity of herbaceous plants at the landscape scale.

AB In this study, we aim to understand the boundaries and the species evolutionary relationships in Mesochila, which includes 20 species arranged into three subgenera. We also conducted a biogeographic analysis that allowed us to identify the major events that shaped the currently disjunct distribution of the group. Our analyses were performed employing four major phylogenetic algorithms: equal and implied weight parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Phylogenetic analyses, including 25 taxa (all 20 species in the genus plus five outgroups) and 37 characters, indicated that Mesochila is a monophyletic group composed of four strongly supported lineages, although no consensus was attained regarding relationships between lineages. Bayesian inference resulted in the less resolved topology, whereas implied weight parsimony yielded the most different tree when using a low k value (1). We present a new infrageneric classification for the group with the description of Mesochila (Neomesochila) subgen. nov. to acconunodate M. (N.) brevipennis, M. (N.) drechseli, M. (N.) moraveci, and M. (N.)ptepusula. Furthermore, we transfer M. (M.) distil:co from M. (Eumesochila) back to M. (Alesochila). The biogeographical analysis suggested a South American origin for the group, in Chacoan/P dominions (Atlantic rainforest/Cerrado biomes), with subsequent dispersions to Central America and Amazonia.

AB Global climate change introduces new combinations of environmental conditions, which is expected to increase stress on plants. This could affect many traits in multiple ways that are as yet unknown but will likely require the modification of existing genetic relationships among functional traits potentially involved in local adaptation. Theoretical evolutionary studies have determined that it is an advantage to have an excess of recombination events under heterogeneous environmental conditions. Our study, conducted on a population of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don), was able to identify individuals that show high genetic recombination at genomic regions, which potentially include pleiotropic or collocating QTLs responsible for the studied traits, reaching a prediction accuracy of 0.80 in random cross-validation and 0.72 when whole family was removed from the training population and predicted. To identify these highly recombined individuals, a training population was constructed from correlation breakers, created through tandem selection of parents in the previous generation and their consequent mating. Although the correlation breakers showed lower observed heterogeneity possibly due to direct selection in both studied traits, the genomic regions with statistically significant differences in the linkage disequilibrium pattern showed higher level of heretozygosity, which has the effect of decomposing unfavourable genetic correlation. We propose undertaking selection of correlation breakers under current environmental conditions and using genomic predictions to increase the frequency of these 'recombined' individuals in future plantations, ensuring the resilience of planted forests to changing climates. The increased frequency of such individuals will decrease the strength of the population-level genetic correlations among traits, increasing the opportunity for new trait combinations to be developed in the future.

AB Forest disturbance, including deforestation, is a major driver of global biodiversity decline. Identifying the underlying socioeconomic drivers can help guide interventions to halt biodiversity decline. Here, we quantified spatial overlaps between the distributions of 6164 globally threatened terrestrial vertebrate species and five major forest disturbance drivers at the global scale: commodity-driven deforestation, shifting agriculture, forestry, wildfire, and urbanization. We find that each driver has a distinct relative importance among species groups and geographic regions with, for example, the dominant disturbance drivers being forestry in northern regions and shifting agriculture in the tropics. Overall, shifting agriculture was more prevalent within threatened forest species' ranges in the tropics, and some temperate nations. Our findings suggest that, globally, threatened forest species are exposed to a disproportional decrease in habitat area. Combining forest disturbance maps and species ranges can help evaluate agricultural landscape management and prioritize conservation efforts to reduce further biodiversity loss.
   Spatial overlaps between forest disturbance drivers and threatened species' ranges reveal that shifting agriculture is a major driver of forest biodiversity loss at a global scale, as demonstrated by a global analysis of forest disturbance and threatened vertebrate species distributions.

AB Ecological genomics approaches have informed us about the structure of genetic diversity in natural populations that might underlie patterns in trait variation. However, we still know surprisingly little about the mechanisms that permit organisms to adapt to variable environmental conditions. The salt marsh foundation plant Spartina alterniflora exhibits a dramatic range in phenotype that is associated with a pronounced intertidal environmental gradient across a narrow spatial scale. Both genetic and non-genetic molecular mechanisms might underlie this phenotypic variation. To investigate both, we used epigenotyping-by-sequencing (epiGBS) to evaluate the make-up of natural populations across the intertidal environmental gradient. Based on recent findings, we expected that both DNA sequence and DNA methylation diversity would be explained by source population and habitat within populations. However, we predicted that epigenetic variation might be more strongly associated with habitat since similar epigenetic modifications could be rapidly elicited across different genetic backgrounds by similar environmental conditions. Overall, with PERMANOVA we found that population of origin explained a significant amount of the genetic (8.6%) and epigenetic (3.2%) variance. In addition, we found that a small but significant amount of genetic and epigenetic variance (<1%) was explained by habitat within populations. The interaction of population and habitat explained an additional 2.9% of the genetic variance and 1.4% of the epigenetic variance. By examining genetic and epigenetic variation within the same fragments (variation in close-cis), we found that population explained epigenetic variation in 9.2% of 8,960 tested loci, even after accounting for differences in the DNA sequence of the fragment. Habitat alone explained very little (<0.1%) of the variation in these close-cis comparisons, but the interaction of population and habitat explained 2.1% of the epigenetic variation in these loci. Using multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) we found that phenotypic differences in natural populations were correlated with epigenetic and environmental differences even when accounting for genetic differences. Our results support the contention that sequence variation explains most of the variation in DNA methylation, but we have provided evidence that DNA methylation distinctly contributes to plant responses in natural populations.

AB Invasive species removal is a common focus in restoration ecology, but the ultimate goal of native plant species recovery and habitat recovery is often elusive. Control of invasive Tamarix spp. shrubs in the American Southwest has only sometimes led to increased native species cover; this is of particular concern for the protection of bird habitat, including the endangered Southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax extimus trailii, abbr. SWFL) that nests readily in Tamarix when native Salix canopy is absent. If we can identify the conditions that lead to more native trees as well as habitat protection for the SWFL, we can prioritize restoration efforts more effectively and reduce conflict between conservation goals. To determine whether reduction in the invasive Tamarix led to more Salix cover, we compiled data on vegetation, soils, and geographic conditions in 260 sites where Tamarix had been subject to control efforts and 132 positive and negative reference sites. We found that (1) reduction in Tamarix only increased Salix cover in wetter sites and was greater when a particular low-disturbance removal method was used; however, the increase did not typically compensate for the overall losses in canopy cover, and (2) Salix cover was generally highest in locations with low drought stress, as reflected by soil properties, distance to water, and climate. These results suggest that the presence and recovery of Salix is dependent on its relatively narrow environmental niche, in contrast with Tamarix's broader one. Thus, although abundance of Salix and Tamarix was negatively correlated, this is likely because of Salix's different niche, as much as or more than direct interspecific competition. Our findings demonstrate that removal of an invasive species does not necessarily lead to reestablishment of the native species they appeared to displace. We suggest that in the case of promoting habitat for SWFL and other birds, outcomes of restoration activity can be improved by focusing Tamarix removal efforts on sites more likely to promote Salix growth based on environmental characteristics.

AB Invasion by climbing plants is a major obstacle to successful vegetation recovery from disturbance and land management in some regions. However, it is unclear how different habitats in agricultural landscapes contribute to the diversity and structure of climbing plant assemblages. In this study, we surveyed the diversity and distribution of climbing plants at disturbed sites of three types (abandoned orange orchards, forest-orchard edges and windbreak hedges) in a forest--terraced orchard mosaic landscape in southwestern Japan. Forest-orchard edges and more recently abandoned orchards tended to have greater climbing plant species richness than most of windbreak hedges and longer-abandoned orchards, which were dominated by kudzu (Pueraria lobata), Humulus scandens, or both. The presence or absence of an overhanging canopy and varying weed control practices in adjacent orchards have created heterogeneous forest-orchard edge conditions that have led to the differentiation of climbing plant assemblages. Repetitive hedge pruning and removal of climbing plants by farmers has created less favourable habitats for many climbing plants. These findings indicate that climbing plant assemblages did not simply correspond to the three focal site types, but rather were determined by 'ecological memory' associated with the effects of past and current agricultural activities and management of neighbouring forests.

AB Fire in tropical forests jeopardizes natural regeneration and can lead to the establishment of an alternative stable state. To address the effects of fire on natural regeneration in a lowland tropical forest, we performed a time series study over 12 years, focusing on the impact of fire frequency and post-fire regeneration time on vegetation structure, diversity, and functional composition in secondary forests. The study was conducted in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest at sites subjected to different fire frequencies (never, once, three, and four times over 44 years) and old-growth forests. During 12 years of monitoring time, no significant difference was observed in community structure and diversity among sites subjected to fire, which suggests an arrested succession pattern and corroborates with the establishment of an alternative stable state. Functional traits associated with fire resistance, including wood density and bark thickness, were higher in areas with fire history compared to old-growth forests. Therefore, our results showed that recurrent fires can lead communities toward an arrested succession pattern with a high divergence in community structure and functional composition compared to old-growth forest. These results have several practical implications for restoration and conservation programs in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

AB Over a century after Wallace's proposition of the riverine barrier hypothesis, the role of rivers in the diversification of species remains a matter of interest in Amazon biogeography. Amazonian rivers, in particular those large and fast flowing rivers, are widely recognized to act as barriers to the dispersal of some organisms. However, the extent to which primate species changes across interfluves (beta-diversity) in response to river features remains to be explicitly tested. In this study, we examine how river characteristics affect the variation in taxonomic and phylogenetic beta-diversity to elucidate the ecological processes behind the differences in primate assemblages between neighboring interfluves in the Brazilian Amazonia. We compiled International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) distribution maps of 80 river-bounded primate species in 10 interfluves separated by major rivers throughout the Brazilian Amazonia. We assessed both the taxonomic (disregarding phylogenetic relationships between species) and phylogenetic beta-diversities. We applied multiple linear models to evaluate whether annual discharge, sinuosity, and reflectance (as a proxy for amount of sediments) in each river or river section that separates neighboring interfluves make rivers effective barriers to primates. We found that mean discharge has a positive effect, while both sinuosity and amount of sediments have negative effects on primate beta-diversity. These variables have significant effects on total taxonomic and phylogenetic beta-diversity between neighboring interfluves, and their species turnover components. River features, however, have no effect on species richness differences. Genera are capable of traversing almost all interfluves, but species are replaced by others in opposite interfluves. Discharge affected both small- and large-sized primate total beta-diversity, but sinuosity only affected large-sized primate assemblages in neighboring interfluves. Our results indicate that although Amazonian rivers act as barriers for many primate species, this barrier effect seems limited to the short/medium time scales, as primate lineages are able to cross them over long-time scales.

AB Aggression is an important component of an animal's defense when protecting offspring from predators. Ground nesting birds use a variety of defense strategies. However, their choice according to situation context is poorly known, especially in nonpasserines and in the subtropics and tropics. The ability to distinguish between differently dangerous predator species and the opportunity to share defense with conspecifics are potentially important but little-studied aspects of nest defense strategy. We experimentally studied the nest defense of Red-Wattled Lapwing in an individually marked population in a desert area near Dubai, UAE. We used three stuffed models representing 1) a predator dangerous both to adults and to nests (a cat), 2) a nest predator (a raven), and 3) a harmless reference model (a moorhen). We confirmed that the lapwings distinguished between predator species (being most aggressive toward the cat, and least aggressive toward the moorhen) and adjusted their defense strategy accordingly. In addition, conspecific visitors play a variety of roles in parents' defense strategy. They can strengthen the parental reaction, or they can assist in distracting a predator. The visitors included not only nesting neighbors but also nonbreeding floaters. Both parents participated in nest defense to a similar extent, regardless of incubation stage and ambient temperature. This study provides new insight into the complexity of the defensive patterns in ground-nesting birds inhabiting a hot environment. Comparative experimental research on a range of environments, with various bird species and predator models, can help us to understand the drivers of these defensive behavioral patterns.

AB Mountain spruce forests in Central Europe decline under storms and bark beetle calamities driven by climate change. A stabilisation by planting rare or missing tree species is expensive and requires funding. A funding policy should mitigate climate change and support biodiversity. The goal of this study was to identify a conversion strategy of even-aged spruce-dominated forest stands to uneven-aged mixed stands with spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and fir (Abies alba Mill.). A simultaneous nonlinear optimisation of the number of planted trees and harvested trees per species and per period schedules stand treatments aiming to maximise the long-term financial outcome. Planting modelling extends a density-dependent stand-level matrix transition model based on diameter classes with an age-class-based model for artificial regeneration. An optimal conversion strategy was applied for five funding policy schemes, each for five initial states representing different stages of age and species composition typical for spruce forest conversion in the mountain zone of the Western Carpathians. Only 50% and higher funding of planting costs for the minor/missing fir and beech species facilitates a substantial increase of their shares in stand volume. Funding decreases the volume failure due to mortality. Funding increases the standing and harvested volume, which mitigates climate change by increasing the carbon sequestration. Funding causes unintended effects on ecosystem services by lowering harvest diameters, decreasing the volume of less profitable beech, and temporarily reducing the stand density aimed at supporting plantings and their diameter increments.

AB Invasive species often have catastrophic direct effects on native species through increased competition and predation. Less well understood are indirect, cascading effects across trophic levels. To reveal trophic disruptions caused by invasive species, it is necessary to document interactions between species at different trophic levels and across guilds. Here, we take this approach to quantify the impact of the invasion of cane toads at a riparian site in the Kimberley, northwest Australia. These toads are toxic to many native vertebrate predators and following toad arrival we observed the expected severe population decline in monitor lizards. Contrary to expectations however, this did not facilitate species in the next trophic level down: the abundance of their reptilian prey, as well as nest success of a songbird whose nests were predominantly depredated by monitor lizards, remained unchanged. Instead, detailed observations suggest a change in the suite of nest predators, with monitor lizards being replaced by other-mainly avian-predators, possibly reflecting their release from competitors that are more efficient nest predators. Hence, our findings highlight complex indirect effects of an invasive species across trophic levels and indicate that trophic cascades can go undetected when failing to include direct observations on predator-prey interactions.

AB Over half of forest cover in the tropics are secondary forests, resulting from spontaneous forest regrowth, once human activities have ceased on a land. The successional process, which governs the recovery of forests structure and composition, is determined by multiple factors that operate at different scales and are related in complex ways. These contingencies may lead secondary forests towards unpredictable successional trajectories. In Colombia, successional forests are an integral part of the landscape, their area is increasing, and can be considered essential allies to achieve restoration goals; however, their ecological value has not been considered in conservation agendas. For this reason, our objective was to evaluate the state-of-the-art in knowledge about successional forests in Colombia to make research opportunities visible. We calculated the area occupied by successional forests in Colombia, as well as in the different regions of the country and we performed a review of the published literature on the research of these forests in the country. Finally, we proposed some considerations for their future study. In brief, successional forests are dynamic ecosystems, both taxonomically and functionally, which should be considered crucial elements of transformed landscapes, and thereby have the possibility of being integrated into large-scale conservation and restoration projects. This highlights the need to eliminate the stigma lying on them to begin to study them as valuable ecological elements within the landscape.

We explored how initial planting composition influences recruiting plant species density, diversity, abundance, and forest structure in a 13-year-old restoration experiment in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Treatments included eight fenced plantings with animal-dispersed species, eight plantings with wind-dispersed species, eight unplanted plots to favor natural succession, and eight plots in the primary forest as reference sites. We predicted that by attracting more seed dispersers, animal-dispersed plantings would most closely resemble the primary forest. A census of trees taller than 2 m showed that while wind-dispersed plantings had more recruits, the animal-dispersed plantings most closely resembled the primary forest in pioneer abundance, species density and abundance of biotically dispersed and abiotically dispersed plants, individual tree basal area (in square meters per hectare), and vertical structure. The wind-dispersed plantings more closely approximated the forest in non-pioneer abundance and community composition. However, restoration treatments were more similar to each other than to the primary forest and did not differ in plant diversity. Animal-dispersed and wind-dispersed plantings did not differ in non-pioneer species density and matched the primary forest in total plot basal area. Higher abundance of trees in wind-plantings is explained by lower establishment limitations, seed legacy effects, and rapid reproduction of a few planted species. As the experiment continues, we expect treatment effects on seed dispersers will more strongly influence the recruiting plant community, leading the animal-dispersed plantings to more closely resemble the primary forest in diversity and forest structure.

AB Tropical species are predicted to be among the most vulnerable to climate change as they often live close to their upper limits to thermal tolerance and in many cases, behavioural thermoregulation is required to persist in the thermal extremes of tropical latitudes. In concert with warming temperatures, near-shore species are faced with the additional threat of shoreline hardening, leading to a reduction in microhabitats that can provide thermal refuges. This situation is exemplified in Singapore, which lies almost on the equator and so experiences yearround hot temperatures, and much of its coastline is now seawall. To investigate the thermal ecology of a common intertidal gastropod, Nerita undata, on these artificial structures, we measured thermal conditions on two seawalls, the temperatures of habitats occupied by the snail, and compared these with the snail's thermal tolerance by measuring heart rate and behavioural thermoregulation (as preferred temperature, Tpref). At one of the two seawalls (Tanjong Rimau), temperatures experienced by N. undata exceeded all measures of thermal tolerance in the sun, while at the other (Palawan Beach), they did not. Temperatures in habitats occupied by the snails on the seawalls were similar to their measured Tpref in the laboratory and were lower than all measures of thermal tolerance. Behavioural thermoregulation by the snails, therefore, significantly increased the thermal safety margins of N. undata on the relatively homogenous seawalls in Singapore, and at one of the two seawalls were necessary to allow snails to survive. Accordingly, to facilitate motile species to maintain broad thermal safety margins through behavioural regulation, the provision of additional refuges from thermal stress is recommended on artificial coastal defences such as seawalls.

AB The selection of habitats with potential reproductive resources may maximize individual reproductive success and overall fitness. Dendrobatid frogs display remarkable parental care which is associated with water bodies (phytotelmata) contained in plants with characteristics that are important to offspring survival. It has been shown that the size of phytotelmata is a key factor that drove the divergence in parental care patterns in poison frogs and that the distribution of reproductive resources can influence space use in these species. Here, we investigated parental care strategies and the influence of reproductive resource distribution on space use patterns in a wild population of Andinobates claudiae in Bocas del Toro, Panama. We identified the phytotelmata characteristics that predict tadpole deposition and analysed the association between the spatial distribution of phytotelmata and spatial use of males and females. Our observations showed that this species mates polygamously and exhibits male parental care. We found that male frogs have smaller kernel density home ranges and core areas compared to females, and that space use is related to the density of Heliconia plants whose axil cavities are used for tadpole rearing. Furthermore, we found that tadpoles were more frequently found in phytotelmata that were at lower heights and contained larger water volumes. Fathers invested time inspecting multiple cavities and travelled further than predicted from their territories to find suitable deposition sites. Our observations suggest a selective choice of phytotelmata regarding tadpole deposition, where distribution and quality of cavities might influence parental care decisions.

AB Forest dynamics is driven by the formation of gaps, especially in temperate forests. A potentially useful tool for identifying canopy gaps at different spatial scales is remote sensing. Our study used two types of data: (1) high spatial resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) to detect canopy gaps in the forest and (2) field data to quantify natural and artificial regeneration within the gaps. The study aimed to: (i) measure the characteristics of canopy gaps; (ii) identify the regeneration patterns within gaps; (iii) identify the factors influencing tree species regeneration within gaps. We analysed 313 tree canopy gaps in the Polish part of Bialowieza Forest (ca. 620 km(2)), east Poland. Variability in the mean gap area was very high, ranging from 20.2 to 8693.8 m(2). The number of gaps with an area > 1000 m(2) was the largest. The total area of gaps was highest in coniferous stands, where the biggest median area was also found. Gap size did not affect regeneration density in the Bialowieza Forest, except for birch and hornbeam. The density of less light-demanding tree species in the gaps was greater than light demanding ones. Birch regenerated in all gap sizes, and its density increased with gap area. Oak seedlings dominated in small gaps but conditions in the 'matrix of small gaps' was sufficient for short oak saplings. Hornbeam regeneration was highest in the gaps surveyed, especially the density of short saplings. Seedlings of hornbeam were present in 32% of gaps, but saplings were present in as many as 56% of gaps. Spruce regeneration was less numerous than hornbeam regeneration. Birch regeneration was the most numerous in short sapling stage. We analyzed 31 variables from different categories to identify the factors influencing tree species regeneration within gaps. The most essential variables for the birch and hornbeam regeneration were those containing supporting information, especially the percentage of the specific tree species covering the land around the gap. The variables based on gap geometry (size, shape, direction, elongation) were less important than variables from other categories. We found the positive influence of browsing on the density of hornbeam saplings. However, the high density of ungulates and their browsing pressure hinder birch regeneration. Intensive browsing by ungulates seems to be the most important factor in changing species composition and forest regeneration structure in gaps.

AB The genus Pipa is a species-poor clade of Neotropical frogs and one of the most bizarre-looking due to many highly derived anatomical traits related to their fully aquatic lifestyle. With their African relatives, they form the Pipidae family, which has attracted much attention, especially regarding its anatomy, reproductive biology, paleontology and biogeography. However, the actual diversity and phylogenetic relationships within Pipa remain poorly understood, and thus so do their historical biogeography and the evolution of striking features, such as the absence of teeth and endotrophy in some species. Using short mtDNA sequences across the distribution of the genus, we identified 15 main lineages (Operational Taxonomic Units - OTUs). This more than doubles the number of the currently seven valid nominal species. Several closely related OTUs do not share nuDNA alleles, confirming species divergence. Time-calibrated phylogenies obtained from mitogenomes and from 10 nuclear loci provide highly similar topologies but strikingly distinct node ages for Pipa. High dN/dS ratios and the variation of substitution rates across the trees suggest a strong effect of saturation on fast evolving positions of mtDNA, producing a substantially shorter stem branch of Pipa. Focusing on the nuDNA topology, we inferred an early Neogene Amazonian origin of the diversification of Pipa, with an initial split between the Guiana-Brazilian Shields and Western Amazonia, a pattern observed in many other co-distributed groups. All the western species are edentate, suggesting a single loss in the genus. Each of these groups diversified further out of Amazonia, toward the Atlantic Forest and toward trans-Andean forests, respectively. These events are concomitant with paleogeographic changes and match patterns observed in other co-distributed taxonomic groups. The two Amazonian lineages have probably independently acquired endotrophic larval development.

AB Environmental gradients have emerged as important barriers to structuring populations and species distributions. We set out to test whether the strong salinity gradient from the marine North Sea to the brackish Baltic Sea in northern Europe represents an ecological and genetic break, and to identify life history traits that correlate with the strength of this break. We accumulated mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 sequence data, and data on the distribution, salinity tolerance, and life history for 28 species belonging to the Cnidaria, Crustacea, Echinodermata, Mollusca, Polychaeta, and Gastrotricha. We included seven non-native species covering a broad range of times since introduction, in order to gain insight into the pace of adaptation and differentiation. We calculated measures of genetic diversity and differentiation across the environmental gradient, coalescent times, and migration rates between North and Baltic Sea populations, and analyzed correlations between genetic and life history data. The majority of investigated species is either genetically differentiated and/or adapted to the lower salinity conditions of the Baltic Sea. Species exhibiting population structure have a range of patterns of genetic diversity in comparison with the North Sea, from lower in the Baltic Sea to higher in the Baltic Sea, or equally diverse in North and Baltic Sea. Two of the non-native species showed signs of genetic differentiation, their times since introduction to the Baltic Sea being about 80 and >700 years, respectively. Our results indicate that the transition from North Sea to Baltic Sea represents a genetic and ecological break: The diversity of genetic patterns points toward independent trajectories in the Baltic compared with the North Sea, and ecological differences with regard to salinity tolerance are common. The North Sea-Baltic Sea region provides a unique setting to study evolutionary adaptation during colonization processes at different stages by jointly considering native and non-native species.

AB Stream burial, the rerouting of streams into underground culverts, is common in industrialized and densely populated urban areas. While stream burial is common in urban environments, direct characterization of the within-culvert environment is rare and it is unclear if buried reaches reflect neighboring open reaches regarding habitat, biota, and water chemistry. Additionally, for a buried stream, the entrance and exit of the culvert are abrupt habitat transitions within the stream channel, and it is unknown if these transitions lead to similarly abrupt responses in biotic and abiotic characteristics or if responses are gradual. Quantifying the within-culvert environment and transitions upon entering/ exiting the culvert has rarely been done but can help inform management practices regarding how these systems are impacted and establish a baseline for evaluating daylighting or stream restoration projects. To understand how culverts affect longitudinal biotic and abiotic characteristics of urban streams, we evaluated longitudinal patterns of physical habitat characteristics, stream water physiochemistry, periphyton biomass, and macroinvertebrate density and diversity in two urban streams that included long (>100 m) culvert reaches. Abrupt transitions in a suite of abiotic and biotic variables were observed at the entrances and exits of the culverts whereas some variables showed no response to the culvert presence. Periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate density were reduced by 98% and 92%, respectively, by culverts in the two streams. Within the culverts, we observed greater water depths (average of 10 cm outside vs 26 cm within the culvert), finer benthic substrate, and diversity of macroinvertebrates was reduced by 50%. Nutrient concentrations, in contrast, showed no response to the presence of a culvert. Within 60-90 m downstream of the culvert exits, most of the measured parameters returned to levels similar to those observed upstream of the culvert, suggesting that the ecosystem impacts of urban culverts, though dramatic, may be spatially constrained.

AB Background and aims: Several studies have shown an increase in tree mortality in intact tropical forests in recent decades. However, most studies are based on networks of field plots whose representativeness is debated. We examine the potential of repeated Airborne LiDAR Scanning data to map forest structure change over large areas with high spatial resolution and to detect tree mortality patterns at landscape level. Methods: The study site is a complex forested landscape in French Guiana with varied topographic positions, vegetation structures and disturbance history. We computed a Gap Dynamics Index from Canopy Height Models derived from successive LiDAR data sets (2009, 2015 and 2019) that we compared to field-measured mortality rates (in stem number and basal area loss) obtained from regular monitoring of 74 1.56-ha permanent plots. Results: At the plot level, the relation between gap dynamics and absolute basal area loss rate (combining fallen and standing dead trees) was overall highly significant (R2 = 0.60) and especially tight for the 59 ha of unlogged forest (R2 = 0.72). Basal area loss rate was better predicted from gap dynamics than stem loss rate. In particular, in previously logged plots, intense self-thinning of small stems did not translate into detectable gaps, leading to poor predictability of stem mortality by LiDAR in those forests severely disturbed 30 years before. At the landscape scale, LiDAR data revealed spatial patterns of gap creation that persisted over the successive analysis periods. Those spatial patterns were related to local topography and canopy height. High canopy forests and bottomlands were more dynamic, with a higher fraction of canopy affected by gaps per unit time indicating higher basal area loss rates. Conclusion: Gap detection and mapping via multitemporal LiDAR data is poised to become instrumental in characterizing landscape-scale forest response to current global change. Meaningful comparison of gap dynamics across time and space will, however, depend on consistent LiDAR acquisitions characteristics.

AB Perennial grasses are the main source of fuel during fires in savannas. The demography of these grasses likely varies between species although they have the same general architecture and coexist in savannas. However, very few studies compare their demography. Similarly, their demography likely varies between years because of the variability in weather condition and fire intensity. We described and compared the demography and life-cycle of the four dominant perennial grass species (Andropogon canaliculatus, Andropogon schirensis, Hyparrhenia diplandra and Loudetia simplex) of the Lamto savanna (Ivory Coast) and assessed the influence of their demographic features (stasis, fecundity, growth, fragmentation and retrogression) on this demography. Grass species were monitored over three consecutive years (2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018) on three 5 m x 10 m plots. We used a size-classified matrix model with 5 circumference classes (3-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-35 cm, 35-50 cm and >50 cm). Results showed differences in the age-based parameters, asymptotic growth rates (lambda s) and elasticities of the lambda s of the grass species. The population of A. canaliculatus, A. schirensis and H. diplandra were slowly declining while L. simplex was significantly declining. There were noticeable year-to-year variations in the demography of these four species. The most important demographic parameter influencing As was the stasis in all species, while retrogression and fragmentation contributed to a relative homogeneity of ages between size-classes 2 to 5. This study provides new insights about the demography of Guinean savanna grasses that could be used to describe the mechanisms of their coexistence, and inform fire management policies.

AB There is limited understanding of the genetic variability in Phytophthora infestans in the major potato cultivation region of north-western Russia, where potato is grown primarily by small households with limited chemical treatment of late blight. In this study, the mating type, sensitivity to metalaxyl, and genotype and population genetic diversity (based on 12 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers) of 238 isolates of P. infestans from the Pskov region during the years 2010-2013 were characterized. The aim was to examine the population structure, phenotypic and genotypic diversity, and the prevalent reproductive mode of P. infestans, as well as the influence of the location, time, and agricultural management practices on the pathogen population. The frequency of the A2 mating was stable over the four seasons and ranged from 33 to 48% of the sampled population. Both mating types occurred simultaneously in 90% of studied fields, suggesting the presence of sexual reproduction and oospore production in P. infestans in the Pskov region. Metalaxyl-sensitive isolates prevailed in all four years (72%), however, significantly fewer sensitive isolates were found in samples from large-scale conventional fields. A total of 50 alleles were detected in the 141 P. infestans isolates analyzed for genetic diversity. Amongst the 83 SSR multilocus genotypes (MLGs) detected, 65% were unique and the number of MLGs varied between locations from 3 to 20. These results, together with the high genotypic diversity observed in all the locations and the lack of significance of linkage disequilibrium, suggest that sexual recombination is likely responsible for the unique MLGs and the high genetic diversity found in the Pskov region population, resembling those of north-eastern European populations.

AB Multilevel societies (MLSs) are present in several animal clades and our understanding of them is growing at a time with increasing habitat loss. The ways individuals in these complex societies respond to habitat restriction and fragmentation are unknown. We examined ranging and feeding competition in a Ruwenzori Angolan colobus MLS in a forest fragment at Nabugabo, Uganda. We analyzed GPS points collected over 2 years and scan samples collected over 10 months on 12 core units in one band to compare sex- and core unit-specific activity budgets and near-neighbor distances. The 95% home range size estimate of this band was 1.75 km(2), much smaller than the ranges of similar-sized bands of primate MLS in continuous habitats. Day range length was also shorter. The colobus rarely utilized the matrix and over the two-year period core units' home ranges overlapped by 93%. Indicators of scramble competition included more time spent feeding in larger core units, near-neighbors at greater distances when feeding relative to resting, and greater feeding for females compared to males. A quadratic relationship was found between core unit size and home range and core area size, where intermediate-sized units showed the smallest ranges. All units showed similarly tortuous paths; however, the smallest core units had the longest day range lengths and the fastest rates of travel. We conclude that while large core units suffer some food competition, small units may be displaced more in inter-unit contests because they appear to suffer the highest energetic costs searching for food within this constricted area. Significance statement Wildlife worldwide is faced with increasing habitat loss and fragmentation. How this impacts animals that live in large, complex societies (e.g., multilevel societies) is an important question to investigate for future conservation. We examined ranging behavior and food competition for a multilevel society of Rwenzori Angolan colobus monkeys (12 core units, 139 monkeys) in Uganda that occupies a relatively small forest fragment. We found scramble competition for food, especially in the largest core units. However, membership in the smallest core units seemed to be the most energetically costly. These units moved the most per day and the fastest, perhaps because they were unable to displace larger core units from food patches. Overall, this multilevel society occupied an area many times smaller than similar-sized primate multilevel societies in continuous habitat and moved far less, suggesting that fragmentation is constraining their range.

AB To meet international and national commitments to decrease emissions of fossil fuels, cities around the world must obtain information on their historical levels of emissions, identifying hotspots that require special attention. Direct atmospheric measurements of pollution sources are almost impossible to obtain retrospectively. However, tree rings serve as an archive of environmental information for reconstructing the temporal and spatial distribution of fossil-fuel emissions in urban areas. Here, we present a novel methodology to reconstruct the spatial and temporal contribution of fossil-fuel CO2 concentration ([CO2F]) in the urban area of Medellin, Colombia. We used a combination of dendrochronological analyses, radiocarbon measurements, and statistical modeling. We obtained annual maps of [CO2F] from 1977 to 2018 that describe changes in its spatial distribution over time. Our method was successful at identifying hotspots of emissions around industrial areas, and areas with high traffic density. It also identified temporal trends that may be related to socioeconomic and technological factors. We observed an important increase in [CO2F] during the last decade, which suggests that efforts of city officials to reduce traffic and emissions did not have a significant impact on the contribution of fossil fuels to local air. The method presented here could be of significant value for city planners and environmental officials from other urban areas around the world. It allows identifying hotspots of fossil fuels emissions, evaluating the impact of previous environmental policies, and planning new interventions to reduce emissions.

AB Forest height inversion with Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) has become a research hotspot in the field of radar remote sensing. In this paper, we systematically studied a modified two-step, three-stage inversion simulating the L-band (L = 23 cm) full-polarization interferometric SAR data with an average forest height of 18 m using ESA PolSARpro-SIM software. We applied this method to E-SAR L-band single-baseline full PolInSAR data in 2003. In the first step, we modified the three-stage inversion algorithm based on phase diversity (PD)/maximum coherence difference (MCD) coherence optimization methods, corresponding to PD, MCD, respectively. In the second step, we introduced the coherence amplitude inversion term and modified the fixed weight to the variable of epsilon times the ground scattering ratio, which improved the accuracy of forest height inversion. The mean of forest height inversion by the HV method was the lowest (15.83 m) and the RMSE was the largest (4.80 m). The PD method was superior to the HV method with RMSE (4.60 m). The MCD method was slightly better than using the PD method with the smallest RMSE (4.43 m). After adding the coherence amplitude term, the RMSE was improved by 0.15 m, 0.14 m, and 0.08 m, respectively. The smallest RMSE was obtained by MCD, followed by the PD and HV methods. Although the robustness of the forest height inversion algorithm was reduced, the underestimation was improved and the RMSE was reduced. Due to the complexity of the real SAR E-SAR L-band single-baseline full PolInSAR data and the small sample sizes, the three-stage inversion methods based on coherent optimization were lower than the three-stage in-version method. After introducing the coherent magnitude term, the overestimation of the forest height was significantly weakened in HVWeight, PDweight, and MCDWeight, and PDWeight was optimal. The modified two-step, three-stage inversion algorithm had significant effects in alleviating forest height underestimation and overestimation, improving the accuracy of forest height inversion, and laying a foundation for the upcoming L-band SAR satellite generation, new SAR and LIDAR systems combined with RPAs (remotely piloted aircrafts)/UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) for small areas mapping initiatives, and promoting the depth and breadth of the SAR applications of the new SAR system.

AB The new wave of reform of collective forestland tenure (NRCFT) in China is considered an important policy for achieving sustainable management of forest resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of NRCFT on forest fragmentation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China based on a fixed-effects model. The forest fragmentation was analyzed based on the remote sensing images of Landsat and landscape pattern indices in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that (1) The NRCFT has significantly contributed to reducing forest fragmentation. (2) The effect of economic growth on forest fragmentation showed an inverted U-shape. (3) The implementation of the Grain for Green Program (GGP) and the transformation of rural energy consumption significantly reduce the degree of forest fragmentation. This study has crucial implications for formulating policies, achieving good forest governance, and reducing forest fragmentation.

AB A vast literature indicates that environment plays a paramount role in determining floristic composition in tropical forests. However, it remains unclear which are the most important environmental factors and their relative effect across different spatial scales, plant life forms or forest types. This study reviews the state of knowledge on the effect of soil and climate on floristic composition in tropical forests. From 137 publications, we collated information regarding: (1) spatial scale, continent, country, life form, and forest type; (2) proportion of variance in floristic composition explained by soil and climatic variables and how it varies across spatial scales; and (3) which soil and climate variables had a significant relationship on community composition for each life form and forest type. Most studies were conducted at landscape spatial scales (67%) and mainly in South America (74%), particularly in Brazil (40%). Studies majorly focused on trees (82%) and on lowland evergreen tropical forests (74%). Both soil and climate variables explained in average the same amount (14% each) of the variation observed in plant species composition, although soils appear to exert a stronger influence at smaller spatial scales while climate effect increases toward larger ones. Temperature, precipitation, seasonality, soil moisture, soil texture, aluminum, and base cations-calcium and magnesium-and their related variables (e.g., cation exchange capacity, or base saturation) were frequently reported as important variables in structuring plant communities. Yet there was variability when comparing different life forms or forest types, which renders clues about certain ecological peculiarities. We recommend the use of standardized protocols for collecting environmental and floristic information in as much as possible, and to fill knowledge gaps in certain geographic regions. These actions will be especially beneficial to share uniform data between researchers, conduct analysis at large spatial scales and get a better understanding of the link between soils and climate gradients and plant strategies, which is key to propose better conservation policies under the light of global change.

AB Understanding the factors that shape the diversity and composition of biotic communities in natural and human-modified landscapes remains a key issue in ecology. Here, we evaluate how functional traits, species diversity and community composition of palm species vary in relation to biogeographic variables and forest age in northwest Ecuador. Functional traits capture essential aspects of species' ecological tradeoffs and roles within an ecosystem, making them useful in determining the ecological consequences of environmental change, but they have not been used as commonly as more traditional metrics of species diversity and community composition. We inventoried palm communities in 965 10 x 10 m plots arrayed in linear transects placed in forests of varying age. Adult palms in forests of younger regeneration stages were characterized by species with greater maximum stem height, greater maximum stem diameter, and solitary stems. The shift in functional features could indicate that shade tolerant palms are more common in old-growth forest. The shift could also reflect the legacy of leaving canopy palms as remnants in areas that were cleared and then allowed to regrow. Moreover, younger forest age was associated with decreased abundance and altered species composition in both juvenile and adult palms, and decreased species richness in adults. These results highlight the importance of retaining intact, old-growth forest to preserve functional and species diversity and highlight the importance of considering multiple aspects of diversity in studies of vegetation communities.

AB Aim The biotic assembly of one of the most species-rich savannas, the Brazilian Cerrado, has involved recruitment of lineages from several surrounding regions. However, we lack a clear understanding about the timing and pathways of biotic exchanges among these regions and about the role those interchanges had in the assembly of Neotropical biodiversity. We investigated the timing and routes of species movements between wet or seasonally dry habitats across Neotropical regions and assessed the potential for ecological adaptation by evaluating the habitat transitions correlated with morphological shifts. Location Neotropics. Taxon The plant genus Anemopaegma (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae). Methods We inferred a Bayesian molecular phylogeny of Anemopaegma using one nuclear and two chloroplast markers. We sampled more than 90% of the known species diversity of Anemopaegma, covering its full geographical range. We estimated divergence times using a Bayesian relaxed-clock approach and inferred ancestral ranges as well as shifts in habitat and morphological characters. Results Phylogenetic analyses recovered seven main clades within Anemopaegma. The genus likely originated in Amazonia in the late Oligocene. Early-diverging lineages diversified in situ in Amazonia, particularly during the Miocene, with independent dispersal events to the Andes, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. Shifts from seasonally dry forest to savanna habitats were correlated with shifts from liana to shrub and the loss of tendrils. Main Conclusions The timing of diversification of major lineages within Anemopaegma is consistent with major geological and climatic events that occurred during the late Palaeogene and Neogene, such as the Andean uplift and the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum. Movements across different regions within the Neotropics were relatively common but shifts between habitats were not. The correlation in the evolution of the shrubby habit, the loss of tendrils and the shifts from forest to savanna are consistent with a scenario of ecological adaptation.

AB Among tropical forests, lianas are predicted to have a growth advantage over trees during seasonal drought, with substantial implications for tree and forest dynamics. We tested the hypotheses that lianas maintain higher water status than trees during seasonal drought and that lianas maximize leaf cover to match high, dry-season light conditions, while trees are more limited by moisture availability during the dry season. We monitored the seasonal dynamics of predawn and midday leaf water potentials and leaf phenology for branches of 16 liana and 16 tree species in the canopies of two lowland tropical forests with contrasting rainfall regimes in Panama. In a wet, weakly seasonal forest, lianas maintained higher water balance than trees and maximized their leaf cover during dry-season conditions, when light availability was high, while trees experienced drought stress. In a drier, strongly seasonal forest, lianas and trees displayed similar dry season reductions in leaf cover following strong decreases in soil water availability. Greater soil moisture availability and a higher capacity to maintain water status allow lianas to maintain the turgor potentials that are critical for plant growth in a wet and weakly seasonal forest but not in a dry and strongly seasonal forest.

AB The expansions and contractions of a species' range in response to temporal changes in selective filters leave genetic signatures that can inform a more accurate reconstruction of their evolutionary history across the landscape. After a long period of continental decline, Australian rainforests settled into localized patterns of contraction or expansion during the climatic fluctuations of the Quaternary. The environmental impacts of recurring glacial and interglacial periods also intensified the arrival of new lineages from the Sunda shelf, and it can be expected that immigrant versus locally persistent taxa responded to environmental challenges in quantifiably different manner. To investigate how such differences impact on species' distribution, we contrast landscape genomic patterns and changes in habitat availability between a species with a long continental history on Doryphora sassafras and a Sunda-derived species (Toona ciliata), across a distributional overlap. Extensive landscape-level homogeneity across chloroplast and nuclear genomes for the Sunda-derived T. ciliata, characterize the genetic signature of a very recent invasion and a rapid southern "exploratory" expansion that had not been previously recorded in the Australian flora (i.e., of Gondwanan origin or Sahul-derived). In contrast, D. sassafras is consistent with other Sahul-derived species characterized by strong geographical divergence and regional differentiation. Interestingly, our findings suggest that admixture between genetically divergent populations during expansion events might be a contributing factor to the successful colonization of novel habitats. Overall, this study identifies some of the mechanisms regulating the rearrangements in species distributions and assemblage composition that follow major environmental shifts, and reminds us how a species' current range might not necessarily define species' habitat preference, with the consequence that estimates of past or future range might not always be reliable.

AB Within estuarine and coastal ecosystems globally, extensive habitat degradation and loss threaten critical ecosystem functions and necessitate widescale restoration efforts. There is abundant evidence that ecological processes and species interactions can vary with habitat characteristics, which has important implications for the design and implementation of restoration efforts aimed at enhancing specific ecosystem functions and services. We conducted an experiment examining how habitat characteristics (presence; edge vs. interior) influence the communities of resident fish and mobile invertebrates on restored oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs. Similar to previous studies, we found that restored reefs altered community composition and augmented total abundance and biomass relative to unstructured sand habitat. Community composition and biomass also differed between the edge and interior of individual reefs as a result of species-specific patterns over small spatial scales. These patterns were only weakly linked to oyster density, suggesting that other factors that vary between edge and interior (e.g. predator access or species interactions) are likely more important for community structure on oyster reefs. Fine-scale information on resident species' use of oyster reefs will help facilitate restoration by allowing decision makers to optimize the amount of edge versus interior habitat. To improve the prediction of faunal use and benefits from habitat restoration, we recommend investigations into the mechanisms shaping edge and interior preferences on oyster reefs.

AB Cerradomys is a genus of the tribe Oryzomyini with eight species currently recognized, and a controversial taxonomy. These species are mainly distributed in the South America dry diagonal, but some species extend into Atlantic Forest, reaching the coastal sandy plains known as Restingas. This study aimed to address species limits and patterns of diversification of Cerradomys species. For this purpose, we performed cytogenetic and molecular analyses (phylogeny, coalescent species delimitation, barcoding, and divergence times estimation) using multiple mitochondrial and nuclear markers on a comprehensive sampling, representing all nominal taxa reported so far. Chromosomal information was a robust marker recognizing eight Cerradomys species. Reciprocal monophyly was recovered for all the species, except for C. subflavus. These results together with coalescent analyses recovered eight species as the most congruent species delimitation scenario for the genus (mean Ctax: 0.72). Divergence time estimates revealed that Cerradomys' diversification occurred about 1.32 million years ago (Mya) during the Pleistocene. Although our results conservatively support the eight Cerradomys species described so far, different lines of evidence suggest that C. langguthi and C. subflavus could potentially be species-complexes. We discussed this scenario in the light of multiple evolutionary processes within and between species and populations, since Cerradomys comprises a species group with recent diversification affected by Pleistocene climatic changes and by the complex biogeographic history of South America dry diagonal. This work supports that the diversity of Cerradomys is underestimated and reiterates that interdisciplinary approaches are mandatory to identify small rodent species properly, and to unhide cryptic species.

AB Natural habitats are increasingly affected by anthropogenically driven environmental changes resulting from habitat destruction, chemical and light pollution, and climate change. Organisms inhabiting such habitats are faced with novel disturbances that can alter their modes of signaling. Coloration is one such sensory modality whose production, perception and function is being affected by human-induced disturbances. Animals that acquire pigment derivatives through diet are adversely impacted by the introduction of chemical pollutants into their environments as well as by general loss of natural habitat due to urbanization or logging leading to declines in pigment sources. Those species that do manage to produce color-based signals and displays may face disruptions to their signaling medium in the form of light pollution and turbidity. Furthermore, forest fragmentation and the resulting breaks in canopy cover can expose animals to predation due to the influx of light into previously dark environments. Global climate warming has been decreasing snow cover in arctic regions, causing birds and mammals that undergo seasonal molts to appear conspicuous against a snowless background. Ectotherms that rely on color for thermoregulation are under pressure to change their appearances. Rapid changes in habitat type through severe fire events or coral bleaching also challenge animals to match their backgrounds. Through this review, we aim to describe the wide-ranging impacts of anthropogenic environmental changes on visual ecology and suggest directions for the use of coloration both as an indicator of ecological change and as a tool for conservation.

AB Countries in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and along the Red Sea are particularly vulnerable to coral reef degradation, and understanding the degree of connectivity among coral reefs is a first step toward efficient conservation. The aim of this study is to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity patterns of the broadcast spawning coral Acropora tenuis, first at a large scale comparing the Red Sea and the WIO, and second at a smaller scale comparing sites within the WIO. In total 689 individual A. tenuis colonies were sampled on 28 locations in Saudi Arabia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar and analysed with seven microsatellite markers. The sample site in the Red Sea was found to be differentiated from all other sites in the WIO, which confirms the hypothesised genetic break. High differentiation was found between the African mainland and Madagascar and within Madagascar. However, there is evidence for long-distance larval dispersal for A. tenuis in the North Mozambique Channel region, with exchange between northern Mozambique and northern Madagascar. The sites in the southwest of Madagascar show mixing with sites in northern Madagascar, as well as exchange with sites in northern Mozambique and Tanzania. Southern Mozambique forms a separate group in Bayesian clustering. High genetic connectivity was found for most sites along the East African mainland coast, with no indication for strict genetic barriers. These results support biophysical modelling studies, which propose Tanzania as a seeding source of larvae for downstream Kenya. These patterns of high genetic connectivity combined with contemporary dispersal barriers can be explained by the long larval duration of A. tenuis and the prevailing northbound East African Coast Current that facilitates higher genetic connectivity along the northern East African Coast, while eddies in the Mozambique Channel are causing larval retention in southern Mozambique and Madagascar.

AB Fire can change gallery forest vegetation structure, thereby altering nutrient fluxes between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In Brazilian savannas, which are fire-prone ecosystems, the fire regime is changing due to human activities such as converting native vegetation to farmland and urban areas. Uncontrolled wildfires in these savannas can reach gallery forests, which are more sensitive to fire impacts, leading to concerns about the effects of fire on gallery forest vegetation structure and freshwater ecosystems. We analysed the relationships between fire severity (the degree to which the fire has changed an area), percentage of burned area, variation in precipitation with gallery forest and savanna vegetation structure recovery and input of nutrients (NH4, NO2-, NO3- and PO43) to streams for 16 months after a fire event in five watersheds associated with small streams. One year after the fire, vegetation recovery (NDVI) was lower in gallery forest areas than in savanna woodlands, despite the more severe fires in savannas. The short-term effects of fire on gallery forest vegetation included increased nitrate concentrations in streams, which were also influenced by increased precipitation and the extent of the burned area. The nutrient inputs into the stream stabilized within 1 year. However, gallery forest vegetation did not fully recover at that time and may continue to alter the functioning of the aquatic ecosystem. Together, these results demonstrate the need for an integrated fire management plan that considers both gallery forests and the surrounding savannas in the landscape to address consequences to aquatic ecosystems.

AB Phosphorus (P) is often one of the most limiting nutrients in highly weathered soils of humid tropical forests and may regulate the responses of carbon (C) feedback to climate warming. However, the response of P to warming at the ecosystem level in tropical forests is not well understood because previous studies have not comprehensively assessed changes in multiple P processes associated with warming. Here, we detected changes in the ecosystem P cycle in response to a 7-year continuous warming experiment by translocating model plant-soil ecosystems across a 600-m elevation gradient, equivalent to a temperature change of 2.1 degrees C. We found that warming increased plant P content (55.4%) and decreased foliar N:P. Increased plant P content was supplied by multiple processes, including enhanced plant P resorption (9.7%), soil P mineralization (15.5% decrease in moderately available organic P), and dissolution (6.8% decrease in iron-bound inorganic P), without changing litter P mineralization and leachate P. These findings suggest that warming sustained plant P demand by increasing the biological and geochemical controls of the plant-soil P-cycle, which has important implications for C fixation in P-deficient and highly productive tropical forests in future warmer climates.

AB The study of community spatial structure is central to understanding diversity patterns over space and species co-occurrence at local scales. Although most analytical approaches consider horizontal and vertical dimensions separately, in this study we introduce a three-dimensional spatial analysis that simultaneously includes horizontal and vertical species associations. Using tree census data (2000-2016) and allometries from the Luquillo forest plot in Puerto Rico, we show that spatial organization becomes less random over time as the forest recovered from land-use legacy effects and hurricane disturbance. Tree species vertical segregation is predominant in the forest with almost all species that co-occur in the horizontal plane avoiding each other in the vertical dimension. Horizontal segregation is less common than vertical, whereas three-dimensional aggregation (a proxy for direct tree competition) is the least frequent type of spatial association. Furthermore, dominant species are involved in more non-random spatial associations, implying that species co-occurrence is facilitated by species segregation in space. This novel three-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify and quantify tree species spatial distributions, how interspecific competition was reduced through forest structure, and how it changed over time after disturbance, in ways not detectable from two-dimensional analyses alone.

AB Purpose Organic anions commonly released from plant roots and microorganisms are widely reported to mobilize soil phosphorus (P). We characterized soil organic P that was mobilized by organic anions and assessed its amenability to hydrolysis by phosphatase enzymes. Methods Six soils differing in organic P concentration were extracted with citrate, malate or oxalate solutions and incubated with preparations of phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, or phytase. Organic P compounds present in these extracts were putatively identified and quantified with solution P-31-NMR spectroscopy and the enzyme-labile P fractions were assessed by changes in molybdate-reactive P (MRP) concentration. Results Organic P mobilization varied markedly among the organic anions. Extraction with 10 mM citrate was most effective and extracted 7.8-fold more total P than the water controls across all soils. Approximately 95% of the extracted P was non-MRP. The organic anions increased both the amount of P extracted and the proportion of the total extracted P that was phosphatase-labile. Phytase was generally the most effective enzyme with up to 60% of the total non-MRP being amenable to hydrolysis by phytase across all extracts. The presence of inositol hexakisphosphates in the extracts, as well as other forms of organic P including nucleic acids and phospholipids, was verified by P-31-NMR with concentrations dependent on both organic anions and soil type. Conclusion The combination of organic anions and phosphatases represents a key mechanism by which plants and microorganisms can enhance the bioavailability of soil P. This has important implications for understanding P dynamics in natural and managed ecosystems and for ongoing efforts to improve the P-acquisition efficiency of agricultural plants.

AB 1. In thermally extreme environments, it is challenging for organisms to maximize performance due to risks associated with stochastic variation in temperature and, subsequently, over evolutionary time minimizing the exposure to risk can serve as one of the mechanisms that result in organisms preferring suboptimal temperatures.
   2. We tested this hypothesis in a slow-moving intertidal snail on tropical rocky shores, where temperature variability increases with time from 30 min to 20 hr when recorded at 30 min intervals (due to short-term environmental autocorrelation where temperatures closer in time are more similar as compared to temperatures over a long period of time). Failure to accommodate temporal variation in thermal stress by selecting cool habitats can result in mortality.
   3. Thermal performance curves for different traits (heart rate and locomotion) were measured and compared to the snail's thermal preferences in both the field and laboratory. Predicted performances of the snails were simulated based on thermal performance curves for different traits over multiple time-scales and simulated carryover effects.
   4. A strong mismatch was found between physiological and behavioural thermal maxima of the snails (physiological thermal maximum being higher by similar to 7 degrees C), but the snails avoided these maxima and sought temperatures 7-14 degrees C cooler. Such a risk-averse strategy can be explained by their predicted performances where the snails should make decisions about preferred temperatures based on time periods >= 5 hr to avoid underestimating the temporal variation in body temperature.
   5. In extreme and stochastic environments, where the temporal variation in environmental conditions can lead to substantial divergence between instantaneous and time-averaged thermal performances, 'cooler is better' and 'suboptimal' body temperatures are preferred as they provide sufficient buffer to reduce mortality risk from heat stress.

AB An increase in river water temperatures is being detected worldwide, with some predictions of an up to 4 degrees C rise by 2050. Such stream temperature increase is likely to affect aquatic communities, with predicted declines and range shifts of cold stenothermic species and a facilitated dispersal and population development in temperature-tolerant species, including invasive ones. This study analyzed how thermal changes affect macroinvertebrate community compositions in three differentiated thermal regions within a single stream system. In each thermal region, we used standard surber sampling in combination with in-stream cross-exposure experiments, comparing the thermal response of native vs. non-native gammarids (Gammarus roeselii and Dikerogammarus villosus). Macroinvertebrate species composition was highly dependent on temperature, with indigenous gammarids preferring colder sites and invasive ones such as D. villosus being dominant at higher temperatures. Species composition was also strongly affected by season, substratum and the presence of macrophytes. In light of climate change, consideration of shifts in community composition highly driven by temperature needs to become integrated with biological response patterns related to morphological and flow degradation, chemical pollution and fine sediment. Such an approach is crucial for the effective conservation and restoration of native biodiversity and for a realistic prediction of the ability to reach policy targets for aquatic ecosystems.

AB Metabolic cooperation is widespread, and it seems to be a ubiquitous and easily evolvable interaction in the microbial domain. Mutual metabolic cooperation, like syntrophy, is thought to have a crucial role in stabilizing interactions and communities, for example biofilms. Furthermore, cooperation is expected to feed back positively to the community under higher-level selection. In certain cases, cooperation can lead to a transition in individuality, when freely reproducing, unrelated entities (genes, microbes, etc.) irreversibly integrate to form a new evolutionary unit. The textbook example is endosymbiosis, prevalent among eukaryotes but virtually lacking among prokaryotes. Concerning the ubiquity of syntrophic microbial communities, it is intriguing why evolution has not lead to more transitions in individuality in the microbial domain. We set out to distinguish syntrophy-specific aspects of major transitions, to investigate why a transition in individuality within a syntrophic pair or community is so rare. We review the field of metabolic communities to identify potential evolutionary trajectories that may lead to a transition. Community properties, like joint metabolic capacity, functional profile, guild composition, assembly and interaction patterns are important concepts that may not only persist stably but according to thought-provoking theories, may provide the heritable information at a higher level of selection. We explore these ideas, relating to concepts of multilevel selection and of informational replication, to assess their relevance in the debate whether microbial communities may inherit community-level information or not.

AB Warming and drying from deforestation could amplify carbon storage losses in tropical remaining forests. Here the authors report this value to be extra 5.1% in the Amazon and 3.8% in Congo as compared to the direct biomass loss from deforestation.
   Biophysical effects from deforestation have the potential to amplify carbon losses but are often neglected in carbon accounting systems. Here we use both Earth system model simulations and satellite-derived estimates of aboveground biomass to assess losses of vegetation carbon caused by the influence of tropical deforestation on regional climate across different continents. In the Amazon, warming and drying arising from deforestation result in an additional 5.1 +/- 3.7% loss of aboveground biomass. Biophysical effects also amplify carbon losses in the Congo (3.8 +/- 2.5%) but do not lead to significant additional carbon losses in tropical Asia due to its high levels of annual mean precipitation. These findings indicate that tropical forests may be undervalued in carbon accounting systems that neglect climate feedbacks from surface biophysical changes and that the positive carbon-climate feedback from deforestation-driven climate change is higher than the feedback originating from fossil fuel emissions.

AB The well-established pattern of forest thinning during succession predicts an increase in mean tree biomass with decreasing tree density. The forest thinning pattern is commonly assumed to be driven solely by tree-tree competition. The presence of non-tree competitors could alter thinning trajectories, thus altering the rate of forest succession and carbon uptake. We used a large-scale liana removal experiment over 7 years in a 60- to 70-year-old Panamanian forest to test the hypothesis that lianas reduce the rate of forest thinning during succession. We found that lianas slowed forest thinning by reducing tree growth, not by altering tree recruitment or mortality. Without lianas, trees grew and presumably competed more, ultimately reducing tree density while increasing mean tree biomass. Our findings challenge the assumption that forest thinning is driven solely by tree-tree interactions; instead, they demonstrate that competition from other growth forms, such as lianas, slow forest thinning and ultimately delay forest succession.

AB In insect-pollinated plants, gene flow through pollen depends on the behaviour of pollinators when moving pollen, as well as the spatial distribution of the plants. For the perennial species Yucca valida, we evaluated gene flow mediated by its obligate pollinator, the yucca-moth Tegeticula baja. We also estimated genetic diversity and population structure throughout the plant's geographical distribution. Using nuclear microsatellites, we genotyped 405 individuals, representing 105 trees and progenies from 15 plants (300 seedlings). We estimated outcrossing rate, pollen donors, dispersion distance and genetic autocorrelation index, as well as diversity and differentiation indexes. We found that Y. valida has a mostly outcrossing mating system. Gene flow through pollen occurs over short distances (42 m) within a small reproductive neighbourhood (1.4 ha) where individuals are genetically related. Each mother plant's progeny has at least 2.8 pollen donors. Despite the inbreeding detected, interaction among yucca life-history traits may maintain high levels of genetic diversity and low differentiation among Y. valida populations. The spatial scale at which gene flow operates is essential in understanding the distribution of genetic variation within and between populations.

AB Background Standing genetic variation is important especially in immune response-related genes because of threats to wild populations like the emergence of novel pathogens. Genetic variation at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which is crucial in activating the adaptive immune response, is influenced by both natural selection and historical population demography, and their relative roles can be difficult to disentangle. To provide insight into the influences of natural selection and demography on MHC evolution in large populations, we analyzed geographic patterns of variation at the MHC class II DRB exon 2 locus in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) using sequence data collected across their entire broad range. Results We identified 31 new MHC-DRB alleles which were phylogenetically similar to other cervid MHC alleles, and one allele that was shared with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We found evidence for selection on the MHC including high dN/dS ratios, positive neutrality tests, deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and a stronger pattern of isolation-by-distance (IBD) than expected under neutrality. Historical demography also shaped variation at the MHC, as indicated by similar spatial patterns of variation between MHC and microsatellite loci and a lack of association between genetic variation at either locus type and environmental variables. Conclusions Our results show that both natural selection and historical demography are important drivers in the evolution of the MHC in mule deer and work together to shape functional variation and the evolution of the adaptive immune response in large, well-connected populations.

AB Seedling banks are very important in forest regeneration following forest disturbances such as crop cultivation. In 2011 and 2013 the Uganda National Forestry Authority (NFA) evicted encroachers from parts of Mabira Central Forest Reserve that had been under crop cultivation for over 40 years. This gave an opportunity for the vegetation to recover. In this study, we assessed the recovery process based on seedling bank diversity, richness and density in three blocks differing in recovery time. Two disturbed blocks, the Western Block (WB) (abandoned by encroachers 1-3 years), and the Eastern Block (EB) (abandoned 4-5 years) before this study and a nearby undisturbed area (intact) were included in the study. We recorded 48 seedlings species; 37 in WB, 30 in EB and 27 in intact. Differences in species richness were not statistically significant among blocks (F-2,F- 88 = 1.2420, p = 0.294). All seedling species found in the intact were found in the EB and WB. There were statistically significant differences in species diversity (Shannon-Wiener: F-2,F- 88 = 5.354, p = 0.006), density (P < 0.001) and composition (ANOSIM; R = 0.55, p = 0.001) among blocks. Apart from Broussonetia papyrifera, other species contributing to the dissimilarity (Acalypha neptunica, Antiaris toxicaria, Blighia unijugata, Funtumia elastica were late succession species. Animal dispersed species dominated intact. Seed-regenerating species were found in both WB and EB, but re-sprouts were more common in EB. These results show that proximity to intact forest aids forest recovery, even for areas with long-term cultivation history.

TI Importance of the forest state in estimating biomass losses from
   tropical forests: combining dynamic forest models and remote sensing
SO BIOGEOSCIENCES

   DISTURBANCES; IMPACT; DEATH; FIRE; CONSEQUENCES
AB Disturbances, such as extreme weather events, fires, floods, and biotic agents, can have strong impacts on the dynamics and structures of tropical forests. In the future, the intensity of disturbances will likely further increase, which may have more serious consequences for tropical forests than those we have already observed. Thus, quantifying above-ground biomass loss of forest stands due to stem mortality (hereafter biomass loss rate) is important for the estimation of the role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle. So far, the long-term impacts of altered stem mortality on rates of biomass loss have not been adequately described.
   This study aims to analyse the consequences of long-term elevated stem mortality rates on forest dynamics and biomass loss rate. We applied an individual-based forest model and investigated the impacts of permanently increased stem mortality rates on the growth dynamics of humid, terra firme forests in French Guiana. Here, we focused on biomass, leaf area index (LAI), forest height, productivity, forest age, quadratic mean stem diameter, and biomass loss rate. Based on the simulation data, we developed a multiple linear regression model to estimate biomass loss rates of forests in different successional states from the various forest attributes.
   The findings of our simulation study indicated that increased stem mortality altered the succession patterns of forests in favour of fast-growing species, which increased the old-growth forests' gross primary production, though net primary production remained stable. The stem mortality rate had a strong influence on the functional species composition and tree size distribution, which led to lower values in LAI, biomass, and forest height at the ecosystem level. We observed a strong influence of a change in stem mortality on biomass loss rate. Assuming a doubling of stem mortality rate, the biomass loss rate increased from 3.2 % yr(-1) to 4.5 % yr(-1) at equilibrium. We also obtained a multidimensional relationship that allowed for the estimation of biomass loss rates from forest height and LAI. Via an example, we applied this relationship to remote sensing data on LAI and forest height to map biomass loss rates for French Guiana. We estimated a countrywide mean biomass loss rate of 3.0 % yr(-1).
   The approach described here provides a novel methodology for quantifying biomass loss rates, taking the successional state of tropical forests into account. Quantifying biomass loss rates may help to reduce uncertainties in the analysis of the global carbon cycle.

AB Pyrus calleryana Decne. (Callery pear) is a deciduous tree native to China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. It is a popular ornamental tree in the United States (US) with early spring blooms and vibrant fall color. There are at least 26 cultivars of P. calleryana available in the US of which "Bradford" is the most well-known. Open-pollinated P. calleryana escapees are becoming one of the most common invasive tree species in the eastern United States. Developing better management practices for invasive P. calleryana requires detailed knowledge about reproductive biology and genetic diversity of the species, however, little is currently known about genetic variability within those open-pollinated populations. We investigated genetic diversity and population structure of non-cultivated, escaped P. calleryana populations within a similar to 177 km radius in the southeastern United States. Because P. calleryana exhibits a range of morphological variation with great evolutionary potential, we hypothesized that a high genetic diversity would be manifested among escaped P. calleryana. Using 15 previously developed microsatellite loci, we genotyped 180 open-pollinated P. calleryana individuals that were collected across six naturally occurring sites in Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina, United States. Our results demonstrated the presence of a population structure with high genetic diversity, high gene flow, and high genetic differentiation between individuals across collection sites. Our results revealed that P. calleryana populations had differentiated shortly after the introduction to the US, most likely from specimens imported from Asia, consistent with historical records and our prior findings. The high invasive potential of the species is perhaps best underscored by transformation of P. calleryana specimens introduced from Asia into escape populations at continental scale across the United States. Our data also provided novel insight into potential issues that could be problematic for the future as P. calleryana may pose a potential threat to the economy, ecology, and native biodiversity in invaded areas.

AB We examined the effects of artificial gap creation on the diversification of simplified stand structures in an abandoned coppice. A study plot was placed in a 49-year-old evergreen coppice, and two canopy gaps of ca. 100 m(2) were artificially created by logging in December 1992. In 2015-2016 (22-23 years after gap creation), stand structure was resurveyed and compared between a gap-treated plot (PT) and control plot (PC). PT was separated into gap (G), gap edge (GE), and forest interior (FI) parts, and their structures were compared. G and GE, where recruitment of new stems/individuals was expected, had no increase in small stems in 2015 and 2016, showing a mono-modal height distribution pattern in PT similar to PC. Species number also showed no difference between PT and PC, demonstrating a large proportion of species common to PT and PC. No species specific to G and GE was found. In PT, resprouted stems recovered their individual heights during the study period, resulting in a re-simplified local structure and canopy closure. From these results, we concluded that artificial gap creation in the studied stand was insufficient to diversify the stand structure at a mid-term (20 years) scale, and that repeated cutting and/or control of the resprouted stem density is required for diversification of abandoned coppices.

TI Ornithophily in the subtribe Maxillariinae (Orchidaceae) proven with a

AB Ornithophily has been long speculated to occur in the subtribe Maxillariinae (Orchidaceae), relying either solely on micromorphological analyses or scarce field observations of undefined species. In Guatemala we were able to observe regular visits of the azure-crowned hummingbirds feeding on flowers of Ornithidium fulgens. These observations have led us to investigation of floral attractants by means of scanning and transmission microscopy, histochemical and chemical analyses (GC-MS). Conducted investigation revealed that the epidermis of basal protuberance of column-foot has features proving the secretory activity and that secreted nectar is sucrose-dominant. Slight secretion on the middle part of the lip is puzzling. The presence of other potential pollinators has not been reported. Based on the results of this study, we confirmed that the flowers of O. fulgens meet all criteria of ornithophily and thus that the hypothesis about bird pollination in the subtribe Maxillariinae is proven. The presented results confirm that the previously described floral features predicting the bird pollination in this group are justified. This strengthens the theory about floral adaptations to different pollinators and gives valid reasons to consider species with flowers with a certain set of traits as ornithophilous, even in the absence of the pollination observation.

AB Hummingbird flower mites are assumed to monopolize single host plant species owing to sexual selection for unique mating rendezvous sites. We tested the main assumption of the mating rendezvous hypothesis-extreme host specialization-by reconstructing interactions among tropical hummingbird flower mites and their host plants using DNA barcoding and taxonomic identifications. We collected 10,654 mites from 489 flowers. We extracted DNA from 1,928 mite specimens and amplified the cytochrome c oxidase I (CO1) DNA barcode. We analyzed the network structure to assess the degree of generalization or specialization of mites to their host plants. We recorded 18 species of hummingbird flower mites from three genera (Proctolaelaps, Rhinoseius, and Tropicoseius) interacting with 14 species of plants. We found that generalist mites are common, and congeneric mite species often share host plants. Our results challenge the assumption of strict specialization that supports this system as an example of mating rendezvous evolution.

AB Forest fragmentation is a widespread phenomenon that directly or indirectly affects the processes that take place both in forest ecosystems and in their immediate surroundings. So far, many studies confirm its negative effects, especially on biodiversity. On the other hand, there are few studies that address the effects of forest fragmentation on the amount of accumulated biomass or carbon, as well as on the characteristics of wood resources in managed forests. Therefore, issues related to timber production, which are important from the point of view of multifunctional forest management, are omitted. The aim of our research was to add to the knowledge in this area. In particular, we focused on assessing the impact of forest fragmentation on wood resources based on an analysis of edge effects in forest patches (units formed by combining forest fragments characterized by structural connectivity). Vector data describing the topography of forest fragments in Poland and the results of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) from 2015-2019 were used as material for solving this problem. The results of our research showed that the effects of fragmentation on managed pine stands depend on the age of the stand and the fertility of the habitat. In young stands growing on barren or strongly barren habitats, growing stock volume turned out to be significantly higher in the edge zone. In older stands, especially on moderately fertile habitats, significantly higher resources were found in the interior zone of forest patches. Habitat quality also had a significant effect on the amount of carbon accumulated. In strongly barren habitats, higher carbon mass was found in edge zones, while in moderately fertile habitats, stands had higher carbon volume in the interior zone. Our results illustrate that forest fragmentation is a very complex process that can increase or reduce wood resources, depending on the age of the stand and the quality of the habitat. From the standpoint of measurable benefits, it was concluded that protection from the negative effects of fragmentation should focus primarily on older stands and more fertile habitats.

AB Infection may cause some insects to increase their body temperature to deal against pathogens successfully. However, one unclear aspect is whether females may use male temperature to discriminate sick from healthy partners. We tested this by using Tenebrio molitor beetles whose females use the intensity of male antennal and leg stroking that take place during mating, to discriminate among partners. We predicted that females will not choose males that are too hot and/or will penalize these male partners in terms of a reduced egg number and hatching success. We manipulated males by infecting them with an entomopathogenic fungus, and exposed these males versus control males to females. Infected and non-infected males increased their temperature during copulation but females did not choose on the basis of male's temperature or infection status. However, females laid fewer eggs and/or had a reduced hatching success after mating with infected males that had a body temperature higher than ca. 24 ?. We postulate that male temperature is another source of information involved in postcopulatory mate choice that, along with courtship traits, compose a multimodal signaling system.

AB Southern Amazonia harbors a wide diversity of aquatic macrophyte species because of its diverse wetland habitats and location in the Amazon-Cerrado transition zone, which spans the two largest biogeographic domains in South America. We investigated the taxonomic diversity of aquatic macrophytes in the region with a focus on endemism, species richness, and life forms. We present new records of aquatic macrophyte species and compare our results with other Brazilian phytogeographic domains. We found a high number of species of aquatic macrophytes for the southern Amazon region, comparable to extensive inventories in southern, northeastern, and northern regions of Brazil. We recorded 709 species of aquatic macrophytes in 313 genera and 97 families, which includes 90 species endemic to Brazil and five species endemic to the Brazilian Amazonia. The macrophyte species list of southern Amazonia showed < 25% similarity to inventories in Amazonia and Cerrado. This high diversity of aquatic macrophytes in southern Amazonia, with endemic species and others with restricted ranges, emphasizes the need for conserving these wetlands and vegetation types.

AB Studies on seed rain can provide useful information on the spatial distribution, density, and richness of species. This study aimed to sample the seed rain in "capties" with the presence and absence of Copernicia prunifera (Carnatba), characterizing the seeds as for their dispersion syndrome and life forms, and explore the relationship between the monthly rainfall totals and the density and number of species in the seed rain and the seasonality in seed deposition. The research was conducted in 20 capoes, (10 with the presence and 10 with the absence of Copernicia prunifera). Three collectors of 0.50 m(2) were placed in each capao. A total of 1,666 diaspores (55.5 seeds/m(2)), belonging to 17 families and 32 species, were collected. There was a negative relationship between rainfall and the number of seeds (r = -0.73 and p<0.05) and between rainfall and number of species in the seed rain (r = -0.78 and p<0.01). There was an increase in the number of species in the seed rain with an increase in the number of seeds (r = 0.74 and p<0.001). Twelve zoochoric, 12 anemochoric, and 7 autochoric species were recorded, which accounted for 908, 502, and 256 seeds, respectively. Trees had 895 seeds collected, distributed in 12 species, followed by shrubs (574 seeds and 10 species), lianas (133 seeds and 7 species), and palms (61 seeds and 2 species). Anemochoric and zoochoric dispersion syndromes predominated in the dry period, with a predominance of zoochory in all months. There was a difference in the species composition in the seed rain between the capties with the presence and with the absence of Copernicia prunifera. The distance between the capoes did not influence the seed rain composition (Mantel r = -0.11 and p = 0.74). There was no relationship between areas of capoes and the number of seeds in the seed rain (R-2 = 0.013 and p = 0.95).

AB Over the past decade public and private actors have been developing a variety of new policy approaches for addressing agriculturally-driven deforestation linked to international supply chains. While payments for environmental services (PES) have been advocated in many contexts as an efficient and pro-poor environmental policy to incentivize conservation, they have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism for leading to mixed and sometimes adverse environmental and social outcomes. It remains unclear whether such an approach is an improvement over existing approaches to govern sustainability in supply chains and especially as a mechanism for reducing ecosystem conversion. Here we conduct an ex-ante analysis to examine the potential outcomes of using a standalone PES scheme versus existing standalone market exclusion mechanisms (MEM) to govern commodity supply chains. The analysis develops a theoretical framework to examine the potential effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, and legitimacy of the two approaches and then applies this framework using qualitative analysis of secondary and interview data. Using this theory-driven evaluation approach we examine the case of the Brazilian Cerrado, where a PES mechanism is currently being proposed to achieve zero-deforestation targets in soy supply chains. We find that both standalone approaches suffer from different strengths and challenges and would be better used in combination. We conclude that a mixture of strict market exclusion with positive incentives and enabling programs that are targeted at the poorest farmers would be more effective, cost-effective, equitable, and legitimate. However, in the future such supply chain focused soy deforestation control efforts in the Cerrado must be complemented by broader jurisdictional approaches to addressing deforestation and sustainable development that include all land use actors, not just soy farmers. These more inclusive and balanced initiatives can help ensure that avoiding deforestation goes hand in hand with supporting sustainable livelihoods for a wider range of actors in the Cerrado.

AB Question: Is there a decrease in the richness, structural variables and composition similarity of woody Cerrado species with habitat-matrix distance, potentially influenced by soil compaction and propagule dispersal strategies in the pasture matrix?
   Location: We studied three landscapes of a pasture matrix in areas of the Cerrado biome in southwestern Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods: We sampled 110 plots of 2 m x 2 m in the matrix, stratified in ranges perpendicular to the edge of the habitat, and 10 plots in the forest with no edge effect (60 m from the edge). We undertook soil sampling and collected information about the plants (taxonomy, height, circumference and establishment form by germination or resprouting). We defined habitat distance as the predictor variable for the following response variables: abundance, richness, establishment form, mean height, mean diameter at soil height and dispersal syndrome of the individuals sampled; in addition to the porosity and bulk density of the sampled soil.
   Results: We found significant differences between habitat and matrix for abundance, richness, mean height and germination number, but non-significant differences for resprouting number and mean diameter at soil height. There was no relationship regarding matrix-habitat distances for structural variables, and habitat species composition was similar only for the first 10 m distance from the habitat edge.
   Conclusion: Pasture did not prevent plant establishment but might act as an environmental filter. Pasture matrices modify the composition and diversity of the plant community compared with the Cerrado community. Pastures are dominated by resprouting, autochory and grassland species. Regenerating plants from the propagule bank of the matrix showed the potential for natural regeneration of Cerrado areas in pasture as a restoration strategy.

AB Plant species have different traits for mobilizing sparingly soluble phosphorus (P) resources, which could potentially lead to overyielding in P uptake by plant species mixtures compared to monocultures due to higher P uptake as a result of resource (P) partitioning and facilitation. However, there is circumstantial evidence at best for overyielding as a result of these mechanisms. Overyielding (the outcome) is easily confused with underlying mechanisms because of unclear definitions. We aimed to define a conceptual framework to separate outcome from underlying mechanisms and test it for facilitation and complementarity with respect to P acquisition by three plant species combinations grown on four soils. Our conceptual framework describes both mechanisms of complementarity and facilitation and outcomes (overyielding of mixtures or no overyielding) depending on the competitive ability of the species to uptake the mobilized P. Millet/chickpea mixtures were grown in pots on two calcareous soils mixed with calcium-bound P (CaP) and phytate P (PhyP). Cabbage/faba bean mixtures were grown on both acid and neutral soils mixed with P-coated iron (hydr)oxide (FeP) and PhyP. Wheat/maize mixtures were grown on all four soils. Rhizosphere carboxylate concentration and acid phosphatase activity (mechanisms) as well as plant P uptake and biomass (outcome) were determined for monocultures rhizosphere and species mixtures. Facilitation of P uptake occurred in millet/chickpea mixtures on one calcareous soil. We found no indications for P acquisition from different P sources, neither in millet/chickpea, nor in cabbage/faba bean mixtures. Cabbage and faba bean on the neutral soil differed in rhizosphere acid phosphatase activity and carboxylate concentration, but showed no overyielding. Wheat and maize, with similar root exudates, showed overyielding (the observed P uptake being 22% higher than the expected P uptake) on one calcareous soil. We concluded that although differences in plant physiological traits (root exudates) provide necessary conditions for complementarity and facilitation with respect to P uptake from different P sources, they do not necessarily result in increased P uptake by species mixtures, because of the relative competitive ability of the mixed species.

AB In this study, we analyze the demographic rates and biomass dynamics of Lecythidaceae in a 100-ha permanent forest plot in the Central Amazon. We characterize habitats in the plot, analyze the effect of habitat on tree density, species richness, and biomass and demographic dynamics, and quantify significant species habitat associations. The plot experienced a 13.2 % net loss of Lecythidaceae individuals (n = 1023) but aboveground biomass (AGB; Mg ha(-1)) did not differ between the two censuses. Growth rates averaged 1.2 mm year(-1) with high intraspecific variation and differed significantly among species height classes. Stem density and species richness decreased in all six terra firme habitats and were significantly lower in both years in the flood disturbed habitat. Only the flood disturbed areas experienced a significant loss in AGB, along with the highest annual mortality, recruitment, and growth rates across the plot. The lower-lying habitats experienced higher mortality rates than the slopes and plateaus, suggesting too much moisture is a higher risk to Lecythidaceae individuals than drought in this plot. There were no overlapping habitat associations among sister species, or among the seven most abundant species, which suggests that terra firme habitat association provides a niche partitioning mechanism for closely related Lecythidaceae species. As intended with its establishment, this plot continues to provide integral baseline data for one of the most ecologically dominant and culturally significant tree families in the Amazon region.

AB The Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest, separated by the diagonal of open formations, are two ecoregions that comprise the most diverse tropical forests in the world. The Sphaenorhynchini tribe is among the few tribes of anurans that occur in both rainforests, and their historical biogeographic have never been proposed. In this study, we infer a dated phylogeny for the species of the Sphaenorhynchini and we reconstructed the biogeographic history describing the diversification chronology, and possible patterns of dispersion and vicariance, providing information about how orogeny, forest dynamics and allopatric speciation affected their evolution in South America. We provided a dated phylogeny and biogeography study for the Sphaenorhynchini tribe using mitochondrial and nuclear genes. We analyzed 41 samples to estimate the ancestral areas using biogeographical analysis based on the estimated divergence times and the current geographical ranges of the species of Sphaenorhynchini. We recovered three characteristic clades that we recognize as groups of species (S. lacteus, S. planicola, and S. platycephalus groups), with S. carneus and G. pauloalvini being the sister taxa of all other species from the tribe. We found that the diversification of the tribe lineages coincided with the main climatic and geological factors that shaped the Neotropical landscape during the Cenozoic. The most recent common ancestor of the Sphaenorhynchini species emerged in the North of the Atlantic Forest and migrated to the Amazonia in different dispersion events that occurred during the connections between these ecoregions. This is the first large-scale study to include an almost complete calibrated phylogeny of Sphaenorhynchini, presenting important information about the evolution and diversification of the tribe. Overall, we suggest that biogeographic historical of Sphaenorhynchini have resulted from a combination of repeated range expansion and contraction cycles concurrent with climate fluctuations and dispersal events between the Atlantic Forest and Amazonia.

AB Soil respiration (Rs) plays an important role in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the impacts of plant community functional traits on Rs is a key prerequisite for accurate prediction of the future carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems under climate change. This study examined the relationship of Rs with plants in the Ebinur Lake Basin in the arid desert region. Traditional statistical methods and geostatistical methods were used to study the spatial variation characteristics of Rs and to analyze the effects of plant community functional traits and environmental factors on the spatial heterogeneity of Rs. The variation in Rs in the arid desert area of the Ebinur Lake Basin showed a strong spatial dependence (C-0/(C + C-0) = 0.11) and a medium variation (alpha = 25.50, CV = 86.21%). Principal component analysis revealed that morphological traits of plants and soil water content had great contributions to PC1, soil nutrient had great contributions to PC2, and physiological traits of plants and soil temperature had large contributions to PC3. Multiple regression analysis showed that PC1, PC2, and PC3 can explain 83% of the spatial heterogeneity of Rs (F = 157.41, p < 0.01). In conclusion, maximum height, leaf width, leaf dry matter content, leaf thickness, and soil water content were the principal driving elements of soil respiration heterogeneity.

AB The rice-crayfish farming model has been rapidly developed and become an economically viable method to supply food in China in recent years. However, its environmental and economic sustainability has not been thoroughly investigated. This study uses a survey in 2016 and a field experiment in 2017 in Qianjiang, Hubei Province, China to assess the relative economics of concurrent rice-wheat (RW), rice-crayfish (RC), and crayfish monoculture (CM) models in waterlogged land areas. The field survey indicated that the RC model had a higher benefit-cost ratio (3.5:1) than the RW (2.0:1) and CM (3.1:1) models and the RC model protected farmers' enthusiasm for grain production facing unfavourable weather conditions. The field experiment aimed to explore nitrogen management strategies in RC fields. In the experiment, four levels of nitrogen concentration gradient -0 kg N ha(-1)(0 N), 75 kg N ha(-1)(75 N), 150 kg N ha(-1)(150 N) and 225 kg N ha(-1) (225 N), were set in a 2-year-old rice-crayfish (RC2) field, an 8-year-old rice-crayfish (RC8) field, and a RW field as a control. The field experiment results suggested that the peak rice yield in RW, RC2, and RC8 occurred when 225 N, 150 N and 75 N were used, respectively. In RC2 and RC8, however, residual feed-nitrogen that was not used by crayfish was utilized by rice plants. Thus, an optimal amount of nitrogen in RC fields was proposed to improve the nitrogen use efficiency and reduce environmental pollution by nitrogen fertilizer. Farmers use less nitrogen but have higher net income in RC than in RW and CM. It is necessary to sustainably develop integrated farming technologies (i.e., proper field configurations for rice fields) to effectively sustain rice production. The results also showed that the RC farming model was a viable diversification option for rice farmers in waterlogged land.

AB Aim: Biogeographic history and variation in modern environmental conditions can greatly influence local and regional community structure and, more generally, ecosystem functioning. This is clearly exemplified at the Isthmus of Panama where marine communities and environments from the Caribbean Sea and the Tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean differ despite ancient connections during the Miocene and Pleistocene. Here, we compare the functional (implied from traits) and isotopic structure of mangrove fish communities from those two biogeographic regions, which have been separated by the Isthmus of Panama for similar to 3 my.
   Location: Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Panama (Eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea).
   Methods: We gathered data on five functional traits (salinity preference, body mass, diet, position in the water column and lifespan) of mangrove fishes from the sampled regions. We also analysed delta C-13 and delta C-15 isotopic values and calculated functional isotopic metrics of the most abundant fish species inhabiting mangroves of these two regions.
   Results: The taxonomic composition and functional and trophic diversity differed between the mangrove fish communities of the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific. Although the species richness of both assemblages was similar, there was very little taxonomic overlap between them: Snooks (Centropomidae) numerically dominated in the Eastern Pacific, whereas grunts (Haemulidae) and snappers (Lutjanidae) dominated in the Caribbean Sea. Functional divergence (FDiv) and isotopic richness (IRic) were higher in the Caribbean than in the Eastern Pacific, indicating differences in the way fishes use mangroves in these areas.
   Main conclusions: Taxonomic and functional characteristics of mangrove fish assemblages across biogeographic realms can be strongly influenced by local environmental factors (e.g. tidal regimes, the presence of adjacent coastal ecosystems and productivity), and these can override similarities that recent historical connections of faunas might be expected to produce. All such aspects need to be considered when seeking generalizations about ecosystem functioning.

AB Agricultural expansion is among the main threats to biodiversity and functions of tropical ecosystems. It has been shown that conversion of rainforest into plantations erodes biodiversity, but further consequences for food-web structure and energetics of belowground communities remains little explored. We used a unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal groups studied, most of the taxa had lower litter-calibrated & UDelta;C-13 values in plantations than in rainforests, suggesting that they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' energy channeling) in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy channeling) in rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density, and species richness in plantations, providing guidelines on how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of energy through soil food webs. Our results highlight the strong restructuring of soil food webs with the conversion of rainforest into plantations threatening soil functioning and ecosystem stability in the long term.

AB In populations across many taxa, a large fraction of sexually mature individuals do not breed but are attempting to enter the breeding population. Such individuals, often referred to as "floaters," can play critical roles in the dynamics and stability of these populations and buffer them through periods of high adult mortality. Floaters are difficult to study, however, so we lack data needed to understand their roles in the population ecology and conservation status of many species. Here, we analyzed satellite telemetry data with a newly developed mechanistic space use model based on an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to help overcome the paucity of data in studying the differential habitat selection and space use of floater and territorial golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos. Our sample consisted of 49 individuals tracked over complete breeding seasons across 4 years, totaling 104 eagle breeding seasons. Modeling these data mechanistically was required to disentangle key differences in movement and particularly to separate aspects of movement driven by resource selection from those driven by use of a central place. We found that floaters generally had more expansive space use patterns and larger home ranges, as well as evidence that they partition space with territorial individuals seemingly on fine scales through differential habitat and resource selection. Floater and territorial eagle home ranges overlapped markedly, suggesting that floaters use the interstices between territories. Furthermore, floater and territorial eagles differed in how they selected for uplift variables, key components of soaring birds' energy landscape, with territorial eagles apparently better able to find and use thermal uplift. We also found relatively low individual heterogeneity in resource selection, especially among territorial individuals, suggesting a narrow realized niche for breeding individuals, which varied from the level of among-individual variation present during migration. This work furthers our understanding of floaters' potential roles in the population ecology of territorial species and suggests that conserving landscapes occupied by territorial eagles also protects floaters.

AB We reconstructed the mitochondrial phylogeny of the species of the brittle star genus Ophioderma, using sequences of the Cytochrome Oxidase I gene (COI) to address four questions: (i) Are the species of Ophioderma described on morphological evidence reflected in mitochondrial genealogy? (ii) Which species separated from which? (iii) When did speciation events occur? (iv) What is the rate of COI evolution in ophiuroids? We found that most of the 22 described species we sampled coincide with monophyletic clusters of COI sequences, but there are exceptions, most notably in the eastern Pacific, in which three undescribed species were indicated. The COI phylogeny lacks resolution in the deeper nodes, but it does show that there are four species pairs, the members of which are found on either side of the central American Isthmus. Two pairs with a genetic distance of similar to 4% between Atlantic and Pacific members were probably split during the final stages of Isthmus completion roughly 3 million years ago. The rate of divergence provided by these pairs allowed the calibration of a relaxed molecular clock. Estimated dates of divergence indicate that the lineages leading to extant species coalesce at times much older than congeneric species in other classes of echinoderms, suggesting that low extinction rates may be one of the reasons that ophiuroids are species-rich. The mean rate of COI substitution in Ophioderma is three times slower than that of echinoids. Conclusions of previous mitochondria! DNA studies of ophiuroids that relied on echinoid calibrations to determine divergence times need to be revised.

AB The leading causes of the worldwide decline in biodiversity are global warming, allied with natural habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we propose an analysis of the synergistic effects of these two factors in 63 species of Amazonian lizards. We predicted that the high-climatic suitability areas of species would be significantly impacted by different deforestation scenarios and the resultant landscape structure and considered that forest-dwelling species would be especially susceptible to deforestation scenarios. We also pointed out species threatened by both drivers and suggested critical areas for their future conservation. According to our results, most species will face future reductions in suitable areas for their occurrence according to five different patterns, two of which represent significant risks for 15 species. Some of these species already deal with severe habitat loss and fragmentation of their current distribution ranges, whereas others will suffer a considerable area reduction related to future range shifts. We emphasize the importance of protected areas (PAs), especially indigenous lands, and the need to plan combined strategies involving PAs' maintenance and possible implementation of ecological corridors. Finally, we highlight eight species of thermoconformer lizards that constitute present and future conservation concerns related to the combined effects of climate change and habitat loss and that should be carefully evaluated in extinction risk assessments.

AB Interactions between rainforest plants and fire occur when fires encroach into rainforest and when rainforest pioneers colonise fire-prone open forests. Although numerous studies show that many rainforest plants survive fire by resprouting and postfire seedling recruitment, data is lacking for several major Australian rainforest types. In this study, we examine fire-resilience traits among 228 taxa of woody rainforest plants in four rainforest classes (subtropical, warm temperate, dry and littoral rainforest) less than 1 year after being burnt in the extensive wildfires of 2019-2020. Among taxa with >= 5 records of complete crown scorch (126), resprouting occurred in 63% of taxa overall and 61% of late-successional taxa. Fire-cued seedling recruitment occurred in 62% of taxa overall and 48% of late-successional taxa. Surprisingly, species richness of woody plants increased 22% postfire due to high rates of persistence and emergence of new taxa into standing plant populations as seedlings. Stem density increased similar to 400% postfire due to high rates of resprouting and reproduction through suckering and seedling recruitment, although there was a significant redistribution from medium to smaller stem size classes. Larger stems (>10 cm diameter at breast height) were not significantly reduced in rainforest stands. High resprouting rates in small rainforest plants (1 cm diameter at breast height, 1 m tall) suggests rapid attainment of resprouting capacity. Our findings demonstrate that most subtropical, dry, warm temperate and littoral rainforest plant taxa are resilient to rare fires, and suggest that rainforest plants that invade rarely-burnt open forests may quickly become resistant to removal by infrequent fires, with potential for increased populations through fire-enhanced seedling germination.

AB Seed dispersal is critical to the ecological performance of sexually reproducing plant species and the communities that they form. The Mammalian order Carnivora provide valuable and effective seed dispersal services but tend to be overlooked in much of the seed dispersal literature. Here we review the literature on the role of Carnivorans in seed dispersal, with a literature search in the Scopus reference database. Overall, we found that Carnivorans are prolific seed dispersers. Carnivorans' diverse and plastic diets allow them to consume large volumes of over a hundred families of fruit and disperse large quantities of seeds across landscapes. Gut passage by these taxa generally has a neutral effect on seed viability. While the overall effect of Carnivorans on seed dispersal quality is complex, Carnivorans likely increase long-distance dispersal services that may aid the ability of some plant species to persist in the face of climate change.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant form of genetic variation in eukaryote genomes and may be useful for selection of genetically distant parents for crossing in breeding programs. In this study, genome-wide SNPs of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) were genotyped by using double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing to determine the genetic variation and differentiation among and within forage, turf and hybrid populations. After filtering, 16 036 SNPs were used to investigate genetic diversity and for structure analysis. SNP markers clearly differentiated the populations from each other. However, the hybrid population had a higher genetic similarity with the turf population than with the forage population. The results were confirmed by genetic differentiation (fixation index, Fst) and gene flow (Nm) statistics, so that low Fst and high Nm were observed between turf and hybrid groups, indicating less genetic distance and a high similarity between them. Based on the results of the weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean clustering, discriminant analysis of principal components and analysis of molecular variance, greater genetic differentiations were found among diverse turf, forage and hybrid populations, especially between turf and forage ones. In conclusion, numerous informative SNPs, natural allelic diversity-led domestication patterns, basic genetic variation statistics (e.g. Fst and heterozygosity) and population structures have multidimensional applicability for tall fescue genomics-assisted breeding.

AB Aim: Tropical South America, in particular Amazonia, has been identified as the area of the basal diversification of several large mammal clades. Whether this scenario also holds for younger and widely distributed clades remains unclear. Here, we assessed the historical biogeography of a young but diverse and widely distributed mammal Glade.
   Location: The Neotropics.
   Taxon: Long-tailed mice of the genus Oligoryzomys.
   Methods: We estimated a dated species tree by sampling five genes (one mitochondrial and four nuclear) from 30 of the 32 living species of the genus. We inferred the distribution of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of distinct species groups, using a 13 ecoregion scheme and fitting three biogeographical models, to simulate dispersal events under the selected model.
   Results: The DEC model best explained the diversification of Oligoryzomys. The MRCA of the genus had an age of similar to 2.64 Mya and its ancestral area was inferred as a large region encompassing Boreal and Southern Amazonia, Chaco and Tropical Andes. Subsequent vicariance events, followed by dispersal events towards the present, account for its diversification and wide distribution.
   Main conclusion: The biogeographical history of Oligoryzomys is complex. It originated in the northern half of South America; and then after a series of vicariant events, a series of dispersion events allowed it to colonize southern South America, the Andes and closer to the present Central and North America. This radiation, which constitutes one of the fastest and largest Pleistocene diversifications of Neotropical mammals, involves events previously suggested for other groups (e.g. Andean diversification), others that are novel for rodents and for the most part for South American mammals (e.g. the identification of the Chaco as a centre of diversification).

AB Background Seahorses, seadragons, pygmy pipehorses, and pipefishes (Syngnathidae, Syngnathiformes) are among the most recognizable groups of fishes because of their derived morphology, unusual life history, and worldwide distribution. Despite previous phylogenetic studies and recent new species descriptions of syngnathids, the evolutionary relationships among several major groups within this family remain unresolved. Results Here, we provide a reconstruction of syngnathid phylogeny based on genome-wide sampling of 1314 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and expanded taxon sampling to assess the current taxonomy and as a basis for macroevolutionary insights. We sequenced a total of 244 new specimens across 117 species and combined with published UCE data for a total of 183 species of Syngnathidae, about 62% of the described species diversity, to compile the most data-rich phylogeny to date. We estimated divergence times using 14 syngnathiform fossils, including nine fossils with newly proposed phylogenetic affinities, to better characterize current and historical biogeographical patterns, and to reconstruct diversification through time. We present a phylogenetic hypothesis that is well-supported and provides several notable insights into syngnathid evolution. We found nine non-monophyletic genera, evidence for seven cryptic species, five potentially invalid synonyms, and identified a novel sister group to the seahorses, the Indo-Pacific pipefishes Halicampus macrorhynchus and H. punctatus. In addition, the morphologically distinct southwest Pacific seahorse Hippocampus jugumus was recovered as the sister to all other non-pygmy seahorses. As found in many other groups, a high proportion of syngnathid lineages appear to have originated in the Central Indo-Pacific and subsequently dispersed to adjoining regions. Conversely, we also found an unusually high subsequent return of lineages from southern Australasia to the Central Indo-Pacific. Diversification rates rose abruptly during the Middle Miocene Climate Transition and peaked after the closure of the Tethys Sea. Conclusions Our results reveal a previously underappreciated diversity of syngnathid lineages. The observed biogeographic patterns suggest a significant role of the southern Australasian region as a source and sink of lineages. Shifts in diversification rates imply possible links to declining global temperatures, the separation of the Atlantic and Pacific faunas, and the environmental changes associated with these events.

AB The measurement of biodiversity at all levels of organization is an essential first step to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that drive spatial patterns of biodiversity. Ecologists have explored the use of a large range of different summary statistics and have come to the view that information-based summary statistics, and in particular so-called Hill numbers, are a useful tool to measure biodiversity. Population geneticists, on the other hand, have focused largely on summary statistics based on heterozygosity and measures of allelic richness. However, recent studies proposed the adoption of information-based summary statistics in population genetics studies. Here, we performed a comprehensive assessment of the power of this family of summary statistics to inform regarding spatial patterns of genetic diversity and we compared it with that of traditional population genetics approaches, namely measures based on allelic richness and heterozygosity. To give an unbiased evaluation, we used three machine learning methods to test the performance of different sets of summary statistics to discriminate between spatial scenarios. We defined three distinct sets, (i) one based on allelic richness measures which included the Jaccard index, (ii) a set based on heterozygosity that included F-ST and (iii) a set based on Hill numbers derived from Shannon entropy, which included the recently proposed Shannon differentiation, Delta D. The results showed that the last of these performed as well or, under some specific spatial scenarios, even better than the traditional population genetics measures. Interestingly, we found that a rarely or never used genetic differentiation measure based on allelic richness, Jaccard dissimilarity (J), showed the highest discriminatory power to discriminate among spatial scenarios, followed by Shannon differentiation Delta D. We concluded, therefore, that information-based measures as well as Jaccard dissimilarity represent excellent additions to the population genetics toolkit.

AB Over a million species face extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation policies that maximize the protection of biodiversity to sustain its manifold contributions to people's lives. Here we present a novel framework for spatial conservation prioritization based on reinforcement learning that consistently outperforms available state-of-the-art software using simulated and empirical data. Our methodology, conservation area prioritization through artificial intelligence (CAPTAIN), quantifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity protection, allowing the exploration of multiple biodiversity metrics. Under a limited budget, our model protects significantly more species from extinction than areas selected randomly or naively (such as based on species richness). CAPTAIN achieves substantially better solutions with empirical data than alternative software, meeting conservation targets more reliably and generating more interpretable prioritization maps. Regular biodiversity monitoring, even with a degree of inaccuracy characteristic of citizen science surveys, further improves biodiversity outcomes. Artificial intelligence holds great promise for improving the conservation and sustainable use of biological and ecosystem values in a rapidly changing and resource-limited world.
   Artificial intelligence methods can help biodiversity conservation planning in a rapidly evolving world. A framework based on reinforcement learning quantifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity protection and achieves better solutions with empirical data than alternative methods.

AB The Brazilian squirrel Guerlinguetus brasiliensis is the only sciurid species occurring in the Atlantic Forest. We investigated the geographical distribution of the genetic diversity of this sciurid species across the Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest, using two mitochondrial markers and one nuclear marker. We also inferred the demographic history and estimated the present and past habitat suitability for the species. We found strong mitochondrial DNA structure, possibly with both the Doce River and the valley of Paraiba do Sul River restricting gene flow between populations. The demography and ecological niche modelling highlighted a shared evolutionary history amongst several forest-dependent species in the Atlantic Forest. A pattern of isolation by distance was also found, revealing the low mobility and/or dispersal capacity of the species. Further data are required to disentangle exactly how past and/or recent habitat changes have affected population-level genetic diversity of G. brasiliensis.

AB Introduction The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) is undergoing alarming deforestation, land overexploitation, and unregulated occupation. The Coastal Sandy Vegetation of BAF, known as Restinga, is under the most pressure of the BAF ecosystems. Understanding the effects of Restinga deforestation on biodiversity is a conservation priority. Aims/Methods We predicted the effect of landscape modifications on the large-scale spatial distribution of an endangered dung beetle (Dichotomius schiffleri) endemic to the BAF Restinga ecosystem. We tested the hypothesis that almost all the potential distribution area of this species has suffered from landscape modification, and reduced its spatial distribution. We used niche-based modeling approaches to predict the potential species distribution (climate-based models) and the species distribution under the current land-use scenario (landscape-based models). We then combined these models to predict the effects of landscape modification. Results The spatial distribution of D. schiffleri has decreased drastically as a consequence of landscape modification. The decreasing patch size, canopy cover percentage, and functional connectivity, and the increasing edge distance explain the decrease in the potential species distribution as predicted by climate variables. Discussion Suitable sites for this species are isolated in a vast matrix of pasture, tree plantations, and urban areas. D. schiffleri is sensitive to anthropogenic changes such as disturbances of preserved Restinga areas. Therefore, human coastal-plain land uses over the past five centuries pose multiple synergistic threats to the persistence of this species. Implications for insect conservation Our findings suggest an alarming trend toward species extinction in the near future, highlighting the need for specific conservation actions to protect Restinga biodiversity.

AB Small habitat patches have been historically neglected in conservation, primarily because extinction risk is higher in small patches. Nevertheless, sets of small patches usually harbor more species than one or a few larger patches of equal total area. Resolving this inconsistency is key to policy and practice in biodiversity conservation. Our analysis of 32 datasets (603 patches and 2290 taxa) provides two novel lines of evidence confirming that small patches have disproportionately high value for biodiversity. First, sets of small patches harbor more species than large patches even when considering only species of conservation concern. Second, sets of small patches harbor more species than large patches even when the small patches are very small compared to the large patches. Therefore, higher extinction risk in small than large patches does not decrease the cumulative value of small patches for biodiversity. We contend that acknowledging the conservation value of small patches, even very small patches, will be a necessary step for stemming biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene.

AB Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important pollinators of wild and cultivated plants. Evidence suggests their populations are declining globally, threatening the availability of the free pollination services they provide. Conservation of bumble bees in the US is limited due to a paucity of research on the natural history of most species. The purpose of this exploratory study was to establish baseline data about the Bombus species present in agricultural landscapes in central Georgia, their phenologies and the plants with which they interact. Bombus were captured and identified to species and caste during 10-minute surveys at three sites in 2010 and two sites in 2011. Average weekly captures differed between years, and some phenologies varied from those in published literature. Results suggest that Bombus range maps might need to be updated and that high temperatures might negatively impact foraging. Bumble bees were captured on a variety of plant genera, but were not always carrying pollen, suggesting that some pollens could be more desirable than others. This study is the first record in the peer-reviewed literature of overall B. bimaculatus phenology in the USA. Long-term Bombus research across the United States is urgently needed for conservation of this ecologically critical genus.

AB Home gardening is an indigenous practice of cultivation that has effectively adapted to local ecological conditions over generations. This study examined the effects of disturbance and garden size on biodiversity to develop a better understanding of vegetation cover and its role in livelihood and provision of forest management in the Vindhyan highlands. Data were collected from 60 gardens which were classified into large (> 650 m(2)), medium (400-650 m(2)), and small (< 400 m(2)), based on size and disturbance gradients viz., high, medium, and low. A total of 133 species from 50 families were recorded, in which trees (47.4%) were dominant followed by shrubs (18%) and herbs (16.5%). With respect to disturbance, the highest number of tree species (39) were found at low disturbance (LD) followed by 33 species in medium disturbance (MD) and 32 species in high disturbhance (HD). The total mean richness of species was greater at LD (20.3 +/- 2.3) and lowest at HD (18.5 +/- 2.2). Tree density was significantly (P <= 0.05) higher at LD (293.75 +/- 16.1 individual ha(-1)) as compared to MD (221 +/- 11.5 individual ha(-1)) and HD (210 +/- 10.3 individual ha(-1)). However, the results for shrubs and herbs density were considerably different, where shrubs density was highest at HD (70 +/- 6.9 individual per 1,000 m(2)) and lowest at LD (62.5 +/- 5.8 individual per 1,000 m(2)), while the maximum density of herbs was recorded at MD (466.25 +/- 29.8 individual per 100 m(2)) and minimum at LD (370 +/- 21.4 individual per 100 m(2)). The summed dominance ratio indicated frequent use of garden plants in bio-fencing, vegetables, ornamental, and ethnomedicine. Diversity (P < 0.01) and species richness (P < 0.05) showed a significant positive correlation with garden size. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the first component (PC1) accounted for 28.6% of variance, whereas the second explained 21.9% of variance in both disturbance and garden size with a cumulative variance of 50.5%. These components depicted the positive association with HD (14.34), SDiv (13.91), TCD (12.47), and HDiv (12.09). We concluded that the diversity of home gardens changed with disturbance, which crucially served as a refuge for native tree species in a degraded landscape. This pattern highlighted the importance of home gardens for plant biodiversity conservation and local livelihood, which must be a viable option for regeneration of deforested dry tropics, while also reducing the burden on dry tropical forest regions.

AB Community-based ecotourism is a type of tourism that takes economic, environmental, and socio-cultural sustainability into account. This research aimed to identify tourism potentials for community-based ecotourism business development and mountain ecosystem conservation for livelihood improvement in the area near Bela Mountain. A cross-sectional study design with the mixed method was employed. Key informants' data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The majority, 88.8% agreed that Bela Mountain has huge natural physical tourism potentials and 91.3% of respondents agreed that the site has huge biological tourism potentials for community-based ecotourism development. Those biological tourism resources have a significant value for ecosystem conservation. The study area is full of man-made ecotourism potentials and the area is gifted with major cultural ecotourism resources. A combination of spectacular land scenery, diversified flora species, amazing cliffs and caves makes Bela Mountain and its environs a rich opportunity for the development of community-based ecotourism.

AB Background PRDM9 is a key regulator of meiotic recombination in most metazoans, responsible for reshuffling parental genomes. During meiosis, the PRDM9 protein recognizes and binds specific target motifs via its array of C2H2 zinc-fingers encoded by a rapidly evolving minisatellite. The gene coding for PRDM9 is the only speciation gene identified in vertebrates to date and shows high variation, particularly in the DNA-recognizing positions of the zinc-finger array, within and between species. Across all vertebrate genomes studied for PRDM9 evolution, only one genome lacks variability between repeat types - that of the North Pacific minke whale. This study aims to understand the evolution and diversity of Prdm9 in minke whales, which display the most unusual genome reference allele of Prdm9 so far discovered in mammals. Results Minke whales possess all the features characteristic of PRDM9-directed recombination, including complete KRAB, SSXRD and SET domains and a rapidly evolving array of C2H2-type-Zincfingers (ZnF) with evidence of rapid evolution, particularly at DNA-recognizing positions that evolve under positive diversifying selection. Seventeen novel PRDM9 variants were identified within the Antarctic minke whale species, plus a single distinct PRDM9 variant in Common minke whales - shared across North Atlantic and North Pacific minke whale subspecies boundaries. Conclusion The PRDM9 ZnF array evolves rapidly, in minke whales, with at least one DNA-recognizing position under positive selection. Extensive PRDM9 diversity is observed, particularly in the Antarctic in minke whales. Common minke whales shared a specific Prdm9 allele across subspecies boundaries, suggesting incomplete speciation by the mechanisms associated with PRDM9 hybrid sterility.

AB In this article, I lean toward the ecological site of ecotone and the act of crossing to think about the pedagogical decisions I made as a scholar and practitioner teaching Black studies and English education classes. Within the classroom, I suggest centering Black and Indigenous women's poetry to help students think about interdependence, ecological precarity, and ethical engagements. Black and Indigenous poets invite us to move beyond our disciplines into a cultivated ecotone, or space where we can unearth anti-Blackness in environmental education and invite intellectual curiosity and self-reflection. What is documented here is how I used my location between two disciplines, and intellectual curiosity in other fields/disciplines, to activate ecotonal crossings with my students that can move us toward more transformative ways of teaching, learning, and knowing.

AB Vegetation demographic models (VDMs) endeavor to predict how global forests will respond to climate change. This requires simulating which trees, if any, are able to recruit under changing environmental conditions. We present a new recruitment scheme for VDMs in which functional-type-specific recruitment rates are sensitive to light, soil moisture and the productivity of reproductive trees. We evaluate the scheme by predicting tree recruitment for four tropical tree functional types under varying meteorology and canopy structure at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We compare predictions to those of a current VDM, quantitative observations and ecological expectations. We find that the scheme improves the magnitude and rank order of recruitment rates among functional types and captures recruitment limitations in response to variable understory light, soil moisture and precipitation regimes. Our results indicate that adopting this framework will improve VDM capacity to predict functional-type-specific tree recruitment in response to climate change, thereby improving predictions of future forest distribution, composition and function.

AB Dispersal is generally difficult to directly observe. Instead, dispersal is often inferred from genetic markers and biophysical modelling where a correspondence indicates that dispersal routes and barriers explain a significant part of population genetic differentiation. Biophysical models are used for wind-driven dispersal in terrestrial environments and for propagules drifting with ocean currents in the sea. In the ocean, such seascape genetic or seascape genomic studies provide promising tools in applied sciences, as actions within management and conservation rely on an understanding of population structure, genetic diversity and presence of local adaptations, all dependent on dispersal within the metapopulation. Here, we surveyed 87 studies that combine population genetics and biophysical models of dispersal. Our aim was to understand if biophysical dispersal models can generally explain genetic differentiation. Our analysis shows that genetic differentiation and lack of genetic differentiation can often be explained by dispersal, but the realism of the biophysical model, as well as local geomorphology and species biology also play a role. The review supports the use of a combination of both methods, and we discuss our findings in terms of recommendations for future studies and pinpoint areas where further development is necessary, particularly on how to compare both approaches. This article is part of the theme issue 'Species' ranges in the face of changing environments (part I)'.

AB In mesic savannas worldwide, trees experience frequent fires, almost all set by humans. Management fires are set to reduce or enhance tree cover. Success depends greatly on responses of sub-adult trees to such fires. To date, the number of successive years that sub-adult trees can resprout nor the number of years that they must resist being top-killed by successive fires, nor the requisite height, have been reported. In a 6-year experimental field study in Guinean savannas of West Africa, we monitored annually the heights and responses of 1,765 permanently tagged sub-adult trees under annual fires set in three different periods of the long dry season: early-dry season (EDS), mid-dry season (MDS) and late-dry season (LDS). Annual MDS fires are the common local management protocols of Guinean savannas, although EDS fires are common in some of the savannas. Results showed that overall, the proportion of sub-adults that resisted being top-killed differed across fire seasons. Furthermore, resisting one fire gave a better chance of resisting the next. Only sub-adults that were able to resist direct damage for three successive EDS and MDS fires reached sufficient height to be recruited to the adult stage. Resistance height (avoiding topkill) was similar to 1 m for EDS and similar to 2 m for both MDS and LDS fires. Recruitment height (threshold for transition to adult stage) was similar to 3 m for EDS and similar to 3.3 m for MDS fires. No height was great enough for sub-adult trees to be recruited to adult stages in LDS fire. Synthesis and applications. The results of this novel field study showed clearly that successive early- and mi-dry season fires can enhance tree density and that successive late-dry season fires alone reduce tree density in Guinean savannas due to the effects of successive fires on sub-adult trees. The results suggest that a planned regime of these seasons of fire could be used to maintain the desired tree density in Guinean savannas and may inform fire management in other mesic savannas where goals are to increase or decrease tree densities. It also provides relevant information for comparative studies on the mechanisms of recruitment of sub-adult trees to an adult stage in all mesic savannas, a process that ultimately determines savanna physiognomy.

AB Invasive plants threaten biodiversity worldwide, but control of non-native species may affect native species in complex ways. Non-native tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) is widespread in western US riparian environments, and tamarisk beetles (Diorhabda spp.), a tamarisk-specific herbivore, were subsequently introduced as biocontrol. The primary effect of biocontrol is defoliation and branch die-back, with repeated defoliation killing the plant. We investigated the initial stages of site recovery after biocontrol and how tamarisk decline affected birds, their arthropod prey, and microclimate. We compared avian community diversity and composition, arthropod abundance, humidity, and temperature at sites along the Virgin River in Nevada and Arizona, USA characterized as either mixed native vegetation, tamarisk-dominated, or tamarisk-dominated where the majority of tamarisk died from biocontrol. We compared avian communities sampled after biocontrol to counts at the same locations before biocontrol. Prior to biocontrol, community compositions of all but one site grouped together using unbiased clustering algorithms. Following biocontrol, tamarisk-dominated sites grouped separately, and mixed sites grouped with the pre-biocontrol cluster. Comparison of pre- and post-biocontrol communities showed 7 common species declined by >= 30% in dead tamarisk sites, while one species did so at mixed sites and 3 at tamarisk-dominated sites. Individual census points in dead tamarisk had significantly lower Simpson diversity than the same points censused before biocontrol, unless native vegetation was present, suggesting tamarisk death was the cause of dominant species abundance changes. Tamarisk-dominated sites were hotter and drier than sites with native vegetation and supported fewer non-tamarisk-obligate arthropods, consistent with the hypothesis that bird reductions were driven by changes in microclimate and prey abundance. How long these effects last will depend upon the rate of native vegetation recovery after biocontrol, therefore we recommend monitoring sites to determine the trajectory of vegetative recovery and considering the need and feasibility of active restoration in those sites with slow or no native regeneration.

AB The nature and extent of effects of increasing densities of non-native species on stream ecosystems remain poorly understood. Non-native crayfish are among the most invasive aquatic species and we hypothesised that, in temperate streams, the extent of trophic modification increases with non-native crayfish density. Instream flow-through mesocosms in the River Lune, north-east England, were used over a 47-day period in summer to measure density effects of invasive signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus on different ecosystem components (benthic fish, macroinvertebrates, algal biomass, and leaf litter breakdown). Effects were measured through three density treatments (low, medium, and high; four, eight, or 12 crayfish with five bullhead Cottus perifretum per 1.5 m(2)) and two control (crayfish and fish absent; crayfish absent and benthic fish present) groups. Impacts of crayfish on macroinvertebrates (density, taxonomic composition), fish (growth, diet), algal standing stock, and decomposition rates increased with crayfish density. Direct effects of increased crayfish density were more important than indirect trophic cascade effects. Despite similar invertebrate abundance and richness across enclosures before introducing crayfish and bullhead, they differed significantly from controls at the end of the study, with >80% reduction in macroinvertebrate abundance recorded in the high-density group. Stable isotope (delta N-15, delta C-13) analysis showed that the trophic niche of bullhead, but not signal crayfish, changed when the species were in sympatry. Bullhead in treatment enclosures occupied a lower trophic position in the food web than those from the control group. Bullhead in the high-density group lost 4.2% of body mass over the study period, confirming the existence of resource competition. Leaf litter break down was 59.2% faster, and algal biomass was 91.4% lower in the treatment with the highest crayfish density compared to the control without study animals. This study indicates that signal crayfish, even at a low density, can strongly alter multiple ecosystem components in streams, and emphasises the need for minimising the spread of invasive crayfish within and between streams.

AB Identifying population structuring in highly fecund marine species with high dispersal rates is challenging, but critical for conservation and stock delimitation for fisheries management. European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a commercial species of fisheries and aquaculture relevance whose stocks are declining in the North Atlantic, despite management measures to protect them and identifying their fine population structure is needed for managing their exploitation. As for other marine fishes, neutral genetic markers indicate that eastern Atlantic sea bass form a panmictic population and is currently managed as arbitrarily divided stocks. The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are key components of the adaptive immune system and ideal candidates to assess fine structuring arising from local selective pressures. We used Illumina sequencing to characterise allelic composition and signatures of selection at the MHC class I-alpha region of six D. labrax populations across the Atlantic range. We found high allelic diversity driven by positive selection, corresponding to moderate supertype diversity, with 131 alleles clustering into four to eight supertypes, depending on the Bayesian information criterion threshold applied, and a mean number of 13 alleles per individual. Alleles could not be assigned to particular loci, but private alleles allowed us to detect regional genetic structuring not found previously using neutral markers. Our results suggest that MHC markers can be used to detect cryptic population structuring in marine species where neutral markers fail to identify differentiation. This is particularly critical for fisheries management, and of potential use for selective breeding or identifying escapes from sea farms.

AB Local people can act as sentinels for change, especially for wildlife populations not monitored by centralized governments. Responding to concern expressed by the Kitasoo Xai'xais (KX) First Nation over a decline in mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) sightings, our community-academic partnership assessed the conservation status of goats in KX territory and beyond in British Columbia by evaluating three independent information sources. Aerial surveys (2019 and 2020) over 542 km(2) revealed a low-density population (mean 0.25, SD 0.12 goats/km(2)), typical of peripheral coastal range. Interviews with KX Knowledge Holders revealed that sightings from sea level have declined sharply over 40 years, a period during which temperatures have increased and snowpack has decreased. Finally, Kill data (1980-2018) showed that kills/hunter/day initially increased among guided hunters before plateauing, but declined among resident hunters (similar to 70% of hunt days) in both coastal and interior BC. Convergent patterns among datasets suggest that coastal goats declined in abundance and/or reduced use of low-elevation habitat, disrupting a millennia-old relationship between KX people and goats, thereby posing a conservation concern. Broadly, our work shows that detecting threats to peripheral populations, and wildlife in general, can be informed and empowered by the knowledge of place-based peoples and associated decentralized management. Kitasoo Xai'xais First Nation mountain goat research illustrates roles of Indigenous peoples as sentinels of population and ecosystem change.

TI Microbiome Transmission During Sexual Intercourse Appears Stochastic and

AB Microbes inhabit virtually everywhere on and/or in our bodies, including the seminal and vaginal fluids. They have significant importance in maintaining reproductive health and protecting hosts from diseases. The exchange of microbes during sexual intercourse is one of the most direct and significant microbial transmissions between men and women. Nevertheless, the mechanism of this microbial transmission was little known. Is the transmission mode stochastic, passive diffusion similar to the random walk of particles, or driven by some deterministic forces? What is the microbial transmission probability? What are the possible evolutionary implications, particularly from the perspective of sexual reproduction (selection)? We tackle these intriguing questions by leveraging the power of Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity, specifically implemented as the HDP-MSN (hierarchical Dirichlet process approximated multi-site neutral model), which allows for constructing truly multi-site metacommunity models, simultaneously including vaginal and semen microbiomes. By reanalyzing the microbiome datasets of seminal and vaginal fluids from 23 couples both before and after sexual intercourses originally reported by Mandar and colleagues, we found that the microbial transmission between seminal and vaginal fluids is a stochastic, passive diffusion similar to the random walk of particles in physics, rather than driven by deterministic forces. The transmission probability through sexual intercourse seems to be approximately 0.05. Inspired by the results from the HDP-MSN model, we further conjecture that the stochastic drifts of microbiome transmissions during sexual intercourses can be responsible for the homogeneity between semen and vaginal microbiomes first identified in a previous study, which should be helpful for sexual reproduction by facilitating the sperm movement/survival and/or egg fertilization. This inference seems to be consistent with the classic Red Queen hypothesis, which, when extended to the co-evolutionary interactions between humans and their symbiotic microbiomes, would predict that the reproductive system microbiomes should support sexual reproduction.

AB Seedling recruitment, community assembly, and forest regeneration, while receiving substantial attention in tropical rain forests, have received little attention in tropical dry forests. Here, we examine the structure, composition, and diversity of woody seedling assemblages across 19 forest stands in a human-modified landscape of Caatinga dry forest, assessing the role played by rainfall, aboveground biomass, and chronic anthropogenic disturbances (i.e., livestock grazing pressure and wood extraction) as assembly forces. We quantified a large set of community-level attributes including functional traits related to water availability, physical protection, and survival success. We recorded a total of 544 seedlings from 59 species, giving a mean density of 28.6 +/- 15.8 (mean +/- SD) seedlings and 7.42 +/- 4.35 species per 1000 m(2). The 10 most abundant species accounted for almost 80% of all individuals, whereas nearly half of the species were considered rare (i.e., less than two individuals across the 19 forest stands). Seedling assemblages differed structurally and taxonomically from adult assemblages, exhibiting lower abundance, species richness, and divergent dominant species. Moreover, the dominant species of seedlings exhibited low adult-to-offspring ratios. Seedling species and assemblages were functionally diverse, with community-level attributes mostly affected by rainfall. Our results suggest that the Caatinga dry forest in sandy soils support seedling assemblages, to some extent, structured along environmental gradients, with rainfall and wood extraction acting as key community assembly forces. Although seedling assemblages are functionally diverse, they are relatively low density and taxonomically impoverished at local and landscape scales, potentially impacting successional trajectory and long-term forest dynamics. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

AB Tropical forests experience a relatively stable climate, but are not thermally uniform. The tropical forest canopy is hotter and thermally more variable than the understory. Heat stress in the canopy is expected to increase with global warming, potentially threatening its inhabitants. Here, we assess the impact of heating on the most abundant tropical canopy arthropods-ants. While foragers can escape hot branches, brood and workers inside twig nests might be unable to avoid heat stress. We examined nest choice and absconding behavior-nest evacuation in response to heat stress-of four common twig-nesting ant genera. We found that genera nesting almost exclusively in the canopy occupy smaller cavities compared to Camponotus and Crematogaster that nest across all forest strata. Crematogaster ants absconded at the lowest temperatures in heating experiments with both natural and artificial nests. Cephalotes workers were overall less likely to abscond from their nests. This is the first test of behavioral thermoregulation in tropical forest canopy ants, and it highlights different strategies and sensitivities to heat stress. Behavioral avoidance is the first line of defense against heat stress and will be crucial for small ectotherms facing increasing regional and local temperatures.

AB Background: Currently, 58 species are assigned to the genus Allobates, with 70% of its diversity described just in the last two decades, with many additional species likely unnamed. The continuous description of these new species represents a fundamental step for resolving the taxonomy and ensuring the future conservation of the genus.
   Methods: Using molecular, acoustic, and morphological evidences, we describe a new species of Allobates from Teles Pires River region, southern Amazonia, and provide accounts on the population of A. tapajos found sympatrically with the new species.
   Results: The new species is distinguished from its congeners by the coloration of thighs, venter, dorsum, and dark lateral stripe. It has four types of calls, with advertisement calls formed by relatively long trills with a mean duration of 2.29 s +/- 0.65, mean of 39.93 notes +/- 11.18 emitted at a mean rate of 17.49 +/- 0.68 notes per second, and mean dominant frequency of 5,717 Hz +/- 220.81. The genetic distance between the new species and its congeners in a fragment of the 16S mitochondrial fragment ranged between 13.2% (A. carajas) to 21.3% (A. niputidea). The sympatric Allobates population fits its morphology and acoustic with the nominal A. tapajos, but presents a relatively high genetic distance of nearly 6.5%, raising questions on the current taxonomy of this species.

AB The Atlantic Forest (AF) domain is one of the Earth's biodiversity hotspots, known for its high levels of species diversity and endemism. Factors related to palaeoenvironmental dynamics, such as the establishment of vegetational refugia and river basins, have different impacts on biological communities and biodiversity patterns in this domain. Here, we sample genome-wide RADseq data from a widespread treefrog (Dendropsophus elegans), inhabiting natural and human-impacted ecosystems at the Brazilian AF to test the impact of riverine boundaries and climatic refugia on population structure and diversification. We estimate divergence times and migration rate across identified genetic breaks related to the rivers Doce, Paraiba do Sul, Ribeira de Iguape, and Paraguacu, known to represent barriers to gene flow for other AF endemic species, and test the role of climatic refugia. Finally, we investigate the impact of spatio-temporal population history on morphological variation in this species. We recovered a phylogeographic history supporting three distinct clades separated into two geographically structured populations, corresponding to the north and south of AF. In addition, we identified an admixture zone between north and south populations in the latitude close to the Doce River. Our findings support a pattern of isolation-by-distance and the existence of a secondary contact zone between populations, which might have been promoted by gene flow during population expansion. Further, we found support for models considering migration parameters for all the tested rivers with different population divergence times. Based on the species history and the AF palaeoenvironmental dynamics, we corroborate the role of forest refugia impacting population structure for this species through recent range expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The Doce and Paraiba do Sul Rivers coincide with the main genetic breaks, suggesting they might also have played a role in the diversification processes. Finally, despite finding subtle correlations for phenotypic data among different populations, variation is not strongly detectable and does not seem associated with speciation-level processes that could warrant taxonomic changes. Such results can be explained by phenotypic plasticity of the evaluated traits and by recent divergence times, where there has been insufficient time and weak selective pressures to accumulate enough phenotypic differences.

AB Fine roots balance multiple essential plant functions that ultimately fuel plant productivity. The coordination of root functional traits is multidimensional, meaning that some traits are correlated while others can vary independently. This leads to a large variety of adaptive trait combinations and thus functional diversity in plant belowground morphology, anatomy, physiology and symbioses with soil biota. Within forest communities, co-occurrence of such belowground trait combinations may be especially prevalent in tropical forests, not only due to their immense biodiversity but also because their soils are frequently weathered and limited in phosphorus. Phosphorus occurs in different forms (that differ in their mobility and accessibility) that may select for different trait combinations on relatively small spatial scales. While evidence accumulates of the myriad viable nutrient acquisition strategies on poor tropical soils, they are not well conceptualized. In this study, we outline criteria for the identification and investigation of fine-root trait syndromes. We then apply these criteria to a case study of tropical tree species adapted to phosphorus-poor soil and synthesize a range of traits. Five potentially coexisting syndromes are presented that are distinguished by root morphology, mycorrhizal association type, their interactions and implications for fine-root functioning. We connect the functional variation of these species-level syndromes in tropical communities to an established phosphorus partitioning hypothesis. The co-occurrence of fine-root trait syndromes could have implications for root sampling design, species coexistence, community structure and biogeochemical cycling.

AB Understanding how genetic variation is spatially distributed is necessary for understanding the processes that generate and maintain biodiversity. However, there has been little investigation into the phylogeography of widespread forest trees in Aotearoa New Zealand with studies to date showing little congruence in phylogeographic patterns. Pseudopanax crassifolius (lancewood/horoeka) is a widespread lowland forest tree endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand. We investigated the phylogeography of this species using microsatellites and chloroplast haplotypes and compare the results to published results from the closely-related P. ferox, which also has a widespread lowland distribution, but differs in its ecological preferences. Microsatellite genotypes revealed two weakly differentiated genetic clusters within P. crassifolius. One cluster comprised all individuals from the North Island plus those from the north-eastern and central-eastern South Island. The second cluster, which had lower levels of genetic variation than the northern cluster, encompassed the southern and western South Island. The southern cluster exhibited lower genetic diversity, particularly in the southern South Island, suggesting that the species was severely restricted, or even extirpated, from this region during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This result contrasts with the high level of genetic structuring observed in the closely-related P. ferox. There was evidence of asymmetric chloroplast introgression from P. ferox into P. crassifolius in the south-eastern South Island. Alternative scenarios that may have led to this asymmetric introgression are discussed.

AB Aim Artificial light at night (ALAN) and roads are known threats to nocturnally migrating birds. How associations with ALAN and roads are defined in combination for these species at the population level across the full annual cycle has not been explored. Location Western Hemisphere. Methods We estimated range-wide exposure, predictor importance and the prevalence of positive associations with ALAN and roads at a weekly temporal resolution for 166 nocturnally migrating bird species in three orders: Passeriformes (n = 104), Anseriformes (n = 27) and Charadriiformes (n = 35). We clustered Passeriformes based on the prevalence of positive associations. Results Positive associations with ALAN and roads were more prevalent for Passeriformes during migration when exposure and importance were highest. Positive associations with ALAN and roads were more prevalent for Anseriformes and Charadriiformes during the breeding season when exposure was lowest. Importance was uniform for Anseriformes and highest during migration for Charadriiformes. Our cluster analysis identified three groups of Passeriformes, each having similar associations with ALAN and roads. The first occurred in eastern North America during migration where exposure, prevalence, and importance were highest. The second wintered in Mexico and Central America where exposure, prevalence and importance were highest. The third occurred throughout North America where prevalence was low, and exposure and importance were uniform. The first and second were comprised of dense habitat specialists and long-distance migrants. The third was comprised of open habitat specialists and short distance migrants. Main conclusions Our findings suggest ALAN and roads pose the greatest risk during migration for Passeriformes and during the breeding season for Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Our results emphasise the close relationship between ALAN and roads, the diversity of associations dictated by taxonomy, exposure, migration strategy and habitat and the need for more informed and comprehensive mitigation strategies where ALAN and roads are treated as interconnected threats.

ID DIVERSITY
AB Using 11 microsatellite markers, data on the genetic structure, levels of variability, and the degree of differentiation of 23 populations (1110 head) of Tuvan coarse-wooled short fat-tailed sheep from different regions of the Tyva Republic were obtained. It was established that at present this autochthonous breed is represented by two main types (mountain and steppe), as well as by numerous local intermediate populations. Despite the detected allelic diversity from 7502 to 10 114, a significant heterozygote deficiency (from 15.3 to 35.6%) was detected in all studied populations. At the same time, interpopulation differences in the group of Tuvan sheep of the steppe type (F-ST = 0.013-0.153, Jost's D = 0.029-0.461) were more pronounced than in the group of Tuvan sheep of the mountain type (F-ST = 0.01-0.071, Jost's D = 0.029-0.247). The adaptation to different natural and climatic conditions, including a typological composition and productivity of pastures on the territory of Tuva, is one of the possible reasons for the heterogeneous differentiation of the population structure of Tuvan short fat-tailed sheep.

AB We review the consequences of environmental changes caused by human activities on forest products and forest-dependent communities in the Amazon region-the vast Amazonas River basin and the Guiana Shield in South America. We used the 2018 and 2021 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and recent scientific studies to present evidence and hypotheses for changes in the ecosystem productivity and geographical distribution of plants species. We have identified species associated with highly employed forest products exhibiting reducing populations, mainly linked with deforestation and selective logging. Changes in species composition along with a decline of valuable species have been observed in the eastern, central, and southern regions of the Brazilian Amazon, suggesting accelerated biodiversity loss. Over 1 billion native trees and palms are being lost every two years, causing economic losses estimated between US$1-17 billion. A decrease in native plant species can be abrupt and both temporary or persistent for over 20 years, leading to reduced economic opportunities for forest-dependent communities. Science and technology investments are considered promising in implementing agroforestry systems recovering deforested and degraded lands, which could engage companies that use forest products due to supply chain advantages.

AB Watershed eco-compensation (WEC) is considered a significant environmental policy instrument for watershed ecological protection and management. However, in the legislation and practice of eco-compensation in China, the development of the WEC mechanism is still in the initial stages. In this paper, the institutional opportunities and challenges of WEC are analyzed from the existing policies, laws, and economical instruments. Theoretically, WEC in China has seen a combination of punitive-based "Watershed Ecological Damage Compensation (WEDC)" and incentive-based "Watershed Ecological Protective Compensation (WEPC)". Through a comparative analysis of domestic and foreign watershed compensation practices, the results demonstrate that most of China's WEC projects have an insufficient legal basis, a single compensatory subject, insufficient compensation funds, and an imperfect market-oriented compensation mechanism. To improve watershed eco-compensation in China, it is recommended to strengthen legislation, select diversified eco-compensation approaches, and establish a market-based and systematic eco-compensation mechanism for watersheds.

AB Interspecific competition can strongly influence community structure and shape niche breadth and overlap. One of the main factors that determines hummingbird community structure is competition for food. Hummingbirds' functional attributes, such as beak length and body mass, influence nectar acquisition in flowers. This study evaluates how functional and behavioral attributes of hummingbirds influence their specialization, as measured by pollen transportation. We tested the following hypothesis: H1) smaller and short-billed hummingbirds will carry higher pollen richness and relatively more pollen grains than long-billed hummingbirds; H2) dominant and territorial hummingbirds carry a lower richness of pollen types and fewer pollen grains when compared to subordinate hummingbirds, and H3) the similarity in the composition of pollen morphotypes, between the hummingbirds species, will be low because we expect to find high specialization in the use of plant species. We conducted the study between September 2018 and March 2019 in a Campo Rupestre (rocky outcrops) in Southeastern Brazil. Hummingbirds were captured with a trap. The pollen adhered to the body parts was collected, counted, and identified in the laboratory. We recorded hummingbirds' beak sizes and body masses. Behavioral responses of hummingbirds to artificial feeders were collected regarding the time and duration of each visit and the outcome of aggressive interactions. An interaction network was built based on the pollen grains found on each hummingbird. Our results showed that neither body size nor aggressive behaviors influenced pollen richness on hummingbirds' bodies. Beak length was the most important hummingbird attribute that influenced pollen richness, but not pollen relative abundance. Short-billed hummingbirds carried the greatest richness of pollen grains. The hummingbird pollen-grain interaction network was generalized in the pollen grains transported. We conclude that hummingbirds' beak length is the central morphological variable related to pollen grain transport in rocky outcrops.

AB The Amazon and the Atlantic Forest are Brazilian biomes that suffered an intense land use and land cover change, marked by the loss of native forest and expansion of agriculture and livestock. This article aims to analyze land use and land cover change history and to propose a sustainable alternative for agriculture and livestock as an opportunity for rural development in these biomes. The statistics of the platform from the Annual Mapping Project for Land Use and Land Cover in Brazil (MapBiomas) were used in an annual historical series from 1985 to 2020. The analysis of land use and land cover changes indicates that the Amazon native forest was reduced by 44.53 million hectares (Mha), while pasture, agriculture and planted forest increased by 38.10, 6.06 and 0.26 Mha, respectively, over the 35 years (1985 to 2020). In the Atlantic Forest, for the same period, forest and pasture reduced by 0.99 and 11.53 Mha, respectively, while agriculture expanded by 8.06 Mha and planted forest by 2.99 Mha. Sustainable land use strategies, such as the Integration Crop-Livestock-Forest (ICLF), can support the increase in agricultural production while recovering and preserving the environment. Policies and programs should consider regional particularities and barriers for more significant adoption of this strategy.

AB Premise of research. Pollinators are known to impose strong selection on floral shape. Particularly well studied is the relationship between the flowers of hummingbird-pollinated plant species and the bills of their pollinators. However, no studies to date have evaluated whether these relationships vary according to the level of pollination specialization. Here, we quantify the relationship between the corolla shape of Antillean Gesneriaceae and the bills of their hummingbird pollinators for species with a specialist (one functional group of pollinators: hummingbirds) and a generalist (more than one functional group of pollinators: hummingbirds, bats, and insects) pollination strategy.Methodology. We used phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses on linear measurements and phylogenetic two blocks partial least squares on multivariate geometric morphometrics data to test whether and how the variation in the corolla shape of the Antillean Gesneriaceae is correlated to the shape of the bills of their hummingbird pollinators.Pivotal results. We found that corolla shape is correlated with the bill shape of the hummingbird pollinators but that the nature of this relationship differed between pollination specialists and generalists. For example, corolla curvature was positively correlated with bill curvature for specialists but not for generalists.Conclusions. Our study suggests that pollinators affect the evolution of flower shape but that the nature and strength of the selective pressures are affected by the pollinator guild of the pollinators in the Antillean Gesneriaceae.

AB Human-modified landscapes have been threatening mammal populations worldwide. However, little is known about the genetic consequences of these impacts in long term for most species. Here, we analyzed the genetic diversity and population structuring of a top predator, the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), to investigate genetic signatures that could be explained by anthropogenic threats. We collected non-invasive samples from scats, tissue from road-killed and blood from captured animals, which were analyzed by a set of nine microsatellite loci. We assessed the genetic population structure of 105 individuals using Bayesian and discriminant factorial components. Additionally, we measured the genetic diversity and gene flow, and evaluated bottleneck signatures. Genetic analyses revealed a spatial population structuring between central-western and southeastern populations, that is likely due to the reduction of gene flow. Both central-western and southeastern populations showed similar genetic diversity values and signatures of a recent bottleneck. It is suggested that maned wolf population structuring observed is a consequence of the huge human landscape modification, for agribusiness purposes occurring during the past century. It is inferred that both gene flow reduction and recent bottlenecks may compromise the genetic variation maintenance within local populations and negatively affect the long-term persistence of this wild and unique canid. Our results may be useful for defining international conservation actions considering landscape and population conectivity of this charismatic though Near Threatened to extinction Neotropical species, and helpful for the National Action Plan for Brazilian Canids Conservation.

AB Soil organic phosphorus (P) compounds can be the main P source for plants in P-limited tropical rainforests. Phosphorus occurs in diverse chemical forms, including monoester P, diester P, and phytate, which require enzymatic hydrolysis by phosphatase into inorganic P before assimilation by plants. The interactions between plant interspecific differences in organic P acquisition strategies via phosphatase activities with root morphological traits would lead to P resource partitioning, but they have not been rigorously evaluated. We measured the activities of three classes of phosphatases (phosphomonoesterase, PME; phosphodiesterase, PDE; and phytase, PhT), specific root length (SRL), root diameter, and root tissue density in mature tree species with different mycorrhizal associations (ectomycorrhizal [ECM] or arbuscular mycorrhizal [AM]) and different successional status (climax or pioneer species) in Sabah, Malaysia. We studied nitrogen (N)- and P-fertilized plots to evaluate the acquisition strategies for organic P under P-limited conditions 7 years after fertilization was initiated. P fertilization reduced the PME activity in all studied species and reduced PhT and PDE activities more in climax species than in the two pioneer species, irrespective of the mycorrhizal type. PDE activity increased in some climax species after N fertilization, suggesting that these species allocate excess N to the synthesis of PDE. Moreover, PME and PhT activities, but not PDE activity, correlated positively with SRL. We suggest that climax species tend to be more strongly dependent on recalcitrant organic P (i.e., phytate and/or diester P) than pioneer species, regardless of the mycorrhizal type. We also suggest that trees in which root PME or PhT activity is enhanced can increase their SRL to acquire P efficiently. Resource partitioning of soil organic P would occur among species through differences in their phosphatase activities, which plays potentially ecologically important role in reducing the competition among coexisting tree species in lowland tropical rainforests.

AB Most of the tropical rainforests are subject to both anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) cause forest clearings within the tropics. This study was conducted at mid-elevations (1100-1700 m a.s.l.) in Mount Cameroon National Park. We assessed the difference in the structure of bird communities in the forest and areas located nearby affected by elephant activities. We used the point-count method; 22 points were established within each habitat. The vegetation was visually estimated within a 50 m radius surrounding each counting point. In total, 1603 birds from 85 species were recorded. The vegetation cover from 3 to 5 m at points with elephant activity was significantly lower compared to points without elephant activity. Bird species richness was significantly higher around points in pasture compared to points in intact forest. Habitat type and the percentage of vegetation layer from 3 to 5 m significantly impacted the bird community structure. The points in the pasture were especially characterized by the increased abundance of some open habitat species (e.g., Chubb's Cisticola chubbi). Few studies have documented the effects of elephant activity on other species, although the effects are widely stated as important drivers of habitat diversity in tropical forests. In conclusion, disturbance caused by elephants leads to increased bird community diversity due to the increased heterogeneity of the environment, which documents the high importance of elephants as ecosystem engineers.

AB Hedgerows are semi-natural wooded habitats and an important element in agricultural landscapes across Western and North-Western Europe. They reduce erosion, function as carbon sinks and thus provide essential ecosystem services. Moreover, they form a structurally diverse ecosystem for numerous taxa and connect otherwise fragmented forest habitats. This study compiled data from the hedgerow-rich oceanic regions of Europe, covering a gradient from Southern Sweden to Northern France, to analyse the influence of management, landscape context and climate variables on the number of herbaceous forest specialists in hedgerows. The species frequencies in hedgerows were related to their functional traits to identify plant characteristics that are beneficial for species dispersal and persistence in hedgerows. Our results show that numerous forest plant species, but not all, can thrive in hedgerows. Those are likely thermophilic, tolerant against regular disturbance and able to disperse efficiently. Hedgerows in regions that are warm or that are impacted by heat and drought events contain fewer forest species. Intensive adjacent land-use had a negative impact on forest species richness, while the surrounding forest cover was not significantly important. In congruence with previous regional studies, wider hedgerows contain more forest species, which is most likely caused by a more effective buffering of the microclimate. Thus, hedgerow width gains in importance in times of climate change and increasing extreme weather events. It is a key factor for habitat quality also on a European scale that needs to be considered for future management strategies.

AB Conventional agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been criticized for failing to exploit conservation synergies that could be obtained from spatial coordination of conservation efforts. Understanding the design and implementation of novel incentive mechanisms explicitly designed to boost spatial coordination of conservation efforts is, therefore, of critical importance. We conducted the first systematic review of such incentives ('Spatial Coordination Incentives'), including Agglomeration Bonus, Threshold Bonus, and Threshold Payments. The review aims to investigate these incentives' performance and identify the underlying factors affecting their performance. An extensive bibliographic search was carried out and 55 papers were included in the final analysis. Most papers (89%) are theoretical and experimental studies. Real-world applications of these incentives are rare. The theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that these incentives could potentially promote participation, spatial coordination, and environmental effectiveness. However, the results remain a subject of debate in experimental studies. Performance variation is attributed to scheme design features and contextual factors. We highlight the areas where future work would be most warranted to further validate the performance of these incentives. Insights gained from the review provide important implications for the emerging field of conservation science and ongoing efforts to improve the design of AES for better landscape-scale management.

AB Genital morphology reveals rapid diversification among species, and species-specific divergence in genital morphology may result in reproductive isolation and promote speciation. Natural selection against maladaptive hybridization may cause species-specific genital divergence. In this context, divergence in mating traits is expected to be greater between sympatric populations than between allopatric populations in a pair of species, known as reproductive character displacement (RCD). However, there are few examples of RCD in the genital morphology of closely related species. Additionally, processes leading to RCD have rarely been inferred. In this study, we examined RCD and its underlying mechanisms by focusing on species-specific genital morphologies of closely related Ohomopterus ground beetle species. A morphological analysis showed patterns of RCD in species-specific genital parts in both sexes. Interspecific hybridization was confirmed by a mate choice experiment and by a population genetic analysis indicating extensive interspecific gene flow, suggesting that reinforcement is the most plausible process underlying the observed RCD. We found variation in the degree of displacement in contact zones, which may correspond with the ongoing process of genital evolution and speciation. Our results provide support for the lock-and-key hypothesis of genital evolution in closely related Ohomopterus species.

AB Fine root production, turnover, and decomposition are fundamental rhizosphere processes that can vary when young forest ecosystems pass through different phases of succession towards maturity. To assess these changes during succession, we applied ingrowth bag and sequential coring methods for fine root production and a modified negative exponential model for fine root decomposition at four phases of tropical forest chronosequence: 1) young secondary forests of about 8 years, 2) medium secondary forests of 15 years, 3) advanced secondary forests of 25 years, and 4) old-growth primary forests of > 100 years. Primary forests stored higher fine root biomass than secondary forests but the average fine root productivity did not differ statistically between successional phases. Fine root turnover rates were > 1 yr(-1) for all the phases of succession, indicating that the turnover was higher than the standing fine root biomass. Fine root decay models showed that the decomposition rates did not differ significantly between successional phases. Furthermore, fine root production and mortality correlated positively to soil organic carbon concentrations. Our results showed that fine root productivity and turnover rates in secondary forests get to PF level from the younger phases of succession. The results have important implications in understanding the successional patterns regarding belowground resource allocation, nutrient turnover, and soil organic carbon sequestration in the constantly changing tropical forests ecosystems.

AB As deforestation frontiers expand in the tropics, understanding species responses is critical to inform efficient land-use management policies. Here we evaluated lizard responses to changes in landscape, habitat patch, and quality in a deforestation frontier in southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. We first considered overall lizard assemblages and then two species subgroups of contrasting thermoregulation strategies. We sampled lizards at 21 forest patches (42-7,035 ha) subject to moderate habitat disturbance (e.g., cattle intrusion and selective logging). Based on 6,000 pitfall trap-days and 60,000 m of visual surveys, we recorded 215 individuals representing 15 species. Contrary to expectations, species richness and abundance were not explained by any of the variables considered, including matrix quality, proportion of forest cover, forest patch area and shape, age since isolation, arthropod biomass, canopy openness, litter volume, tree density, and fire history. However, the composition of persisting species was determined by the structural complexity of the adjacent matrix. The abundance of species that avoid direct sun exposure to regulate their body temperature increased under more-complex structures of adjacent matrix areas and decreased within patches more intensively affected by past fire events. Disturbance within forest patches likely decreased the patch-matrix contrast, contributing to the absence of forest area effects. Nevertheless, species-specific microhabitat requirements dictated part of the lizard species that were able to persist in the fragmented landscape. Strategies aiming to maximize lizard diversity should embrace retention of the habitat quality within forest patches and forest corridors/high-stature vegetation in at least some sites connecting forest remnants.

AB Rhododendron arboreum species belonging to the Ericaceae family are found at an altitude of 1500-3000 m in the Himalayan region with bright red to pinkish flowers. These flowers are edible and are harvested for the Rhododendron arboreum processed squash called `buransh' in the native language. This Rhododendron squash provides high ecological and medicinal value as it not only acts as a refreshing drink for the locals but its extraction for commercial utilization provides many livelihood opportunities to the local communities of the Western Himalayas. The Indian state of Uttarakhand has been a rich source of many NTFPs especially Rhododendrons which are extracted for both local and commercial use in the study area. Our research focuses on the Value-chain analysis of Rhododendron arboreum squash 'buransh' as a Non-timber forest product (NTFP) with the case study of Chamoli District in the state of Uttarakhand. The findings of the study reveal that the harvest of R. arboreum for the production of Rhododendron squash provides many economic benefits to the local communities. The average price of freshly harvested R.arboreum flowers ranges from 30 to 60 Rupees (available in both fresh wet and in dry form). The quantum of squash production varies from 2500 to 7500 L in the flowering season depending on the production capacity, size, and location of the processing units/NGOs or cottage industries in the study area. The value chain provides an important source of livelihood enhancement option for the locals of the Himalayas region to target the unemployment in the state of Uttarakhand. The study explores the value-chain from the harvest of the R. arboreum for the Rhododendron squash preparation and its various components, stages, methods and, the opportunities and challenges involved. The forest community groups such as the 'Van-Panchayats' play a significant role in the management of the forest resources in the study area. The study recommends trainings and capacity building for enhancing the knowledge of the locals to adopt sustainable practices for the harvest of the R.arboreum sp. and to maintain the overall vitality and health of the Rhododendron rich forests from high anthropogenic pressures in the study area.

AB Tropical secondary forests play an increasing role in biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, but the underlying mechanisms driving the successional trajectory to old-growth forests are still not fully characterized. Species with different dispersal abilities or habitat preferences affect the compositional similarity of secondary forests to old-growth forests. We studied the dynamics of forest succession in twelve 1-ha plots of tropical secondary forests on Hainan Island, China, using ten years of census data (2010-2020). We compared the variations in demographic rates and community composition among three successional stages, with four plots each in young secondary forest (YS), old secondary forest (OS), and old-growth forest (OG). The effects of five species groups (generalists, rare species, and specialists in each of the three successional stages) on successional trajectory were explored using sensitivity analysis. Species richness in the OS only reached 65% of OG after 60 years of succession. The diameter growth, mortality, and recruitment rates were the highest in the YS and the lowest at the OG. Growth decreased and recruitment increased during the second census period (2015-2020) during which there were two extended droughts, but there was no significant change in mortality rate. The successional trajectories of YS and OS showed a slow but directional trend towards the OG, with a weak stochastic component. The five species groups made different contributions to the successional trajectory. Generalists contributed to the convergence of secondary forests to old-growth forests, while old-growth specialists contributed to divergence. Secondary species usually contributed to divergence with old-growth forest, and young-secondary specialists had a stronger effect than old-secondary specialists. The divergence effect of rare species on similarity occurred only when presence data were used. When based on abundance data, rare species had little effect on community similarity. Overall, our results indicated that the successional trajectories of our tropical secondary forests moved towards OG but the recovery rate was slow. Both deterministic and stochastic processes contribute to secondary succession, but deterministic processes dominated. Furthermore, it is necessary to emphasize the different contributions of species with different habitat specialization to the successional trajectory, in order to better predict successional outcomes and prioritize conservation targets.

AB For over forty years, Brazil, its subnational governments, Indigenous communities, other nations, non-governmental organizations, corporations, and individuals have worked to conserve the Amazon rainforest through a staggering number of diverse international initiatives. While some initiatives have supported Brazil in decreasing the rate of deforestation over the past fifteen years, the 2019 fires demonstrated that destruction continues. Left unchecked, this irreversible destruction promises to amplify. Fortunately, the long history of global involvement in Amazon conservation provides ample lessons for effective, place-based deforestation prevention. Thoughtful and coordinated international action can address the current lethal combination of destructive factors: Brazil's environmentally hostile federal administration, its national economic recession, and surging international demand for deforestation commodities.
   This Article curates lessons learned from over four decades of international efforts to conserve the Amazon rainforest and synthesizes them into a more effective and efficient strategy. Due to the urgency caused by the climate crisis and the Amazon's impending "tipping point," this Article analyzes the issue through a retrospective lens, drawing insight from past and existing initiatives because what has been done is possible. Because this Article's proposal relies on existing global alliances, political motivation, institutions, and mechanisms, the burden of its implementation is considerably reduced. There simply is no time for starting fresh.

AB The impact of deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia is a global concern, and land occupation in public lands contributes to increased deforestation rates. Little is known about the spread of deforestation in landholdings in undesignated public lands located on cattle-ranching frontiers. We use a case of Matupi District, a hotspot of deforestation along the Transamazon Highway in the southern portion of Brazil's state of Amazonas, where spontaneous squatters and land grabbers are the main actors occupying landholdings. We assessed the advance of deforestation and the spatial distribution of landholdings in relation to the main road and to land categories (e.g., protected areas and undesignated public land). Landholdings up to 400 ha were the majority in numbers (52%) and larger landholdings (> 400 ha) were located farther into the forest, contributing to expanding the deforestation frontier. By 2018, 80% of the remaining forest was in larger landholdings (> 400 ha), increasing the susceptibility of this forest to being cleared in the coming years. Thus, greater attention should be given to these larger landholdings to control the spread of deforestation. By analyzing the clearing pattern in the landholdings, deforestation monitoring can focus on specific sizes of landholdings that contribute most to the advance of the deforestation frontier. Brazil's current trend to facilitating the legalization of illegal claims in undesignated public lands, such as the large and medium landholdings we studied, implies vast areas of future deforestation and should be reversed.

AB Plant photosynthesis and biomass production are associated with the amount of intercepted light, especially the light distribution inside the canopy. Three virtual canopies (n = 80, 3.25 plants/m(2)) were constructed based on average leaf size of the digitized plant structures: 'small leaf' (98.1 cm(2)), 'medium leaf' (163.0 cm(2)) and 'big leaf' (241.6 cm(2)). The ratios of diffuse light were set in three gradients (27.8%, 48.7%, 89.6%). The simulations of light interception were conducted under different ratios of diffuse light, before and after the normalization of incident radiation. With 226.1% more diffuse light, the result of light interception could increase by 34.4%. However, the 56.8% of reduced radiation caused by the increased proportion of diffuse light inhibited the advantage of diffuse light in terms of a 26.8% reduction in light interception. The big-leaf canopy had more mutual shading effects, but its larger leaf area intercepted 56.2% more light than the small-leaf canopy under the same light conditions. The small-leaf canopy showed higher efficiency in light penetration and higher light interception per unit of leaf area. The study implied the 3D structural model, an effective tool for quantitative analysis of the interaction between light and plant canopy structure.

AB Heyman and Ariely (2004) demonstrated that the expected effectiveness of soliciting help varied depending on the "market", a money market represented by cash rewards versus a social market represented by goods as rewards. They showed that, as cash rewards increase, individuals expected others to be more willing to help, yet, when offering social goods as rewards such as candy, expected willingness to help was insensitive to rewards' monetary worth. We conducted two pre-registered replication studies (total: N = 3302, MTurk/Prolific) of Study 1 in Heyman and Ariely (2004) and found support for one of their main claims that people are more sensitive to worth when the reward is cash than goods. However, the rewards' monetary worth impacted expected willingness to help even in social markets, deviating from the original findings. Extensions further compared between-subject and within-subject designs, examined perceived affect (joy and regret), and added a new control condition. We concluded that higher compensation is generally perceived as better when soliciting help, yet more so for the money market cash rewards than for the social market goods rewards.

AB Marrubium parviflorum Fisch. & C.A. Mey. and Marrubium cuneatum Russell, are naturally distributed in various parts of Iran. It is difficult to clearly identify these species, because of their morphological similarities. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the morphological characteristics and genetic diversity among various populations of these species in the country to find more variable traits and compare their genetic structure. In total, we evaluated 16 populations of these species, with up to ten replications per each population. For morphology, we studied the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of both reproductive and vegetative organs. For molecular investigations, the nuclear DNA was extracted using modified CTAB method and amplified using twelve ISSR molecular primers. Data were analyzed using SPSS, PAST, GenAlex, STRUCTURE, and Geno-Dive. Results indicated that in both species, most of the quantitative and qualitative morphological characteristics varied among and within the populations. Parameters of genetic diversity and polymorphism differed among the populations of both species. According to AMOVA test, the great proportion of significant genetic difference in M. parviflorum belonged to within populations, which was supported by a high rate of gene flow, a weak population genetic differentiation and clustering analyses. While, the reverse conditions were registered in M. cuneatum populations. According to Nei's genetic distance and structure analysis, populations of M. parviflorum and M. cuneatum were clustered into seven and five genetics groups, respectively. However, the populations of both species were mixed together in morphological and ISSR dendrograms, which revealed similarity between them. It seems that the occurrence of ancestral gene flow or recent speciation were responsible for these similarities.

AB Bird pollination in Asia is regarded as an uncommon phenomenon and, therefore, only a few investigations on mating pattern and paternity in fruits of Asian bird-pollinated plants have been conducted. Here, we examined spatial genetic structure, pollen dispersal, and multiple paternity in a natural population of Bombax ceiba (B. ceiba) (Malvaceae) in Hainan Island, South China, using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A low genetic diversity (H-e = 0.351 +/- 0.0341 and 0.389 +/- 0.043, respectively, for adults and offspring) and bottleneck effects were observed. Genetic kinship was significant within 400 m or in 1,800-3,800 m. Both the mating pattern and paternity analysis confirmed obligate xenogamy and a low multiple paternity in B. ceiba. There was a strongly negative relationship between the frequency of matings and the distance between mating pairs. The average pollen dispersal distance was 202.89 +/- 41.01 m (mean +/- SE) and the farthest distance of > 1 km was recorded. Realized mating events showed an extremely leptokurtic distribution within 1,200 m, suggesting that the pollen dispersal distance was consistent with the optimal foraging theory of generalist birds such as Zosterops spp. and Pycnonotus spp. Paternity per tree ranged from two to six and the average effective number of pollen donors per maternal plant was 3.773, suggesting a low level of paternity diversity as compared to other bird-pollinated plants. We concluded that optimal foraging behavior by generalist birds could explain the leptokurtic pollen dispersal distribution and predominantly near-neighbor matings in B. ceiba. The limited pollen dispersal distance and low multiple paternity were consistent with low fruit setting rate (3.27 +/- 0.93%) in this self-incompatible tree, which was caused mainly by the restricted flight distance of birds and human disturbances. Low genetic diversity and significant spatial genetic structure might have largely resulted from logging and human collection of fruits.

AB Purpose This article develops a viable means of assessment of the suitability for disposal of hundreds of national government offices in Jakarta as a facet of the relocation of Indonesia's capital from Java to Borneo. Design/methodology/approach A "disposal assessment model", based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and a bespoke model of office adaptation, is constructed and applied to the population of to-be-vacated public office buildings in Jakarta. Findings In this initial demonstration mode, the disposal assessment model is tested on a live dataset and found able not only to rank buildings for disposal against stated objectives but also to incorporate more complex variables and lead into other forms of business analysis. Practical implications A fit-for-purpose model is shown capable of assisting decision-makers involved in major asset disposal, while also accounting for the stances of project stakeholders. Social implications The model offers the possibility to evaluate and, likely, optimise net social benefit for Jakarta and Indonesia both quantitatively and qualitatively. Originality/value The disposal assessment model builds on prior work in operations research and property management to develop a new construct applicable to a novel asset issue of massive proportions.

AB In the tropical rainforest of Amazonia, phosphorus (P) is one of the main nutrients controlling forest dynamics, but its effects on the future of the forest biomass carbon (C) storage under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations remain uncertain. Soils in vast areas of Amazonia are P-impoverished, and little is known about the variation or plasticity in plant P-use and -acquisition strategies across space and time, hampering the accuracy of projections in vegetation models. Here, we synthesize current knowledge of leaf P resorption, fine-root P foraging, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, and root acid phosphatase and organic acid exudation and discuss how these strategies vary with soil P concentrations and in response to elevated atmospheric CO2. We identify knowledge gaps and suggest ways forward to fill those gaps. Additionally, we propose a conceptual framework for the variations in plant P-use and -acquisition strategies along soil P gradients of Amazonia. We suggest that in soils with intermediate to high P concentrations, at the plant community level, investments are primarily directed to P foraging strategies via roots and arbuscular mycorrhizas, whereas in soils with intermediate to low P concentrations, investments shift to prioritize leaf P resorption and mining strategies via phosphatases and organic acids.

AB When environmental conditions differ both within and among populations, multiscale adaptation results from processes at both scales and interference across scales. We hypothesize that within-population environmental heterogeneity influences the chance of success of migration events, both within and among populations, and maintains within-population adaptive differentiation. We used a simulation approach to analyse the joint effects of environmental heterogeneity patterns, selection intensity and number of QTL controlling a selected trait on local adaptation in a hierarchical metapopulation design. We show the general effects of within-population environmental heterogeneity: (i) it increases occupancy rate at the margins of distribution ranges, under extreme environments and high levels of selection; (ii) it increases the adaptation lag in all environments; (iii) it impacts the genetic variance in each environment, depending on the ratio of within- to between-populations environmental heterogeneity; (iv) it reduces the selection-induced erosion of adaptive gene diversity. Most often, the smaller the number of QTL involved, the stronger are these effects. We also show that both within- and between-populations phenotypic differentiation (Q(ST)) mainly results from covariance of QTL effects rather than QTL differentiation (F-STq), that within-population QTL differentiation is negligible, and that stronger divergent selection is required to produce adaptive differentiation within populations than among populations. With a high number of QTL, when the difference between environments within populations exceeds the smallest difference between environments across populations, high levels of within-population differentiation can be reached, reducing differentiation among populations. Our study stresses the need to account for within-population environmental heterogeneity when investigating local adaptation.

AB Human activities can globally modify natural ecosystems determining ecological, demographic and range perturbations for several animal species. These changes can jeopardize native gene pools in different ways, leading either to genetic homogenization, or conversely, to the split into genetically divergent demes. In the past decades, most European wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations were heavily managed by humans. Anthropic manipulations have strongly affected also Italian populations through heavy hunting, translocations and reintroductions that might have deeply modified their original gene pools. In this study, exploiting the availability of the well-mapped porcine genome, we applied genomic tools to explore genome-wide variability in Italian wild boar populations, investigate their genetic structure and detect signatures of possible introgression from domestic pigs and non-native wild boar. Genomic data from 134 wild boar sampled in six areas of peninsular Italy and in Sardinia were gathered using the Illumina Porcine SNP60 BeadChip (60k Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms - SNPs) and compared with reference genotypes from European specimens and from domestic pigs (both commercial and Italian local breeds), using multivariate and maximum-likelihood approaches. Pairwise F-ST values, multivariate analysis and assignment procedures indicated that Italian populations were highly differentiated from all the other analyzed European wild boar populations. Overall, a lower heterozygosity was found in the Italian population than in the other European regions. The most diverging populations in Castelporziano Presidential Estate and Maremma Regional Park can be the result of long-lasting isolation, reduced population size and genetic drift. Conversely, an unexpected similarity was found among Apennine populations, even at high distances. Signatures of introgression from both non-Italian wild boar and domestic breeds were very limited. To summarize, we successfully applied genome-wide procedures to explore, for the first time, the genomic diversity of Italian wild boar, demonstrating that they represent a strongly heterogeneous assemblage of demes with different demographic and manipulation histories. Nonetheless, our results suggest that a native component of genomic variation is predominant over exogenous ones in most populations.

AB The economic costs of non-indigenous species (NIS) are a key factor for the allocation of efforts and resources to eradicate or control baneful invasions. Their assessments are challenging, but most suffer from major flaws. Among the most important are the following: (1) the inclusion of actual damage costs together with various ancillary expenditures which may or may not be indicative of the real economic damage due to NIS; (2) the inclusion of the costs of unnecessary or counterproductive control initiatives; (3) the inclusion of controversial NIS-related costs whose economic impacts are questionable; (4) the assessment of the negative impacts only, ignoring the positive ones that most NIS have on the economy, either directly or through their ecosystem services. Such estimates necessarily arrive at negative and often highly inflated values, do not reflect the net damage and economic losses due to NIS, and can significantly misguide management and resource allocation decisions. We recommend an approach based on holistic costs and benefits that are assessed using likely scenarios and their counter-factual.

AB Anthropogenic pressure has well-documented effects on the spatial distribution of biodiversity but it can also have more subtle effects on wildlife, influencing the time of the day and for how long animals are active. These temporal effects have not received much attention from the scientific and conservation community, despite activity being intrinsically related to crucial aspects in an animal's life. Here we use data from a large-scale camera trap survey (517 survey sites covering more than 1000 km(2)) conducted in areas under distinct levels of protection in the Brazilian Cerrado to investigate the effect of anthropogenic pressure on the activity of mammal species >1 kg. We used both circular statistics and GLMMs to investigate whether species would shift activity towards the night in response to disturbance, resulting in a decrease of diurnal activity in areas under lower protection levels and closer to households. Our results revealed that most species investigated did not show a temporal response to anthropogenic pressure, with only two species responding in the way we expected: tamanduas reduced the probability of daytime activity closer to households and collared peccaries reduced diurnal activity slightly in areas under lower protection levels. Our findings also suggest that environmental factors have a greater influence on species' activity than indicators of pressure in the mosaic of protected areas studied. Although stricter levels of habitat protection are known to have a positive and strong influence on the spatial distribution of many mammal species in the study region, we showed here that human pressure has only a modest effect on the period these species were active. This limited temporal response highlights the need for large natural areas under low disturbance that allow mammal species to respond spatially to threats.

AB The felid species of South America are thought to have arrived on the continent during the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) in the Pleistocene. However, molecular and palaeontological data do not agree on how this event affected speciation in felids. Here, we determine both the number of colonization events and the period when felines first migrated from North America to South America. In addition, we evaluate whether similar evolutionary events could have affected the eight Neotropical cat species in their levels of genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure and demographic changes. We analysed four concatenated mitochondrial genes of the jaguar, ocelot, margay, tigrina, pampas cat, Andean cat, puma and jaguarundi. The samples were representative of a wide distribution of these species in Central and South America. Our analysis suggests either three or four colonization events from North America to South America over the past 3 Myr, followed by subsequent speciation events and the attainment of high or very high genetic diversity levels for seven of the species. No unique evolutionary process was detected for any of the current Neotropical cat species.

AB Knowledge of the genetic structure and cryptic diversity is essential for the conservation of endangered species. We conducted a genetic survey of the federally endangered Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) sampled from its USA range in southern Florida. Florida bonneted bats are primarily found in four regions separated by approximately 100 to 250 km, including three western natural areas: Babcock Webb WMA (BW), Polk County (PC), and Collier County (CC) and one urban population on the east coast, Miami-Dade County (MD). We used 22 microsatellite loci and cytochrome b sequences to assess the extent of connectivity and levels of genetic diversity. Populations were highly differentiated at microsatellite loci (overall F-ST = 0.178) and model-based and ordination analyses showed that MD was the most distinct among pairwise comparisons. Regional populations were small (N-e < 100) with no evidence of inbreeding. Contemporary migration and historic gene flow suggested that regional populations have not frequently exchanged migrants, and thus the divergence among western regions was likely a result of genetic drift. Significantly, mitochondrial DNA revealed that haplotypes from MD were similar or shared with those recognized as Eumops ferox from Cuba and Jamaica, and divergent (1.5%) from the remainder of bonneted bats in Florida. Our data support the management of each of the four populations as distinct population segments, and that BW, PC and CC combined are on an independent evolutionary trajectory from bats in MD. Bonneted bats in Florida appear to harbor cryptic diversity that will require a reassessment of their taxonomy.

AB Coppice forest management impacts understorey vegetation. This is particularly true for habitat specialists (priority elements in conservation) who prefer closed canopy conditions associated with mature forests. Most trait-based studies of forest understorey focus on interspecific differences, which neglect the role of intraspecific variability. Here, we tackled this issue by examining how leaf traits respond (intra- and inter-specifically) to different stages of stand maturity for habitat specialist and generalist species. We measured the leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) for 1,932 individuals belonging to 71 understorey species in 18 beech coppice forests grouped in three stages of stand maturity (i.e., post-logging, n = 5; recovering, n = 5; old stands, n = 8). We assessed leaf trait variation across stages of forest maturity for the entire community, and for specialists and generalists separately using monotonic trend tests. Then, we disentangled the proportion of variation attributable to intraspecific variability and interspecific differences of specialists and generalists using variance decomposition. We found significant positive trends in community-level SLA and negative ones in LDMC with increasing stand maturity. Beech forest understorey specialists (but not generalists) explained these patterns. The contribution of intra- and inter-specific components was dependent upon the trait under consideration and habitat specialization. For specialists, intraspecific variability was significant for all leaf traits and could explain 15.2% of model variance for SLA, 4.2% for LA and 3.1% for LDMC along the stand maturity gradient. Interspecific differences were significant for LDMC (29.8% of variance explained) and SLA (7.6%). For generalists, intraspecific variability was not significant; interspecific differences were significant for LA and explained 26.2 % of variability along the stand maturity gradient. We revealed that the maturity of coppice stands have different effects on generalist and specialist species. Habitat specialists are responsive to subtle changes in forest stand age both intra- and interspecifically, with their prevalence being function- and trait-dependent. Interspecific differences explained most of the LDMC (resource conservation) variance, while intraspecific variability accounted most of the SLA (light capture) variance. Generalists contribute to communitylevel trait variation, yet these species were less responsive to changes in forest stand age. To assess the impact of forest management on understories and refine the effectiveness of monitoring plans, we recommend focusing on habitat specialists, ideally including both trait variability within- and among-species.

AB Church forests on the premises of Ethiopian Orthodox Churches have been recognized as refugia of tropical plant biodiversity within the predominantly agricultural landscape matrix. Understanding the species composition, population structure, and human use of trees in forested areas is crucial for sustainable conservation efforts. We investigated these features in mixed natural-planted church forests in central Ethiopia. Three forests associated with churches for 37-50 years were surveyed to assess: (i) the diversity and population characteristics of woody species depending on the age of the church forest, (ii) the use of trees by humans, and (iii) church forests' contribution to the conservation of threatened species. Vegetation and ethnobotanical data were collected via forest inventory of 24 plots sized 0.04 ha and through a rapid rural appraisal conducted in 120 households. Thirty woody species, twenty-eight indigenous species, and two exotic species were identified. The three church forests were floristically different, with only four tree species in common. Most indices of diversity and population structural parameters of woody species were higher in older than in younger church forests, presumably due to a longer tradition of forest conservation. All church forests presented inverse J-shaped size-class distributions, indicative of populations with good recruitment potential. Woody species were mainly used for medicine, construction wood, and firewood. Eighteen threatened species were recorded; however, few conservation activities besides social taboos were revealed in the examined forests. Our findings highlight the role of church forests in the conservation of woody species diversity, and the need to strengthen current strategies to support long-term biodiversity conservation.

AB Habitat fragmentation caused by hydroelectric dams has depleted fish populations worldwide. Restocking actions are usually adopted to recover those populations, but hatchery management protocols rarely guarantee the maintenance of genetic diversity and a balanced contribution among captive breeders each generation. Here, a set of 10 microsatellite markers was used to assess the genetic diversity (average allelic richness A(R) = 10.87 and expected heterozygosity H-E = 0.742, respectively) and structuring of Megaleporinus obtusidens, a migratory freshwater fish inhabiting over 2500 km of the Sao Francisco River in Brazil. Three main genetic clusters were identified in this species across the river basin that could be related to the sharply different climatic and hydrologic regimes from the Upper to the Lower course. A significant reduction (> 50%) in genetic diversity was observed in the broodstock when compared to their wild conspecifics, especially in the allelic richness. The information here presented will aid for management of genetic resources of this species in the Sao Francisco River taking as reference the genetic clusters identified. Furthermore, the results indicated that restocking is not necessary unless signals of population depletion occurs and, if so, hatchery reproductive protocols should rely on artificial fertilization rather than mass spawning.

Visual records were made while surveying through linear transections in a forest area associated with two important rivers that form the Xingu River in the central region of Mato Grosso State, Brazil. Females were observed with infants in the dry and rainy seasons. Other primate species locally recorded are Alouatta caraya, Mico emiliae, Plecturocebus vieirai, and Sapajus libidinosus. Our records demonstrate the importance of continuous forest areas in maintaining the primate community in landscapes modified by agribusiness activities.

AB Populations are embedded in communities, but despite their potential to affect individual fitness, it is unknown whether and how species interactions evolve in communities. Evolutionary outcomes are likely more complex in natural communities because (a) the evolution of interactions may not be evenly distributed among all community members and (b) coevolution is conditional on the environmental conditions within which interactions are playing out. To test the evolution of interaction strengths in natural communities, we performed two common garden experiments in grassland communities in Northern California. In each garden, we transplanted individuals of four populations (one local, three foreign) of an annual invasive grass Bromus hordeaceus into natural communities, characterized the interaction neighbourhood around each focal individual, and quantified individual fitness. This method allowed us to fit multispecies competition models to fitness data, estimating interaction strengths between focal B. hordeaceus populations and each of seven species that were common in the interaction neighbourhoods, in each garden. We found that interaction strengths significantly differed among local and foreign source populations, but the direction and magnitude of evolution differed among common gardens and among neighbour species-in neither garden were interactions experienced more strongly by foreign populations compared to local populations. The fitness of local populations (relative to foreign populations) decreased when neighbours were removed, strongly enough in one garden to cause strong local maladaptation, and the local population did not perform the best in either garden. Synthesis. Together, our results demonstrate how species interactions evolve to determine fitness in ecological communities, providing a richer view of adaptation in natural systems. In our study, this richness included the unique challenges populations face in nature: uneven abundances and a diffuseness of species interactions, nonlinear density effects on fitness, and evidence of (mal)adaptation that is conditional on local conditions. We conclude by hypothesizing the causes and consequences of challenges to adaptation and how they help identify priority areas for the field.

AB The forestry practice of clear-cutting (the removal of all woody vegetation) results in a range of negative impacts on ectotherm physiology and behaviour. Organisms in these habitats can experience elevated body temperature due to increases in air and soil temperature, affecting their performance. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ambient temperature (air and soil), habitat type (clear-cut, forest edge and forest interior) and season (summer and autumn) on body temperature, microhabitat use and velocity of the thermosensitive ground-beetle Ceroglossus chilensis. We found that body temperature of C. chilensis increased with higher soil temperature in summer, especially in clear-cuts, although body temperature decreased rapidly when sheltering in microhabitats (e.g. dead logs, plants and leaf litter). Leaf litter and dead logs were more frequently selected in native forest and clear-cuts, respectively, but in clear-cuts, dead logs and plants have up to 4 degrees C higher than the optimal preference of C. chilensis. Higher soil temperature and lower activity levels of beetles were observed in clear-cuts in summer than in the other two habitat types, and beetles moved faster in the interior of the native forest than in other habitats regardless of the season. Our results suggest that C. chilensis is a bioindicator of changes in ambient temperatures occurring after forest fragmentation by forestry. We suggest that the management and maintenance of thermal shelters in clear-cuts could lessen the negative effects of high temperatures on thermosensitive beetles in fragmented forest landscapes.

AB Plant functioning in response to the environment is an important issue for vegetation reassembly of degraded lands because of both low and excessive sunlight influence the performance of young plants. However, how shade-tolerant tree species deal with excess of light energy remains unclear due to the contrasting results among studies and the subjective classifications of species shade tolerance. From a quantitative classification of shade tolerance of 12 tropical tree species planted in the field under contrasting light conditions, we hypothesized that shade-tolerant species are capable of effective long-term acclimation to high-light conditions. Plant size and survival of species were measured at the beginning and 38 months after planting. We also measured functional traits associated with carbon economy and non-photochemical energy dissipation. Under high-light condition, more light-demanding species showed higher growth rates associated with higher values of functional traits that improve the CO2 assimilation capacity. By contrast, more shade-tolerant species showed higher survival that was associated with higher values of qN, leaf K contents and leaf thickness. The concomitant increase in these traits, as well as their greater plasticity to light in WUEi, F-v/F-m and qN, confers on these species strong photoprotection to avoid high-light stress and to persist under open field conditions. The results challenge the common assumption that only fast-growing and light-demanding tree species are suitable for vegetation reassembly in full sunlight conditions and to improve the environmental conditions for other species.

AB Although edge influence has been studied extensively, there is no consensus on how insect communities respond to edge environments. Studies highlight the importance of an experimental design that considers samples in adjacent matrix and the distance from the edge as a continuous factor. We sampled ants along edges composed by Cerrado vegetation and three types of crop matrix: sugarcane, eucalyptus and pasture. We assessed the response patterns of ant communities to edge contrast and distance using linear models. Ant richness increases linearly towards Cerrado core in edges composed by sugarcane, while it did not change along edges composed by eucalyptus. In both cases, ant composition on both sides of these edges tended to be highly different. In pasture, ant richness is higher than Cerrado, while the composition changes gradually along this edge, indicating that low contrast edges imply a smoother effect of edge influence on communities. Our results suggest that edge influence is dependent on the structural contrast between the habitats that compose the edges. We highlight the importance of the two-sided approach on edge studies and the use of more than a single biodiversity dimension to provide an accurate picture of edge influence on insect communities.

AB Changes in riparian vegetation directly affect the entry of allochthonous material into aquatic systems, which is the main source of food and energy for different functional feeding groups (FFG) of aquatic insects that play important ecological roles in these ecosystems. Thus, reducing the fragmentation of organic matter affecting the energy flow and food network, interfering with important ecosystem processes that sustain biodiversity. We assess the effects of landscape changes on the composition of the FFG of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) communities in streams from the Eastern Amazon, a region that exhibits a mosaic of multiple land uses with the prevalence of pastures. We expected that shredders and collectors (gatherers and filterers), naturally prevalent in preserved first-order streams, would be more affected by the loss of riparian vegetation due to their higher dependence on allochthonous food sources than other FFG. We sampled 30 Amazonian streams (1st to 3rd orders) located in the Capim River Basin, Paragominas, Para, Brazil. The environmental predictors affected the FFG of EPT. Shredders, collector-gatherer, and predators were predominant in streams with more forests that had more living trees in the channel. On the other hand, collector-filter were predominant in streams with more exposed soil and higher water temperatures. We conclude that the preservation of riparian zones is important for the preservation of FFG of EPT and highlighting the effectiveness of using these groups as a tool for biomonitoring environmental quality. Implications for insect conservation Our results show that FFG of EPT are affected by environmental conditions. Therefore, the landscape changes caused by the deforestation of the riparian zone imply changes in the composition of the FFG of EPT communities.

AB Context Climate and landscape structure are predicted to affect pollination and plant reproduction but few studies have tested how these stressors interact. Objectives Using a 9-year dataset we tested whether climate interacts synergistically with forest loss and fragmentation to affect pollination and subsequent reproduction in a tropical understory herb, Heliconia tortuosa. We hypothesized that hot and/or dry conditions might amplify effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, leading to declines in plant reproduction. Methods We collected data on pollen tubes, fruit, and seeds of H. tortuosa in a mensurative experiment representing gradients in forest amount and patch size (N = 40 focal-patch landscapes). We modeled these reproductive metrics as a function of landscape composition, configuration, precipitation, temperature, and statistical interactions among these variables. Results We found little support for synergistic landscape and climate effects. However, H. tortuosa reproduction decreased in wet years, small patches, and, counterintuitively, in landscapes with high forest cover. We speculate that reproduction improved in deforested landscapes because the lack of surrounding forest constrains hummingbird movement, and therefore visitation is focused on plants that remain. Conclusion Although we did not detect synergistic effects, we emphasize the importance of additive effects of climate and landscape structure on plant reproduction. Wet years, small patches, and heavily forested landscapes appear to have negative consequences for Heliconia reproduction. Decline in this common species is likely to have cascading consequences for hummingbird pollinators, and subsequently other hummingbird-dependent plant species.

AB Inefficient management of protected areas (PAs) is often due to ignoring their surrounding matrix in the baseline studies, especially in wooded landscapes. In Iran, the application of landscape structure studies in protection policies and PA management is not prevalent. In this study, land cover changes in Dena Rural District (including parts of inside and outside Dena PA) have analyzed using the process of the Landsat images along with field survey two times (1989 and 2018). The landscape structural integrity was quantified based on the situation of oak forest land and its alteration. The composition and the configuration of oak forest land were assessed by metrics based on the moving extent of the Persian squirrel, Sciurus anomalus (which is an endangered focal endemic species completely dependent on the oak forest). Alterations of landscape structural integrity were compared for inside and outside Dena PA and at different altitudes. The results show connectivity loss and increased fragmentation of oak remnant patches, but this deforestation is more severe near areas facing direct human impacts and interventions. These are among attributes that are to be considered for zoning PA (such as controlling zone and training/participation zone). At higher altitudes, physical protection and strict control are more effective, while training local communities for stewardship is more essential at lower altitudes for conserving woodland integrity.

AB Despite the global importance of the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, especially to aquaculture, knowledge of genetic variability within native populations is still limited. While several studies have assessed genetic differentiation across the major drainage basins of Africa, relatively little effort has focused on characterizing genetic differentiation at finer scales. We assessed genetic variation in O. niloticus within and among nine drainage basins in Ghana using nuclear microsatellite DNA markers as the basis for identifying potential units of conservation among wild populations. We screened 312 wild individuals using eight nuclear microsatellite DNA markers. We found moderate genetic diversity within and differentiation among all wild populations studied, with strong signals of recent demographic bottlenecks in several populations. Genetic structure among 11 populations suggested the presence of up to ten management units (MUs). In particular, the Black Volta and the Tano-Asuhyea populations, which were the most genetically distinct and geographically isolated and may be most at risk of loss of genetic diversity over time, may well represent evolutionary significant units. Therefore, at the minimum, the Black Volta and Tano-Asuhyea populations should be prioritized for conservation actions to sustain them over the long-term.

AB Plant growth is almost always limited by light availability and competition. However, plants are generally plastic and can change their morphology and biomass allocation to optimize growth under suboptimal conditions. We set up a controlled pot experiment with three light availability levels (10%, 20%, and 50%) to study the effect of light and competition on the biomass allocation and leaf morphology in monospecific and mixed pots of recently planted European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) saplings using a quantile regression model. Specific leaf area (SLA) showed the strongest reaction and increased with decreasing light availability. Woody aboveground mass fraction (AMF) increased with decreasing light availability, but the effect of light on biomass allocation was less pronounced than on SLA. The SLA, woody AMF, and root mass fraction (RMF) of the two conifer species and European beech varied greatly, with European beech having a higher SLA and RMF than the two conifer species. The associated effect of plant size on biomass allocation was small, and the strength of the association was not meaningful on a practical level. The competitor's effect on biomass allocation was minor overall and only present for some species, suggesting that species' functional dissimilarity does not greatly affect allocational patterns in early tree development stages.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) is severely deforested and the remaining forest fragments are generally reduced and disconnected. Euterpe edulis (Arecaceae) is a native AF palm rarely found in forest fragments inserted in more deforested landscapes. We investigate how forest fragments inserted in landscapes with different levels of deforestation influence both the genetic diversity and physiological traits of E. edulis progenies. For this, we evaluate the genetic diversity and physiological variables associated with carbon balance at leaf and whole-plant leaf scales of E. edulis progenies to light availability. We collected fruits from six mother plants, being three from a forest fragment inserted in a more forested landscape (83% of forest cover) and three from a forest fragment inserted in a more deforested landscape (55% of forest cover). The seeds were germinated and, after reaching the juvenile stage, 17 microsatellite markers were used to perform a genetic diversity analysis. The progenies were subjected to 18 light treatments (0.72-22.1 mol photons m(-2) day(-1)) for the analysis of the carbon balance at leaf and whole-plant scales. We found that the origin of the mother plant proved to affect some genetic parameters, since progenies from mother plants of a forest fragment inserted in the more forested landscape had a greater number of private and effective alleles. In addition, progenies from this forest fragment had a great acclimation capacity to the light levels, with higher growth rates and vigor. Our results provide evidence that conservation actions are necessary for this species, including selecting and replanting progenies from the forest fragments inserted in more forested landscapes. It could be a way for alternative genotypes to raise the levels of alleles and thus avoid the collapse of these populations in fragments inserted in deforested landscapes where a low number of adult and juvenile individuals are found.

AB Land use and land cover (LULC) changes strongly affect local hydrology and sediment yields. The current study focused on a basin in the Brazilian Amazon and had the following three objectives: (1) to perform an effective diagnosis of flow and sediment yield, (2) to evaluate the impacts of LULC changes over the last 40 years on the hydro-sedimentological variables, and (3) to investigate the impacts of the possible trends or breaking points in the flow, surface runoff, and sediment yield series. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model validation showed that the simulated results were consistent with the data measured in the dynamic reproduction of flow seasonality. Furthermore, changes in LULC altered surface runoff, sediment yield, and flow according to the Mann-Kendall and Pettitt non-parametric tests. It was also observed that the sub-basins in which pastureland is predominant are more susceptible to increased surface runoff and sediment yield. According to trend and homogeneity tests, these sub-basins had break points in the time series of these variables. On the other hand, in the sub-basins whose land cover is predominantly forest, the time series is homogeneous and trendless. The current study highlighted the impacts that 40 years of LULC changes in an Amazonian basin had on hydro-sedimentological variables, which, in turn, can play an important role in changing the hydrological cycle, consequently these changes can also impact diverse human activities in the region, such as agribusiness, livestock, energy production, food security, and public water supply. Thus, it is concluded that the SWAT model is a good estimator of hydro-sedimentological processes in Amazonian basins and can be used by decision makers in the management of water and environmental resources.

AB Cord-forming (CF) fungi are found worldwide; however, tropical CF fungi are poorly documented. They play an essential role in forest ecosystems by interconnecting nutrient resources and aiding in the decomposition of plant matter and woody litter. CF fungi samples were collected from two forest conservation sites in the Sabah region of Malaysian Borneo. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the ribosomal rRNA gene array 18S to 28S region from cords collected placed all of the collected specimens in Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycetes), specifically within the orders Trechisporales, Phallales, Hymenochaetales, Polyporales, and Agaricales. Comparison of the cord-derived sequences against GenBank and UNITE sequence databases, as well as phylogenetic analyses, revealed they were all novel sequences types. Many of these novel lineages were found to be closely related to other basidiomycetes commonly found in tropical forests, suggesting a large undiscovered tropical fungal diversity in Borneo that has been detected independently of sampling fruiting bodies. We show how these sequence types relate to the morphologies of the cords from which they were sampled. We also highlight how rapid, small-scale sampling can be a useful tool as an easy and relatively unbiased way of collecting data on cord-forming fungi in difficult-to-access, complex forest environments, independently of locating and sampling sporophores.

AB Life history theory aims to understand how different environments result in differential investment in fitness-related traits. While trade-offs between traits are expected, many studies show positive or no correlation between pairs of costly traits. One hypothesis that may explain the inconsistency of trade-offs in the literature is that trait investment may occur in a dichotomous hierarchy (the tree model), which allows for differential trait investment weighted by the traits' respective positions within the hierarchy. Previous mathematical models predict different covariances between traits depending on their position on the allocation tree. While hierarchical differential investment is often used to discuss findings in life history theory, the role of an allocation hierarchy in trait covariances has not been directly tested. In turn, this study aims to identify trait covariances between behavioral and morphological phenotypes on different branches of an allocation tree for the bean beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. While trade-offs between copulatory behaviors and morphology were found for both males and females, only traits at the base and far from each other in the hierarchy negatively covaried. This study empirically shows that trade-offs may be the result of hierarchical investment.

AB The Cerrado biome is being gradually reduced. Remote sensing has been widely used to investigate spatio-temporal changes in the landscape, which are frequently limited to mapping with orbital sensors, while the Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) proved to be advantageous in terms of spatial resolution and the application of advanced digital processing techniques. In this study, we investigated a vereda (humid area) of a conservation unit in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) was applied to images obtained by RPAS to distinguish the phytophysiognomies of plant strata from the vereda and to diagnose the recovery of native and invasive vegetation after prescribed burning. The study was carried out in the following five stages: biomass collection; quality analysis of the land cover; phytosociological survey; collection of control points using a GNSS receiver (type L1/L2); and the capture of aerial images with an RGB camera coupled to a DJI Phantom 4 Pro, which was performed through overflights in three different periods. Object-Based Image Analysis was subsequently performed using the Nearest Neighbor classifier combined with Feature Space Optimization, obtaining classifications with accuracy and Kappa indexes greater than 80% and 0.80, respectively. The results of image processing allowed us to infer that fire acted as a renewing agent for native vegetation and as an inhibiting agent for invasive vegetation. The classification analyses combined with the phytosociological analysis allowed us to infer that the vereda is in the process of maturation. Therefore, the study demonstrated the potential of data obtained by RPAS for the diagnosis and analysis of vegetation dynamics in small wetlands submitted to Integrated Fire Management (IFM).

AB Peronospora tabacina is an obligate parasite that causes blue mold of tobacco. The pathogen reproduces primarily by sporangia, whereas the sexual oospores are rarely observed. A collection of 122 isolates of P. tabacina was genotyped using nine microsatellites to assess the population structure of individuals from subpopulations collected from central, southern, and western Europe; the Middle East; Central America; North America; and Australia. Genetic variations among the six subpopulations accounted for similar to 8% of the total variation, including moderate levels of genetic differentiation, high gene flow among these subpopulations, and a positive correlation between geographic and genetic distance (r = 0.225; P < 0.001). Evidence of linkage disequilibrium (P < 0.001) showed that populations contained partially clonal subpopulations but that subpopulations from Australia and Mediterranean Europe did not. High genetic variation and population structure among samples could be explained by continuous gene flow across continents via infected transplant exchange and/or long-distance dispersal of sporangia via wind currents. This study analyzed the most numerous P. tabacina collection and allowed conclusions regarding the migration, mutation, and evolutionary history of this obligate biotrophic oomycete. The evidence pointed to the species origin in Australia and identified intracontinental and intercontinental migration patterns of this important pathogen.

AB Wildlife corridors are critical for maintaining the viability of isolated wildlife populations and conserving ecosystem functionality. Anthropogenic pressure has negatively impacted wildlife habitats, particularly in corridors between protected areas, but few studies have yet quantitatively assessed habitat changes and corresponding wildlife presence. We quantified land use/land cover and human-elephant conflict trends over the past two decades in the Wami Mbiki-Saadani (WMS) wildlife corridor, Tanzania, using RS and GIS combined with human-wildlife conflict reports. We designed landscape metrics and habitat suitability models for the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) as a large mammal key species in the WMS ecosystem. Our results showed that forest cover, a highly suitable habitat for elephants, decreased by 3.0% between 1998 and 2008 and 20.3% between 2008 and 2018. Overall, the highly suitable habitat for elephants decreased by 22.4% from 1998 to 2018, when it was scarcely available and when small fragmented patches dominated the unprotected parts of the corridor. Our findings revealed that large mammalian habitat conservation requires approaches beyond habitat-loss detection and must consider other facets of landscape patterns. We suggest strengthening elephant habitat conservation through community conservation awareness, wildlife corridor mapping, and restoration practices to ensure a sustainable pathway to human-wildlife coexistence.

AB Edge disturbance can drive liana community changes and alter liana-tree interaction networks, with ramifications for forest functioning. Understanding edge effects on liana community structure and liana-tree interactions is therefore essential for forest management and conservation. We evaluated the response patterns of liana community structure and liana-tree interaction structure to forest edge in two moist semi-deciduous forests in Ghana (Asenanyo and Suhuma Forest Reserves: AFR and SFR, respectively). Liana community structure and liana-tree interactions were assessed in 24 50 x 50 m randomly located plots in three forest sites (edge, interior and deep-interior) established at 0-50 m, 200 m and 400 m from edge. Edge effects positively and negatively influenced liana diversity in forest edges of AFR and SFR, respectively. There was a positive influence of edge disturbance on liana abundance in both forests. We observed anti-nested structure in all the liana-tree networks in AFR, while no nestedness was observed in the networks in SFR. The networks in both forests were less connected, and thus more modular and specialised than their null models. Many liana and tree species were specialised, with specialisation tending to be symmetrical. The plant species played different roles in relation to modularity. Most of the species acted as peripherals (specialists), with only a few species having structural importance to the networks. The latter species group consisted of connectors (generalists) and hubs (highly connected generalists). Some of the species showed consistency in their roles across the sites, while the roles of other species changed. Generally, liana species co-occurred randomly on tree species in all the forest sites, except edge site in AFR where lianas showed positive co-occurrence. Our findings deepen our understanding of the response of liana communities and liana-tree interactions to forest edge disturbance, which are useful for managing forest edge.

AB Cryptic species and lineages have been widely reported during the last decades, particularly in the marine realm. Misidentifications and ignoring species complexes imply many consequences, notably biasing biodiversity and connectivity assessments, which in turn mislead our understanding of ecosystems and impact the effective design and management of conservation plans. Focusing on the Indo-Pacific coral genus Pocillopora, playing key roles in reef ecosystems as one of the main bio-constructors, we report the first Pocillopora PSH16 (ORF53; sensu Gelin et al. 2017) colonies (N = 19) in the Western Indian Ocean (Nosy Tanikely, Madagascar), 6000 km further from its current distribution. Colonies were identified according to their mitochondrial open reading frame (ORF) haplotype and Bayesian assignment tests based on 13-microsatellite genotypes. Additionally, we performed genetic structure and diversity analyses with sympatric colonies from other Pocillopora species and Pocillopora PSH16 colonies from the tropical southwestern Pacific, revealing (1) a weak clonal richness, (2) a weak genetic diversity and (3) a relative isolation for the newly reported PSH16 colonies. These colonies thus represent either a new, distinct and uncommon, genetic lineage or isolated remnants of a wider one. In any case, unless specific management measures are implemented, their long-term maintenance seems compromised due to restricted gene flow within a restricted pool of genes.

AB Animals that show aggression often risk injury and incur steep energetic costs. Thus, aggression should occur at such times and towards such opponents as to maximize fitness. We tested hypotheses predicting adaptive territorial aggression in the common loon, a species in which ease of observation of territory owners and floaters (prebreeders) seeking to evict them provide a rare window onto owner-floater competition. As predicted, older, more competitive floaters (4-year-olds and upwards) tended to intrude into territories that had produced chicks the previous year (and, hence, were of high quality). Older floaters also showed predicted increases in aggression and territorial yodeling, and a lower rate of submissive behaviors than younger floaters. Floaters of all ages intruded more often than neighboring territory owners, as predicted, but tended to avoid territories with chicks. For their part, owners yodeled more often and behaved more aggressively during chick-rearing, although yodels peaked in frequency 2 weeks before aggression, suggesting that males with young chicks yodel to discourage intrusions, but employ aggression to protect older chicks. Territory owners showed the predicted higher rates of aggression and yodeling towards older, more dangerous floaters than towards young, submissive ones. However, territorial pairs did not treat floaters more aggressively than neighbors, overall. Moreover, owners showed no spike in aggression nor yodeling following a year with chicks, perhaps to avoid providing social information to floaters that use chicks as social information to target territories for eviction. Significance statement Floaters are young nonbreeding individuals that compete with territory owners and are future breeders. Yet floaters are difficult to study because they are mostly unmarked, nomadic individuals. Owing to extensive efforts to capture juvenile common loons, we have established a large population of marked floaters in this species. Hence, loons offer a rare window to investigate efforts of floaters to settle on breeding territories. We found that older floaters (4 to 8 years), which are capable of evicting owners from their territories, target high-quality territories for their intrusions, show more aggression, and show less submissiveness during intrusions than do young floaters. We further discovered that territory owners are more aggressive towards older, more dangerous floaters. Our findings show that territory owners recognize the degree of threat posed by each floater and treat each floater differently on that basis.

AB This paper argues that a cluster of pathogens, hazardous labor conditions, and environmental constraints rendered chronic gastrointestinal distress fatal for African laborers living near Lambare ' ne ', Gabon during the 1920s. Application of syndemic theory and epidemiological methods on patient records at Hospital Schweitzer, the central hospital of the region, explain how a seemingly simple diagnosis of chronic gastrointestinal distress belied a complex web of worsening biological and social outcomes for laborers in the tropical forests of central Gabon. An analysis of the syndemic suffering of GI patients reveals how the dysentery pathogen became tied to the peaks and valleys of the colonial economy, and in particular, the colonial extraction of tropical hardwoods. These processes culminated in the summer of 1929 when the highest number of timber exports coincided with the deadliest months of dysentery outbreak for the patient population at Hospital Schweitzer. This case study proposes syndemics as an effective theoretical framework to research historical precedents of the entanglement of people, pathogens, and illness.

AB Fake controversies have influenced policy making on health and environmental issues for decades, resulting in major implementation setbacks worldwide. As a case study, in this paper we examine fake controversies produced by a small group of active Brazilian researchers that have seriously impacted environmental conservation, particularly in issues related to deforestation and climate change. Based on the literature, we develop a typology of strategies deployed in fake controversies, which include manufacturing uncertainty, misusing scientific credentials, and disregarding scientific literature. Afterwards, we examine the influence of this group of contrarians at the National Congress. We then analyze the fake controversies promoted by these contrarians and argue that, to properly understand them, we need to consider a strategy so far overlooked in the literature: the manufacture of "pseudo-facts", namely, affirmations at odds with the established literature but that strives to appear as scientific facts. Unlike other contexts, in which contrarians have mainly sought to cast doubt on consensual issues by arguing that there are still considerable uncertainties surrounding them, in Brazil pseudo-facts on deforestation have been produced and published outside the peer-reviewed literature. We conclude the study with recommendations on how to oppose fake scientific controversies that threaten environmental conservation in general.

AB Road edge effects consist of changes in abiotic and biotic conditions resulting from the new artificial boundaries on the vegetation that are created by a road. It is known that edge effects can have variable direct and indirect influences on the biota, can be species-specific and also site-specific. However, edge effects for most plant species and most of their respective reproductive components have not been assessed yet, especially for anemochoric plants, which can directly influence the ecosystem structure. Here we evaluated directly and indirectly road edge effects on plant reproductive components (floral visiting bees, fruiting, diaspore herbivory, and diaspore dispersal) of three abundant and sympatric Malpighiaceae anemochoric species in a Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) reserve. We showed that (i) there are direct and indirect road edge effects on the reproductive components of the three anemochoric species; (ii) the road edge effects were not species-specific for all reproductive components, except for floral visiting bees; and (iii) edge influences in plants reproductive components in the cerrado sensu stricto area are restricted to 30 m from the road, except for fruit production. Our results suggest that anthropogenic changes in the landscape should be assessed in detail, as changes that are often considered to be negligible and that are believed to not cause negative damage to the structure of ecosystem, may have impacts on it. A mitigating measure is to avoid fragmentation of forest areas, such as the construction of dirt roads that cross preserved areas.

AB North American freshwater mussel species have experienced substantial range fragmentation and population reductions. These impacts have the potential to reduce genetic connectivity among populations and increase the risk of losing genetic diversity. Thirteen microsatellite loci and an 883 bp fragment of the mitochondrial ND1 gene were used to assess genetic diversity, population structure, contemporary migration rates, and population size changes across the range of the Sheepnose mussel (Plethobasus cyphyus). Population structure analyses reveal five populations, three in the Upper Mississippi River Basin and two in the Ohio River Basin. Sampling locations exhibit a high degree of genetic diversity and contemporary migration estimates indicate that migration within river basins is occurring, although at low rates, but there is no migration is occurring between the Ohio and Mississippi river basins. No evidence of bottlenecks was detected, and almost all locations exhibited the signature of population expansion. Our results indicate that although anthropogenic activity has altered the landscape across the range of the Sheepnose, these activities have yet to be reflected in losses of genetic diversity. Efforts to conserve Sheepnose populations should focus on maintaining existing habitats and fostering genetic connectivity between extant demes to conserve remaining genetic diversity for future viable populations.

AB Estimating the extent of genetic differentiation between populations is an important measure in population genetics, ecology and evolutionary biology. The fixation index, or FST, is an important measure, which is routinely used to quantify this. Previous studies have shown that the FST estimated for selectively constrained regions was significantly lower than that estimated for neutral regions. By deriving the theoretical relationship between FST at neutral and constrained sites, we show that excess in the fraction of deleterious variations segregating within populations compared to those segregating between populations is the cause for the reduction in FST estimated at constrained sites. Using whole-genome data, our results revealed that the magnitude of reduction in FST estimates obtained for selectively constrained regions was much higher for distantly related populations compared to those estimated for closely related pairs. For example, the reduction was 47% for comparison between Europeans and Africans, 30% for the European and Asian comparison, 16% for the Northern and Southern European pair, and only 4% for the comparison involving two Southern European (Italian and Spanish) populations. Since deleterious variants are purged over time due to purifying selection, their contribution to the among-population diversity at constrained sites decreases with the increase in the divergence between populations. However, within-population diversities remain the same for all pairs compared; therefore, the FST estimated at constrained sites for distantly related populations are much smaller than those estimated for closely related populations. We obtained similar results when only the SNPs with similar allele frequencies at neutral and constrained sites were used. Our results suggest that the level of population divergence should be considered when comparing constrained site FST estimates from different pairs of populations.

AB Light and water availability are likely to vary over the lifespan of closed-canopy forest trees, with understory trees experiencing greater limitations to growth by light and canopy trees greater limitation due to drought. As drought and shade have opposing effects on isotope discrimination (Delta C-13), paired measurement of ring width and Delta C-13 can potentially be used to differentiate between water and light limitations on tree growth. We tested this approach for Cedrela trees from three tropical forests in Bolivia and Mexico that differ in rainfall and canopy structure. Using lifetime ring width and Delta C-13 data for trees of up to and over 200 years old, we assessed how controls on tree growth changed from understory to the canopy. Growth and Delta C-13 are mostly anti-correlated in the understory, but this anti-correlation disappeared or weakened when trees reached the canopy, especially at the wettest site. This indicates that understory growth variation is controlled by photosynthetic carbon assimilation due to variation in light levels. Once trees reached the canopy, inter-annual variation in growth and Delta C-13 at one of the dry sites showed positive correlations, indicating that inter-annual variation in growth is driven by variation in water stress affecting stomatal conductance. Paired analysis of ring widths and carbon isotopes provides significant insight in what environmental factors control growth over a tree's life; strong light limitations for understory trees in closed-canopy moist forests switched to drought stress for (sub)canopy trees in dry forests. We show that combined isotope and ring width measurements can significantly improve our insights in tree functioning and be used to disentangle limitations due to shade from those due to drought.

AB Absolute growth rates change with tree size and age, shifting throughout species ontogeny. The study on interspecific variation in plant traits has generated important insights into the life-history strategies and their consequences for ecosystem functioning. However, it remains unknown to what extent - and even if - species' functional traits are related to the variation in their growth trajectories. We set out to model growth trajectories of 45 woody species from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest in a secondary subtropical forest under regeneration, aiming to understand if species can be grouped by their growth patterns throughout ontogeny and if these groups could be classified in distinct ecological strategies based on key plant traits. We used a maximum likelihood estimation approach to predict growth trajectories using three ecologically relevant parameters [maximum growth rate (G(max)), diameter at maximum growth rate (D-opt), and the ontogenetic variability in growth rate (K)] followed by multivariate analyses to detect associations among phylogenetic relationships, plant traits, and growth parameters and classify species into growth pattern groups. Across species, growth trajectory parameters varied widely. The cluster analysis identified three distinct groups based on growth trajectories parameters, which were not functionally or ecologically well defined. Our findings supports the idea that traits describing plant size and tree shape, such as maximum height, canopy volume and height to diameter ratio, were generally the best predictors of species growth parameters throughout ontogeny, even though traits representing resource-use and reproductive strategies also played a significant role. Growth-trait framework can be understood as a continuum of multi-trait combinations where, at one end of the gradient, we find trees with higher growth rate and larger diameters supporting a voluminous canopy combined with lower investment in leaf tissue and smaller diaspore; at the other end, taller trees supporting a smaller canopy with higher investment in leaf tissue and longer diaspore. Ultimately, we have shown that tree architecture, leaf and reproductive traits significantly influence growth trajectory along tree ontogeny, which may be the reason why objectively grouping species based on growth-trajectories parameters is ineffective, at least in highly diverse secondary subtropical forests undergoing regeneration.

AB In the neotropics, potamodromous fish species are among the most severely impacted by dams, which can lead to blocking of the migratory routes, elimination of the breeding areas, and population isolation in this group. However, growing evidence has indicated that free-flowing tributaries along fragmented watersheds provide important contributions to the reproductive migration and recruitment of migratory fish. If this is really occurring, we could expect low or undetectable population differences in different reservoirs and respective unimpeded tributaries along watersheds fragmented by dams. Aiming to test this hypothesis, we assessed the genetic diversity and population structure of Pimelodus maculatus, a migratory catfish species, in seven reservoirs and nine tributaries along the Paranapanema River basin, Paraguay-Parana-Plata system, South America. As predicted in our initial hypothesis, after analyzing nine microsatellite loci and a 406-bp mitochondrial DNA sequence (D-Loop) in 640 individuals, we found high nuclear genetic diversity and non-significant genetic substructuring among each reservoir and its tributaries, contrasting with the results between samples separated by dams. Our findings reinforce the idea that free-flowing tributary rivers are contributing to maintenance of wider population distributions, larger effective population sizes, and satisfactory genetic diversity levels.

AB Examining community responses to habitat configuration across scales informs basic and applied models of ecosystem function. Responses to patch-scale edge effects (i.e., ecological differences between patch edges and interiors) are hypothesized to underpin the effects of landscape-scale fragmentation (i.e., mosaics of multipatch habitat and matrix). Conceptually, this appears justifiable because fragmented habitats typically have a greater proportion of edge than continuous habitats. To critically inspect whether patch-scale edge effects translate consistently (i.e., scale up) into patterns observed in fragmented landscapes, we conducted a meta-analysis on community relationships in seagrass ecosystems to synthesize evidence of edge and fragmentation effects on shoot density, faunal densities, and predation rates. We determined effect sizes by calculating log response ratios for responses within patch edges versus interiors to quantify edge effects, and fragmented versus continuous landscapes to quantify fragmentation effects. We found that both edge and fragmentation effects reduced seagrass shoot densities, although the effect of edge was statistically stronger. By contrast, fauna often exhibited higher densities in patch edges, while fragmentation responses varied directionally across taxa. Fish densities trended higher in patch edges and fragmented landscapes. Benthic fishes responded more positively than benthopelagic fishes to edge effects, although neither guild strongly responded to fragmentation. Invertebrate densities increased in patch edges and trended lower in fragmented landscapes; however, these were small effect sizes due to the offsetting responses of two dominant epifaunal guilds: decapods and smaller crustaceans. Edge and fragmentation affected predation similarly, with prey survival trending lower in patch edges and fragmented landscapes. Overall, several similarities suggested that edge effects conform with patterns of community dynamics in fragmented seagrass. However, across all metrics except fish densities, variability in fragmentation effects was twice that of edge effects. Variance patterns combined with generally stronger responses to edge than fragmentation, warrant caution in unilaterally "scaling-up" edge effects to describe fragmentation effects. Alternatively, fragmentation includes additional factors (e.g., matrix effects, patch number, mean patch size, isolation) that may enhance or offset edge effects. Fragmentation and increased edge are syndromes of habitat degradation, therefore this analysis informs mechanistic models of community change in altered terrestrial and marine systems.

AB Trapliners are pollinators that visit widely dispersed flowers along circuitous foraging routes. The evolution of traplining in hummingbirds is thought to entail morphological specialization through the reciprocal coevolution of longer bills with the long-tubed flowers of widely dispersed plant species. Specialization, such as that exhibited by traplining hummingbirds, is often viewed as both irreversible and an evolutionary dead end. We tested these predictions in a macroevolutionary framework. Specifically, we assessed the relationship between beak morphology and foraging and tested whether transitions to traplining are irreversible and lead to lower rates of diversification as predicted by the hypothesis that specialization is an evolutionary dead end. We find that there have been multiple independent transitions to traplining across the hummingbird phylogeny, but reversals have been rare or incomplete at best. Multiple independent lineages of trapliners have become morphologically specialized, convergently evolving relatively large bills for their body size. Traplining is not an evolutionary dead end however, since trapliners continue to give rise to new traplining species at a rate comparable to non-trapliners.

AB In selectively logged forests, trees grow in an altered environment and tend to display morphological changes, such as height (H) and diameter (D). In this study, effects of selective logging were evaluated on the H:D allometric relationships in six common tree species of the seasonal semi-deciduous forest and whether these effects changed according to the forest stratum: understory species (Actinostemon concolor, Sorocea bonplandii and Inga marginata) and canopy/emergent species (Aspidosperma polyneuron, Campomanesia xanthocarpa and Cabralea canjerana). The study was conducted in two 3000 m(2) (0.3 ha) plots. One plot in a forest remnant selectively logged in the past and another in a conserved forest remnant that no signals of anthropogenic action. Individuals of the six species were marked and their heights and diameters were recorded. There was a greater investment in diameter growth per increment of height in four of the six species in the selectively logged forest remnant in comparison to conserved forest. The lower canopy cover in logged remnant suggests the higher light levels is an important factor in H:D relationship differences between populations of these remnants. The highest light levels in logged forest allows the trees allocate more biomass for diameter growth, increasing safety margin against breakage. Selective logging changes the H:D relationship in a MSFSP remnant demonstrating that luminosity plays an important role in the architectural patterns of tropical rainforests because it is the main limiting resource in the understory stratum.

AB Species loss within a microbial community can increase resource availability and spur adaptive evolution. Environmental shifts that cause species loss or fluctuations in community composition are expected to become more common, so it is important to understand the evolutionary forces that shape the stability and function of the emergent community. Here we study experimental cultures of a simple, ecologically stable community of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus plantarum, in order to understand how the presence or absence of a species impacts coexistence over evolutionary timescales. We found that evolution in coculture led to drastically altered evolutionary outcomes for L. plantarum, but not S. cerevisiae. Both monoculture- and co-culture-evolved L. plantarum evolved dozens of mutations over 925 generations of evolution, but only L. plantarum that had evolved in isolation from S. cerevisiae lost the capacity to coexist with S. cerevisiae. We find that the evolutionary loss of ecological stability corresponds with fitness differences between monoculture-evolved L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae and genetic changes that repeatedly evolve across the replicate populations of L. plantarum. This work shows how coevolution within a community can prevent destabilising evolution in individual species, thereby preserving ecological diversity and stability, despite rapid adaptation.

AB Edge effects are caused by the penetration of abiotic and biotic conditions from the nonforest matrix into forest interiors. Edge effects are particularly relevant to studies of lemur conservation biogeography due to the high levels of forest loss and fragmentation on Madagascar. Moreover, climatic seasonality has influenced many aspects of lemur evolutionary ecology (e.g., diet and ranging patterns). Although lemurs are strongly influenced by seasonality and edge habitats are an increasingly dominant feature of their forest habitats, there are few data on whether or not any species exhibit seasonal responses to edge effects. In this study, we evaluated for the first time whether four lemur species (Avahi peyrierasi, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus ranomafanensis, and Microcebus sp.) exhibited seasonal variations in their edge proximities in SE Madagascar. We conducted diurnal (N = 348) and nocturnal (N = 134) lemur surveys along six transects over 3 years in the Vohibola III Classified Forest. The four lemur species exhibited considerable interspecific differences in the overall distribution and shape of their seasonal edge proximities. A. peyrierasi aggregated significantly further away from the forest edge during the warm, wet season than during the cool, dry season. The combination of a highly selected diet in A. peyrierasi and anthropogenic depletion of their preferred food and sleeping trees in edge habitats may explain seasonal changes in edge proximity. Lack of a seasonal edge effect in the other three lemur species likely reflects their ecological flexibility and in H. g. ranomafanensis and E. rubriventer, active defense of home-ranges and territories, respectively, from conspecifics. Further research is needed to better understand this new described pattern of seasonal variations in edge responses in lemurs.

AB Background Predicting how natural and anthropogenic drivers shape different ecological indicators, such as plant populations along environmental gradients, can be a relevant tool for establishing management and conservation criteria of tropical wetlands. We aimed to assess the effects of seasonal flood disturbance, type of grasslands and topographical conditions on Croton trinitatis population distribution in a tropical wetland. Methods The study was carried out in a seasonally flooded grassland (Central-West Brazil). We conducted samplings of soil on the dry and flood hydrophases of the Pantanal. We took the samples in eight seasonal ponds, with 1 km interval between them. Transects were marked during the flood period, observing the water level, one in the lowest zone, in the middle of the pond = low (ca. 60 cm deep), one at the pond edge = mid (ca. 30 cm deep) and one in the higher zone, on the external part = high (ca. 1 cm deep). Results The results showed that the topography, seasonality, and types of grassland determine differences in the abundance patterns of adult plants and seedlings, and seed bank and seed predation. The abiotic factors can shape plant population-related ecological processes and patterns, with outputs (germination and predation) and inputs (local dispersion and from neighbouring areas) of proportional seeds for the population maintenance in this environment. Conclusion We emphasize the importance of these findings, to show that abiotic factors are not the only ones to be considered in ecological studies of distribution and structuring of populations in habitats with extreme seasonal events.

TI Cryptic population structure and transmission dynamics uncovered for
   Schistosoma mansoni populations by genetic analyses
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION
AB Patterns of diversity in pathogen genomes provide a window into the spatiotemporal spread of disease. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Schistosoma mansoni parasites form genetic clusters that coincide with the communities of their human hosts. We also looked for genetic clustering of parasites at the sub-community level. Our data consists of 14 microsatellite DNA markers, typed from pooled DNA samples from N = 254 infected individuals living in three Brazilian communities. We found a one-to-one correspondence between genetic clusters found by K-means cluster analysis and communities when K = 3. These clusters are also easily identified in a neighbor-joining tree and principal coordinates plots. K-means analysis with K > 3 also reveals genetic clusters of parasites at the sub-community level. These sub-clusters also appear on the neighbor-joining tree and principal coordinates plots. A surprising finding is a genetic relationship between subgroups in widely separated human communities. This connection suggests the existence of common transmission sites that have wide influence. In summary, the genetic structure of S. mansoni in Brazil juxtaposes local isolation that is occasionally broken by long-range migration. Permanent eradication of schistosomes will require both local efforts and the identification of regional infection reservoirs.

AB The associations between functional traits and species distributions across environments have attracted increasing interest from ecologists and can enhance knowledge about how plants respond to the environments. Here, we applied a hierarchical generalized linear model to quantifying the role of functional traits in plant occurrence across topographic gradients. Functional trait data, including specific leaf area, maximum height, seed mass and stem wood density, together with elevation, aspect and slope, were used in the model. In our results, species responses to elevation and aspect were modulated by maximum height and seed mass. Generally, shorter tree species showed positive responses to incremental elevation, while this trend became negative as the maximum height exceeded 22 m. Most trees with heavy seeds (> 1 mg) preferred more southerly aspects where the soil was drier, and those light-seed trees were opposite. In this study, the roles of maximum height and seed mass in determining species distribution along elevation and aspect gradients were highlighted where plants are confronted with low-temperature and soil moisture deficit conditions. This work contributes to the understanding of how traits may be associated with species occurrence along mesoscale environmental gradients.

TI Climate change could reduce and spatially reconfigure cocoa cultivation
   in the Brazilian Amazon by 2050
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID THEOBROMA-CACAO; AGRICULTURE; DEFORESTATION; CIRCULATION; SYSTEMS
AB Cocoa is a plant with origins in northwestern South America with high relevance in the global economy. Evidence indicates that cocoa is sensitive to a dry climate, under which crop production is reduced. Projections for future climate change scenarios suggest a warmer and drier climate in the Amazon basin. In this paper, we quantify the potential effects in cocoa production due to its edaphoclimatic suitability changes to the Brazilian Amazon biome and account for regional differences in planning occupation territories. We modeled the suitability of cocoa's geographical distribution using an ensemble of 10 correlative models that were run in the "biomod2" library and projected to two future climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) by 2050. Combining information on climate and soil suitability and installed infrastructure in the macro-regions of the Brazilian Amazon. We defined a zoning system to indicate how cocoa production may respond to climate change according to the current and future suitability model. Our results suggest that a reduction in precipitation and an increase in temperature may promote a reduction in the suitability of cocoa production in the Brazilian Amazon biome. In addition of the areas suitable for cocoa plantation, we found a 37.05% and 73.15% decrease in the areas suitable for intensification and expansion zones under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, compared with the current scenario. We conclude that there may be a need to expand land to cocoa production in the future, or else it will be necessary to plant a cocoa variety resistant to new climatic conditions. Besides, we recommend procedures to combat illegal deforestation to prevent the most critical climate change scenarios from occurring.

AB More refined knowledge of how tropical forests respond to changes in the abiotic environment is necessary to mitigate climate change, maintain biodiversity, and preserve ecosystem services. To evaluate the unique response of diverse Afrotropical forest communities to disturbances in the abiotic environment, we employ country-wide tree species inventories, remotely sensed climate data, and future climate predictions collected from 104 1-ha plots in the central African country of Gabon. We predict a 3-8% decrease in Afrotropical forest species richness by the end of the century, in contrast to the 30-50% loss of plant diversity predicted to occur with equivalent warming in the Neotropics. This work reveals that forecasts of community species composition are not generalizable across regions, and more representative studies are needed in understudied diverse biomes. This study serves as an important counterpoint to work done in the Neotropics by providing contrasting predictions for Afrotropical forests with substantially different ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic histories.

AB Purpose In plant-soil systems, phosphorus partitioning during the annual cycle related to nitrogen partitioning remains largely unknown. The present study aims at assessing the soil-plant P allocation patterns of four tree species along four phenological stages and its relationship with tissues and soil N concentrations. Methods Cryptomeria japonica, Larix kaempferi, Fagus crenata and Robinia pseudoacacia trees were selected to sample coarse roots, sapwood, foliage, litter and soil during four phenological stages where total and Olsen extractable P and nitrogen content were measured respectively. Results Intra- and inter plant tissue nitrogen correlated well with phosphorus during the four phenological stages, especially root nitrogen. Fagus and Robinia were phosphorus limited, Larix was nitrogen limited and Cryptomeria co-limited. All species reabsorbed phosphorus and nitrogen from foliage prior to leaf abscission and stored nitrogen in roots and sapwood. Phosphorus storage was solely found in sapwood of Robinia. Soil dissolved ammonium correlated positively with nitrogen reabsorption efficiency during the green leaf stage, while single soil nutrient variables did not correlate with phosphorus reabsorption efficiency. Conclusions Plant tissues nitrogen partitioning correlated well with their respective phosphorus partitioning and the increase of soil NH4+ correlated positively with nitrogen reabsorption efficiency, regardless of tree species during the green leaf stage. The results of this study show the intricate relationship that exists between nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil-plant continuum as well as the tree species specific internal cycling of these nutrients.

AB The Sapindales are a large order comprised of trees, shrubs, lianas and rarely herbs. This lineage is mostly pantropical with important temperate lineages, inclusing some of the most diverse, highly prized woods in the world, such as mahogany (Swietenia). In this study, we characterized the wood anatomy across eight of the nine Sapindales families, and leverage phylogenetic comparative methods to explore the evolution of wood traits in the order. We delimited 23 characters and reconstructed them onto the most recent time-calibrated phylogeny for the group. We found that ring-porosity is derived within the order, coinciding with the occupation of more seasonal climates; marginal parenchyma is ancestrally present, but largely lost in Anacardiaceae-Burseraceae-Kirkiaceae; vessels in radial chains are ancestrally absent but gained many times; scanty paratracheal parenchyma was ancestrally present with multiple evolutions of more abundant parenchyma. Anacardiaceae-Burseraceae-Kirkiaceae share tyloses and large vessel-ray pits. Radial ducts are exclusive to Anacardiaceae-Burseraceae, while traumatic ducts are exclusive to Meliaceae-Rutaceae-Simaroubaceae. Rays are generally 2-4 cells wide, heterocellular, but with multiple lineages evolving homocellular narrow rays or more heterocellular wide rays. Prismatic crystals are commonly located in rays in Anacardiaceae-Burseraceae while in the other families they are mainly in axial parenchyma. Silica bodies are abundant in Burseraceae, but also present in Anacardiaceae and Meliaceae. Lianas are exclusively in Anacardiaceae and Sapindaceae, with Sapindaceae displaying an enormous diversity of cambial variants. Our work unravels several potential synapomorphies of Sapindales major clades, and evolutionary patterns for the enormous wood anatomical diversity of the order. In addition, our work highlights variable characters worth of more detailed studies within individual families of the Sapindales.

AB Trees regenerating in the understory respond to increased availability of light caused by gap formation by undergoing a range of morphological and physiological adjustments. These adjustments include the production of thick, sun-type leaves containing thicker mesophyll and longer palisade cells than in shade-type leaves. We asked whether in the shade-regenerating tree Acer pseudoplatanus, the increase in leaf thickness and expansion of leaf tissues are possible also in leaves that had been fully formed prior to the increase in irradiance, a response reported so far only for a handful of species. We acclimated potted seedlings to eight levels (from 1 to 100%) of solar irradiance and, in late summer, transferred a subset of them to full sunlight. Within 30 days, the shaded leaves increased leaf mass per area and became thicker mostly due to elongation of palisade cells, except for the most shaded individuals which suffered irreversible photo-oxidative damage. This anatomical acclimation was accompanied by partial degradation of chlorophyll and a transient decline in photosynthetic efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-M). These effects were related to the degree of pre-shading. The F-v/F-M recovered substantially within the re-acclimation period. However, leaves of transferred plants were shed significantly earlier in the fall, indicating that the acclimation was not fully effective. These results show that A. pseudoplatanus is one of the few known species in which mature leaves may re-acclimate anatomically to increased irradiance. This may be a potentially important mechanism enhancing utilization of gaps created during the growing season.

AB The ecological co-dependency between plants and hummingbirds is a classic example of a mutualistic interaction: hummingbirds rely on floral nectar to fuel their rapid metabolisms, and more than 7000 plant species rely on hummingbirds for pollination. However, threats to hummingbirds are mounting, with 10% of 366 species considered globally threatened and 60% in decline. Despite the important ecological implications of these population declines, no recent review has examined plant-hummingbird interactions in the wider context of their evolution, ecology, and conservation. To provide this overview, we (i) assess the extent to which plants and hummingbirds have coevolved over millions of years, (ii) examine the mechanisms underlying plant-hummingbird interaction frequencies and hummingbird specialization, (iii) explore the factors driving the decline of hummingbird populations, and (iv) map out directions for future research and conservation. We find that, despite close associations between plants and hummingbirds, acquiring evidence for coevolution (versus one-sided adaptation) is difficult because data on fitness outcomes for both partners are required. Thus, linking plant-hummingbird interactions to plant reproduction is not only a major avenue for future coevolutionary work, but also for studies of interaction networks, which rarely incorporate pollinator effectiveness. Nevertheless, over the past decade, a growing body of literature on plant-hummingbird networks suggests that hummingbirds form relationships with plants primarily based on overlapping phenologies and trait-matching between bill length and flower length. On the other hand, species-level specialization appears to depend primarily on local community context, such as hummingbird abundance and nectar availability. Finally, although hummingbirds are commonly viewed as resilient opportunists that thrive in brushy habitats, we find that range size and forest dependency are key predictors of hummingbird extinction risk. A critical direction for future research is to examine how potential stressors - such as habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and introduction of non-native plants - may interact to affect hummingbirds and the plants they pollinate.

TI Integrating ecosystem markets to co-ordinate landscape-scale public
   benefits from nature
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; PAYMENTS; GOODS
AB Ecosystem markets are proliferating around the world in response to increasing demand for climate change mitigation and provision of other public goods. However, this may lead to perverse outcomes, for example where public funding crowds out private investment or different schemes create trade-offs between the ecosystem services they each target. The integration of ecosystem markets could address some of these issues but to date there have been few attempts to do this, and there is limited understanding of either the opportunities or barriers to such integration. This paper reports on a comparative analysis of eleven ecosystem markets in operation or close to market in Europe, based on qualitative analysis of 25 interviews, scheme documentation and two focus groups. Our results indicate three distinct types of markets operating from the regional to national scale, with different modes of operation, funding and outcomes: regional ecosystem markets, national carbon markets and green finance. The typology provides new insights into the operation of ecosystem markets in practice, which may challenge traditionally held notions of Payment for Ecosystem Services. Regional ecosystem markets, in particular, represent a departure from traditional models, by using a risk-based funding model and aggregating both supply and demand to overcome issues of free-riding, ecosystem service trade-offs and land manager engagement. Central to all types of market were trusted intermediaries, brokers and platforms to aggregate supply and demand, build trust and lower transaction costs. The paper outlines six options for blending public and private funding for the provision of ecosystem services and proposes a framework for integrating national carbon markets and green finance with regional ecosystem markets. Such integration may significantly increase funding for regenerative agriculture and conservation across multiple habitats and services, whilst addressing issues of additionality and ecosystem service trade-offs between multiple schemes.

TI Identification of source populations for reintroduction in extinct

AB The use of genetically closely related populations as reintroduction sources is crucial in restoration programmes for endangered species because genetically distant populations may cause genetic disturbances. Aporia hippia (Lepidoptera; Pieridae) is an endangered subalpine grassland butterfly in Japan and its distribution area is restricted to the Asama, Yatsugatake and Akaishi Mountains in central Honshu Island. In the Yatsugatake Mountains, its population is probably already extinct, and reintroduction from the other sites is now under consideration. Here, we estimated the genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of A. hippia in Japan to identify candidate source populations for reintroduction in extinct populations via multiplexed inter-simple sequence repeat genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq) and mitochondrial DNA sequencing methods. The MIG-seq method indicated the presence of very few genetic differences among the populations. The mitochondrial DNA sequencing method identified two haplotypes: haplotype A in the Asama, Yatsugatake and northern Akaishi Mountains, and haplotype B in the central and southern Akaishi Mountains. The two haplotypes exhibited only a one base pair substitution between them. Implications for insect conservation: Based on these results, we suggest the existence of two conservation units: the first group consisting of populations in the Asama, Yatsugatake, and northern Akaishi Mountains, and the second group consisting of those in the central and southern Akaishi Mountains. According to this genetic proximity, however, all populations of A. hippia in Japan can also be defined as one conservation unit group, given the risk of inbreeding depression or difficulty of adaptation in different environments.

AB The blenniids of the genus Scartichthys are one of the most common fishes of Central and South American Pacific coastal reefs. This being said, Scartichthys spp. remain difficult to identify in the field, and identification is particularly challenging across the c. 6000 km where three of the four currently accepted species are known to occur in sympatry. A reason for this is that the main taxonomic characters from traditional taxonomy are indeed elusive. In addition, at the same time, species can display multiple colour patterns in the field, depending on their ontogenetic stage, habitat association and reproductive behaviour. Overall, molecular characterization is warranted to help address these issues. In this study, the authors have used a novel approach to revise the genus by combining colouration, morphological and molecular data of representative specimens of the four currently valid species and seven described colour patterns. From this, the authors show that only three of the four species should be considered as valid; Scartichthys gigas (Steindachner, 1876), Scartichthys variolatus (Valenciennes, 1836) and Scartichthys viridis (Valenciennes, 1836), whereas Scartichthys crapulatus (Williams, Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, 1990, 492, 1-30) should be synonymized with S. viridis. In the same way, the analyses in this study show that one of the colour patterns attributed so far only to S. gigas is characteristic of the juvenile stages of S. viridis. The time-calibrated phylogeny of this study shows that this genus is relatively young and that the estimated time of divergence between S. gigas and S. viridis is c. 1.71 Ma. In comparison, the Desventuradas and Juan Fernandez Islands endemic S. variolatus diverged c. 1.95 Ma. The results of this study help to clarify the taxonomy of Scartichthys.

AB Surgeonfishes have had a long evolutionary history that has been closely linked with coral reef ecosystems. Today they are a key component of reef fish assemblages, playing a pivotal role in a variety of ecosystem functions. However, coral reefs are at the forefront of environmental change with a suite of stressors pushing these ecosystems towards alternative configurations. The role of surgeonfishes in these ecosystems may be changing and our understanding of these fishes must now be considered within a context of change. To explore these issues, we review the literature on surgeonfishes and examine (1) how their functional roles on coral reefs have evolved over the past 50 million years, (2) the key functions performed by surgeonfishes on present-day coral reefs, and (3) predict how the nature and importance of these roles may change in the near future (similar to 30 years). Specifically, we draw on recently clarified functional frameworks to categorise surgeonfishes into six broad functional groups (browsers, brushers, croppers, concealed croppers, sediment-suckers, water-column feeders) using morphological and behavioural traits. Subsequently, we explore how these functional groups make critical contributions to the ecosystem processes of macroalgal removal, algal turf removal, detritus removal, sediment dynamics, plankton harvesting and cross-habitat trophic linkages Furthermore, using this framework we consider how environmental factors, anthropogenic stressors, as well as other behavioural and morphological traits can shape the delivery of key functions by surgeonfishes. Finally, we highlight how surgeonfishes may play increasingly important roles in supporting key functions and services on current and future, highly-altered, coral reefs.

AB Context Conversion of land cover by urban expansion is typically thought to reduce functional diversity by homogenizing species composition, at least in well-studied temperate locations. Studies of highly diverse and disturbance-sensitive tropical ecosystems remain rare. Objectives By exhaustively surveying resident forest bird communities across an urbanizing Neotropical region we aimed to: (1) assess the patterns and landscape-level correlates of species occurrences in forest habitat; (2) identify trait predictors of species occurrences in urban forest patches; and (3) evaluate the associations between urbanization and phylogenetic and functional diversity. Methods We inventoried forest bird communities along the Panama Canal, an area characterized by a strong urbanization gradient from remnant patches surrounded by a densely populated metropolis (Panama City) to extensive tracts of protected rainforest in National Parks. We determined associations of community composition, species traits, and functional and phylogenetic diversity with landscape-level attributes. Results In contrast to most previous studies reporting community homogenization, forest patches in urbanized central Panama contained different subsets of resident bird species. Species in forests within in the most urbanized subregions generally were those with strong dispersal abilities, short developmental periods, and recent evolutionary histories. Although species identities varied among urban patches, functional and phylogenetic diversity were similar. Conclusions Our results are best characterized by community "simplification"-a loss of species without loss of functional or phylogenetic representation. The dissimilarity of bird community composition among forest patches in urbanized regions appears to be a unique outcome and could be influenced by patch-specific attributes.

AB Background Salvia macrosiphon is an aromatic perennial species of Lamiaceae family that grows naturally in different parts of Iran. This herb is widely used in folk and modern medicine. Although in Flora Iranica and Flora of Iran, no infraspecific taxonomic rank has been detected for S. macrosiphon, some infraspecific taxonomic ranks have been reported. In the current study, we evaluated the genetic diversity and structure of 11 populations of this species to detect inter and intrapopulation genetic diversity and to survey the possibility of infraspecific taxonomic ranks in this species. Methods and results We utilized the modified C-TAB protocol for DNA extraction and amplified the genomes using several SCoT molecular markers. We calculated of genetic diversity and polymorphism parameters using GenAlex 6.4, Geno-Dive ver.2, PopGene, PopART and Structure 2.3.4. The parameters of genetic polymorphism differed between the populations. Moreover, a low rate of gene flow supported a moderate level of population's genetic diversity and differentiation. According to haplotypes network (TCS) analysis, a high level of genetic mutation has occurred among the individuals of some populations leading to high intrapopulation diversity. On the basis of structure analysis and Nei's genetic distance, the examined populations were classified into four genotypes. Conclusions The clustering pattern of the populations in each group was not related to geographical distance or phytogeography. It seems that the wide geographic distribution, a small gene flow rate and the occurrence of a high level of genetic mutation lead to infraspecific genetic differentiation in the species and we suppose some infraspecific ranks exist for it.

AB Background: Tropical montane forests are important reservoirs of carbon and biodiversity but are threatened by deforestation and climate change. It is important to understand how forest structure and aboveground biomass change along gradients of elevation and succession. Questions: What are the interactive effect of elevation and two stages of succession on forest structural parameters? Studied species: Tree communities. Study site and dates: Cofre de Perote, Veracruz, Mexico. August to December 2015. Methods: We studied four sites along an elevational gradient (500, 1,500, 2,500, and 3,500 m). At each elevation and each forest type, we established five 20 x 20 m plots (n = 40 plots). Within each plot, we measured stem density, mean diameter at breast height (dbh), and tree height and derived basal area and aboveground biomass (AGB). Results: AGB peaked at 2,500 m and was significantly related to elevation and succession, with higher values in old-growth forests than in secondary forests at higher altitudes. Lower values of mean dbh and basal area were found at higher elevations. At the lowest elevation, both successional stages had the same values of stem density and AGB. At both lower elevations, secondary forests had higher values of dbh and basal area. There were high biomass stocks in the old-growth forest at 2,500 and 3,500 m. Conclusions: Old-growth forests at higher elevations are threatened by deforestation, consequently these remaining fragments must be preserved because of their storage capacity for biomass and their ability to mitigate climate change.

AB Phosphorus (P) cycling is an important yet poorly studied aspect of the macronutrient balance in tropical rainforest ecosystems. As soil P occurs in different organic and inorganic forms (fractions) with varying degrees of lability, we hypothesized that these fractions will vary between soil types, and temporally within soil types. Additionally, we hypothesized a direct influence of leaf litterfall P input on soil total P and soil P fractions. We collected soil and leaf litter samples from three soil types in a central Amazonian lowland rainforest in Brazil over five months, and used a modified Hedleys fractionation method to determine six organic and inorganic soil P fractions, and also total, labile and residual P. Leaf litterfall P concentrations were determined colorimetrically. Soil inorganic and organic P fractions varied between soil types and across months, but soil type and month interactions were mostly non-significant. Some inorganic P fractions (P-i-NaOH) peaked while the organic fractions (P-o-NaOH) fell and vice versa. Leaf litterfall production and leaf litterfall P input peaked around two months following the wettest month. Leaf litterfall P input was a significant predictor of P-o-NaHCO3, a bioavailable P fraction. Future studies on P cycling in terrestrial ecosystems should examine the roles played by individual soil P fractions as they cycle asynchronistically and differently across soil types.

AB Forests are an important natural resource that provides to society several valuable goods and services that include timber, fuel, food, chemicals, medicines, climate regulation, and soil protection. Forests in several developing countries are however being destroyed at a rapid rate with adverse impacts such as increased soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and increased emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. The causes of deforestation are complex and diverse and depend on the socio-economic, political, cultural, legal and institutional contexts of the countries in which the affected forests are located. This paper examines the deforestation trends in developing countries and discusses the key drivers of deforestation in these countries. The paper also identifies and discusses some approaches that can be used to reduce deforestation. The insights provided by the paper can be practically applied to formulate policies, strategies and action plans for improving forest management and enhancing both their economic contribution and role in sustainable development.

AB Here we describe a new species of Lancehead (Bothrops jabrensis sp. nov.) based on three individuals sampled from a previously unknown population from Pico do Jabre, an isolated and small Caatinga moist-forest enclave (CMFE) located in northeastern Brazil. Although this new species has an external morphology resembling those found in representatives of the Bothrops jararaca (Wied-Neuwied, 1824) species group, B. jabrensis can be diagnosed by a combination of meristic and color characters. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates the new species represents a unique and highly divergent lineage within Bothrops revealing the existence of a previously unknown phylogenetic lineage that has been evolving as an independent unit for more than 8 million years. Additionally, the estimated divergence time of this lineage conflicts with some proposed scenarios of historical processes associated with the evolution of CMFEs. Finally, the uniqueness of this species indicates its relevance for the maintenance of the phylogenetic diversity of Lanceheads in South America. Like other CMFEs, Pico do Jabre is consistently threatened by poaching, illegal fires, deforestation for agricultural purposes, and illegal logging. The restricted distribution of B. jabrensis, in a small and disturbed CMFE, strongly suggests that this species is critically endangered and is likely approaching extinction as a natural population.

AB Deforestation continues at rapid rates despite global conservation efforts. Evidence suggests that governance may play a critical role in influencing deforestation, and while a number of studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between national-level governance and deforestation, much remains to be known about the relative importance of subnational governance to deforestation outcomes. With a focus on the Brazilian Amazon, this study aims to understand the relationship between governance and deforestation at the municipal level. Drawing on the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) as a guiding conceptual framework, and incorporating the additional dimension of environmental governance, we identified a wide array of publicly available data sources related to governance indicators that we used to select relevant governance variables. We compiled a dataset of 22 municipal-level governance variables covering the 2005-2018 period for 457 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon. Using an econometric approach, we tested the relationship between governance variables and deforestation rates in a fixed-effects panel regression analysis. We found that municipalities with increasing numbers of agricultural companies tended to have higher rates of deforestation, municipalities with an environmental fund tended to have lower rates of deforestation, and municipalities that had previously elected a female mayor tended to have lower rates of deforestation. These results add to the wider conversation on the role of local-level governance, revealing that certain governance variables may contribute to halting deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB The Atlantic Forest harbors 7% of global biodiversity and possesses high levels of endemism, but many of its component taxa remain unstudied. Due to the importance of tropical forests and the urgency to protect them, there is a compelling need to address this knowledge gap. To provide more information on its arthropod fauna, a Malaise trap was deployed for 12 months in a semi-degraded area of the southern Upper Parana ecoregion of the Atlantic Forest. All specimens were DNA barcoded and the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system was employed to assign each specimen to a species proxy. DNA barcodes were obtained from 75,500 arthropods that included representatives of 8,651 BINs. Nearly 81% of these BINs were first records, highlighting the high rates of endemism and lack of study of arthropods from the Atlantic Forest. Diptera was the most abundant order, followed by Hemiptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. Diptera was also the most species-rich order, followed by Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera, a result consistent with studies in other biogeographic regions. Insects were most abundant in winter and most diverse in autumn and winter. This pattern, however, was caused mainly by the dynamics of dipteran diversity as other orders differed in their seasonal variation. The BIN composition of the insect community varied sharply through the year and also differed between the two consecutive summers included in the sampling period. The study of the 38 commonest BINs showed that seasonal patterns of abundance were not order-specific. Temperature had the strongest impact on seasonal abundance variation. Our results highlight the striking and understudied arthropod diversity of the highly fragmented Atlantic Forest, the predominance of dipterans, and the fact that abundance and richness in this insect community peak in the coolest months. Standardized studies like this generate fast and reliable biodiversity inventories and unveil ecological patterns, thus providing valuable information for conservation programs.

AB We analyzed the seasonal variation in the diet, trophic niche breadth (Levins index), the partitioning of food resources (Pianka's symmetric index) and trophic level (weighed average of trophic level of each prey determined in FishBase and SeaLifeBase platform) of Plagioscion squamosissimus (Heckel, 1840) and Hydrolycus scomberoides (Cuvier, 1819) in the Machado River, Rondonia, Brazil. Fish samplings were conducted bimonthly from June 2013 to May 2015 in five sites, using eight sets of gillnets. The occurrence frequency and volumetric frequency were used to quantify the food items. We analyzed the stomach contents of 283 individuals, 134 of H. scomberoides and 149 of P. squamosissimus. Fish were the most consumed food item by both piscivorous species. However, H. scomberoides mostly ingested pelagic fish (e.g. Characiformes fishes and Prochilodus nigricas Spix & Agassiz, 1829), while P. squamosissimus mostly consumed benthic fish [e.g. Pimelodus blochii Valenciennes, 1840 and Tenellus trimaculatus (Boulenger, 1898)]. Hydrolycus scomberoides presented the trophic level 3.55 for both periods analyzed, while P. squamosissimus 4.01 in the flood period and 3.82 in the drought period. Seasonal variations in the diet of H. scomberoides and P. squamosissimus were observed (PERMANOVA). Specifically, P. squamosissimus consumed mainly "Siluriformes" fishes and P. blochii in the drought period. The trophic niche breadth of P. squamosissimus was greater than that of H. scomberoides in the flood period. The species P. squamosissimus and H. scomberoides had low (0.35) food niche overlap in both seasons analysed. The data indicated that P. squamosissimus has a generalist feeding habit, while H. scomberoides is specialized in prey selection. The overlap of food niche between the species in both periods of the hydrological cycle was low, indicating that niche partitioning was probably the main mechanism of coexistence of these species, with little relationship with variations of the hydrological cycle.

AB Prochilodus lineatus is a species of migratory fish widely distributed in the Parana River basin, found mainly in the Grande, Pardo and Mogi-Guacu rivers located in a well-developed region of the state of Sao Paulo. This study analyzes the genetic diversity and population structure in shoals of P. lineatus based on temporal analysis of specimens sampled over the years 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2015 in the Mogi-Guacu River, Sao Paulo, at the region of Cachoeira de Emas. Genetic analysis performed using the D-Loop and seven microsatellite marker revealed significant genetic variability in all sampled groups. Moderate levels of structuring between groups were identified with the microsatellite markers (Fst = 0.14), while the mitochondrial marker did not reveal patterns of genetic structuring (Fst = 0.01). The genetic variability fluctuated over time, characterizing patterns of structuring among the analyzed samples. The occurrence of environmental alterations resulting in increased mortality rates, as well as changes in the water level in the ecosystem, among other factors, could determine changes in the reproductive behavior of species. The lack of favorable environmental conditions for reproduction in the basin, as reflected by tests of population bottlenecks, could have resulted in the differentiation of populations of P. lineatus over time.

AB Cybistax antisyphilitica (Bignoniaceae) is extensively distributed in the Cerrado biome, from typical savannas to forest formations. In these areas, light varies widely in both time and space. The aim of this study was to investigate the initial growth and physiological responses of potted C. antisyphilitica seedlings to natural light conditions. To this end, we cultivated one group of seedlings under full sunlight (FS), a second group under a small gap with medium transmittance (MT) and a third group under canopy shade with low transmittance (LT), in an urban fragment of a tropical semideciduous forest. The daily course of chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured at the beginning, middle and end of the dry season. Also, at the end of the experiment, measurements of leaf gas exchange and growth were carried out. Dynamic photoinhibition was found in seedlings under FS. The photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance and transpiration rates were higher under FS compared to seedlings under LT conditions. Overall, the stem diameter, the dry mass of leaves and stem, total dry mass and relative growth rate were higher in plants under FS and MT than plants under LT. Cybistax antisyphilitica allocated less biomass to stems and leaves and more to the roots, independent of growth conditions. The plasticity at leaf level suggests that C. antisyphilitica can exploit the heterogenous light environment of the semideciduous forest, but the massive development of the roots can contribute to its tolerance to dry periods typical of the Cerrado biome.

AB In this study, we evaluated the isolated effects of interannual and decadal time scales on the water balance of the Amazon basin. This research is interesting because it brings the dynamical response of water balance components to a particular ocean-scale variability. For this, we used the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) and SST filtering techniques. The impact of isolated interannual and decadal time scales was quantified for episodes of ENSO and the Atlantic dipole (AD). The results show that isolated interannual scales weaken the impacts of El Nino and La Nina on water balance components in the northern Amazon and northeastern Brazil. Such weakening is more evident in episodes of El Nino than in those of La Nifia. This indicates that El Nino is more dependent on other time scales (in addition to interannual) than is La Nina. In relation to the Atlantic, a positive AD increases (decreases) precipitation in the northern (southern) Amazon basin in the experiment with all SST time scale variabilities. On the other hand, when the decadal scale is isolated, an increase in precipitation in the northern basin is not observed, losing the dipole pattern in the precipitation anomaly between the northern and southern Amazon basin. BAM is not sensitive to a negative AD when SST is isolated in the decadal scale. These results are important for monitoring the climate of humid tropical regions, mainly for the study of ENSO, since, according to recent research, these extreme events will be increasingly frequent and intense.

AB Windthrows are common, natural disturbances in forest ecosystems. One of the effects of these disturbances is the exposure of mineral soil, which is gradually colonised by plants and other organisms via secondary succession. The aim of this research, conducted in the windthrows in the Kampinos National Park (central Poland), was to determine the changes in composition, richness, and abundance of the bryophytes and lichens inhabiting the mineral habitats of uprooted trees and to identify the level of its distinctiveness from the surrounding forest floor. The largest number of species (28) was found in pits; fewer species were found on the lower part of the uproot mounds (21), and in the vicinity of the uprooted trees (16). Many species differed in abundance and in their fidelity to the selected habitat types. Significant changes in the species richness and composition of the habitat types were observed between the first and third year after the dis??? turbance. A large number of species inhabited the pits, and there was a gradual increase in the lower parts of the uproot plates. The communities of the pits and lower parts of the mounds were similar in the first year after the windthrow. After three years the pits became more similar to the undisturbed sites, whereas the opposite tendency was observed in relation to lower parts of the mounds. There were important differences in (a) condition between the studied habitats as estimated using ecological indicator values, and (b) the share of species with different types of growth forms and life strategies.

AB S. macrophylla is an important forest species with economic value, however its main problem is its ecological vulnerability to the attack of H. grandella. In this sense, the objective in this study was to determine the effect of A. indica and J. curcas in reducing the attack of H. grandella on S. macrophylla plants planted in agroforestry systems. For this, the basal diameter (mm), height of plant (cm), attacked plants (%), attacked stems (%), apices attacked (%), leaves attacked (%), survival and mortality of larvae were evaluated (%). The lowest percentage of attack of H. grandella in S. macrophylla plants was registered in the association S. macrophylla with T. cacao and A. indica and also in S. macrophylla with T. cacao and J. curcas, planted at 1 m x 3 m, with 0.95 and 2.85%, respectively. However, the greater survival and mortality of larvae of H. grandella was registered in the association S. macrophylla with T. cacao and in S. macrophylla with T. cacao and J. curcas with 90.20 and 88.89% respectively. Thus, the use of A. indica and J. curcas significantly promote the reduction of H. grandella attack on S. macrophylla plants planted in agroforestry systems.

AB Establishment of exotic invasive species causes many negative implications in restoration programmes such as out competing native species, thereby altering the structure, composition and function of the target ecosystem. Although Alstonia macrophylla is an exotic invasive tree species in Sri Lanka, its impact on native flora is undermined due to its timber value. The influence of A. macrophylla on the composition and dynamics of new recruits in an eleven-year-old restoring pine plantation (RP) was investigated and compared to a 25???30-year-old unrestored Pine plantation (UP) in Hantana, Sri Lanka. In both stands, the dominant species and the highest densities in all life stages (seedlings, saplings and trees) of the woody plants were represented by A. macrophylla. This species survived better than the non-Alstonia species in RP, than in UP, and was well represented in all diameter at breast height (dbh) classes in RP. The negative correlation between rainfall and mortality of Alstonia and non-Alstonia was stronger in UP than that in RP. The study concludes that considering life history strategies and invasive behavior of A. macrophylla in pine conversion programmes, they must be managed at different time scales (short, mid and long term) using silvicultural techniques to achieve restoration goals in the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka.

AB The genus Medicago L. (Fabaceae) comprises approximately 87 different spe-cies of herbs and shrubs widespread from the Mediterranean to central Asia. Medicago polymorpha is a herbaceous legume that can be a useful pasture plant, in particular, in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It had aroused great interest due to high nutri-tious quality, highly palatability and N-fixing plan in neutral soil. There is no informa-tion on its population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and morphological variability in Iran. Due to the medicinal importance of this species, a genetic variability and pop-ulations' structure study is performed studying 15 geographical populations of Medica-go polymorpha. Therefore, we used six inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) markers and 15 combined IRAP markers to reveal within and among popula-tion genetic diversity in this plant. AMOVA test produced significant genetic difference (PhiPT = 0.46, P = 0.010) among the studied populations and also revealed that, 66% of total genetic variability was due to within population diversity while, 34% was due to among population genetic differentiation. Mantel test showed positive significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance of the studied popula-tions. STRUCTURE analyses and population assignment test revealed some degree of gene flow among these populations. PCoA plot of populations was in agreement with UPGMA clustering of molecular data. These results indicated that geographical popu-lations of Medicago polymorpha are well differentiated based on (IRAP) markers.

AB Aim Grasslands of varying land-use intensity and history were studied to describe and test species richness and compositional patterns and their relationships with the physical environment, land cover of the surrounding landscape, patch geometry, and grazing. Location The mainland of Norway. Methods We utilized data from the Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Agricultural Landscapes, which recorded vascular plants from 569 plots, placed within 97 monitoring squares systematically distributed throughout agricultural land on the Norwegian mainland. We identified four grassland types: (i) moderately fertilized, moist meadows; (ii) overgrown agricultural land; (iii) cultivated pastures and disturbed ground; and (iv) natural/unfertilized and outfield pastures. Results Soil moisture and grazing measures were found to be important in explaining species compositional variation in all grassland types. Richness patterns were best explained by complex and differing combinations of environmental indicators. Nevertheless, negative (nitrogen and light level) or unimodal (pH) responses were similar across grassland types. Vegetation plots adjacent to areas historically and/or currently dominated by mires, forests, or pastures, as well as abandoned and overgrown grasslands, had a slightly higher species richness. Larger grasslands surrounding the vegetation plots had slightly less species than smaller grasslands. Conclusions This study demonstrates that data from a national monitoring programme on agricultural grasslands can be used for plant ecological research. The results indicate that climate-change-related shifts along moisture and nutrient gradients (increases) may alter both species composition and species richness in the studied grasslands. It is likely that large and contiguous managed (grass)land might affect areas perceived as remnants, probably caused by the transformation to homogeneous (agri)cultural landscapes reducing edge zones, which in turn may threaten the species pool and richness. The importance of land use and land-cover composition should be considered when planning management actions in extensively used high-latitude grasslands.

AB Expert knowledge is widely used for assessing the conservation status of little-known species. Pterocymbium oceanicum is a large, emergent tree endemic to Fiji. Experts classified the species as 'Critically Endangered' (IUCN Red List) in 2016 and estimated the population size at <250 mature individuals with the largest subpopulation consisting of a single stand of 100 individuals. We surveyed this stand and counted 133 individuals, which validated the expert estimate. However, we discovered an additional three stands nearby, increasing the total subpopulation size to 433 individuals. Therefore, the expert estimate reliably and conservatively estimated population size but missed important information. Field surveys suggest that P. oceanicum has a narrow ecological niche as a long-lived early pioneer at mid-elevations (400-800 m) in seasonally dry forests, one of Fiji's most degraded ecosystems. The introduced African Tulip Tree, Spathodea campanulata, is invading the sampled subpopulation and shares the characteristics of being a large, fast-growing and early successional tree. Therefore, the narrow niche of P. oceanicum may now be threatened by S. campanulata. Our study highlights that expert knowledge can provide valuable information about threatened species but also has limitations. IUCN Red List assessments based solely on expert assessments should therefore be cautiously interpreted. The invasion by S. campanulata poses a serious threat to P. oceanicum and needs to be carefully monitored, with the impacts of S. campanulata on the establishment and growth of P. oceanicum requiring urgent investigation.

AB Background The increasing demand for local food production is fueling high interest in the development of controlled environment agriculture. In particular, LED technology brings energy-saving advantages together with the possibility of manipulating plant phenotypes through light quality control. However, optimizing light quality is required for each cultivated plant and specific purpose.
   Findings This article shows that the combination of LED gradient set-ups with imaging-based non-destructive plant phenotyping constitutes an interesting new screening tool with the potential to improve speed, logistics, and information output. To validate this concept, an experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of a complete range of red:blue ratios on 7 plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, Euphorbia peplus, Ocimum basilicum, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum, and Setaria viridis. Plants were exposed during 30 days to the light gradient and showed significant, but species-dependent, responses in terms of dimension, shape, and color. A time-series analysis of phenotypic descriptors highlighted growth changes but also transient responses of plant shapes to the red:blue ratio.
   Conclusion This approach, which generated a large reusable dataset, can be adapted for addressing specific needs in crop production or fundamental questions in photobiology.

AB The Brazilian government intends to complete the paving of the BR-319 highway, which connects Porto Velho in the deforestation arc region with Manaus in the middle of the Amazon Forest. This paving is being planned despite environmental legislation, and there is concern that its effectiveness will cause additional deforestation, threatening large portions of forest, conservation units (CUs), and indigenous lands (ILs) in the surrounding areas. In this study, we evaluated environmental degradation along the BR-319 highway from 2008 to 2020 and verified whether highway maintenance has contributed to deforestation. For this purpose, we created a 20 km buffer adjacent to the BR-319 highway and evaluated variables extracted from remote sensing information between 2008 and 2020. Fire foci, burned areas, and rainfall data were used to calculate a drought index using statistical tests for a time series. Furthermore, these were related to data on deforestation, CUs, and ILs using principal component analysis and Pearson's correlation. Our results showed that 743 km(2) of forest was deforested during the period evaluated, most of which occurred in the last four years. A total of 16,472 fire foci were identified. Both deforestation and fire foci occurred mainly outside the CUs and ILs. The most affected areas were close to capital cities, and after resuming road maintenance in 2015, deforestation increased outside the capital cities. Current government policy for Amazon occupation promotes deforestation and will compromise Brazil's climate goals of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and deforestation.

AB Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) is the only cultivated and commercially important species in the genus Pistacia, consisting of a deciduous, dioeciously and wind-pollinated at least 11 tree species. Pistacia vera is native to north Afghanistan, northeast Iran, and central Asian republics. To investigate the genetic diversity of pistachio (Pistacia vera), we genotyped 30 cultivars of this species using 10 Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) markers. The SCoT markers generated 9-25 alleles (155 in total) with an average of 16 per locus. The highest value of percentage polymorphism (61.99%) was observed in Ghafori Rafsanjan (cultivars No.27) which shows high value for gene diversity (0.42) and Shanon, information index (0.39). Genotype Shahpasand (Pust Ghermez) (No.10) has the lowest value for percentage of polymorphism (20%) and the lowest value for Shanon, information index (0.15), and He (0.010). Genetic similarity values obtained from Dice's coefficient ranged from 0.66 (between Akbari (Pust Ghermez) and Badami Dishkalaghi) to 0.88 (between populations Menghar Kalaghi and Kaleghochi (Pust Ghermez). The main objectives of this study were to assess the genetic diversity and genetic relationship of pistachio cultivars in Iran. These results could benefit Irainian pistachio germplasm collection, conservation and future breeding.

AB The parental effect on wood anatomy and growth rings of Cordia trichotoma trees was studied. Tree seeds of two provenances (Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes) were collected in 1986. Seedlings were planted, and after 25 years, twelve wood disks were collected from six trees from each provenance. Anatomical features and growth rings were analyzed according to standard techniques. Qualitative anatomy of wood indicated similarities between the two provenances, except for the presence of geniculate vessels found in woods from the Cerrado. However, the greatest differences in wood anatomy were quantitative. Provenances from Cerrado had wood with shorter vessel and fibers elements, less fiber lumen, less parenchyma per mm 2 , and more vessels per group than did provenances from the Atlantic Forest. Cross dating among the radial growth ring series was performed through visual and statistical procedures. The relationships between tree rings and meteorological records were performed through Pearson's correlation, and through dendro-climatic analysis that identified the end summer precipitation as the major factor affecting tree growth at inter annual timescale. The standard chronologies of tree-ring width series showed similarity between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest provenances, but with small differences in the juvenile period of live of trees. The rains that decreased between April and June associated with the gradual decrease in temperature may have reduced the cambial activity and caused the formation of tree rings with small differences between the two provenances. The results of this study are relevant for climate adaptive forestry: they emphasize the importance of heritability in the plasticity of certain features of wood anatomy related to the environmental conditions in which they grow, while the growth rate and its year-by-year variability show small differences.

AB It is estimated that human body is inhabited by approximately 380 trillions of viruses, which exist in the form of viral communities and are collectively termed as human virome. How virome is assembled and what kind of forces maintain the composition and diversity of viral communities is still an open question. The question is of obvious importance because of its implications to human health and diseases. Here we address the question by harnessing the power of Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) in terms of three neutral models including standard Hubbell's neutral model (HNM), Sloan's near-neutral model (SNM) and Harris et al. (2017) multi-site neutral model (MSN), further augmented by Ning et al. (2019) normalized stochasticity ratio (NSR) and Hammal et al. (2015) power analysis for the neutral test (PNT). With the five models applied to 179 virome samples, we aim to obtain robust findings given both Type-I and Type-II errors are addressed and possible alternative, non-neutral processes are detected. It was found that stochastic neutral drifts seem prevalent: approximately 65-92% at metacommunity/landscape scales and 67-80% at virus species scale. The non-neutral selection is approximately 26-28% at community scale and 23% at species scale. The false negative rate is about 2-3%, which suggested rather limited confounding effects of non-neutral process on neutrality tests. We postulate that prevalence of neutrality in human virome is likely due to extremely simple structure of viruses (stands of DNA/RNA) and their inter-species homogeneities, forming the foundation of species equivalence-the hallmark of neutral theory.

AB An integral part of the courtship sequence of the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) involves the male raising his wings to expose tergal glands on his dorsum. When a female cockroach feeds on the secretion of these glands, she is optimally positioned for mating. Core chemical components have been identified, but the effect of male diet on the quality of the tergal gland secretion remains unexplored. After validating the pivotal role of tergal feeding in mating, we starved or fed reproductively mature males for one week. We then paired each male with a sexually receptive female and observed their interactions through an infrared-sensitive camera. While starvation had no effect on male courtship behavior, it did influence the duration of female tergal feeding and mating outcomes. Females fed longer on the gland secretion of fed males, and fed males experienced greater mating success than starved males (73.9% vs. 48.3%, respectively). These results suggest that the quality of the tergal gland secretions, and by association mating success, are dependent on the nutritional condition of the male.

AB Environmental factors and dispersal can influence the structure of biological communities. Their effects can depend on the functional features of the species in the community. Since species belonging to the same trophic level, such as phytoplankton, may show functional differences, we investigated whether the effects of environment and dispersal differ among phytoplankton species from different functional groups. We analyzed data from a rainy and a dry period in 30 reservoirs in a subtropical region. In both periods, the environment as well as high and limited dispersal influenced the metacommunity structure. The functional groups had a low correspondence in their response to both dispersal and environment. Our results showed that the influence of the processes underlying the structure of the metacommunities, such as species sorting (environment influence), mass effect (high dispersal), and neutral dynamics (limited dispersal), depended on the functional characteristics of the organisms and could vary even among species of the same trophic level. These findings suggested that species at the same trophic level could not be considered ecological equivalents. This paper includes a Portuguese and Spanish version of the abstract in the online resources.

AB Background: The deforestation caused by road construction is one of the main drivers for both biodiversity and function loss in tropical ecosystems. Terricolous cryptogams are pioneers in colonizing roadside and they are limited by environmental and edaphic factors, thus, cryptogams may act as pioneers for ecosystem rehabilitation at roadside.Methods: This research was aimed at determining the diversity and composition of terricolous cryptogams, as well as their relationship with elevation and soil properties among roadside of the tropical Andes of Ecuador, in order to establish indicator species of this anthropized ecosystems. Five elevations were selected and in each one 50 grids of 20 cm x 30 cm were sampled (250 in total along the road), where occurrence, cover and identification of every cryptogam species were recorded. To evaluate the effect of elevation and soil properties on cryptogam richness, a linear model was conducted. Species composition among elevations was compared by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), and their relationship with the environmental variables through a correla-tion with adjusted axes was performed. A total of 72 species were recorded, those being 44 bryophytes and 28 lichens. Species richness and composition of terricolous cryptogams were influenced by elevation and soil properties, thus the richness is higher at elevations E1, E2 and E3 (2600, 2200 and 1800 m a.s.l.), differing from low elevations E4 and E5 (1400 and 1000 m a.s.l.). Higher elevations with specific soil conditions (e.g bulk density, nitrogen and silt) harbored different cryptogam communities than those in lower elevations.Conclusions: A combination of both elevation and soil properties are shaping the colonization by terricolous cryptogams commnunities. As such, 18 species were identified as the best indicators for all sets of environmental conditions at the roadside, which can therefore be considered for monitoring ecological processes in tropical areas. Use of biocrusts for restoration is an emerging field. If implemented in the study region, elevation and soil drivers may help to better chose the more suitable cryptogam species to manage and stabilize roadside in tropical roads.

AB Accurately detecting sudden changes, or steps, in genetic diversity across landscapes is important for locating barriers to gene flow, identifying selectively important loci, and defining management units. However, there are many metrics that researchers could use to detect steps and little information on which might be the most robust. Our study aimed to determine the best measure/s for genetic step detection along linear gradients using biallelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. We tested the ability to differentiate between linear and step-like gradients in genetic diversity, using a range of diversity measures derived from the q-profile, including allelic richness, Shannon Information, G(ST), and Jost-D, as well as Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. To determine the properties of each measure, we repeated simulations of different intensities of step and allele proportion ranges, with varying genome sample size, number of loci, and number of localities. We found that alpha diversity (within-locality) based measures were ineffective at detecting steps. Further, allelic richness-based beta (between-locality) measures (e.g., Jaccard and Sorensen dissimilarity) were not reliable for detecting steps, but instead detected departures from fixation. The beta diversity measures best able to detect steps were: Shannon Information based measures, G(ST) based measures, a Jost-D related measure, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. No one measure was best overall, with a trade-off between those measures with high step detection sensitivity (G(ST) and Bray-Curtis) and those that minimised false positives (a variant of Shannon Information). Therefore, when detecting steps, we recommend understanding the differences between measures and using a combination of approaches.

AB In this paper, we study the general mechanism of Turing-pattern in a tree-grass competition model with cross diffusion and time delay. The properties of four equilibrium points, the existence of Hopf bifurcation and the sufficient conditions for Turing instability caused by cross-diffusion are analyzed, respectively. The amplitude equation of tree-grass competition model is derived by using multi-scale analysis method, and its nonlinear stability is studied. The sensitivity analysis also verified that fire frequency plays a key role in tree-grass coexistence equilibrium. Finally, the Turing pattern of tree-grass model obtained by numerical simulation is consistent with the spatial structure of tree-grass density distribution observed in Hulunbuir grassland, China.

AB The colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri is a cosmopolitan species commonly found in sheltered temperate marine environments, primarily marinas and harbors. Upon release, B. schlosseri larvae settle immediately on hard substrates in the vicinity (< 50 cm) of maternal colonies, suggesting genetically structured populations on fine spatial scales. We used seven microsatellite loci to characterize long-term (2004-2008) genetic structures of a B. schlosseri population residing underneath stones at Michmoret Harbor (along the Israeli Mediterranean coast), revealing a persistent genetic structure through time. Further, Michmoret Harbor was exposed to episodes of natural disturbances (October 2006 and November 2007), during which the entire population was eradicated from shallow waters. These disturbances provided a unique opportunity to study the population genetic dynamics of newly established population of a marine invasive species within its geographic origin. The results revealed a 4-year-long structured single population in Michmoret Harbor that was homogeneous at the time but not at the micro-geographic scale. The B. schlosseri population from Michmoret Harbor showed no genetic changes, in contrast to changes in the distribution of allele frequencies that were reported in other B. schlosseri populations in other parts of the world after natural catastrophic events.

AB Although fire occurrence plays a central role in the dominance of the super-dominant bracken fern Pteridium arachnoideum in Neotropical forests, it is unclear whether this applies to the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), which vegetation is naturally adapted to fire. We assessed fire effects on the aboveground biomass of P. arachnoideum in the Cerrado Ecological Reserve in Central Brazil. We measured frond height, density, standing biomass, and litter biomass before and for two years following a prescribed fire, and also sampled a control site to control for other mortality events and for seasonal variation. The average P. arachnoideum frond height and aboveground biomass decreased over three times in the burnt site 18 months after the fire. The frond density decreased both in the burnt and control site, indicating that this may have been caused in another way than by fire. Conversely, litter biomass decreased shortly after the fire in the burnt site, but returned to pre-fire levels in one year. Possible explanations for the lasting negative effects of fire on the height and biomass of P. arachnoideum include the implementation of the prescribed fire early in the dry season, which likely limited immediate clonal regrowth, and the herbivory by leaf-cutting ants. Nevertheless, the effective clonal growth of P. arachnoideum apparently precluded the fire from having stronger effects and hence this species was not excluded from the site. We conclude that direct and indirect fire effects may cause the decline of P. arachnoideum in Cerrado, so that prescribed fires may be applied as a management strategy in Cerrado sites where this species is super-dominant, ideally in combination with other control measures.

AB Disturbance (e.g. loss of plant cover) increases ambient temperature which can be lethal for ectotherm insects especially in hot places. We compared the thorax temperatures of 26 odonate species as a function of body size, habitat quality ("conserved" and cooler vs "perturbed" and warmer) and suborder (Anisoptera vs Zygoptera), as well as critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and as a function of habitat quality in Argia pulla (Zygoptera) and Orthemis ferruginea (Anisoptera). We expected thorax temperatures to differ between suborders based on their differences in body size and habitat quality status, and that populations in perturbed sites would have higher critical thermal maxima compared to those in conserved sites. This study was done in a tropical region with high ambient temperatures. Anisopterans had a higher body temperature than zygopterans, with no difference between habitats. Thoracic and air temperature were positively related, yet body temperatures were higher than the ambient temperature. A. pulla had higher CTmax in the perturbed sites, while O. ferruginea showed the opposite trend. Microenvironmental changes increase the ambient temperature, perhaps filtering insect species. The apparent resilience of odonates to disturbance should be examined more closely (using more species), especially in small species like the zygopterans which appear to be more strongly affected by ambient temperature.

AB Background: Urban remnant forests are embedded in urban areas and are threatened directly and indirectly by urbanization. The direct effects (e.g., loss of area) have been well studied. However, knowledge about the indirect influence of urbanization through edge effects on the biodiversity in remnant forests is limited.Methods: In this study, we surveyed woody plant species in 72 plots in nine remnant forest patches in Guiyang, China. We examined the influences of urbanization and edge effects on the species diversity and composition of woody plants in remnant forests. We compared alpha diversities and quantified compositional dissimilarities in interior and edge sites at different levels of urbanization. We also measured the niche width of the recorded plant species and assessed whether high levels of urbanization and edge effects increased the number of generalist species.Results and conclusions: The Shannon index, the Simpson index and the Pielou index of adult trees were lowest in the edge habitat under high levels of urbanization. Significant differences in the Shannon index and the Simpson index of sapling/seedling were detected between interior and edge sites under low urbanization. The edge effects on the species composition of adult trees were intensified by high levels of urbanization. Woody plant species with wide niche widths were more abundant at edge sites under high levels of urbanization. Therefore, we recommend that urban expansion surrounding remnant patches should be strictly controlled to alleviate edge effects on biodiversity.

AB Habitat fragmentation is one of the leading causes of edge genesis and its effects. Functional tree traits such as wood density, height, and diameter are essential variables from which it is possible to infer several ecological processes. This study assessed the variability of the functional traits of trees over two habitats (edge and interior) of a forest remnant The hypothesis tested were i) the functional traits would have lower values at the edges than the interior, and ii) environmental variables would influence such differences. This study was carried out in the largest Atlantic Forest remnant within Serra da Tiririca State Park, Brazil, by establishing ten plots (50 x 20 m) among different habitats. Within each plot, wood samples were taken from all trees with a diameter of >= 10 cm. It was recorded the altitude, distance from the plots to the edge, and fire records as possible explanatory variables (environmental variables). Wood density was obtained using the immersion method. To verify differences in functional traits by habitat, the Wilcoxon test was applied. Additionally, the influence of explanatory variables on functional traits through generalized linear models was evaluated. One hundred eighty-five trees were recorded at the edges and 218 trees at the interior of the remnant. Wood density and tree height were significantly lower in the edges than in the interior. Furthermore, the best models indicated significant relationships between wood density and habitats, as well as diameter and distance to the edge. This study was effective in raising suitable variables to predict edge effects.

AB Fires and habitat fragmentation are responsible for devastating large ecosystems around the biosphere. The increasing use of remote sensing allows fire patterns to be identified and plays an essential role in preventing fires. In this context, this study aimed to describe the variation in evidence of fire between the edge and the interior of an Atlantic Forest remnant in southeastern Brazil and infer its effects on vegetation. Fire records were acquired between 2010 and 2020 from the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais database and United States Geological Survey satellite images. For each scene, the images were processed and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. To assess the variation, records were classified and compared according to the year, month, hours, and habitat type (edge and interior). To verify the influence of fires on vegetation, simple linear regressions were performed based on the fire risk due to the NDVI-year-habitat interaction. The data included 748 fire records, with the highest occurrences from April to August, and 51% of the fires occurred between 15h and 20h, indicating periods with more intense solar radiation. The relationship between fire risk and NDVI-year-habitat was significant (F = 30.35; R-2 = 0.26; p < 0.0001), and the edges were more vulnerable to fire risk. This study shows that in an Atlantic Forest remnant, areas with lower vegetation indices, such as edges, are more vulnerable to fire than areas with dense forest vegetation.

AB Tropical forests have been rapidly deforested and degradation worldwide has outpaced biodiversity field sampling. No study to date has assessed the effects of insular habitats induced by hydroelectric dams on Amazonian understory plants. Fern community responses to anthropogenic effects on tropical forest islands can be revealed at a faster pace by using simple and cheap, yet informative, protocols that could be applied by non-specialists. This study seeks to both understand the drivers of fern and lycophytes assemblages on forest islands and investigate the relative costs and effectiveness of a simplified sampling protocol that can be applied by non-specialists. Fern species were sampled by a non-specialist who photographed all ferns and lycophytes within seventeen 0.25-ha plots on 10 forest islands at the lake of Balbina Hydroelectric dam, central Amazonia. Sampling was carried out opportunistically during a field expedition planned to conduct tree inventories. As predictors, we used locally measured or GIS-derived descriptors of plot and landscape conditions. We used multivariate and linear models to further assess the influence of predictors on patterns of species richness and composition of ferns assemblages. A total of 286 photographed individual ferns or lycophytes represented at least 23 species and 14 genera. The average number of taxa per plot was 6.1 in the islands and 14.3 in the mainland. The species pool found on islands was a nested subset of the mainland fern community. Species richness was positively related to island size and negatively related to isolation and fire severity. Area, isolation and fire severity also significantly explained variation in community composition. The relative cost of the picture-based fern protocol applied was very modest (only 4% of the total expedition budget), even compared to the typically low cost of alternative field campaigns. We conclude that fern community structure in this forest archipelago was primarily driven by island size, isolation and fire disturbance. Moreover, we show that a simple sampling protocol carried out by a non-specialist can lead to inexpensive and highly reliable ecological data. This opens an avenue for crowdsourcing ecological fern data collections using a citizen science approach.

AB Limited groundwater resources and their overexploitation have become major challenges for sustainable development worldwide. In this study, an innovative hybrid approach was proposed to generate a groundwater spring potential map (GSPM) from the Sarab plain located in Lorestan Province, Iran, which includes the new best-worst method (BWM), stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA), support vector machine learning method (SVR), Harris hawk optimization (HHO), and bat algorithms (BA). The first step involved the inventory of a map prepared to contain 610 spring locations. Randomly, 70% of the spring points were selected as training data, and the remaining 30% were selected for validation. Based on the review of the literature and available data, thirteen factors were generated as independent variables. The BWM and SWARA methods were used to identify correlations between the occurrence of springs and factors. Finally, using SVR-BA and SVR-HHO hybrid models, potential maps of groundwater springs were generated and then evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and several statistical evaluators such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa index. Validation of the training data set showed that the success rates for the SWARA-SVR-BA, SWARA-SVR-HHO, BWM-SVR-BA, and BWMSVR-HHO models were 92.6%, 93.7%, 95.9%, and 96.4%, respectively. The results revealed that with a small difference, BWM-SVR-HHO performed better in training compared to other models. Evaluation of the prediction rate showed that the values of the area under the ROC curve for SWARA-SVR-BA, SWARA-SVR-HHO, BWM-SVR-HHO, and BWM-SVR-BA were 91.7%, 92.4%, 93.3%, and 94.7%, respectively. According to the results, although all models had excellent performance with more than 90% accuracy, BWM-SVR-BA was more accurate in predicting. The hybrid models presented in this study can be used as an accurate and effective methodology to improve the results of spatial modeling of the probability of groundwater occurrence.

AB The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promote a broad set of socio-economic and environmental goals. Through a case study on Malaysia, this paper investigates how economic Goal 8 (economic growth), Goal 9 (industry), and Goal 17(increased partnerships) are likely to conflict with environmental Goal 13 (climate action), Goal 14 (life below water), and Goal 15 (life on land). We analyze data from Economy-Wide Material Flows Analysis (EW-MFA) that captures Malaysia's aggregate resource use over time and also assess the likely economic and environmental contradictions for Malaysia's future trajectory by looking at major drivers of Malaysia's economic growth. Using policy-scoring, we provide a detailed analysis of how the various sectors of growth are likely to result in synergies or trade-offs with the environmental SDGs. We find substantial contradictions between the economic and environmental SDGs for Malaysia. Our paper questions whether or not, when examining a concrete case study, economic and environmental SDGs are compatible.

AB Background To set up successful conservation measures, detailed knowledge on the dispersal and colonization capacities of the focal species and connectivity between populations is of high relevance. We developed species-specific nuclear microsatellite molecular markers for the grayling (Hipparchia semele), a butterfly endemic to Europe and of growing conservation concern in North-West Europe, and report on its population genetics, in a fragmented, anthropogenic landscape in Belgium. Our study included samples from 23 different locations nested in two regions and additional historical samples from two locations. We assessed contemporary, long-distance dispersal based on genetic assignment tests and investigated the effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on the population genetic structure and genetic variation using data of nine microsatellite loci. Results Detected dispersal events covered remarkably long distances, which were up to ten times larger than previously reported colonisation distances, with the longest movement recorded in this study even exceeding 100 km. However, observed frequencies of long-distance dispersal were low. Our results point to the consequences of the strong population decline of the last decades, with evidence of inbreeding for several of the recently sampled populations and low estimates of effective population sizes (Ne) (ranging from 20 to 54 individuals). Conclusions Our study shows low frequencies of long-distance dispersal, which is unable to prevent inbreeding in most of the local populations. We discuss the significance for species conservation including future translocation events and discuss appropriate conservation strategies to maintain viable grayling (meta) populations in highly fragmented, anthropogenic landscapes.

AB The Chinese sucker (Myxocyprinus asiaticus) is an endangered and threatened fish species in China. To augment wild populations, millions of captive-bred Chinese sucker have been released into the upper Yangtze River in recent years, with little evaluation of the genetic impact. The genetic diversity of 112 wild M. asiaticus from different reaches of the Yangtze River was examined, and the population structure among them and three artificially bred populations was determined using 12 microsatellite markers. Genetic data from the wild M. asiaticus populations before the hatchery release programme were synthesized and compared to detect fine-scale variation in genetic structure together with spatiotemporal changes in the wild population. The results showed that the genetic diversity of wild M. asiaticus was relatively high (observed heterozygosity = 0.604-0.609, polymorphic information content = 0.442-0.496), even though a moderate decrease in total diversity was detected when compared with previous studies. M. asiaticus from the Wanzhou reaches, which showed low genetic variation before the stocking programmes, displayed the highest level of genetic diversity (observed heterozygosity = 0.609, polymorphic information content = 0.496) in this study. Insignificant differences in genetic structure among wild populations, with low genetic differentiation (F-st = 0.035-0.083), as well as close genetic relationships between wild and hatchery populations were observed. Current genetic diversity and population structure of wild M. asiaticus were strikingly different from those before the hatchery release programme, which indicated that stocking activities have altered the genetic character of the populations in the upper Yangtze River. The conservation of M. asiaticus requires legal protection for the fish and its habitat. Genetic monitoring of the wild populations and accurate evaluation of genetic divergence is imperative. In addition, the results of this study should be used to provide scientific guidance for an effective hatchery release programme for M. asiaticus.

AB Areas of endemism characterize geographical regions by their unique biotas, providing the basis for studies on the ecological and historical drivers of these biologically distinct units. Tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) are a highly diverse clade of lianas distributed throughout the Neotropics, representing an excellent model for studying the drivers of species diversity and distribution patterns in this region. We used a dataset representing 98% of the diversity of Bignonieae and 21 170 unique locality records to perform an analysis of endemicity using NDM/VNDM. We recovered areas of endemism distributed across the Neotropics, including a higher number of areas at coarser spatial scales. Although overlapping and nested patterns of endemism were common and the spatial congruence with the individual units of previous regionalization schemes was low, the patterns of endemism recovered were in general agreement with those documented for other taxa. Our findings are generally consistent with key Neotropical biogeographical hypotheses. These results highlight the importance of studying detailed distribution patterns of selected taxa for an improved understanding of Neotropical biogeography.

AB Seed dispersal and predation are critical processes for plant recruitment which can be affected by fire events. We investigated community composition of small mammals in gallery forests with distinct burning histories (burned or not burned similar to 3 years before) in the Cerrado (neotropical savanna). We evaluated the role of these animals as seed removers of six native tree species, potentially mediated by the occurrence of fire. We sampled four previously burned sites and four unburned ones. Seed removal was assessed using two exclusion treatments: exclusive access of small rodents and access of all seed-removing vertebrates. The previous burning changed the structural characteristics of the forests, increasing the density of the understory vegetation and herbaceous cover, which determined differences in species composition, richness, and abundance of small rodents (abundance in the burned forests was 1/6 of the abundance in the unburnt ones). Seed removal rates across the six species were reduced in burnt forests in both treatments and were higher for the "all vertebrates" treatment. Other vertebrates, larger than small rodents, played a significant role as seed removers for five of the six species. The effects of fire were consistent across species, but for the two species with the largest seeds (Hymenaea courbaril and Mauritia flexuosa) removal rates for both treatments were extremely low in the burned forests (<= 5%). The observed decline in small rodent seed predation in the burned forests may have medium to long-term consequences on plant communities in gallery forests, potentially affecting community composition and species coexistence in these forests. Moreover, fire caused a sharp decline in seed removal by large mammals, indicating that the maintenance of dispersal services provided by these mammals (mainly the agouti Dasyprota azarae) for the large-seeded species may be jeopardized by the burning of gallery forests. This burning would also affect several small mammal species that occur in the surrounding typical savanna habitats but also use these forests. Fire events have been increasing in frequency and intensity because of human activities and climate changing. This current scenario poses a serious threat considering that these forests are fire-sensitive ecosystems within the Cerrado.

AB The adoption of diverse resource acquisition strategies is critical for plant growth and species coexistence. Root phosphatase is of particular importance in the acquisition of soil phosphorus (P), yet it is often overlooked in studies of root trait syndromes. Here, we evaluated the role of root phosphatase activity (RPA) within the root economics space and the order-based variation of RPA, as well as the correlations between RPA and a suite of leaf traits and soil properties over a range of evergreen tree species in a subtropical forest. Root phosphatase activity exhibited a high degree of inter-specific variation. We found that there were two leading dimensions of the multidimensional root economics space, the root diameter-specific root length axis (collaboration trait gradient) and the root tissue density-root nitrogen concentration axis (classical trait gradient), and RPA aligned with the former. Root phosphatase activity is used as a 'do it yourself' strategy of soil P acquisition, and was found to be inversely correlated with mycorrhizal colonization, which suggests a trade-off in plant P acquisition strategies. Compared with soil and foliar nutrient status, root traits mattered most for the large inter-specific changes in RPA. Furthermore, RPA generally decreased from first- to third-order roots. Taken together, such diverse P-acquisition strategies are conducive to plant coexistence within local forest communities. The use of easily measurable root traits and their tight correlations with RPA could be a feasible and promising approach to estimating species-specific RPA values, which would be helpful for better understanding plant P acquisition and soil P cycling.

AB Previous studies have reported that males augment their reproductive success by increasing the number of females with which they copulate, and that such copulations are not energetically demanding in terms of trivial sperm production costs. However, we now know that males do pay reproductive costs. As males mate successively, a reduction in the performance of copulatory behaviours would be expected, as well as in the number of sperm transferred. Here we compared the duration of courtship, mating and post-insemination phase, the number of genital and non-genital copulatory courtship occurrences, and the number of sperm transferred in successive matings in Holocnemus pluchei spider males. As matings increased in males, there was no effect on the duration of courtship, mating or post-insemination phase. Interestingly, genital copulatory courtship varied in successive copulations depending on male size, but there was no change in the number of sperm transferred. In addition, the occurrence of nongenital copulatory courtship decreased along successive copulations. The negative effects of successive matings on copulatory courtship indicate that these behaviours are costly for males, except for the number of sperm transferred. Our research lays the foundation for future studies on male costs as a function of mating history in spiders.

AB A mechanistic understanding of how tropical-tree mortality responds to climate variation is urgently needed to predict how tropical-forest carbon pools will respond to anthropogenic global change, which is altering the frequency and intensity of storms, droughts, and other climate extremes in tropical forests. We used 5 years of approximately monthly drone-acquired RGB (red-green-blue) imagery for 50 ha of mature tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to quantify spatial structure; temporal variation; and climate correlates of canopy disturbances, i.e., sudden and major drops in canopy height due to treefalls, branchfalls, or the collapse of standing dead trees. Canopy disturbance rates varied strongly over time and were higher in the wet season, even though wind speeds were lower in the wet season. The strongest correlate of monthly variation in canopy disturbance rates was the frequency of extreme rainfall events. The size distribution of canopy disturbances was best fit by a Weibull function and was close to a power function for sizes above 25 m(2). Treefalls accounted for 74 % of the total area and 52 % of the total number of canopy disturbances in treefalls and branchfalls combined. We hypothesize that extremely high rainfall is a good predictor because it is an indicator of storms having high wind speeds, as well as saturated soils that increase uprooting risk. These results demon-strate the utility of repeat drone-acquired data for quantifying forest canopy disturbance rates at fine temporal and spatial resolutions over large areas, thereby enabling robust tests of how temporal variation in disturbance relates to climate drivers. Further insights could be gained by integrating these canopy observations with high-frequency measurements of wind speed and soil moisture in mechanistic models to better evaluate proximate drivers and with focal tree observations to quantify the links to tree mortality and woody turnover.

AB In modern wildlife ecology, spatial population genetic methods are becoming increasingly applied. Especially for animal species in fragmented landscapes, preservation of gene flow becomes a high priority target in order to restore genetic diversity and prevent local extinction. Within Central Europe, the Alps represent the core distribution area of the black grouse, Lyrurus tetrix. At its easternmost Alpine range, events of subpopulation extinction have already been documented in the past decades. Molecular data combined with spatial analyses can help to assess landscape effects on genetic variation and therefore can be informative for conservation management. Here, we addressed whether the genetic pattern of the easternmost Alpine black grouse metapopulation system is driven by isolation by distance or isolation by resistance. Correlative ecological niche modeling was used to assess geographic distances and landscape resistances. We then applied regression-based approaches combined with population genetic analyses based on microsatellite data to disentangle effects of isolation by distance and isolation by resistance among individuals and subpopulations. Although population genetic analyses revealed overall low levels of genetic differentiation, the ecological niche modeling showed subpopulations to be clearly delimited by habitat structures. Spatial genetic variation could be attributed to effects of isolation by distance among individuals and isolation by resistance among subpopulations, yet unknown effects might factor in. The easternmost subpopulation was the most differentiated, and at the same time, immigration was not detected; hence, its long-term survival might be threatened. Our study provides valuable insights into the spatial genetic variation of this small-scale metapopulation system of Alpine black grouse.

AB River damming threatens freshwater biodiversity worldwide by isolating populations, reducing both gene flow and genetic variation, and affecting the ability of a given population to adapt to environmental changes. Herein, we employed a microsatellite DNA marker panel and a multitemporal approach to assess the effects of damming on the genetic diversity of a long-lived species from both contemporary and historical perspectives. To accomplish this, we used the migratory catfish Pseudoplatystoma corruscans as a model and sampled it in two South American basins. We tested whether: (1) populations from dammed and undammed environments would display different levels of genetic diversity; (2) ecosystem size would influence the level of genetic diversity; and (3) projected whether fish populations would maintain their current genetic diversity in the long term. Our findings reveal that P. corruscans populations from dammed landscapes with smaller ecosystems showed smaller estimated effective population size, lower genetic diversity, and higher relatedness coefficient than in intermediate ecosystem size in both dammed and undammed environments. We also noticed changes in estimated gene flow and effective population size from both contemporary and historical perspectives, probably because of dams. Predictive genetic diversity analysis revealed a critical scenario for the long-term persistence of P. corruscans in dammed environments with smaller ecosystem sizes. Our study suggests that anthropogenic barriers have substantially impacted genetic diversity and genetic structuring of the migratory fish P. corruscans. Thus, the formation of conservation policies is urgently needed to avoid local extinctions of this species in fragmented riverscapes. We highlighted the effectiveness of large ecosystems and connectivity between populations in conserving genetic diversity of migratory fishes.

AB Years of fire suppression, decreases in herbivores, and global climate change have led to shifts in savannas worldwide. Natural open vegetation such as grasslands and shrublands is increasing in wood density, but the effects for small mammals are not well understood. While most of the mammal studies from the Brazilian Cerrado are concentrated in the core area of this large Neotropical savanna, its southern portions are suffering from biome shifting through woody encroachment. Herein, we surveyed a small mammal community from the southeastern boundary of Cerrado (Santa Barbara Ecological Station) and evaluated the micro and macro environmental variables shaping community structure in order to investigate how the woody encroachment in the last 15 years may have influenced this assemblage. We recorded 17 species of marsupials and rodents along five distinct habitats in a gradient from grasslands to woodlands. Although richness was not affected by microhabitat variables, total and relative abundance varied according to habitat type and in relation to herbaceous, shrub, and tree density. Rodents such as Calomys tener and Clyomys laticeps were positively affected by increasing herb cover, Cerradomys scotti and Oligoryzomys nigripes by shrub cover, while the marsupial Didelphis albiventris had higher association with increasing tree cover. We detected an increase of 27.4% in vegetation density (EVI) between 2003 and 2018 in our study site, and this woody encroachment negatively affected the abundance of some small mammals. The open-area specialists Cryptonanus chacoensis and C. scotti had a decrease in abundance, while D. albiventris and O. nigripes were favored by woody encroachment. Our data suggest that woody encroachment is shifting community composition: small mammals often associated with grasslands and open savannas are likely to be negatively affected by woody encroachment; while species that rely on tree-covered habitats are likely to benefit from an increasing woody landscape. Therefore, forest-dwellers are gradually replacing open-vegetation inhabitants. Active management of open formations (e.g., with prescribed burning) may be needed to maintain Cerrado biodiversity, especially considering the open-area endemics.

AB Historic climate changes drive geographical populations of coastal plants to contract and recover dynamically, even die out completely. Species suffering from such bottlenecks usually lose intraspecific genetic diversity, but how do these events influence population subdivision patterns of coastal plants? Here, we investigated this question in the typical coastal plant: mangrove species Aegiceras corniculatum. Inhabiting the intertidal zone of the tropical and subtropical coast of the Indo-West Pacific oceans, its populations are deemed to be greatly shaped by historic sea-level fluctuations. Using dual methods of Sanger and Illumina sequencing, we found that the 18 sampled populations were structured into two groups, namely, the "Indo-Malayan" group, comprising three subgroups (the northern South China Sea, Gulf of Bengal, and Bali), and the "Pan-Australasia" group, comprising the subgroups of the southern South China Sea and Australasia. Based on the approximate Bayesian computations and Stairway Plot, we inferred that the southern South China Sea subgroup, which penetrates the interior of the "Indo-Malayan" group, originated from the Australasia subgroup, accompanied by a severe bottleneck event, with a spot of gene flow from both the Australasia and "Indo-Malayan" groups. Geographical barriers such as the Sundaland underlie the genetic break between Indian and Pacific Oceans, but the discontinuity between southern and northern South China Sea was originated from genetic drift in the bottleneck event. Hence, we revealed a case evidencing that the bottleneck event promoted population subdivision. This conclusion may be applicable in other taxa beyond coastal plants.

AB The distribution of major clades in Bertolonia (Melastomataceae) is congruent with subareas of the Atlantic Forest, providing an opportunity to estimate ages of historical breaks in the Atlantic Forest, from its major north/south split to more restricted local radiations. The role of niche conservatism in driving diversification of Bertolonia is also analysed and discussed in the light of its historical distribution. We estimated the age of the diversification events, gathered the climatic envelopes of species and clades, generated bioregions for the Atlantic Forest and reconstructed the ancestral areas of speciation for the genus. Our analysis subdivided the Atlantic Forest in five subareas, three of them in the northern and two in the southern Atlantic Forest. We also recovered a deep north/south divergence of the Atlantic Forest in the Oligocene (c. 30 Mya) followed by subsequent local radiations in both regions and a south-eastern/southern division in the Miocene. Later diversification happened mostly from the Mid-Miocene to Pliocene/Pleistocene with several dispersal events, mostly between neighbouring areas. We corroborated this assumption demonstrating that closely related lineages tend to occur in habitats with similar climatic conditions, mainly related to temperature. Our analyses on Bertolonia effectively captured relatively old historical events in the Atlantic Forest, such as the north/south division in the Oligocene and south/south-eastern split in the Miocene, but also recent ones, such as climatic fluctuations and forest fragmentation in the Quaternary. We indicate here for the first time that, for some organisms, the well-known north/south split of the Atlantic Forest could be older than expected. Recent radiation events occurred mainly on a regional basis after this deep division of the domain and the subclades that were recovered showed a significant climatic niche conservatism.

AB The effects of forest fragmentation on forest bird species in the Bemanevika Protected Area (PA), northwestern Madagascar, were investigated during two breeding seasons from October 2016 to January 2018. The forest of Bemanevika is composed of large patches of fragmented tropical rainforest. Seven forest fragments ranging from 10 to 1 050 ha were surveyed. Two methods were used to collect data along transects orientated from the forest edge toward the interior of the forest: mist-netting and point-counts. In all, 27 non-forest birds and 65 forest birds were recorded at all fragments. According to their distribution along an edge-interior gradient, these 65 forest species are classified into three main groups: 15 (23.1%) edge species, 12 (18.5%) forest interior species and 38 (58.5%) ubiquitous species. Larger forest fragments host more forest bird species than smaller forest fragments. Of the 65 forest birds, 14, including the 12 forest interior species, were not found in the four smaller fragments (10-29 ha). The density of forest interior species was positively correlated to forest fragment size. The general trend was that forest interior species were the most sensitive to forest fragmentation (e.g. Madagascar Serpent-eagle Eutriorchis astur, Pitta-like Ground-roller Atelornis pittoides and Schlegel's Asity Philepitta schlegeli). Large raptors, terrestrial species and understory species were the first to disappear from the small fragments. Fragmented forests provide habitat for bird species, even for those vulnerable to forest fragmentation, therefore the maintenance of large enough forest fragments should be considered in all conservation strategies aimed to protect forest birds.

AB Tropical forests disappear rapidly because of deforestation, yet they have the potential to regrow naturally on abandoned lands. We analyze how 12 forest attributes recover during secondary succession and how their recovery is interrelated using 77 sites across the tropics. Tropical forests are highly resilient to low-intensity land use; after 20 years, forest attributes attain 78% (33 to 100%) of their old-growth values. Recovery to 90% of old-growth values is fastest for soil (<1 decade) and plant functioning (<2.5 decades), intermediate for structure and species diversity (2.5 to 6 decades), and slowest for biomass and species composition (>12 decades). Network analysis shows three independent clusters of attribute recovery, related to structure, species diversity, and species composition. Secondary forests should be embraced as a low-cost, natural solution for ecosystem restoration, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation.

AB Certain traits of recipient environments, such as the availability of limiting resources, strongly determine the establishment success and spread of non-native species. These limitations may be overcome through behavioral plasticity, allowing them to exploit alternative resources. Here, we show how a secondary cavity nester bird, the rose-ringed parakeet Psittacula krameri, innovates its nesting behavior as a response to the shortage of tree cavities for nesting in its invasive range in Tenerife (Canary Islands). We observed that some breeding pairs excavated their own nest cavities in palms, thus becoming primary cavity nester, whereas others occupied nests built with wood sticks by another invasive species, the monk parakeet Myiopsitta monachus. The use of these novel nesting strategies increased the number of breeding pairs by up to 52% over 6 years, contributing to a 128.8% increase of the whole population. Innovative nests were located at greater heights above ground and were more aggregated around conspecifics but did not result in greater breeding success than natural cavities. Occupation of monk parakeet colonies by rose-ringed parakeets also benefited the former species through a protective-nesting association against nest predators. Our results show how an invasive species innovate nesting behaviors and increase nest-site availability in the recipient environment, thus facilitating its population growth and invasion process. Potential behavioral innovations in other invasive rose-ringed parakeet populations may be overlooked, and should be considered for effective management plans.

AB Aim Palaeoceanographic changes can act as drivers of diversification and speciation, even in highly mobile marine organisms. Shearwaters are a group of globally distributed and highly mobile pelagic seabirds. Despite a recent well-resolved phylogeny, shearwaters have controversial species limits, and show periods of both slow and rapid diversification. Here, we explore the role of palaeoceanographic changes on shearwaters' diversification and speciation. We investigate shearwater biogeography and the evolution of a key phenotypic trait, body size, and we assess the validity of their current taxonomy. Location Worldwide. Taxa Shearwaters (Order Procellariiformes, Family Procellariidae, Genera Ardenna, Calonectris and Puffinus). Methods We generated genomic (ddRAD) data to infer a time-calibrated species tree for the shearwaters. We estimated ancestral ranges and evaluated the roles of founder events, vicariance and surface ocean currents in driving diversification. We performed phylogenetic generalised least squares to identify potential predictors of variability in body size along the phylogeny. To assess the validity of the current taxonomy, we analysed genomic patterns of recent shared ancestry and differentiation among shearwater taxa. Results We identified a period of high dispersal and rapid speciation during the Late Pliocene-early Pleistocene. Species dispersal appears to be favoured by surface ocean currents, and founder events are supported as the main mode of speciation in these highly mobile pelagic seabirds. Body mass shows significant associations with life strategies and local conditions. The current taxonomy shows some incongruences with the patterns of genomic divergence. Main Conclusions A reduction of neritic areas during the Pliocene seems to have driven global extinctions of shearwater species, followed by a subsequent burst of speciation and dispersal probably promoted by Plio-Pleistocene climatic shifts. Our findings extend our understanding on the drivers of speciation and dispersal of highly mobile pelagic seabirds and shed new light on the important role of palaeoceanographic events.

AB One-third of all Neotropical forests are secondary forests that regrow naturally after agricultural use through secondary succession. We need to understand better how and why succession varies across environmental gradients and broad geographic scales. Here, we analyze functional recovery using community data on seven plant characteristics (traits) of 1,016 forest plots from 30 chronosequence sites across the Neotropics. By analyzing communities in terms of their traits, we enhance understanding of the mechanisms of succession, assess ecosystem recovery, and use these insights to propose successful forest restoration strategies. Wet and dry forests diverged markedly for several traits that increase growth rate in wet forests but come at the expense of reduced drought tolerance, delay, or avoidance, which is important in seasonally dry forests. Dry and wet forests showed different successional pathways for several traits. In dry forests, species turnover is driven by drought tolerance traits that are important early in succession and in wet forests by shade tolerance traits that are important later in succession. In both forests, deciduous and compound-leaved trees decreased with forest age, probably because microclimatic conditions became less hot and dry. Our results suggest that climatic water availability drives functional recovery by influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in a convergence of community trait values with forest age when vegetation cover builds up. Within plots, the range in functional trait values increased with age. Based on the observed successional trait changes, we indicate the consequences for carbon and nutrient cycling and propose an ecologically sound strategy to improve forest restoration success.

AB Hedera helix L. is an invasive, but medicinally important plant. In Iran, there is no available study on the H. helix population to reveal the genetic diversity and population structure. Fifty-six individual plants belonging to nine geographical populations were collected in four provinces of Iran. High genetic diversity, polymorphisms, and a Shannon diversity index of 0.269 were detected in Mazandaran, Kandovan (Population 3). Analysis of the molecular variance indicated 40% of total genetic variation of the whole population was present in the subpopulation. A high genetic similarity (0.922) between plant Populations 5 (Kermanshah; Islamabad) and 6 (Kermanshah; Paveh) was noted. On the other hand, a low genetic similarity was observed between plant Populations 1 (Tehran; Darband) and 8 (Ardabil; Hur). The Mantel test revealed a correlation between the genetic and geographical distances. Furthermore, it demonstrated the isolation mechanism responsible for the population structure in the H. helix plant populations. The principal component analysis explained the majority of the variation in the morphological characteristics. Three components explained 87% of the variation, and the first component explained 60% of the variation. For instance, the leaf morphology showed a correlation of > 0.7 between leaf morphological and floral characters. The plant leaves and quantitative flower characteristics separated the plant populations according to the differences in length. The current results have implications for plant conservation and management.

AB Biological assemblages are often predictable from knowledge of natural environmental heterogeneity and change in response to anthropogenic disturbances, such as deforestation, so understanding ecological mechanisms and processes mediating assemblages is essential to direct conservation actions. We sampled frogs along an edaphic and vegetation-structure gradient in the Brazilian Amazon to test the hypothesis that assemblages change in species composition and functional trait characteristics across landscapes due to environmental filtering. Our study area covered a gradient of forest fragmentation, and we hypothesized that assemblages would change in response to both natural gradients and deforestation. We found that frog assemblages are locally structured by species turnover along gradients in distance to water bodies, vegetation structure, soil sand and silt content, and proportion of the area deforested. Additionally, we found that small-bodied species and those with direct breeding (no larval stage) were no longer present in deforested areas. We conclude that frog assemblages are not randomly distributed across forests, but trait filtering has resulted in different species subsets from the regional pool, which change among sites with different environmental conditions and disturbance levels. Our findings highlight the importance of creating reserves to effectively protect forests and maintain connectivity among forest fragments resulting from deforestation. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

AB The concept of a root economics space (RES) is increasingly adopted to explore root trait variation and belowground resource-acquisition strategies. Much progress has been made on interactions of root morphology and mycorrhizal symbioses. However, root exudation, with a significant carbon (C) cost (c. 5-21% of total photosynthetically fixed C) to enhance resource acquisition, remains a missing link in this RES. Here, we argue that incorporating root exudation into the structure of RES is key to a holistic understanding of soil nutrient acquisition. We highlight the different functional roles of root exudates in soil phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) acquisition. Thereafter, we synthesize emerging evidence that illustrates how root exudation interacts with root morphology and mycorrhizal symbioses at the level of species and individual plant and argue contrasting patterns in species evolved in P-impoverished vs N-limited environments. Finally, we propose a new conceptual framework, integrating three groups of root functional traits to better capture the complexity of belowground resource-acquisition strategies. Such a deeper understanding of the integrated and dynamic interactions of root morphology, root exudation, and mycorrhizal symbioses will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying species coexistence and how to explore belowground interactions for sustainable managed systems.

AB Temporal taxonomic changes have been noted in bird communities in protected tropical forests. However, it is not known whether these changes compromise the conservation of functional diversity. Here we monitored bird communities in an Atlantic Forest Protected Area in southern Brazil annually during 10 years. We assess temporal trends in taxonomic and functional diversity metrics and compare the observed functional diversity values with expected values to identify the mechanisms that drive community assembly. We also verified temporal beta diversity and the prevalence of its components. We found variations in species richness over time when assessing the entire community, passerines, non-passerines, and specialized insectivorous passerines. Taxonomic turnover was predominant in the temporal beta diversity of these groups. Nonetheless, no significant variations in functional richness were recognized, indicating functional redundancy between the changing species. However, functional nestedness was predominant in the group of specialist insectivorous passerines, which indicates functional erosion in this group. There were also increases in the dispersion of the entire community and functional divergence in non-passerines. These alterations seem to reflect the occurrence of rare species with unique functional traits and the optimization of the use of available resources. Our data suggest that the communities had random functional structures. Consequently, taxonomic alterations are possible due to random substitution generated by dispersal processes however, the redundancy between species allows overall functional stability of community. We also highlight that different groups of species can present different temporal trajectories and their evaluations are necessary to unveil silent alterations in their functional roles.

AB Background The potential benefits of intercropping are manifold and have been repeatedly demonstrated. Intercropping has the potential to create more productive and resilient agroecosystems, by improving land utilisation, yield and yield stability, soil quality, and pest, disease and weed suppression. Despite these potential benefits, significant gaps remain in the understanding of ecological mechanisms that govern the outcomes when crop species are grown together. A major part of plant-plant interactions takes place belowground and these are often overlooked. Scope This review synthesises current evidence for belowground plant-plant interactions of competition, niche differentiation and facilitation, with the aim of identifying root traits that influence the processes contributing to enhanced performance of intercrops compared with monocultures. We identify a suite of potentially complementary root traits for maximising the benefits of intercropping. These traits underpin improved soil exploration, more efficient resource use, and suppression of soil-borne pathogens and pests in intercrops. Conclusion This review brings together understanding of the mechanisms underpinning interactions between intercropped roots, and how root traits and their plasticity can promote positive outcomes. Root trait 'ideotypes' for intercropped partners are identified that could be selected for crop improvement. We highlight the importance of examining belowground interactions and consider both spatial and temporal distribution of roots and rhizosphere mechanisms that aid complementarity through niche differentiation and facilitation. Breeding of crop ideotypes with specific beneficial root traits, combined with considerations for optimal spatio-temporal arrangement and ratios of component crops, are essential next steps to promote the adoption of intercropping as a sustainable farming practice.

AB Invasive species are considered a serious problem in different ecosystems worldwide. They can compete and interfere with native plants, leading to a shift in community assembly and ecosystem function. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Nicotiana glauca Graham invasion on native vegetation composition and soil of the most invaded locations in the Taif region, Western Saudi Arabia, including Alwaht (WHT), Ar-Ruddaf (RDF), and Ash-shafa (SHFA). Plant species list, life span, life form, and chorotypes were assessed. Six locations highly infested with N. glauca shrubs were selected, and the morphological parameters of the shrubs were measured. Within each location, richness, evenness, relative density of species, and soil were measured either under the canopy of N. glauca shrubs or outside the canopy. Floristic analysis revealed the existence of 144 plant species, mainly perennial. The shrubs at the SHFA1 location showed the highest values of all measured morphological parameters. The WHT 1 location showed high richness and evenness, while the WHAT 2 location showed less richness and evenness. The invaded locations showed substantial variation in the community composition. Additionally, the effect of N. glauca on the understory species varied from competition to facilitation, where most of the understory species were inhibited. As an average of all locations, 65.86% of the plant species were recorded only outside the canopy of N. glauca. The vegetation analysis revealed that the SHFA location is more vulnerable to invasion that could be ascribed to its wide range of habitats and high disturbance. The soil-vegetation relationships showed significant variations among the studied locations regarding soil composition, and thereby showed a wide ecological range of the invasive shrubs N. glauca. Therefore, the invasion of N. glauca in the Taif region altered the species interactions, nutrients, and soil properties.

AB Privately protected areas with voluntary forest protection are promoted as an innovative solution for biodiversity conservation across the globe, particularly in regions where high biological diversity is threatened by agricultural expansion and human disturbance such as the tropical Andes. Colombia alone has over 2000 privately protected areas, but how well private reserves achieve conservation goals is largely unknown. To understand the attributes of reserves that determine success and the types of species conserved, we evaluated regional diversity of medium and large mammals with camera trapping over two years in the western Andes of Colombia. We examined how mammal occupancy was influenced by the size and land use of privately protected areas, landscape-scale variables, and anthropogenic disturbance. We used a multi-species hierarchical framework to assess responses of species and functional groups to environmental covariates. We found that forest in this reserve network retains a diverse mammal assemblage, but low occurrence and restricted species distributions suggest high vulnerability. Forest-restricted species and large species had higher occupancy in larger sites and sites with a higher proportion of forest, regardless of whether a site was designated as a reserve. However, landscape-level measures of connectivity and human disturbance were the strongest predictors of occupancy. Our research indicates that conservation of biodiversity within reserve networks in the Andes will be effective only if these efforts are linked to landscape-level conservation initiatives that conserve large areas of native forest and limit human disturbance across the landscape.

AB Accelerated extinction rates have prompted an increased focus on the interplay between environmental change and species response. The effects of environmental change on thermal opportunity are typically considered through a climate change context. However, habitat alteration can also have strong effects on the thermal environment. Additionally, habitat alteration is considered a leading factor of species extinction, yet few studies address the influence of habitat alteration on thermal opportunity and time-energy budgets in at-risk species. Here, we show the strong effects that habitat degradation can have on thermal opportunity, time-energy budgets, and life history demographics of local populations. In the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas, woody vegetation encroachment has resulted in a shift in life history traits that appears to play an important role in recent extirpations of eastern collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris). Populations in degraded habitats experienced a decline in thermal opportunity and less time at body temperatures (time at T-b) suitable for digestion compared with those in intact habitats. We used our data to model the effect of reduced time at T-b on the net assimilated energy available for growth and reproduction. Our model predicts an similar to 46% decline in the annual fecundity of individuals, which is similar to empirical observations of reproduction of C. collaris populations in degraded habitats (similar to 49%). We conclude that C. collaris in degraded habitats experienced reduced growth and reproduction primarily as a result of constrained thermal opportunity leading to a decline in digestive processing rates. Our study applies an underappreciated approach to identify the biophysical and time-energy effects of habitat alteration.

AB Asian elephants are endangered while they have faced similar to 70% population decline in India in the last 60 years. Climate change projections indicate exacerbation of ongoing habitat loss (>40%) by 2070, potentially impacting genetic structure of wild elephants across India. Therefore, we provide consolidated baseline data on genetic diversity and structure of elephants across four eco-regions of India, i.e., north-western (NW), north-eastern (NE), east-central (ECI), and southern India (SI), to identify populations at greater risk of further divergence. We genotyped 169 faecal samples across 14 microsatellites with 90.0% overall success rate. The genetic diversity levels were moderate and varied between the eco-regions (H-E=0.57-0.74). Allelic richness was higher in NE (3.73-3.78) and SI (3.62-3.71). We observed a high inbreeding coefficient in NE (F-IS=0.55-0.58) compared to the other elephant populations, probably due to the presence of related individuals in our samples. Genetic differentiation between populations using F-ST statistics (F-ST=0.06-0.18) was significant. Bayesian and multivariate analyses identified three major genetic clusters in India - NW, NE, and combined ECI-SI, mostly consistent with their geographic distribution. We also observed an unexpected pattern of high genetic distance between adjacent populations. This fine-scale genetic structure suggests the presence of barriers (natural and anthropogenic) and complex social organisation. Additionally, incipient sub-structuring within NE and SI indicates potential genetic discontinuity. These results highlight the importance of maintaining genetic diversity, particularly of NE and ECI populations, by retaining habitat connectivity and ensuring gene flow for effective elephant conservation in India.

AB Environmental conditions and the spatial arrangement of habitats are thought to play a major role in shaping community assembly during habitat construction and may be key in establishing time lags between habitat establishment and species colonization (colonization credits), and between local species extinction and habitat loss (extinction debts). Despite the importance of soil organisms in ecosystem functioning and their limited dispersal ability, these kinds of shifts in microarthropod communities have rarely been explored. We assessed the roles of the environment and connectivity in soil microarthropod community composition during habitat regeneration in Mediterranean forests. We selected three different forest patches in six study areas: one long-established (pre-1956; LONG) control forest patch, and two recent forest patches (post-1956), one connected (CONN) to and one isolated (ISOL) from the LONG. In each patch, we determined soil temperature, moisture, pH, and fertility and collected soil samples for microarthropod extraction. Our results indicate that the densities of fauna such as oribatid mites and proturans with limited mobility were lower in ISOL than in other forest types; as well, oribatid populations in ISOL were less diverse. Arthropods with greater mobility than the precedent groups, such as collembolans and non-oribatid mites, were present in lower densities in LONG than in other forest types. Oribatid assemblages in the two recent forest patches were more similar to one another than to those in the LONG. Recent forests were mostly dominated by known pioneer species, while LONG was dominated by the typical species found in well-developed organic soils. In conclusion, oribatid density and richness had recovered surprisingly well in CONN, more so than in ISOL and to a similar extent as LONG. However, oribatid assemblages in the recent forests are different from those in long-established forests due to the potential colonization credits and extinction debts triggered by soil development.

AB Understanding the contributions of participants from management practices and those from the local community to protected areas (PAs) as nature reserves, is crucial for forest protection and resource conservation. Thus, empirical studies have usually investigated whether patrolling has significantly improved forest protection action. Many previous studies have exhaustively examined the contributions to forest protection by rangers or local persons, but there has been little research on the contribution of both sides to patrol efforts with separate consideration given to each. This paper explores insights into the patrol efforts in the Nam Tien forest station. The total number of patrollers, walking distances, and working days across years were significantly different between the ranger and local person patrol groups. There was a considerable variation in the number of patrollers (Z = 2.02; p < 0.01), distance (Z = 2.45; p < 0.01) and working days (Z = 2.37; p < 0.01) between rangers and local persons related to monthly patrolling. For the traditional patrols in the various PAs, it is shown that, for long-term forest protection, local persons patrolling should be considered more, in order to achieve the sustainable conservation.

AB Ecuador has shown a growth in its scientific production since 2011, representing 85% of the total historical production. These investigations are reflected in scientific publications, which address world interest topics and serve as a link for the university, business, and society. This work aims to analyze the scientific production generated by Ecuador in the period of 1920-2020 using bibliometric methods to evaluate its intellectual structure and performance. The methodology applied in this study includes: (i) terms definition and search criteria; (ii) database selection, initial search, and document compilation; (iii) data extraction and software selection; and finally, (iv) analysis of results. The results show that scientific production has been consolidated in 30,205 documents, developed in 27 subject areas, in 13 languages under the contribution of 84 countries. This intellectual structure is in harmony with the global context when presenting research topics related to "Biology and regional climate change", "Higher education and its various approaches", "Technology and Computer Science", "Medicine", "Energy, food and water", and "Development and applications on the Web". Topics framed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), sustainability, climate change, and others. This study contributes to the academic community, considering current re-search issues and global concerns, the collaboration between universities and countries that allow establishing future collaboration links.

AB Area-based conservation is essential to safeguard nature's diversity. In view of expanding human land use, increasing climate change and unmet conservation targets, area-based conservation requires efficiency and effectiveness more than ever. In this review, I identify and relate pressing challenges to promising opportunities for effective and efficient protected area governance and management, to enhance research, decision-making and capacity building in area-based conservation under uncertain future developments. I reveal that protected area management is particularly challenged by human land use, climate change, invasive species, and social, political and economic limitations. Protected area management often lacks the continuous availability of data on current states and trends of nature and threats. Biocultural conservation, climate-smart management and biosecurity approaches help to overcome challenges induced by human needs, climate change and invasive species, respectively. Economic valuation and shifts in funding priorities can boost protected area effectiveness and efficiency. In-situ monitoring techniques, remote sensing and open data infrastructures can fill data and information gaps for protected area planning and management. Moreover, adaptive management is an auspicious concept in the framework of systematic conservation planning to ensure the enduring effectiveness of protected areas despite unpredictable future developments. Post-2020 international biodiversity and sustainable development goals could be met earlier if protected areas were more effective. I consequently conclude with the need for a global information system that is to support area-based conservation by synthesizing challenges and opportunities for protected area management effectiveness and efficiency at the local to global level.

AB The response of tropical trees to the change of light intensity has been reported to be varied among different species. Some reports argued that the growth was increasing parallel to the increasing of light intensity, but other reports mentioned that the sensitivity to the light intensity was depending on the species. Another environmental factor that has been scientifically proven to affect tree growth is humidity. While humidity itself also directly affected by the light intensity in the forest ecosystems. Therefore, it is possible that the growth pattern of trees under different light intensities is also affected by air humidity under the canopy. This research aimed to study the growth response of a light-demanding Alstonia scholaris and a shade-tolerant Eusideroxylon zwageri to the different levels of air humidity and light intensity. The experiment was conducted in Jambi, Indonesia from April to November 2019. The experiment was carried out using split plot design with factorial treatments. The main plot was the air humidity with three levels and the sub plots was light intensity with five levels. Four replicates were applied. In general, the A. scholaris tends to be more sensitive to the humidity and light intensity compared to E. zwageri. In particular, A. scholaris tends to be more sensitive to the light intensity while, E, zwageri is more sensitive to the humidity. However, there is also strong indication that the effects of light intensity to the growth, especially for A. scholaris, was affected by the humidity level.

AB Songbird communities that rely on sagebrush habitat for breeding are experiencing steep population declines, while a large amount of the sagebrush ecosystem continues to be impacted by energy development. Reclamation is increasingly emphasized as a means of mitigating impacts on species that have been affected by oil and gas development; however, the response of sagebrush species to reclamation has largely been untested. We used nest survival of the Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri breweri) as an indicator of fitness responses to short-term reclamation in sagebrush habitat. We assessed oil and gas reclamation similar to 5 years after reclamation, but sagebrush reestablishment is a slow process; thus, the legacy of these disturbances (i.e., disturbance scars) will likely remain for decades. We compared Brewer's Sparrow nest survival across a gradient of oil and gas development from undisturbed and active development to areas that had undergone oil and gas reclamation. Nest survival was assessed at multiple scales from microhabitat to landscape. The distribution of nest sites in the active and reclamation areas suggested local avoidance of disturbance, both active and reclamation disturbance, when establishing nesting territories. We found that reclamation benefited nest survival at a local-scale when disturbance exposure exceeded 15%. Our findings demonstrated scale-dependent nest survival relationships. Across microhabitat and landscape scales, sagebrush canopy cover and composition were important to Brewer's Sparrow nest survival. Combined, these finding emphasize the importance of avoiding the removal of sagebrush habitat whenever possible and expediting sagebrush reestablishment in reclamation areas to maintain high quality sagebrush habitat for breeding songbird populations.

AB Recognition of species is essential in a variety of domains, most remarkably biology, biogeography, ecology, as well as conservation. The genus Stellaria L. (Caryophyllaceae) has over 120 species spread across Europe and Asia's temperate zones. According to the most remarkable current treatments, nine species recognize Stellaria in Iran. These species are categorized into two types. Despite the broad distribution of several Stellaria species in Iran, no research on their genetic variability, method of divergence, or dispersion trends is accessible. As a result, we conducted genetic and morphological research on six Stellaria species and two of their closest relatives gathered from various habitats in Iran. This research aims to 1) Can SCoT markers be utilized to recognize Stellaria species? 2) What are the genetic characteristics of the mentioned taxa in Iran? and 3) To examine the interrelation of the species. In this research, ten SCoT markers were employed for molecular analysis, and 112 accessions were utilized for morphological study. The genetic distances were calculated using the Jaccard similarity coefficient, and descriptive data on the populations were used to estimate genetic parameters. There were 98 polymorphic bands all over. The integration of morphological and SCoT data demonstrated that the Stellaria species of Iran could be delimited and recognized. The Stellaria species are genetically unique; however, they share some similar alleles, according to AMOVA and STRUCTURE analyses.

AB The exploration of new and diverse animal groups in the study of sexual selection is both necessary and important to help better understand broad patterns and test sexual selection hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origins and maintenance of reproductive tactics and associated traits. Solifuges are, in this matter, an exceptional group and very little explored from the sexual selection point of view. At first glance, mating is apparently quite simple and conserved within this arachnid order, but solifuge reproductive behavior is unique among arachnids and more diverse than previously thought. In particular, these voracious animals appear to exhibit high sexual conflict, as males need to avoid being eaten by their aggressive female partners and mating encounters in some species involve periods of apparently male-induced female inactivity during sperm transfer. The extent to which reproductive encounters are coercive versus collaborative, however, remains largely unknown. In this review, we begin with a historical perspective of sexual behavior research in solifuges. We then discuss precopulatory mating patterns, the role of the female and male during mating, sexual dimorphism, and the influence of sexual selection during different stages of mating. In addition, we explore cases of sexual cannibalism and provide an updated analysis of how postcopulatory sexual selection may be acting on these amazing arachnids. This review shows that there is much to be done in this extraordinary group of animals.

AB We investigated the genetic structure of three phenotypically distinct ecotypic groups of Norway spruce (Picea abies) belonging to three elevational classes; namely, low- (acuminata), medium- (europaea), and high-elevation (obovata) form, each represented by 150 trees. After rigorous filtering, we used 1916 Genotyping-by-Sequencing generated SNPs for analysis. Outputs from three multivariate analysis methods (Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in STRUCTURE, Principal Component Analysis, and the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components) indicated the presence of a distinct genetic cluster representing the high-elevation ecotypic group. Our findings bring a vital message to forestry practice affirming that artificial transfer of forest reproductive material, especially for stands under harsh climate conditions, should be considered with caution.

AB The distribution of many species is fragmented due to human activities and isolated populations are often affected by genetic changes. Small populations are endangered by inbreeding depression, often leading to a low mean fitness of small populations and to an increased extinction risk. Using museum samples of protected Microtus oeconomus mehelyi from the years 1950, 1964 and 2000, we studied the population which inhabits the Kis Balaton area that has considerably changed by human activity in the last centuries. The detected effective population size, differences in allele frequencies, associations between alleles and a high genetic differentiation may be explained by 50 years of random genetic drift in this population in the significantly altered Kis Balaton area. We have detected a genetic difference between Kis Balaton populations and published populations from Hungary, Austria and Slovakia. Using linkage disequilibrium and temporal approaches, the estimates of the effective population size are below 100/1000, thresholds to limit inbreeding depression and to retain evolutionary potential. Taking the fragmented occurrence of Microtus oeconomus mehelyi in central Europe into account, it is possible that also other populations may also undergo the same processes after significant isolation.

AB Human activities are affecting habitats and wildlife populations worldwide. Tropical forests are one of the most affected environments, mainly due to deforestation and poaching. Since high levels of anthropogenic pressure on forest ecosystems, including illegal logging and hunting, occur in southwest Myanmar (Rakhine State), we analyzed the effects of human disturbance on medium to large mammals in this region. We used camera-trapping data collected over three consecutive years to investigate occurrence probabilities of 10 species: five common species exploited for bushmeat consumption, and five threatened species targeted by the illegal wildlife trade. We used a hierarchical single-species multi-season occupancy model implemented in a Bayesian framework to evaluate the effects of human disturbances and persistent habitat characteristics, such as the proportion of remaining pristine evergreen forest and the elevation, on occurrence probabilities. We found that occupancy probabilities of three out of five target species for the illegal wildlife trade were positively linked to forest habitats, whereas among common species hunted for bushmeat consumption the Northern red muntjak and the Malayan porcupine were negatively affected by human presence. The effects of human and habitat covariates were varied for other species of both groups. We confirmed results from previous studies that human disturbance is a driver of occurrence probabilities for some species in tropical areas. Our findings suggest that as protection of rainforest habitat is fundamental to the conservation of tropical ecosystems, law enforcement, patrolling, and local engagement activities are also recommended to mitigate forest and species exploitation. Finally, camera trapping could be a first step to identify areas where human presence affects species occupancy and help local authorities to develop more fine-tuned conservation plans.

AB Restoration of genetic diversity to levels that ensure long-term species persistence is an important management strategy in degraded systems. Unfortunately, genetic data are lacking for many species such that practitioners must make management decisions for data-deficient areas using information from other parts of a species' range. For such a management approach to be reliable, genetic diversity needs to be structured similarly. To determine if this is the case, we compared genetic structure in the submersed aquatic plant species Vallisneria americana across similar salinity gradients in three major tidal rivers in eastern North America (the Potomac, Hudson, and Kennebec) using 10 microsatellite markers. The Potomac supported high genotypic diversity, and no barriers between sampled sites were identified. Migrant analysis suggested that moving restoration stock within 22 km would fall within natural dispersal distances and thus create low risks, if augmentation were sought for sites where potential inbreeding was detected. The Hudson supported low genotypic diversity. No inbreeding was detected in the Kennebec or the Hudson, but dispersal barriers and recent bottlenecks were observed. These differences in genetic structure among rivers could limit broad adoption of management guidelines based solely on genetic data from one part of this species' range. Such guidelines could risk moving restoration stock across barriers in the unsampled rivers, altering the species' genetic architectures and potentially its natural resilience. Despite the allure of applying science-based generalities to restoration practice, locally relevant data and stock may often be needed for restoration efforts to maintain self-sustaining systems.

AB A growing body of research highlights the decisive role that justice claims play in creating sustainable payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs. Employing Sikor et al.'s approach to the study of justice claims in ecosystem governance along three dimensions-distribution, procedure and recognition-we study the negotiation process behind China's flagship interprovincial PES agreement: the Xin'anjiang River eco-compensation agreement between Huangshan (Anhui province) and Hangzhou (Zhejiang province) prefectures. We find that divergent claims between stakeholders on matters of distributive and procedural justice undercut one party's commitment to the agreement. Local officials in the upstream locality (Huangshan) see themselves as having been disadvantaged in both procedural and distributive aspects of negotiation. They claim to have been insufficiently included in a bargaining process that involved not only the downstream locality (Hangzhou) but also the central government. Huangshan stakeholders also see themselves as largely excluded from the benefits of cleaner water and bearing too much of the pollution abatement cost. For their part, Hangzhou stakeholders have advanced a 'polluters pay' view of distributive justice and found partial support for this claim from Beijing. Our findings suggest that attending to environmental justice considerations should be given top priority in China's design of PES schemes.

AB The effect of two drought acclimation treatments-high (HS) or moderated (MS) drought stress-on seedling growth was assessed in the two tree species Caesalpinia platyloba S.Watson (Fabaceae) and Ipomoea wolcottiana Rose (Convolvulaceae) in order to prepare them for dry spells. These species are mainly distributed in mature and disturbed sites, respectively, in a seasonal tropical dry forest in Jalisco, Mexico. Without acclimation, the seedlings of C. platyloba showed low values in both Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), suggesting a conservative biomass allocation, while in I. wolcottiana, the high Relative Growth Rate (RGR), Root: Shoot ratio (R:S), and low SLA suggested seedling drought evasion. After the acclimation period, the seedlings of both species showed reduced biomass allocation to leaves, as indicated by the decrease in Leaf Mass Ratio (LMR). Additionally, increases in R:S suggested greater allocation to water capture during the short growth season. After the dry spell simulation, the control seedlings of C. platyloba showed negative NAR, but the relatively high NAR observed in the seedlings subjected to HS and MS suggested that these treatments were sufficient to endure drought stress. In I. wolcottiana, a sigmoid relationship described that seedlings' RGR rapidly increased when NAR was raised. Contrastingly, in C. platyloba seedlings, the constant RGR increase related to the raise in NAR suggested a conservative use of water. In the I. wolcottiana seedlings, the HS treatment induced leaf abscission. Both species were plastic enough to acclimate to short periods of drought, but different levels of drought stress were necessary to acclimate the seedlings of each species. Suggested drought-acclimation treatments are to water the C. platyloba seedlings at 25% (HS) and I. wolcottiana seedlings at 50% (MS) of field capacity.

AB We carried out two experiments to test the effect of temperature increase and distance to the edge of remnant vegetation on seedling emergence, speed of seedling emergence, and seedling species diversity from Tamaulipan thornscrub. We carried out one experiment during the dry period, and a second one in the rainfall season. For both experiments, we collected 60 soil samples of 30 x 60 cm by 4 cm depth in a remnant Tamaulipan thornscrub fragment, from 5 m from the edge to the interior of remnant vegetation in a grid of six columns (15 m apart) per 10 rows (17 m apart). We divided each sample into two. One was set to grow in trays inside six acrylic open-top chambers (OTCs) to simulate global warming and the other in trays next to them, outside the OTCs. Mean temperature was 1 degrees C higher inside OTCs during the irrigation experiment and 2 degrees C higher during rainfall trial. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with Poisson link distribution to determine if there was an effect of the increase in temperature on the number of seedlings and species. Number of seedlings and species were similar inside and outside OTCs during irrigation trial, but there were more species and seedlings outside OTCs during the rainfall trial. For both experiments, speed of seedling emergence was similar inside and outside OTCs. Increased temperature affected number of seedlings and species, diversity, and abundance more than distance to the edge of the thornscrub fragment. Simulated warming under rainfall seems to decrease number of species, diversity, and abundance of seedlings; however, this difference could be due to other aspects not considered in this study. Further studies might consider seed dormancy and viability variations in the soil seed bank throughout the year.

AB The European green crab Carcinus maenas and its sister species C. aestuarii are highly invasive species causing damage to coastal ecosystems and contributing to severe economic losses worldwide. C. maenas was first detected at the Atlantic Patagonian coast in 2001. In this work, we studied the diet of the green crab in a recently invaded location in Golfo Nuevo, using three complementary techniques: direct stomach observation, metabarcoding of gut content and stable isotope analysis. Direct stomach observation and metabarcoding showed that green crabs have a broad omnivorous diet, ingesting most of the phyla present in the study area. Gut content metabarcoding allowed a detailed description of algal diversity and revealed other taxa that went unnoticed in the visual stomach analysis. Stable isotope analysis showed that the major contribution to the crabs' diet was from the phytoplankton chain (by bivalve consumption) and not directly from algae. This study approach combining three complementary techniques also allowed us to detect some differences in the diet between sexes, which suggests that male and female crabs are not as ecologically equivalent as previously thought. Besides, we detected sequences corresponding to C. aestuarii suggesting that the green crab Patagonian population is a hybrid of both sister species. These findings are key to understanding the impacts green crabs can have on the local ecosystem.

AB Accurate identification of species from timber is an essential step to help control illegal logging and forest loss. However, current approaches to timber identification based on morphological and anatomical characteristics have limited species resolution. DNA barcoding is a proven tool for plant species identification, but there is a need to build reliable reference data across broad taxonomic and spatial scales. Here, we construct a species barcoding library consisting of 1550 taxonomically diverse timber species from 656 genera and 124 families, representing a comprehensive genetic reference data set for Chinese timber species and international commercial traded timber species, using four barcodes (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, and ITS2). The ITS2 fragment was found to be the most efficient locus for Chinese timber species identification among the four barcodes tested, both at the species and genus level, despite its low recovery rate. Nevertheless, the barcode combination matK+trnH-psbA+ITS2 was required as a complementary barcode to distinguish closely related species in complex data sets involving internationally traded timber species. Comparative analyses of family-level discrimination and species/genus ratios indicated that the inclusion of closely related species is an important factor affecting the resolution ability of barcodes for timber species verification. Our study indicates that although nuclear ITS2 is the most efficient single barcode for timber species authentication in China, complementary combinations like matK+trnH-psbA+ITS2 are required to provide broader discrimination power. These newly-generated sequences enrich the existing publicly available databases, especially for tropical and subtropical evergreen timber trees and this current timber species barcode reference library can serve as an important genetic resource for forestry monitoring, illegal logging prosecution and biodiversity projects.

AB Dispersal is a critically important process that dictates population persistence, gene flow, and evolutionary potential, and is an essential element for identifying species conservation risks. This study aims to investigate the contributions of dispersal syndromes and hydrographic barriers on patterns of population connectivity and genetic structure in fishes occupying the particularly rugged and fragmented landscape of the Kimberley Plateau, Western Australia. We assessed population genetic structure between three neighbouring catchments (the Mitchell, King Edward, and Drysdale rivers) in three congeneric groups of freshwater fishes that exhibit varied dispersal syndromes within and among groups: (1) Melanotaenia australis and M. gracilis; (2) Syncomistes trigonicus and S. rastellus; and (3) Hephaestus jenkinsi and H. epirrhinos. Within each species we sampled the upper, middle, and lower reaches of each catchment and assessed patterns of gene flow between and within catchments using microsatellite markers. Our results suggest that contemporary connectivity between catchments is greatly limited or absent in all study species, regardless of their dispersal syndromes. However, gene flow within catchments varied in line with predicted dispersal potential, with poor dispersers exhibiting limited gene flow and significant genetic structuring. We conclude that the rugged landscape and historical habitat isolation has contributed to patterns of population fragmentation among fish populations from different river catchments. However, it appears dispersal syndromes influence connectivity and gene flow within catchments, where landscape constraints are not as pervasive. This study presents a comparative population genetic analysis of freshwater fishes with differing dispersal syndromes and colonisation ability. Our findings provide new insights into factors shaping patterns of biodiversity on the Kimberley Plateau, and the evolutionary uniqueness of fish communities from different river catchments draining the plateau. More broadly, they highlight the importance of accounting for dispersal-related traits when planning management and conservation strategies.

AB 'Brejos de altitude' is an ecosystem that has been subjected to severe exploitation, leading to an intense reduction in Brazil. Understanding the patterns of bryophyte diversity and composition, particularly of specialized species such as the epiphylls, to anthropic and abiotic variables is crucial for implementing protection measures. We investigated the relationship between composition and diversity of epiphyllous bryophytes and anthropic (edge effects) and abiotic (altitude) variables at local (within each 'Brejo') and regional (set of three 'Brejos') scale. Abiotic and anthropic variables were correlated with alpha and beta diversity (decomposed into species replacement and richness differences) using GLM. Their effects on species composition were evaluated using PERMANOVA. The localities at higher elevations harboured a richer bryoflora and overall beta diversity patterns were associated with altitude and locality, which acted over different scales. Regionally, the contribution of richness differences was limited with increasing altitude. Yet, dissimilarities among localities were associated with richness differences and replacement, denoting the importance of local factors. The composition was explained by local factors interacting with the regional altitudinal gradient. Anthropic activity was significant only when interacting with local factors and altitudinal gradient. Environmental filtering associated with altitude played a more important role in shaping the diversity and composition of epiphyllous bryophytes, at both regional and local scales. Each 'Brejo' acts as an ecological refuge, harbouring part of the whole environmental gradient, and presents a unique floristic composition. Moreover, partitioning beta diversity highlighted the interplay of local and regional forces shaping diversity patterns.

AB Central South America primarily comprises seasonally dry tropical domains, where a sharp rainy season defines phenological and yearly growth patterns. Here we examine if the genetic structure of the understorey ground-herb Chamaecostus subsessilis species complex, from South American seasonally dry forests, is defined by intrinsic contrasting environments of the Cerrado and southern Amazonia. We analysed a dataset of c. 20 kb of sequence data from targeted capture high-throughput sequencing using PCR-generated probes. We used an admixture model and population pairwise F-ST comparisons to interpret genetic structure. We also used a Bayesian coalescent approach with a relaxed clock to estimate divergence times between populations and haplotypes. Genetic structure reflects separate populations from Amazonia and from the Cerrado, whereas a haplotype-based phylogenetic tree provides further spatiotemporal evidence of this strong phylogeographical structure. Spatial arrangements among genetic lineages of the C. subsessilis species complex reveal that intraspecific evolution in Central South America seasonally dry understories is closely linked to environmental gradients.

AB There is increasing evidence that species diversity is underestimated in the current taxonomy of widespread freshwater fishes. The bagrid species T. albomarginatus s.l. is mainly distributed in the lowlands of South China, as currently identified. A total of 40 localities (including the type locality), which covers most of its known range, were sampled. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated mtDNA and nuclear genes recover nine highly supported lineages clustering into eight geographic populations. The integration of molecular evidence, morphological data, and geographic distribution demonstrates the delineation of T. albomarginatus s.l. as eight putative species. Four species, namely, T. albomarginatus, T. lani, T. analis, and T. zhangfei sp. nov. and the T. similis complex are taxonomically recognized herein. Moreover, T. zhangfei sp. nov. comprises two genetically distinct lineages with no morphological and geographical difference. This study also reveals aspects of estimation of divergence time, distribution, and ecological adaption within the T. albomarginatus group. The unraveling of the hidden species diversity of this lowland bagrid fish highlights the need for not only the molecular scrutiny of widely distributed species of South China but also the adjustment of current biodiversity conservation strategies to protect the largely overlooked diversity of fishes from low-elevation rapids.

AB Seed dispersal and predation by animals often drive plant regeneration. In tropical savannas, such as the Cerrado of Brazil, fire is also a key process in ecosystem dynamics, consuming the lower vegetation strata and killing wildlife, but how fire affects seed-animal interactions is virtually unknown. We investigated the effects of prescribed fires on the removal of diaspores from Miconia rubiginosa and sunflower Helianthus annuus in Cerrado from southeast Brazil. Using plots burned one month or one year before sampling and unburned controls, we assessed the effect of prescribed fire on microhabitat structure and diaspore removal by vertebrates and ants. Covered microhabitats experienced higher seed removal by vertebrates than open microhabitats, but microhabitat features did not influence seed removal by ants. Prescribed fire did not change the total amount of seed removal, and ants were responsible for most removals in burned and control plots. However, fire increased the importance of ants as agents of removal compared to vertebrates. These changes were probably mediated by changes in microhabitat cover. It is likely that species, whose seeds are often preyed upon by vertebrates, benefit from fire to escape predation, while the opposite would be true for those removed by granivorous ants. By changing microhabitats composition and frequency of seed removal by different agents, fire may create pulses of opportunities for certain plant species to increase their populations and enlarge their spatial distribution, while constraining others. However, how different fire intensities and frequencies influence seed fate of different species is still to be investigated. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

AB Globalization has undeniably impacted the Earth's ecosystems, but it has also influenced how we think about natural systems. Three fourths of the world's forests are now altered by human activity, which challenges our concepts of native ecosystems. The dichotomies of pristine vs. disturbed as well as our view of native and non-native species, have blurred; allowing us to acknowledge new paradigms about how humans and nature interact. We now understand that the use of militaristic language to define the perceived role of a plant species is holding us back from the fact that novel systems (new combinations of all species) can often provide valuable ecosystem services (i.e., water, carbon, nutrients, cultural, and recreation) for creatures (including humans). In reality, ecosystems exist in a gradient from native to intensely managed - and "non-nativeness" is not always a sign of a species having negative effects. In fact, there are many contemporary examples of non-native species providing critical habitat for endangered species or preventing erosion in human-disturbed watersheds. For example, of the 8,000-10,000 non-native species introduced to Hawai'i, less than 10% of these are self-sustaining and 90 of those pose a danger to native biota and are considered invasive. In this paper, we explore the native/non-native binary, the impacts of globalization and the political language of invasion through the lens of conservation biology and sociology with a tropical island perspective. This lens gives us the opportunity to offer a place-based approach toward the use of empirical observation of novel species interactions that may help in evaluating management strategies that support biodiversity and ecosystem services. Finally, we offer a first attempt at conceptualizing a site-specific approach to develop "metrics of belonging" within an ecosystem.

AB Documenting phylogenetic diversity for conservation practice allows elucidation of ecosystem functioning and processes by highlighting the commonality and divergence of species' functional traits within their evolutionary context. Conserving distinct evolutionary histories has intrinsic value, and the conservation of phylogenetically diverse communities is more likely to preserve distinct or relic evolutionary lineages. We explored the potential for anthropogenic forest fragmentation to act as a selective filter of avian phylogenetic diversity within the community of forest-dependent birds of the critically endangered Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest (IOCBF), South Africa. We conducted avian point count surveys during the austral breeding season, and calculated fragmentation metrics of forest structural complexity, patch size and isolation. We constructed a maximum likelihood phylogeny using the combined analysis of two mitochondrial genes and three nuclear markers and measured the influence of the fragmentation metrics on six measures of phylogenetic diversity. Our results indicated that the avian community was variously affected by anthropogenic forest fragmentation, with the different metrics of phylogenetic diversity responding with no definitive overall pattern. However, forest structural complexity emerged as an important metric explaining phylogenetic structuring. While the avian community's phylogenetic diversity displayed resilience to anthropogenic fragmentation, previous research showed a reduction in functional diversity along the fragmentation gradient. Therefore, we recommend studies that especially aim to guide conservation management, incorporate both phylogenetic and functional diversity measures to sufficiently interrogate communities' resilience to the threats under investigation.

AB Heterospecific pollen deposition (HPD) is ubiquitous across plant communities, especially for generalized species which use a diversity of pollinators, and may have negative effects on plant reproduction. However, it is unclear whether temporal changes in the co-flowering community result in changes in HPD patterns. Moreover, community-level studies are required to understand which factors influence HPD and how the reproduction of different species is affected. We investigated the temporal variation of HPD, its relationship with level of specialization on pollinators and floral phenotypic specialization, and its association with reproductive success (pollen limitation and fruit set) in 31 hummingbird-pollinated plant species in a tropical Campo Rupestre. We found seasonality in HPD, with species flowering in the dry season having greater diversity of heterospecific pollen on stigmas and a higher frequency of stigmas containing heterospecific pollen, compared to the rainy season. Stigmas of ecologically generalized species had more heterospecific pollen, while the relationship for ecologically specialized species depended on floral phenotype. Surprisingly, and in contrast to theory, we found a positive relationship between HPD and reproductive success. Our results indicate benefits of generalization and facilitation, in which sharing pollinators brings greater reproductive success via increased conspecific pollen deposition, even if it incurs more HPD. We demonstrated how assessing HPD at a community-level can contribute to understanding the ecological causes and functional consequences of pollinator sharing.

AB Whether geographically peripheral populations are worth conserving has been hotly debated yet remains unresolved. This is especially relevant in high-latitude countries where, within their political jurisdictions, many species reach their range limits as peripheral isolates and require conservation attention, even if they are common elsewhere. In Canada, similar to 77% of "at-risk" plant species are at their northern range limit in southern Canada but more common south of the Canada-USA border. Peripheral populations might contain little genetic variation, suffer low fitness and be prone to extinction, or they might be adapted to extreme range-edge environments and thus well-poised to participate in range shifts during climate change. Abronia umbellata is endemic to coastal dunes from Baja California, Mexico to Oregon, USA but also occurs as disjunct populations designated "at-risk" in Washington, USA and British Columbia, Canada. Based on sequence variation at nine single-copy nuclear genes assayed for 94 individuals from 25 populations across the species range, these disjunct populations were very similar to range edge populations 350 and 650 km to the south in Oregon, and likely arose through recent, long-distance dispersal or fragmentation of a recently expanded range. In contrast, southern-edge populations in Baja, though not disjunct, were genetically unique and unexpectedly diverse, may currently be in decline yet receive no conservation protection. In this case, the conservation significance of range edge populations depends on which edge, and the unprotected southern edge populations seem a higher priority than those benefitting from special status at the northern range limit.

ID REDD PLUS; PAYMENTS; SERVICES; ECONOMY
AB Irrespective of controversies and frustrated efforts, carbon forestry-the sequestering of greenhouse gases in forests-remains a key element of climate change mitigation. Carbon forestry drives regularly rely on a market-based conservation framework, where forest dwellers are remunerated for their service of maintaining forests through dedicated financial instruments routing global funds. In this article, I turn to India's first large-scale carbon forestry project, situated in the hills of Himachal Pradesh, and trace how carbon forestry plots are subjected to different temporal trajectories on different levels. I show that the marketing of emission reduction certificates (CER), underpinning carbon forestry, posits emergent forests as permanent sinks. The administrative procedures of this Indian carbon forestry project, however, aim at providing for these forests for sixty years. Finally, I show that villagers perceive a sense of closure, suspending dedicated care and governance routines as the project appears to dismantle and future payments become uncertain. I argue that these different temporal registers not only reveal contradictions within carbon forestry approaches but they also highlight the fragility of attempts to economize forests through supposedly green financial instruments and, therefore, the limited impact of what might appear as neoliberal agendas, in time.

AB Human-induced wildfires are increasing in frequency in tropical forests, and their deleterious consequences for biodiversity include decreases in seed rain, which may be affected directly by fire or indirectly by the creation of edges between forest and non-forest environments. Understanding seed rain is key to assess the potential for natural regeneration in plant communities. We assessed the impact of fire and fire-created edges on seed rain species richness, abundance, size, weight, and dispersal syndromes in Atlantic Forest remnants in Bahia, Brazil. We assessed seed rain at monthly intervals for an entire year along seven 300 m-long transects placed perpendicular to the edge. We installed seed traps at the edge and at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 150 m into the burnt area and into the forest from forest edge. We recorded a total of 9050 seeds belonging to 250 morphospecies. We did not observe edge influence; however, we detected a lower abundance and proportion of animal-dispersed seeds in the burnt than in the unburnt areas. The seed abundance in the burnt areas was lower and seeds were smaller and lighter than those in the unburnt area. Seed rain in the burnt area was not greater near to the forest than far from it. The abundance and richness of seed rain was positively correlated with tree density. Our findings highlight the lack of seed rain in burnt areas and differences in community composition between the burnt and unburnt areas. Collectively, these results indicate negative consequences on natural regeneration, which can lead to permanent secondarization of the vegetation and challenges for early regeneration of burnt areas, which will initially have impoverished forests due to low seed richness.

AB Habitat degradation due to hydropower development within protected areas has a marked negative effect on resident wildlife species. However, efforts to develop appropriate conservation and management plans are hampered by a general lack of quantitative information and a poor understanding of relevant ecological constraints. Great Argus Argusianus argus, a large galliform species sensitive to habitat degradation, can reflect the impacts of the Chiew Larn reservoir in southern Thailand on local wildlife. Great Argus abundance in the remaining lowland areas of Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary (KSWS) was estimated using line transects along the Chiew Larn reservoir edges and in the forest interior between February and April 2017. The population estimate for KSWS was 108 individuals (95% CI: 41-272) based on the sampled area of 18.06 km(2), with a density estimate of 5.9 calling males/km(2). The abundance increased with increased distance from the reservoir shoreline, which might be related to the high level of direct and indirect human disturbance close to the hydropower reservoir.

AB Plant invasions change the landscape in unprecedented ways, influencing not only local wetland native biodiversity but also the regional homogenization of plant communities. Freshwater wetlands are particularly vulnerable to invasive plant impacts, but few studies provide a longitudinal assessment encompassing native biodiversity, plant invasions, and anthropogenic disturbance. We investigate the effects of invasive plant richness and abundance on wetland native biodiversity in 16 temperate, freshwater wetlands in central Pennsylvania. We calculate several commonly used plant community structure and wetland condition indices by site and sampling period across a 20-year timeframe. Results indicate that environmental stimuli had a significant impact on invasive plant abundance through time. Native plant richness and abundance was influenced more by shrub richness, non-native plant cover, and environmental stressors than by invasive plant dominance. This relationship was made evident by the high rate of dominant species turnover and prevalence of dominant native species. If an invasive plant dominated a wetland site, it was replaced by a different dominant native and/or invasive plant in 10 to 15 years, a key finding that relates to the replacement rate of dominant species in the herbaceous layer. This discovery suggests that under certain conditions, invasive plants may provide the necessary means by which a system can recover from a disturbance, which historically goes against the current dogma in the scientific community. Moreover, this supports the idea that some invasive plants serve as a type of secondary pioneer species of succession, aiding in the development of a more stable and biodiverse system over time.

AB Boron (B) deficiency influences sugar beet development and productivity. A hydroponic set up of experiment was conducted by utilizing different B concentrations to study the impact of different morphological and physiological responses of sugar beet seedlings under B deficiency. The results showed that B deficiency (14 days of stress) inhibited the growth of different plant parts of sugar beet. The B deficiency significantly increased the leaf specific weight (SLW) and the root-shoot ratio of sugar beet seedlings. The activities of peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed a decreasing tendency under B deficiency, while the contents of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O-2(-)) increased with B concentration. Malonaldehyde (MDA) and proline contents were induced at B deficiency. In conclusion, B deficiency significantly reduced dry weight and leaf area, resulting in stunted sugar beet seedlings. It was manifested by a significant decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities and accumulation of ROS in the plant cells, inducing oxidative stress. The current study revealed that B deficiency affects plant growth and various morpho-physiological processes.

AB Worldwide, forest fragmentation and degradation have affected the flora and fauna, and are threatening the livelihood of people depending upon forest resources. It is essential to understand the underlying ecological processes to better manage such landscapes. In ecological assessments, insects are useful tools to assess the effects of human interventions such as restoration, as insects are vital for several ecosystem processes. Therefore, we studied the ecological processes that determined the distributions of the epigeic insect communities among the degraded forest fragments of the Attappady Hills (Western Ghats, India), which are being restored. Our objectives were to determine the spatial variations in the epigeic insect communities and their responses to habitat quantity and quality of the forest fragments, along with an assessment of the invasive ants' responses to fragmentation and degradation, and their effects on the native insect communities. We used pitfall traps in several forest fragments representing varying disturbance levels along an east-west gradient. The diversity of various insect taxonomic groups and functional feeding guilds were higher in smaller fragments than compared to larger fragments due to edge effects. The variations in the distributions of insect communities were explained by the habitat features that were spatially correlated. Invasive ants, Anoplolepis gracilipes, infested the smaller fragments where the vegetation quality had degraded. We conclude that an understanding of the effects of fragmentation and degradation on insect communities is vital to restoration managers as ecological restoration becomes an important strategy to reverse degradation and to revive ecological processes of fragmented forests.

ID GENOTYPING ARRAY; SNP VARIATION; CATTLE; DIVERSITY
AB The genomic diversity and relationship among seven diverse cattle breeds viz. Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Gir, Vechur, Ongole, Kangayam and Hariana were investigated in 132 random samples based on high density SNP array comprising > 777 K SNPs. A total of 1993 SNPs (0.25% of the total) having greater power (F-ST >= 0.20) to differentiate these cattle populations were identified, and utilized to partition genome of each animal into a predefined number of clusters. The structure of these cattle indicated shared ancestry of dairy breeds viz. Gir, Tharparkar and Sahiwal. Most of the animals (> 76%) of different populations under study except Vechur clustered into their own group of animals called breed. Vechur population retained highest rate of admixture, consistent with its crossing with other breeds. Ongole, Kangayam and Hariana shared comparatively less of their genome (<= 15%) with other breeds. The study indicated that all seven breeds evolved from their independent ancestry but there was intermixing of these breeds in the recent past. The selection signatures identified between draft (Kangayam) and dairy breeds included several genes like FAM19A2, RAB31P, BEST3, DGKA, AHCY, PIGU and PFKP which are involved in immune response, metabolic pathway, transportation of glucose and sugars, signaling pathways, cellular processes, cell division and glycolysis regulation, respectively. Moreover, these genomic regions also harbour QTLs affecting milk performance traits. The signatures were also identified even between the dairy breeds. In comparison to large-sized cattle, there were significant differences in the number of QTLs affecting production (body weight, growth rate etc.) and morphological traits (height) in short-statured Vechur breed. The presence of HMGA2 gene in the selection signature on chromosome 5 may explain the variations in stature between these cattle.

AB Unravelling the drivers of forests dynamics is one of the main challenges in tree community ecology. These drivers include niche differentiation, dispersal limitation and stochasticity. Previous work has demonstrated that these mechanisms likely interact such that no one process is responsible for forest dynamics. One possibility is that the functional composition in a forest changes in a deterministic fashion, but the abundances of individual species that are functionally similar and have similar life-history strategies drift in a neutral fashion. This framework aligns with the functional group-based version of the neutral theory proposed more than 30 years ago, but it has remained poorly understood and is not well-integrated in tree community ecology. To investigate the possibility that determinism and neutrality may operate on the functional and species levels, respectively, we studied the long-term dynamics of trees on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Specifically, we sorted tree species into functional groups. We defined them as groups of species that cluster together based upon continuous functional trait measurements that are believed to reflect key life-history trade-offs. This information was then used to quantify the observed species and functional group dynamics in the forest and to compare them to that expected from neutral simulations. We found that forest dynamics are likely governed by deterministic processes at the between-functional group level where species relative abundances change or drift through time within group. Species rank distributions for each functional group remained relatively stable suggesting that these groups may act as broad adaptive zones for both common and rare species that may promote species coexistence. Moreover, we found that these functional groups associate with different habitats in the forest. Synthesis. The results indicate that deterministic processes control the relative proportion of each functional group in the tropical forest studied and that individual species within groups may have apparently neutral dynamics. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that observed stable functional group relative proportions can be produced by deterministic or neutral dynamics, which underscores the importance of comparing the observed functional dynamics to that expected under neutral dynamics.

AB Ecological restoration has emerged as a key strategy for conserving tropical forests and habitat specialists, and monitoring faunal recovery using indicator taxa like birds can help assess restoration success. Few studies have examined, however, whether active restoration (AR) achieves better recovery of bird communities than natural regeneration, or how bird recovery relates to habitat affiliations of species in the community. In rainforests restored over the past two decades in a fragmented landscape (Western Ghats, India), we examined whether bird species richness and community composition recovery in 23 actively restored (AR) sites were significantly better than recovery in paired naturally regenerating (NR) sites, relative to 23 undisturbed benchmark (BM) rainforests. We measured eight habitat variables and tested whether bird recovery tracked habitat recovery, whether rainforest and open-country birds showed contrasting patterns, and assessed species-level responses to restoration. We recorded 92 bird species in 460 point-count surveys. Rainforest bird species richness was highest in BM, intermediate in AR and lowest in NR. Contrastingly, open-country bird species richness was least in BM, intermediate in AR and highest in NR. Bird community composition varied significantly across treatment types with composition in AR in transition from NR to BM. Bird community dissimilarity between sites was positively related to dissimilarity in habitat structure and floristics, and geographical distance between sites. Variance partitioning indicated that structural and floristic dissimilarity explained 90% of the variation in community composition. Indicator species analysis revealed significant associations of 34 species with one or more treatment types. Species associated with BM and AR treatment types were all rainforest species, while only 38% of species associated with AR and NR treatment types were rainforest species. Synthesis and applications. We show that active restoration (AR) of degraded fragments benefits rainforest birds and reduces the infiltration of open-country birds, and highlight the importance of considering rainforest and open-country species separately. In human-modified tropical rainforest landscapes, AR of degraded fragments fosters partial recovery and complements protection of mature forests for bird conservation.

AB Low mortality rates and slow growth differentiate shade-tolerant from shade-intolerant species and define the survival strategy of juvenile trees growing in deep shade. While radial stem growth has been widely used to explain mortality in juvenile trees, the leaf area ratio (LAR), known to be a key component of shade tolerance, has been neglected so far. We assessed the effects of LAR, radial stem growth and tree height on survival time and the age-specific mortality rate of juvenile Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech), Acer pseudoplatanus L. (sycamore maple) and Acer platanoides L. (Norway maple) in a primeval beech forest (Ukraine). Aboveground and belowground biomass and radial stem growth were analysed for 289 living and 179 dead seedlings and saplings. Compared with the other species, F. sylvatica featured higher LAR, slower growth and a lower mortality rate. The average survival time of F. sylvatica juveniles (72 years) allows it to reach the canopy more often than its competitors in forests with low canopy turnover rate. In contrast, a combination of lower LAR, higher growth rate and higher age-specific mortality rate of the two Acer species resulted in their shorter survival times and thus render their presence in the canopy a rare event. Overall, this study suggests that shade tolerance, commonly defined as a relationship between sapling mortality and growth, can alternatively be formulated as a relationship between survival time and the interplay of growth and LAR.

AB In view of the growing global demand for electricity, many countries have been looking for ways to diversify production. However, in countries such as Brazil, hydroelectric power plants still constitute the predominant generating source, occupying important drainage systems, such as the Upper Parana River. At the same time, hydroelectric dams are among the main sources of impacts on freshwater fish, interfering, for example, in the genetic distribution of populations. Although the same could be expected from Small Hydroelectric Plants, very little genetic information has been obtained along Neotropical drainages. Based on this, the present study analyzed the DNA (microsatellite loci) of non-migratory fish species (seven) upstream and downstream of three Small Hydroelectric Plants in the Upper Parana River basin, obtaining information about the genetic distribution of fish populations in this scenario. In general, the data suggest that populations have been genetically subdivided by Small Hydroelectric Plants and that other factors, such as the number of Small Hydroelectric Plants along a drainage and connectivity with long free stretches, could also influence genetic differentiation levels, which provides information of great relevance to global discussions about the impacts of hydroelectric power plants, as well as for the implementation and management of projects.

AB South America's complex geological and environmental dynamics contributed to the origin of Neotropical biodiversity and shaped the pattern of species distribution on the continent. Massartella Lestage (Ephemeroptera, Leptophlebiidae, Atalophlebiinae) is a genus currently composed of five species endemic to South America, with a disjunct distribution, occurring in mountains along the Atlantic Forest and in the Venezuelan Pantepui region. Here, we use Bayesian phylogenetic trees, fossil-based molecular dating and ancestral range estimation to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Massartella. Results recovered the genus and the Pantepui and Atlantic Forest lineages as reciprocally monophyletic, and suggest that a vicariant event separated populations of the last common ancestor of these clades ca. 66 Ma, between the Middle Cretaceous and the Palaeogene. The diversification processes started at the same time in both lineages, and the reciprocal monophyly of clades indicates no subsequent connections between these areas, or the extinction of intermediates. Mountain biodiversity has the signature of both ancient and recent geoclimatic events and ecological processes that probably were responsible for isolating the Pantepui and Atlantic Forest lineages, as well as the speciation processes within these regions.

AB Evolutionary and ecological processes that influenced the assembly of the New World flora are best understood through investigation of spatio-temporal processes of specific lineages, but some groups still lack a historical overview. Here, we produced a well-sampled dated tree, reconstructed ancestral ranges and performed diversification analyses for Sisyrinchium (Iridaceae) to elucidate its evolution in the Americas. Eight molecular markers and samples representing its full geographical range and morphological diversity were used to estimate divergence times with a Bayesian relaxed clock with secondary calibrations. Ancestral range reconstruction under likelihood methods and diversification analyses were performed. Sisyrinchium originated in a broad range including the Andes and Mesoamerica in the Mid-Miocene. Diversification at high elevations occurred in the early diverging lineages, which feature the highest extinction rates. Increase in diversification rate was detected during the Pliocene/Pleistocene after the colonization of lower elevations. Later sympatric speciation in south-eastern Brazil was followed by movements to other regions, including a long-dispersal event to North America. Higher extinction rates were followed by movements to lower elevations, with periods of accelerated Andean orogeny and global temperature decrease. Our results indicate that palaeoclimate and changes in elevational range influenced diversification in Sisyrinchium.

AB Simple Summary: Regenerating forests represent over half of all tropical forests. While regeneration processes of trees and animal groups have been studied, there is surprisingly little information about how the diversity and community composition of fungi and other microorganisms change and what ecological roles play in tropical forest regeneration. In this study, we compared the diversity and community composition of trees and soil fungi among primary forests and regenerating forests of different ages in two sampling areas in southern Costa Rica. Our study shows that while forest age has a significant influence, environmental factors, such as mesoclimate and soil chemistry, have stronger effects on both fungal and tree communities. Moreover, we observed that the more dissimilar tree communities are between any two sites, the more dissimilar the composition of fungal communities. The results presented here contribute to a better understanding of the successional processes of tropical forests in different regions and inform land use and forest management strategies, including, but not limited to, conservation, restoration, and sustainable use.
   Successional dynamics of plants and animals during tropical forest regeneration have been thoroughly studied, while fungal compositional dynamics during tropical forest succession remain unknown, despite the crucial roles of fungi in ecological processes. We combined tree data and soil fungal DNA metabarcoding data to compare richness and community composition along secondary forest succession in Costa Rica and assessed the potential roles of abiotic factors influencing them. We found a strong coupling of tree and soil fungal community structure in wet tropical primary and regenerating secondary forests. Forest age, edaphic variables, and regional differences in climatic conditions all had significant effects on tree and fungal richness and community composition in all functional groups. Furthermore, we observed larger site-to-site compositional differences and greater influence of edaphic and climatic factors in secondary than in primary forests. The results suggest greater environmental heterogeneity and greater stochasticity in community assembly in the early stages of secondary forest succession and a certain convergence on a set of taxa with a competitive advantage in the more persisting environmental conditions in old-growth forests. Our work provides unprecedented insights into the successional dynamics of fungal communities during secondary tropical forest succession.

AB A new classification for the freshwater crabs of the Americas, the superfamily Pseudothelphusoidea, is presented based on a multigene phylogeny complemented by morphological analyses. We propose that the superfamily Pseudothelphusoidea be composed of two families, the Epiloboceridae and the Pseudothelphusidae, with the subsequent reorganization of the latter into eight subfamilies, of which five (Hypolobocerinae, Kingsleyinae, Potamocarcininae, Pseudothelphusinae, Strengerianinae) represent previously recognized tribes. We erect three new subfamilies: Guinotiinae, Ptychophallinae and Raddausinae, to reflect relationships that have become clear with the new analyses. The new classification scheme has a high level of congruence with the geographical distribution of species and genera. A divergence time estimate suggests that the Pseudothelphusoidea originated in the late Cretaceous around 68 Mya. Subsequent divergence events can be correlated with emergent landmasses throughout the range of the superfamily. There is high concordance among several elements of our proposal: (1) the main morphological types of male gonopods correspond to well defined Glades obtained with molecular analyses; (2) the geographic distribution of the subfamilies has a structured pattern; and (3) the estimated times of divergence of each group can be associated to the geological history of each region. The combination of these elements results in a robust new classification scheme.

AB Deforestation in the tropics causes warming which contributes to regional climate change. Forest loss occurs over a broad range of spatial scales, producing a variety of spatial patterns of cleared and forested land. Whether the spatial attributes of these patterns influence the resulting temperature change remains largely unknown. We adopted a differences-in-differences approach to analyse remotely-sensed forest loss and land surface temperature (LST) data in maritime Southeast Asia. We found that deforestation increased LST, as expected, but that the temperature increases were smaller when forest loss produced more fragmented landscapes in which non-forest and forest edges were heavily interlaced. Temperature increases were greater where the forest loss was more extensive. Warming also extended beyond the location of forest removal, so that forest loss increased temperatures in undisturbed locations up to 6 km away. Different spatial patterns of land clearing, for example, as might be produced by small-holder agriculture as opposed to large-scale deforestation, would therefore have different impacts on the local climate. Conserving forests within 4 km of farmland, urban areas or other sensitive environments may help to avoid temperature increases that reduce land productivity and worsen human health.

AB Tropical land-use change for agricultural expansion is the primary driver of global biodiversity decline. Efforts to stem this decline often focus on protecting pristine habitats or returning farmland to forest, yet such approaches fail to protect vulnerable taxa reliant on habitats within low-intensity farmland. We assess the economic viability of carbon-based payments for ecosystem services (PES) to protect farmland trees and fallowing in Ghana, which provide vital wintering sites for imperiled Afro-palearctic migrant birds and enhance landscape-level carbon storage. We estimate the carbon breakeven prices (BEPs) associated with alternative agricultural management scenarios that protect existing farmland trees. BEPs associated with tree protection on existing farmland were very low, ranging from US$2.49 to US$6.45 t(-1) CO2. Extending and reintroducing fallow periods also carried competitive BEPs, US$4.67-US$15.45 t(-1) CO2, when combined with the protection of 50 trees per hectare. Accounting for leakage and economic uncertainty increased BEPs considerably, but scenarios protecting farmland trees and extending fallow periods remained below EU Emissions Trading Scheme prices. Protecting low-intensity farmland habitats and associated biodiversity is cost-effective under carbon-based PES. Implementation should be combined with efforts to close yield gaps, providing greater local food security and resilience.

AB In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on generating cutting-edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I-VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.

AB Fragmented and degraded ecosystems should be restored to ensure the biological connectivity among fragmented forest landscapes. The tropical rainforests of Southwestern Sri Lanka are highly degraded and fragmented due to plantation agriculture and human settlements. However, the high spatial variation in environmental factors and ecosystem functions challenge the success rate of restoration interventions. The aim of this study was to assess the vegetation composition and stand structure in relation to the spatial variation in key soil physicochemical parameters in the Endane Biodiversity Corridor that links peripheral forest reserve to the Sinharaja Rainforest Complex (SRC). The site that extends over 24 ha was classified into five land-use categories (productive tea lands, marginal tea lands, scrub-abandoned three years ago, and two woodlands-abandoned 15 years ago) in which the vegetation composition, stand structure, and physicochemical parameters of soil were assessed and mapped. Results revealed that the Shannon diversity index in the scrub and the woodlands were higher than in the tea lands. The diversity among the secondary forest patches was similar. However, with a mean record of 14 species, the species richness was high in sites close to the SRC. In comparison to the SRC (358 Mg ha(-1)), there was a substantial potential to sequester more carbon in the restoration sites (12-108 Mg ha(-1)). While explaining 31% of abundance and species distribution, the ordination results revealed a close relationship of the soil parameters to vegetation composition and species abundance. The calculated coefficient variation values for soil parameters (TN, EC, Av.P, Ex.K, OC, and BD) were beyond 12%, indicating high or moderate soil spatial variability among the land use categories. Coefficient of variation for soil pH was estimated to be 9%, revealing low soil spatial variability among the land use categories. The maps of these soil parameters corresponded with the type of land use and fertilizer application to tea fields. The highest and the lowest total N contents were observed in the scrub and woodlands, respectively, which appears to be mediated by the relative composition of N-fixing trees between the two groups. Our results facilitate effective matching of sites to species for restoration of the Endane Biodiversity Corridor that may be replicated in similar restoration contexts in tropical Asia.

AB Examining justice in cities requires using analytical approaches that can unpack their complex nature and reveal the many interacting dimensions that affect justice patterns and processes. Although justice in cities has been examined extensively, it has primarily focused on social and environmental dimensions. However, justice is multi-dimensional, influenced and affected by multiple actors, dynamics, and processes. In this paper we propose the use of ecological justice, as justice of, to, and for nature as a critical lens for portraying a more integral understanding of urban injustices. This lens extends the notion of justice to nature through four dimensions: distribution of harmful impacts, recognition of nature, participation of nature, and the capabilities of social ecological systems. Through a relational lens we develop a methodology that uses the social-ecological technological system (SETS) conceptual framework to unpack how the dimensions and interactions affect ecological justice across urban landscapes. This methodology is operationalized into measurable variables and applied through a case study in New York City. A spatial analysis of indicators that act as SETS-Justice proxies at a Community District level, reveal high spatial variability of ecological justice hotspots when looking at each dimension independently. Identifying ecological justice hotspots can provide critical information for improving ecological justice through multiple means. For example, hotspots lacking in social-ecological recognition and participation of nature can inform context-specific solutions such as policies and projects that target community engagement, capacity building, and improve ecological knowledge. Additionally, a composite analysis of SETS Justice through the aggregation of all indicators, reveals justice hotspots different to those commonly mapped in other justice-focused studies. This approach highlights the need to jointly address issues of environmental and ecological justice.

AB The increasing rate of marine invasions to Western Europe in recent decades highlights the importance of addressing the central questions of invasion biolog: what allows an invader to be successful, and which species are likely to become invasive? Consensus is currently lacking regarding the key traits that determine invasiveness in marine species and the extent to which invasive and indigenous species differ in their trait compositions. This limits the ability to predict invasive potential. Here we propose a method based on trait profiles which can be used to predict non-indigenous species likely to cause the greatest impact and native species with a tendency for invasion. We compiled a database of 12 key biological and life history traits of 85 non-indigenous and 302 native marine invertebrate species from Western Europe. Using multivariate methods, we demonstrate that biological traits were able to discriminate between native and non-indigenous species with an accuracy of 78%. The main discriminant traits included body size, lifespan, fecundity, offspring protection, burrowing depth and, to a lesser extent, pelagic stage duration Analysis revealed that the typical non-indigenous marine invertebrate is a mid-sized, long-lived, highly fecund suspension feeder which either broods its offspring or has a pelagic stage duration of 1-30 days, and is either attached-sessile or burrows to a depth of 5 cm. Biological traits were also able to predict native species classed as "potentially invasive" with an accuracy of 78%. Targeted surveillance and proactive management of invasive species requires accurate predictions of which species are likely to become invasive in the future. Our findings add to the growing evidence that non-indigenous species possess a greater affinity for certain traits. These traits are typically present in the profile of "potentially invasive" native species.

AB The existence of degraded forests is common in the Eastern Amazon. The maintenance of these forests standing and the recovery of their productivity play an important role in the conservation of biodiversity, storage and carbon sequestration. However, the management techniques currently employed are designed for natural forests in the first harvest cycle or lightly explored and do not apply adequately to forests that have gone through several harvest cycles. Therefore, adaptations and the establishment of new management criteria that take into account other characteristics of these types of forests are necessary to ensure their sustainability. The objective of this study was to propose a silvicultural management system that has the potential to recover and perpetuate the productivity of an intensively logged tropical forest. A forest census was carried out on 535.6 ha for trees with dbh >= 25 cm. With these data, the following two treatments were designed: (1) criteria: the BDq method was applied from B = 9.8 m(2) ha(-1), D = 100 cm and q = 2. The criteria for standing wood commercialization were, in this order, first, Health; second, Tree Stem; third, Tree Density and fourth, dbh >= 105 cm. (2) Control: the planning was in accordance with Brazilian regulations. For the cost-benefit and sensitivity analysis, the Net Present Value (NPV) was used and a projection of +/- 20% was made in the commercial price of standing wood. In the criteria treatment, a higher number of trees and species destined for the commercialization of standing wood was verified in relation to the control treatment, showing a greater diversity of species. In the criteria treatment, NPV was positive and superior to the control treatment in all scenarios. The proposed silvicultural management system with an object of an explored and enriched forest, with criteria for harvesting trees with a minimum cut diameter of 25 cm, proved to be viable to generate economic returns and with conservationist potential for the continuous supply of forest products and maintaining biodiversity.

AB One of the many taxonomic challenges found in the Dendropsophus microcephalus species group is the Dendropsophus walfordi distinction from D. nanus. Recent phylogenetic inferences have indicated the paraphyly of these species, although they were not designed to assess this issue. To contribute to the delimitation of these species, we analyzed the 12S, 16S and COI mitochondrial genes, the morphological traits, and the advertisement calls of specimens from northern Amazonia to Argentina, including the type localities of D. nanus and D. walfordi. Paraphyly of D. nanus with respect to D. walfordi was inferred by maximum-parsimony and Bayesian analyses, and five major clades exhibiting nonoverlapping geographic distributions were recognized. The bPTP and ABGD analyses supported the existence of five independently evolving lineages in this complex. Acoustic and morphological data clearly distinguished the clade that included the topotypes of D. walfordi from the others, corroborating the validity of this species. To avoid the paraphyly of D. nanus with respect to D. walfordi, we recognize the clade distributed from central-southern Brazil to Argentina as D. nanus, the clade distributed in Amazonia as D. walfordi, and discuss the existence of unnamed cryptic species closely related to D. nanus and D. walfordi.

AB Effects of permanent (i.e., maintained) and temporary edges with north- and south-facing exposures were studied in sand pine (Pinus clausa var. clausa (Chapm. ex Engelm.) Vasey ex Sarg.) scrub, an open-canopied forest type in Ocala National Forest, Florida. On edges and interiors of four stands of each type, we measured canopy tree architecture in 5 m x 100 m plots and stand density and basal area in 5 m x 200 m plots. Edge effects were modest but often stronger on south-than north-facing edges and along permanent forest roads than temporary edges of clearcuts that were allowed to regrow. Compared with interior trees, those on edges were typically shorter, retained branches lower on their boles, oriented their first branches more towards the edge, and produced more asymmetrical crowns with the long axis extending into the opening; these trends were greater on south- than north-facing edges and along permanent than temporary edges. Contrary to expectations, there were no edge effects on total basal area, dead tree densities, proportions of sand pine trees with leaning trunks, directions of lean, or angles of lean. Instead of an edge effect, most trees leaned towards the southwest, which seems related to the northeastern origin of prevailing winds and wind gusts.

AB All Schistosoma mansoni tri-and tetranucleotide repeat microsatellites published as of December 2018 were identified. All 52 were evaluated for autosomal location, strength of amplification, scorability and behavior as single-copy loci by polyacrylamide and capillary gel electrophoresis. Of these, 27 were unique, autosomal, polymorphic, easily scored and single copy as assessed on pooled adult worm DNA from two different continental origins and adult worm clones. These microsatellites were distributed across all seven autosomal chromosomes. On laboratory strains their heterozygosity ranged from 0.22 to 0.77. Individual markers had 5-13 alleles, allelic richness of 2-10 and an effective allele number of 1.3-8.14. Those infected by Schistosoma mansoni carry many genetically distinct, sexually reproducing parasites, therefore, for an individual infection the complete allele frequency profile of their progeny consists of a pool of DNA from multiple diploid eggs. Using a set of 25 microsatellites, we calculated allele frequency profiles of eggs in fecal samples from people in two Brazilian communities separated by 6 km: Jenipapo (n = 80) and Volta do Rio (n = 38). There were no a priori characteristics that could predict the performance of markers in natural infections based on their performance with laboratory strains. Increasing marker number did not change accuracy for differentiation and diversity but did improve precision. Our data suggest that using a random set of 10-20 microsatellites appears to result in values that exhibit low standard deviations for diversity and differentiation indices.

AB Global forest cover is heavily fragmented. Due to high edge-to-surface ratios in small forest patches, a large proportion of forests is affected by edge influences involving steep microclimatic gradients. Although forest edges are important ecotones and account for 20% of the global forested area, it remains unclear how biotic and abiotic drivers affect forest edge microclimates at the continental scale. Here we report soil and air temperatures measured in 225 deciduous forest plots across Europe for two years. Forest stands were situated along a latitudinal gradient and subject to a varying vegetation structure as quantified by terrestrial laser scanning. In summer, the average offset of air and soil temperatures in forest edges compared to temperatures outside the forest amounted to -2.8 degrees C and -2.3 degrees C, respectively. Edge-to-interior summer temperature gradients were affected by the macroclimate and edge structure. From the edge onwards, larger offsets were observed in dense forest edges and in warmer, southern regions. In open forests and northern Europe, altered microclimatic conditions extended deeper into the forest and gradients were steeper. Canopy closure and plant area index were important drivers of summer offsets in edges, whereas in winter also the forest-floor biomass played a key role. Using high-resolution maps, we estimated that approximately 10% of the European broadleaved forests would be affected by altered temperature regimes. Gradual transition zones between forest and adjacent lands are valuable habitat types for edge species. However, if cool and moist forest interiors are desired, then (i) dense and complex forest edges, (ii) an undisturbed forested buffer zone of at least 12.5 m deep and (iii) trees with a high shade casting ability could all contribute to an increased offset. These findings provide important guidelines to mitigate edge influences, to protect typical forest microclimates and to adapt forest management to climate change.

AB Interactions between species can influence successful reproduction, resulting in reproductive character displacement, where the similarity of reproductive traits - such as flowering time - among close relatives growing together differ from when growing apart. Evidence for the overall prevalence and direction of this phenomenon, and its stability under environmental change, remains untested across large scales. Using the power of crowdsourcing, we gathered phenological information from over 40 000 herbarium specimens, and investigated displacement in flowering time across 110 animal-pollinated species in the eastern USA. Overall, flowering time displacement is not common across large scales. However, displacement is generally greater among species pairs that flower close in time, regardless of direction. Furthermore, with climate change, the flowering times of closely related species are predicted, on average, to shift further apart by the mid-21(st) century. We demonstrate that the degree and direction of phenological displacement among co-occurring closely related species pairs varies tremendously. However, future climate change may alter the differences in reproductive timing among many of these species pairs, which may have significant consequences for species interactions and gene flow. Our study provides one promising path towards understanding how the phenological landscape is structured and may respond to future environmental change.

AB Howler monkeys (genus Alouatta) exhibit the most extensive distribution among platyrrhines, comprising Mesoamerican and South American species groups, with the South American group including the Brazilian endemic A. belzebul species complex encompassing A. belzebul, A. discolor, and A. ululata. We herein analyzed their phylogenetic relationship, nucleotide and haplotype diversity, and population demography based on the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b. The phylogenetic and median-joining network analyses distinguished A. discolor, distributed in the west bank of the Xingu River, from A. belzebul on the east bank. This river is a zoogeographic barrier for these species. We did not find evidence of phylogenetic structure between the A. belzebul populations of opposite banks of the Tocantins River, likely related to the changes in the position of this river to the northeast in the late Pleistocene. The A. belzebul along this river showed great morphologic and haplotype diversity, and A. belzebul from the Amazon have kept a larger population size than A. discolor. We herein describe the karyotype of A. discolor, which was similar to those described for A. ululata and A. belzebul. Our results showed two well-defined and supported clades for A. discolor and A. belzebul. However, a new assessment of A. ululata across a large distribution of sampling is required due to the lack of a clear phylogenetic structure.

AB The papilionoid legume genus Ormosia (Fabaceae) comprises about 150 species of trees and exhibits a striking disjunct geographical distribution between the New World-and Asian and Australasian wet tropics and subtropics. Modern classifications of Ormosia are not grounded on a well-substantiated phylogenetic hypothesis and have been limited to just portions of the geographical range of the genus. The lack of an evolutionarily-based foundation for systematic studies has hindered taxonomic work on the genus and prevented the testing of biogeographical hypotheses related to the origin of the Old World/New World disjunction and the individual dispersal histories within both areas. Here, we present the most comprehensively sampled molecular phylogeny of Ormosia to date, based on analysis of both nuclear (ITS) and plastid (matK and trnL-F) DNA sequences from 82 species of the genus. Phylogenetically-based divergence times and ancestral range estimations are employed to test hypotheses related to the biogeographical history of the genus. We find strong support for the monophyly of Ormosia and the grouping of all sampled Asian species of the genus into two comparably sized clades, one of which is sister to another large clade containing all sampled New World species. Within the New World clade, additional resolution supports the grouping of most species into three mutually exclusive subordinate clades. The remaining New World species form a fourth well-supported clade in the analyses of plastid sequences, but that result is contradicted by the analysis of ITS. With few exceptions the supported clades have not been previously recognized as taxonomic groups. The biogeographical analysis suggests that Ormosia originated in continental Asia and dispersed to the New World in the Oligocene or early Miocene via long-distance trans-oceanic dispersal. We reject the hypothesis that the inter-hemispheric disjunction in Ormosia resulted from fragmentation of a more continuous "Boreotropical" distribution since the dispersal post-dates Eocene climatic maxima. Both of the Old World clades appear to have originated in mainland Asia and subsequently dispersed into the Malay Archipelago and beyond, at least two lineages dispersing across Wallace's Line as far as the Solomon Islands and northeastern Australia. In the New World, the major clades all originated in Amazonia. Dispersal from Amazonia into peripheral areas in Central America, the Caribbean, and Extra-Amazonian Brazil occurred multiple times over varying time scales, the earliest beginning in the late Miocene. In a few cases, these dispersals were followed by local diversification, but not by reverse migration back to Amazonia. Within each of the two main areas of distribution, multiple modest bouts of oceanic dispersal were required to achieve the modern distributions.

AB The Amazon region is expected to become an amplified fire-prone system, but the mechanism of fire occurrence is not fully understood. Here, we employed more than 300,000 Sentinel-2 images acquired during 2016-2019 and compiled a high-resolution inventory of active fires (AFs) over the Amazon. We found that the fire activities in the Amazon in 2019 did not stand out compared with those in 2017 as a whole. However, the number of fires increased in 2019 in the absence of an exceptional drought, suggesting increased human disturbance in the Amazon. The high-resolution AF inventory further demonstrated that over 90% of detected AFs were associated with humans clearing deforested fields on forest fringes for agricultural land expansion. Additionally, our inventory indicated that satellite sensors with coarser spatial resolution could miss considerable small fires, especially at the sensitive agriculture-forest interface, which therefore should be targeted as a priority conservation area.
   Plain Language Summary The Amazon region is a globally important biodiversity hotspot and carbon reservoir. In the context of increasing deforestation in the Amazon, high-resolution satellite monitoring is essential for detecting small spatially fragmented fires and for developing more targeted forest conservation strategies. Here, we compiled a high-resolution active fire inventory by processing more than 300,000 Sentinel-2 images. First, we found that most fires burn over shrublands, grasslands, and croplands near the fringes of the rainforest. Second, the headline-grabbing fires in 2019 did not stand out compared with those in 2017 as a whole. However, the 2019 fires occurred in the absence of droughts, and more fires were observed deeper in the forest, suggesting that human disturbance was increasing in the Amazon. Finally, our inventory allows spatially explicit matches with fire-affected land covers. Evidence from high-resolution observations indicated that the fires in the Amazon are closely interlinked with deforestation and agricultural land expansion and form an interactive circle. This leads to forest fragmentation and stimulates more fragmented fires in turn. Our findings improve the understanding of fire-climate-land cover change interactions at a fine spatial resolution.
   Key Points
   The fire dynamics in 2019 without an exceptional drought indicated an increase in human disturbance in the Amazon
   Over 90% of detected fires were associated with human clearing deforested fields on the forest fringes for agricultural purposes
   Small fires are well recorded in Sentinel-2 images, providing a vital supplement to active fire products from coarser resolution sensors

AB Patchy degradation is a typical characteristic of grassland degradation. However, little is known about the responses of soil microbial community composition and richness to patchy degradation process, although soil microbes play important roles in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Further, there is always a transitional area of vegetation between non-degraded and degraded patches (i.e. ecotone), but the characteristics of soil microbial communities at ecotone are not well understood. Here, we investigated spatial patterns of soil microbial composition and richness from non-degraded to degraded patch in a patchy degraded grassland of Northern China. The results showed that bacterial and fungal richness had contrast patterns during patchy degradation process. Bacterial richness increased while fungal richness decreased from non-degraded to degraded patch. Notably, soil bacteria had significant edge effects, characterized by more abundant bacterial taxa at ecotone compared with non-degraded and degraded patches, which was attributable to the release of competition from the lower dominant phylum-Actinobacteria abundance. Moreover, the relative abundance of rare taxa for bacteria and fungi consistently decreased during patchy degradation process, indicating a reduction of ecosystem function. Relative abundance of soil microbial rare taxa could be a good ecological indicator in responding to grassland degradation. Overall, our study revealed the spatial patterns of soil microbial community during patchy degradation process and the microbial characteristics at ecotone, which is crucial for mechanistic understanding of grassland degradation process, and also providing a theoretical basis for the development of grassland restoration strategy.

AB The recurrence of similar evolutionary patterns within different habitats often reflects parallel selective pressures acting upon either standing or independently occurring genetic variation to produce a convergence of phenotypes. This interpretation (i.e. parallel divergences within adjacent streams) has been hypothesized for drainage-specific morphological 'ecotypes' observed in polyploid snowtrout (Cyprinidae: Schizothorax). However, parallel patterns of differential introgression during secondary contact are a viable alternative hypothesis. Here, we used ddRADseq (N = 35 319 de novo and N = 10 884 transcriptome-aligned SNPs), as derived from Nepali/Bhutanese samples (N = 48 each), to test these competing hypotheses. We first employed genome-wide allelic depths to derive appropriate ploidy models, then a Bayesian approach to yield genotypes statistically consistent under the inferred expectations. Elevational 'ecotypes' were consistent in geometric morphometric space, but with phylogenetic relationships at the drainage level, sustaining a hypothesis of independent emergence. However, partitioned analyses of phylogeny and admixture identified subsets of loci under selection that retained genealogical concordance with morphology, suggesting instead that apparent patterns of morphological/phylogenetic discordance are driven by widespread genomic homogenization. Here, admixture occurring in secondary contact effectively 'masks' previous isolation. Our results underscore two salient factors: (i) morphological adaptations are retained despite hybridization and (ii) the degree of admixture varies across tributaries, presumably concomitant with underlying environmental or anthropogenic factors.

AB Key message Habitat fragmentation influences leaf morphology, quantity and quality of plant resources to herbivores, which in turn affects the patterns of fluctuating asymmetry and herbivory in Quercus deserticola. Forest fragmentation has negative effects on biodiversity by modifying environmental conditions, ecological processes and biotic interactions. We analyzed the effects of forest fragment size and habitat type (forest edge x interior) on the amount of plant resources and their quality for herbivores, leaf morphology, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and herbivory on Quercus deserticola at the Cuitzeo Basin in Mexico. Six forest fragments, where Q. deserticola occurs were classified as (i) small (<= 10 ha); (ii) medium (>= 25 ha); and (iii) large (>= 65 ha). In each forest fragment, four parallel transects of 5 x 50 m were sampled, two located at the edge and two in the interior of the fragments. Chlorophyll content, leaf area, canopy cover and tree size were greater in small than in larger fragments. Leaves of individuals in small fragments and in forest edges were more elongated and wider than in large and in the interior of fragments. Our results also showed higher levels of FA and insect herbivory in the small fragments and forest edges. Insect herbivory was positively correlated with FA in small forest fragments, indicating that the mechanisms driving their interaction are scale-dependent and vary among habitat types according to fragment size. Our findings do not support the idea that the fluctuating asymmetry is a reliable biomarker to detect environmental stress in Q. deserticola in fragmented habitats, but FA may be a good biomarker of plant stress caused by the amount of herbivory damage.

AB Land use changes affect the abundance of plants, and even when plants are spared in agroecosystems, they are further impacted by management practices. Knowing how populations are impacted and the factors affecting them in the landscape is a major challenge in ecosystems under intense land use conversion, an even more important task when the plant is important for livelihoods. To understand how anthropogenic and environmental factors affect plant abundance and the population structure of Annona crassiflora, an important wild fruit tree of Cerrado, we evaluated populations in a gradient of anthropogenic and environmental conditions. Our sampling ranged from well-preserved sites, in natural areas, to highly disturbed pastures in the agroecosystems, covering an extensive area of the Cerrado biome. Results indicate that vegetation thinning and the presence of cattle negatively affect the abundance of small plants. High frequency of thinning and large cattle herds prevent recruitment of small plants in pastures, which may drive populations to local extinction in these sites. Reducing the frequency and intensity of vegetation thinning and cattle herd size may allow the recruitment of small plants into higher life stages. Fruit harvesting, which is positively associated with plant abundance, can continue to be practiced.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Due to increasing human transformation of virtually all habitats on Earth, setting global priorities for conservation is essential. The emerging disciplines of macroecology and macroevolution (MEE) can provide a global perspective and information for such prioritization but remain relatively separated from conservation prioritization, partly because MEE researchers are unaware of the requirements for effective conservation prioritization and existing approaches implementing these. Indeed, existing approaches for conservation prioritization at large scale are scattered across literature. Here, we systematically review this literature and provide a guideline for researchers in MEE as to which of approaches might be suitable for their needs. From >11 000 scientific publications, we identified 134 methods suitable for commonly used MEE data and geographic scale. Furthermore, we use a 'trait matrix' to identify families of similar approaches and to design a guideline to select the most suitable method, given a user-defined set of data and analysis scope. The guidelines are freely available via the conserveR R-package (<>). Finally, we used our review to identify increasing scalability, continuous monitoring and the integration of molecular, remote sensing and animal movement data as key areas for future impacts of MEE in conservation prioritization. We anticipate that our review can serve as a guide to MEE researchers interested in linking their data to conservation as well as for conservation scientists interested in using MEE approaches.

AB Coendou comprises the most speciose genus in Erethizontidae, with 15 currently recognized species. Although several taxonomic studies in the last two decades have unveiled part of its diversity, the most widespread Neotropical taxon Coendou prehensilis has received limited attention. Here, we combined morphological and molecular datasets to infer the phylogenetic relationships of the species in the genus and revise the taxonomy of the C. prehensilis complex. We found four morphotypes and three well-supported monophyletic clades within C. prehensilis. These three clades represent valid species: C. prehensilis (restricted to the north of the Atlantic Forest), C. baturitensis (occurring in the eastern Amazonian and montane forests enclaves in the Caatinga), and C. longicaudatus (two subspecies, C. l. longicaudatus from the Amazon and C. l. boliviensis from Cerrado and Chaco). Furthermore, we recovered three morphologically diagnosable clades within Coendou, for which we assigned subgeneric names. Coendou (Coendou) comprises six species (C. baturitensis, C. longicaudatus, C. mexicanus, C. prehensilis, C. quichua, and C. rufescens), Coendou (Sphiggurus) includes five taxa (C. bicolor, C. insidiosus, C. nycthemera, C. speratus, and C. spinosus), and the third subgenus we named Coendou (Caaporamys) subgen. nov, comprising C. melanurus (type species), C. vestitus, C. pruinosus, C. ichillus, and C. roosmalenorum.

AB Deforestation often results in landscapes where remaining forest habitat is highly fragmented, with remnants of different sizes embedded in an often highly contrasting matrix. Local extinction of species from individual fragments is common, but the demographic mechanisms underlying these extinctions are poorly understood. It is often hypothesized that altered environmental conditions in fragments drive declines in reproduction, recruitment, or survivorship. The Amazon basin, in addition to experiencing continuing fragmentation, is experiencing climate change-related increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts and unusually wet periods. Whether plant populations in tropical forest fragments are particularly susceptible to extremes in precipitation remains unclear. Most studies of plants in fragments are relatively short (1-6 years), focus on a single life-history stage, and often do not compare to populations in continuous forest. Even fewer studies consider delayed effects of climate on demographic vital rates despite the importance of delayed effects in studies that consider them. Using a decade of demographic and climate data from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the Central Amazon, we assess the effects of climate on populations of an understory herb (Heliconia acuminata, Heliconiaceae). We used distributed lag nonlinear models to understand the delayed effects of climate (measured as standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI) on survival, growth, and flowering. We detected delayed effects of climate up to 36 months. Extremes in SPEI in the previous year reduced survival, drought in the wet season 8-11 months prior to the February census increased growth, and drought two dry seasons prior increased flowering probability. Effects of extremes in precipitation on survival and growth were more pronounced in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. The complex delayed effects of climate and habitat fragmentation in our study point to the importance of long-term demography experiments in understanding the effects of anthropogenic change on plant populations.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the greatest threats to biodiversity since unsuitable habitat can be a significant barrier to gene flow, disrupting the connectivity of populations. In this scenario, landscape genetic approaches have been applied as invaluable tools to demonstrate how contemporary habitat alterations affect gene flow. In this study, we used nine microsatellite genotypes to determine the landscape features driving genetic diversity, structure, and functional connectivity among eleven sampling sites of a micro-endemic, and critically endangered salamander (Pseudoeurycea robertsi) in the Nevado de Toluca Volcano. We also modelled the ecological niche of P. robertsi to assess the most important habitat features associated with its probability of presence and analyzed the corridor network to identify important core areas and corridors to keep the network connected, as well as points where the network connection is lost or tightened. Moreover, we performed a redundancy analysis to assess the effect of genetic distance and habitat resistances on gene flow. We found the highest levels of genetic diversity and connectivity at the northwestern part of the Volcano. Meson Viejo sampling site was of especial importance to overall network connectivity. We found low levels of migration rates and low levels of genetic structure. The most important habitat feature associated with probability of presence of Pseudoeurycea robertsi was the Abies forest, and two models were significant under the RDA analysis: Abies forest and Abies forest+Grasslands. We recommend prioritizing the areas of the northwestern and central parts of the volcano in conservation programs. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB Forest cover change is having an enduring link with climatic factors. This study was designed to study the impact of forest cover change in the Western Ghats on meteorological parameters like rainfall and land surface temperature (LST) between 2000 and 2019 using Landsat images. Land use land cover (LULC) data were extracted from Landsat images, and rainfall data of 53 stations were obtained from tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data. Mann-Kendall trend test, a nonparametric test, was adopted to evaluate the long-run trends in rainfall for North East (NE) and South West (SW) monsoon during the selected time period. The test results indicate that 19 stations in the North of Kerala show a positive trend in SW monsoon and 3 stations show a negative trend in NE monsoon. The breakpoint analysis of the rainfall dataset with time and with the elevation from mean sea level (MSL) is performed and the results show a breakpoint in the rainfall for the year 2008 and at 47 m elevation (MSL) from the coast of the Arabian Sea. Forest cover data show that there is a loss of 12.65% in the region for two decades span and also a significant increase in minimum LST from 8.308 to 9.208 degrees C and increase in maximum LST from 41.51 to 46.29 degrees C during the selected time period. Forest cover loss could be an important factor responsible for the increase in LST. The research outcomes would help the policymakers in improvising the measures for land management policies including plantation and urbanization.

AB The exceptional levels of biodiversity found today in the American tropics are the outcome of tens of millions of years of evolution, shaped by the tumultuous geological history of the region, its heterogeneous habitats, climate change, ecological interactions and, in recent millennia, human influence. Although our understanding of diversity patterns and their underlying processes grows steadily in breadth and depth, Neotropical biodiversity is rapidly breaking down. Here, I contrast the long-term evolution of Neotropical biodiversity with its recent and rapid deterioration due to anthropogenic factors. I consider the impacts of the early arrival of humans to the region and the modern intensification of land-use change (primarily driven by agriculture) and other drivers of biodiversity loss, such as direct exploitation, invasive species and climate change. Together, these threats have led to 33% of all Neotropical species for which sufficient data are available being currently threatened with extinction. I outline emerging opportunities for conservation and restoration under the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and call for urgent action from the biodiversity community, for the benefit of people and nature.

AB Shifts in hydrological regimes alter river flow rates and flood pulses, decrease environmental heterogeneity and the floristic-structural complexity of associated plant communities. We tested the hypothesis that drought events affect plant community composition and structure at a small-scale within a riparian fragment towards a reduction in floristic-structural complexity. The tree community was sampled in three habitats (wet, transitional and dry) and monitored in seven inventories carried out between 1991 and 2018. Hydrological variations were evaluated through annual rainfalls, river flow rates and water level data. The species richness and the detrended correspondence analysis axes were used to characterise the temporal modifications in floristic composition. Community structure was described in terms of biomass: accumulated, growth of survivors, mortality and recruitment. Generalised linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate the effects of time and environment in community. It was concluded that the climate has become drier in recent years due to declining precipitation that has affected flow rates and water levels. The floristic-structural complexity of the study fragment was maintained during the monitoring period. However, prolonged and extreme drought events displayed the potential to impact floristic-structural patterns.

AB Understanding the population structure and movements of the invasive fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) is important as it can help mitigate crop damage, and highlight areas at risk of outbreaks or evolving insecticide resistance. Determining population structure in invasive FAW has been a challenge due to genetic mutations affecting the markers traditionally used for strain and haplotype identification; mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COIB) and the Z-chromosome-linked Triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi). Here, we compare the results from COIB and Tpi markers with highly variable repeat regions (microsatellites) to improve our understanding of FAW population structure in Africa. There was very limited genetic diversity using the COIB marker, whereas using the TpiI4 marker there was greater diversity that showed very little evidence of genetic structuring between FAW populations across Africa. There was greater genetic diversity identified using microsatellites, and this revealed a largely panmictic population of FAW alongside some evidence of genetic structuring between countries. It is hypothesised here that FAW are using long-distance flight and prevailing winds to frequently move throughout Africa leading to population mixing. These approaches combined provide important evidence that genetic mixing between invasive FAW populations may be more common than previously reported.

AB Context. Invasive species are major drivers of biodiversity loss, requiring management to reduce their ecological impacts. Population genetics can be applied to delineate management units, providing information that can help plan and improve control strategies. Aim. The present study aims to use a genetic approach to test the existence of three previously proposed sambar deer populations in south-eastern Australia. In doing so, the study aims to delineate management units of sambar deer in southeastern Australia. Methods. Sambar deer DNA was sourced opportunistically from tissue samples and targeted scat collection. Samples were collected from three areas in Victoria, south-eastern Australia: Mt Cole (MC), French Island (FI) and eastern Victoria (EV). Contemporary population structure was assessed using a suite of 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The number of maternal sambar deer lineages in south-eastern Australia was investigated through sequencing of the mitochondrial (mt)DNA control region. Key results. Three distinct genetic clusters were identified. Differentiation among inferred clusters was found to be high, with FST ranging from 0.24 between EV and FI clusters and 0.48 between MC and FI clusters. Two mtDNA haplotypes were identified; R.u1 was found throughout EV and FI, and R.u2 was unique to MC. DNA isolated from scats provided reliable data and proved critical for sampling areas where hunting and culling of deer are not generally undertaken. Conclusions. Three genetically distinct sambar deer management units in south-eastern Australia are defined - MC, FI and EV. Sambar deer control strategies should be applied to each management unit independently. This may be difficult or infeasible for the EV management unit, which is large and geographically complex. Further research may help identify additional fine-scale genetic structure in EV, allowing smaller, more practicable management units to be identified. Implications. Genetic data can be used to identify management units for invasive species, which will be critical for the development of future management strategies and improving control operations. The approach outlined here could also be applied to improve the management of other introduced deer species in south-eastern Australia.

AB The shell morphologies of the freshwater mussel species Pleurobema clava (federally endangered) and Pleurobema oviforme (species of concern) are similar, causing considerable taxonomic confusion between the two species over the last 100 years. While P. clava was historically widespread throughout the Ohio River basin and tributaries to the lower Laurentian Great Lakes, P. oviforme was confined to the Tennessee and the upper Cumberland River basins. We used two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes, 13 novel nuclear DNA microsatellite markers, and shell morphometrics to help resolve this taxonomic confusion. Evidence for a single species was apparent in phylogenetic analyses of each mtDNA gene, revealing monophyletic relationships with minimal differentiation and shared haplotypes. Analyses of microsatellites showed significant genetic structuring, with four main genetic clusters detected, respectively, in the upper Ohio River basin, the lower Ohio River and Great Lakes, and upper Tennessee River basin, and a fourth genetic cluster, which included geographically intermediate populations in the Ohio and Tennessee river basins. While principal components analysis (PCA) of morphometric variables (i.e., length, height, width, and weight) showed significant differences in shell shape, only 3% of the variance in shell shape was explained by nominal species. Using Linear Discriminant and Random Forest (RF) analyses, correct classification rates for the two species' shell forms were 65.5% and 83.2%, respectively. Random Forest classification rates for some populations were higher; for example, for North Fork Holston (HOLS), it was >90%. While nuclear DNA and shell morphology indicate that the HOLS population is strongly differentiated, perhaps indicative of cryptic biodiversity, we consider the presence of a single widespread species the most likely biological scenario for many of the investigated populations based on our mtDNA dataset. However, additional sampling of P. oviforme populations at nuclear loci is needed to corroborate this finding.

AB Background In parasitism arm race processes and red queen dynamics between host and parasites reciprocally mold many aspects of their genetics and evolution. We performed a parallel assessment of population genetics and demography of two species of pinworms with different degrees of host specificity (Trypanoxyuris multilabiatus, species-specific; and T. minutus, genus-specific) and their host, the mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata), based on mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite loci (these only for the host). Given that pinworms and primates have a close co-evolutionary history, covariation in several genetic aspects of their populations is expected. Results Mitochondrial DNA revealed two genetic clusters (West and East) in both pinworm species and howler monkeys, although population structure and genetic differentiation were stronger in the host, while genetic diversity was higher in pinworms than howler populations. Co-divergence tests showed no congruence between host and parasite phylogenies; nonetheless, a significant correlation was found between both pinworms and A. palliata genetic pairwise distances suggesting that the parasites' gene flow is mediated by the host dispersal. Moreover, the parasite most infective and the host most susceptible haplotypes were also the most frequent, whereas the less divergent haplotypes tended to be either more infective (for pinworms) or more susceptible (for howlers). Finally, a positive correlation was found between pairwise p-distance of host haplotypes and that of their associated pinworm haplotypes. Conclusion The genetic configuration of pinworm populations appears to be molded by their own demography and life history traits in conjunction with the biology and evolutionary history of their hosts, including host genetic variation, social interactions, dispersal and biogeography. Similarity in patterns of genetic structure, differentiation and diversity is higher between howler monkeys and T. multilabiatus in comparison with T. minutus, highlighting the role of host-specificity in coevolving processes. Trypanoxyuris minutus exhibits genetic specificity towards the most frequent host haplotype as well as geographic specificity. Results suggest signals of potential local adaptation in pinworms and further support the notion of correlated evolution between pinworms and their primate hosts.

AB The phantom vampire, Vampyrum spectrum (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae), is the largest South American flying mammal classified as threatened by the IUCN. Despite the broad distribution of this species across South America, its low population density and the spatial isolation of its populations may compromise its response to the expected climate change. Using species distribution models, we increased our knowledge of the historical, current, and future spatial distribution patterns of this species. Considering past [last glacial maximum (LGM) and middle Holocene], current, and future climatic scenarios for the South American extent, we used MaxEnt, random forest (RF), and support vector machine methods to model the distribution of V. spectrum over time and identify/quantify climatically stable areas. We observed that our models achieved good performances for all algorithms, especially for RF. The spatial distribution patterns obtained from the models made it possible to identify areas where V. spectrum was more stable over time. From the LGM to the current and future scenarios, the overall balance is the loss of areas in the species distribution range. By using multitemporal analyses, we may be able to identify repeated historical patterns where some conservation areas may be effective in the future if the spatial patterns of distribution are similar to past distributions. Our work contributes to increasing the knowledge of the spatial distribution of the species, providing support for practical management and conservation plans while also showing the importance of predicting historical spatial patterns and considering their spatial trends.

AB Frequent anthropogenic activities in urban regions may result in fragmentation, sequentially forming a variety of forest edges. The contrasting habitats (forest interior vs. edge) may differ in foster pollinator and plant diversity, but little is known about the influence of urban forest fragmentation on pollinator-plant interactions. Six patches of a local bee-pollinated herb, Ajuga decumbens (Labiatae) were used to detect the edge effect. The patches from both the forest edge (three patches) and interior (the other three patches) habitats were close to reduce the differences in pollinator fauna, in an urban fragmented forest in Wuhan city, China. We investigated the pollinator species richness and abundance as well as the reproductive success of the plant across the forest edge and interior habitats. Results revealed that the pollinator assemblage and fruit set of the plant differed between the forest edge and interior habitats, plants from the forest edge had higher pollinator abundance and yielded more fruits than those from the forest interior. Although the patches were close enough for the pollinating bees to fly over, forest edges resulting from fragmentation intensely changed the pollinator assemblage of the local herb. Where the fragmentation of urban forest is unavoidable, our results indicated that the forest edge should be a friendly urban matrix for the local herb and its bee pollinators. Thus, anthropogenic actions e.g. road hardening and introduction of ornamental flowers should be avoided in areas where the forest edges have already been generated by urban construction.

AB The purpose of the study is to assess the ability of three different grain legume species to facilitate phosphorus (P) uptake by intercropped wheat and to evaluate the differences in root exudation and phosphatase activity that each grain legume species can induce in the soil. In a pot experiment under controlled climatic conditions, lupin, pea, and faba bean intercropped with durum wheat and respective sole crops were grown at high and low phosphorus availability. At the flowering time of each grain legume, intercrop and sole crops were sampled. Intercropping favored wheat P uptake more at low P availability than at high P availability. Compared to the sole crop, wheat P uptake was greater in intercropping with pea both without and with the addition of phosphorus and with lupin when phosphorus was not added. Phosphatase activity, which was generally high, was highest in soil with lupin and faba bean sole crops. In the rhizosphere of faba bean, the highest total carboxylate concentration was also measured, followed by pea and lupin. Root exudation was favored by P supply, showing greater values in intercropped wheat than in the respective sole crops. P uptake by wheat was not directly linked to greater root exudation in the tested intercropping systems. Even if root exudation and available phosphorus were generally greater with legumes both in sole crop and in intercropping, other interactions such as complementarity and competition were involved, hiding potential facilitation exerted by faba bean and bringing out the benefits from the wheat/pea combination.

AB Purpose The tropical phosphorus cycle and its relation to soil phosphorus (P) availability are a major uncertainty in projections of forest productivity. In highly weathered soils with low P concentrations, plant and microbial communities depend on abiotic and biotic processes to acquire P. We explored the seasonality and relative importance of drivers controlling the fluctuation of common P pools via processes such as litter production and decomposition, and soil phosphatase activity. Methods We analyzed intra-annual variation of tropical soil phosphorus pools using a modified Hedley sequential fractionation scheme. In addition, we measured litterfall, the mobilization of P from litter and soil extracellular phosphatase enzyme activity and tested their relation to fluctuations in P- fractions. Results Our results showed clear patterns of seasonal variability of soil P fractions during the year. We found that modeled P released during litter decomposition was positively related to change in organic P fractions, while net change in organic P fractions was negatively related to phosphatase activities in the top 5 cm. Conclusion We conclude that input of P by litter decomposition and potential soil extracellular phosphatase activity are the two main factors related to seasonal soil P fluctuations, and therefore the P economy in P impoverished soils. Organic soil P followed a clear seasonal pattern, indicating tight cycling of the nutrient, while reinforcing the importance of studying soil P as an integrated dynamic system in a tropical forest context.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat fragmentation, edge effects, biological invasions, and selective logging, can affect abiotic conditions and biotic interactions that influence the likelihood of seed germination, an important bottleneck for plant regeneration. However, there is no research synthesis evaluating the impact of those disturbances on germination. We performed a global meta-analysis comparing seed germination on disturbed and undisturbed sites. We evaluated the influence of disturbance type, vegetation, plant growth form, dispersal syndrome, seed mass, climate region and phylogeny on germination responses to disturbance. We obtained information about 74 plant species from 25 studies. We found an overall negative effect of anthropogenic disturbance on seed germination. Biological invasion and habitat fragmentation presented a negative impact, whilst edge effects, selective logging and grazing had no consistent effect on seed germination. Anthropogenic disturbances decreased germination of forest species, but plants from open physiognomies (savannas, shrublands and grasslands) were not consistently affected. Disturbed conditions decreased germination of understory forest herbs and shrubs from open physiognomies. Germination of abiotic-dispersed plants was decreased in disturbed areas, whilst there was no consistent effect on biotic-dispersed ones. Seed mass had no effect on species responses, but the interactions between seed mass and growth form and dispersal syndrome affected germination responses. Species responses did not differ between tropical and temperate regions. Phylogenetic relationships among species did not drive the results. Anthropogenic disturbances generally decrease seed germination, and non-trees, small-seeded and abiotic dispersed plants are the most affected. Therefore, conservation practices or restoration efforts focusing on early recruitment, such as direct sowing of seeds, should pay special attention to decreases in seed germination due to habitat alterations following disturbances. Amelioration of disturbed conditions, such as control of invasive species, should be considered to maintain germination rates and plant regeneration in long-term.

AB Studies in the area of functional ecology not only aid in our understanding of the dynamics and structure of communities, but also help elucidate the mechanistic consequences of habitat changes and their implications for species conservation, the nature of biological interactions and the provision of ecosystem services. However, trait selection and measurement are usually not standardized between studies, even for groups that have been widely studied, such as the Drosophilidae (Diptera). In order to suggest a standardized framework for trait selection and measurement for the Drosophilidae, here we reviewed the literature published between September 2018 and June 2021. The review returned 52 relevant papers, and based on the traits presented, we organized three categories of functional traits which we suggest need to be analyzed in order to understand functional pattern of the Drosophilidae: habitat perception, flight performance, and ecophysiological responses. Habitat perception includes those traits that provide the ability to recognize an environment and access its available resources. Flight performance includes those traits related to flight and mobility, while ecophysiological responses include those traits related to energy allocation, survival, and reproductive efficiency. Based on these categories, we projected the expected results for a broad application of the traits we selected in studies with Drosophilidae in natural environments, for example, using the functional approach for a comprehensive diagnosis of the relationship between Drosophilidae and their environments. We encourage a wide use of our framework for both basic and applied studies of Drosophilidae, particularly for those that seek to test hypotheses regarding community structure.

AB A diversity of phenological strategies has been reported for tropical tree species. Defoliation and seasonal dormancy of cambial activity inform us on how trees cope with water stress during the dry season, or maximize the use of resources during the rainy season. Here, we study the matching between leaf phenology (unfolding and shedding) and cambial activity for Prioria balsamifera, a key timber species in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In particular, we (i) evaluated the seasonality of cambial activity and synchrony of phenology among trees in response to climate and (ii) identified the seasonality of leaf phenology and its relation with cambial phenology. The study was conducted in the Luki Man and Biosphere Reserve, located in the Mayombe forest at the southern margin of the Congo Basin. Historic defoliation data were collected every ten days using weekly crown observations whereas recent observations involved time-lapse cameras. Cambial pinning was performed on ten trees during 20 months and radius dendrometers were installed on three trees during 13 months. Tree rings were measured on cores from 13 trees and growth synchrony was evaluated. We found that P. balsamifera defoliates annually with a peak observed at the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season. The new leaves unfolded shortly after shedding of the old leaves. The peak defoliation dates varied across years from September 12 to November 14 and the fraction of number of trees that defoliated at a given time was found to be negatively correlated with annual rainfall and temperature; during the dry season, when precipitation and temperatures are the lowest. Wood formation (radial growth), was found to be highly seasonal, with cambial dormancy occurring during the dry season and growth starting at the beginning of the rainy season. Individual ring-width series did not cross date well. The within species variability of leaf phenology and cambial rhythms provides indication about resistance of the population against climatic changes.</p>

AB Husk tomato is an annual vegetable crop grown for its fruits in Mexico, where it grows as weedy and wild. Eight races are recognized from wild (Wild and Milpero) and cultivated (Arandas, Manzano, Puebla, Rendidora, Salamanca, and Tamazula) conditions based on morphological and ecological traits. However, few studies have addressed the genetic diversity and divergence of all races. We aimed to (i) assess the genetic diversity and structure of 10 cultivars representing the recognized races of husk tomato and (ii) compare the genetic diversity of the cultivated and wild pools. We identified 270 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 40 samples using multiplex ISSR genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq). The results showed lower to moderate diversity in each cultivar (H-E = 0.082-0.147) and lower to moderate pairwise genetic differentiation (F-ST = - 0.011 to 0.195) between cultivars. The Bayesian clustering analysis identified three genetic groups (K = 3) with ancestry coefficients (Q = 0.6-0.89) that suggest gene flow among cultivars. Ordination and classification analysis based on genetic distances revealed two main genetic clusters related to fruit traits and geographic regions where cultivars are commercialized, while a third group included the Wild and Milpero. Analysis of molecular variance revealed higher variation within cultivars (80%) than among cultivars (18%). The cultivated pool harbors 96% of the diversity present in the wild (H-t = 0.322 vs. H-t = 0.311) and does not show severe genetic bottlenecks related to the domestication process. Our results suggest that husk tomato domestication, like other Mesoamerican crops, might be diffuse rather than from a single geographic origin.

AB In the past decade, a large volume of peer-reviewed papers has examined the potential impacts of oil and gas resource extraction in the Canadian oil sands (OS). A large proportion focuses on terrestrial biology: wildlife, birds, and vegetation. We provide a qualitative synthesis of the condition of the environment in the oil sands region (OSR) from 2009 to 2020 to identify gaps and progress cumulative effects assessments. Our objectives were to (1) qualitatively synthesize and critically review knowledge from the OSR; (2) identify consistent trends and generalizable conclusions; and (3) pinpoint gaps in need of greater monitoring or research effort. We visualize knowledge and terrestrial monitoring foci by allocating papers to a conceptual model for the OS. Despite a recent increase in publications, focus has remained concentrated on a few key stressors, especially landscape disturbance, and a few taxa of interest. Stressor and response monitoring is well represented, but direct monitoring of pathways (linkages between stressors and responses) is limited. Important knowledge gaps include understanding effects at multiple spatial scales, mammal health effects monitoring, focused monitoring of local resources important to Indigenous communities, and geospatial coverage and availability, including higher attribute resolution in human footprint, comprehensive land cover mapping, and up-to-date LiDAR coverage. Causal attribution based on spatial proximity to operations or spatial orientation of monitoring in the region is common but may be limited in the strength of inference that it provides.

AB The spider crabs Willinachoides santanai n. gen. n. sp. from the early-middle Miocene of north Brazil and Paradasygyius rodriguezi n. sp. from the late Miocene of Venezuela are described and illustrated. Additionally, Eoinachoides senni Van Straelen, 1933, from the late Oligocene-early Miocene of Venezuela, is redescribed based on photographs of the holotype, and the diagnosis of Eoinachoides latispinosus Carriol, Muizon, and Secretan, 1987, from the late Miocene of Peru, is emended also on the basis of photographs of the holotype. The past distribution points to a Tethyan background for the current amphi-American Inachoididae, with the oldest fossil species known from the early Eocene Tethyan regions (Pakistan and Italy), and from the late Eocene-late Pliocene of the Americas. The high number of mono-typic genera in Inachoididae could be the result of rapid dispersion followed by diversification during the Neogene of the tropical America, facilitated by global and regional events (e.g., eustatic sea level changes, the Mi-1 Oligocene-Miocene boundary global cooling, the global warming period of the Middle Miocene Climate maximum, closure of the Panama Isthmus, and marine incursions into the Amazon Basin). The shoaling and final closure of the Central American Seaway are thought to have critically affected the evolution of the inachoidids and shaped their current distribution patterns.

AB The occasional westward transport of warm water of the Agulhas Current, "Agulhas leakage", around southern Africa has been suggested to facilitate tropical marine connectivity between the Atlantic and Indian oceans, but the "Agulhas leakage" hypothesis does not explain the signatures of eastward gene flow observed in many tropical marine fauna. We investigated an alternative hypothesis: the establishment of a warm-water corridor during comparatively warm interglacial periods. The "warm-water corridor" hypothesis was investigated by studying the population genomic structure of Atlantic and Southwest Indian Ocean green turtles (N = 27) using 12,035 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained via ddRAD sequencing. Model-based and multivariate clustering suggested a hierarchical population structure with two main Atlantic and Southwest Indian Ocean clusters, and a Caribbean and East Atlantic sub-cluster nested within the Atlantic cluster. Coalescent-based model selection supported a model where Southwest Indian Ocean and Caribbean populations diverged from the East Atlantic population during the transition from the last interglacial period (130-115 thousand years ago; kya) to the last glacial period (115-90 kya). The onset of the last glaciation appeared to isolate Atlantic and Southwest Indian Ocean green turtles into three refugia, which subsequently came into secondary contact in the Caribbean and Southwest Indian Ocean when global temperatures increased after the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings support the establishment of a warm-water corridor facilitating tropical marine connectivity between the Atlantic and Southwest Indian Ocean during warm interglacials.

AB In this study, we investigate the main ecological interactions between fouling aquatic organisms (both invasive and native) present in the reservoir of the Governador Jose Richa hydroelectric plant, located in southern Brazil, and to identify the most suitable period for the interruption of machinery operation for cleaning and maintenance of the hydraulic systems of this plant. A total of 32 experimental plates were fixed to a metallic structure positioned close to the plant's water intake. Three species of invasive fouling were identified in our samples (Limnoperna fortunei [Mollusca], Cordylophora sp., and Hydra sp. [Cnidaria]) and six native taxa belonging to the phyla Protozoa, Ciliophora, Amoebozoa, and Arthropoda. Spring and summer were the seasons with the highest fouling rates, as well as densities of fouling organisms. The highest levels of diversity were recorded during the colder seasons. Several interactions between the organisms were identified, such as mutualism, commensalism, competition, epibiosis, cannibalism, and predation. The data obtained suggest that, from the biological point of view, the most suitable period for machine shutdown destined for the removal of biological fouling in the hydraulic systems of the studied plant is between the end of spring and the beginning of summer.

AB Studies on oceanic island biodiversity have been the foundation for much theoretical work. However, seamounts are mostly underexplored, and little information is available about their potential as stepping stones for oceanic dispersal and their role in diversification. Here we used a genetic approach to test different models of marine dispersal between the continental coast and a volcanic ridge composed of seamounts and oceanic islands. We observed that the stepping stone model best fits our results, with one reef fish species displaying ongoing gene flow and another showing endemic lineages restricted to the islands and most isolated seamounts. The data also suggest that connectivity among remote regions could be influenced by Pleistocene sea level fluctuations and that a widespread genetic lineage was originated from an island endemic. Recent findings on island endemic species showed a similar pattern of both origin and export of genetic lineages, indicating that this process occurred multiple times in the Pleistocene. This study highlights the role of seamounts in supporting subpopulations that, in turn, allow island colonization, diversification, and a biodiversity feedback process that nourishes source populations with evolutionary novelty from peripheral regions.

AB Seaports are introduction hotspots for invasive alien species (IAS). This is especially true for rodents, which have accompanied humans around the globe since the earliest days of ocean-going voyages. The rapid spread of IAS soon after arrival in a new environment is facilitated by further human-mediated transport or landscape features, like roads. By measuring genetic diversity and structure to investigate dispersal pathways, we gained insight into the transport, spread and establishment stages of a biological invasion, leveraging the most common rodent species (R. norvegicus) in this setting. We characterized the genetic structure of three Norway rat populations along a busy industrial road used by trucks to access the Port area in Paranagua city (Brazil). A total of 71 rats were genotyped using 11 microsatellite markers. The results revealed a pattern of gene flow contrary to the expected stepping-stone model along the linear transect, with the two furthest apart populations being clustered together. We hypothesize that the observed outcome is explained by natural dispersal along the corridor being lower than human-mediated transport. The sampled area furthest from the port is a gas station frequented by trucks which are considered the most likely mode of transportation. In terms of management strategies, we suggest more emphasis should be put on cargo surveillance to lower the risk of Norway rat dispersal, not only for biosecurity, but also for sanitary reasons, as this port is a major grain trading point.

AB The European Union aims to increase the extent of strictly protected areas, including wilderness areas. However, operationalizing this goal in densely populated Central European member states like Germany, that consists almost entirely of cultural landscapes and will need to rely largely on secondary wilderness areas, is challenging. Anthropogenic influence should be minimized in wilderness areas to support species that depend on undisturbed ecosystems shaped by natural processes. Based on a literature review, we developed a set of criteria to assess the spatial and legal suitability of potential wilderness areas, evaluate their ecological condition and measure the magnitude of human impact. We used available datasets to apply those criteria to a potential wilderness area (PWA), the National Natural Heritage Site Rechlin. From the 20 criteria identified, 12 could be assessed using available datasets, including fragmentation, connectivity, naturalness, habitat continuity and anthropogenic pollution. The PWA Rechlin comprises an area of 1349 ha that is traversed by 9 km of major public roads and waterways; and further fragmented by 81 km of unpaved forest paths. Most of the area is forest (89%), dominated by plantations of the allochthonous species Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies (84%). The majority of forest stands are in the establishment (45%) and early optimum stage (41%). Emissions of nitrogen and phosphorous have caused the eutrophication of two lakes within the candidate site and may affect the potential for natural regeneration of Asperulo-Fagetum forest. Although the NNHS Rechlin does not comply fully with fragmentation and naturalness criteria, the site could be considered for a future wilderness area, especially given the limited availability of other suitable sites in Germany.

AB Exotic plant species often negatively affect native herbivores due to the lack of palatability of the invading plant. Although often unsuitable as food, certain invasive species may provide non-nutritional ecological benefits through increased habitat structural complexity. To understand the potential for common invasive forest plant species of the eastern United States to benefit invertebrate communities, we examined the functional and taxonomic community composition of forest insects and spiders in long-term monitoring plots that contained invasive plant species. The extent of invasive plant species ground cover significantly altered spider community composition as categorized by hunting guild. Areas with higher invasive herbaceous and grass cover contained a higher abundance of space web-weaving and hunting spiders, respectively. Spider species richness and total invertebrate abundance also increased with greater invasive grass cover. Still, these trends were driven by just two invasive plant species, garlic mustard and Japanese stiltgrass, both of which have previously been shown to provide structural benefits to native invertebrate taxa. While these two species may improve the structural component of understory forest habitat, many invertebrate groups were not significantly correlated with other prevalent invasive plants and one species, mock strawberry, negatively affected the abundance of certain insect taxa. Particularly in forests with reduced native plant structure, invasive plant management must be conducted with consideration for holistic habitat quality, including both plant palatability and structure.

AB Urban sprawl is one of the most common landscape alterations occurring worldwide, and there is a growing list of species that are recognised to have adapted to urban life. To be successful, processes of urban colonization by wildlife require a broad spectrum of phenotypic (e.g., behavioural or physiological) adjustments, but evidence for genetic adaptations is much scarcer. One hypothesis proposes that different pathogen-driven selective pressures between urban and non-urban landscapes leads to adaptations in host immune genes. Here, we examined urbanization-related differentiation at the key pathogen-recognition genes of vertebrate adaptive immunity-the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-in a common waterbird, the Eurasian coot (Fulica atra). Samples were collected from an old urban population (established before the 1950s), a new urban population (established in the 2000s), and two rural populations from central Poland. We found strong significant divergence (as measured with Jost's D) at the MHC class II between the old urban population and the remaining (new urban and rural) populations. Also, there was a moderate, but significant divergence at the MHC between the new urban population and two rural populations, while no divergence was found between the two rural populations. The total number of MHC alleles and the number of private (population-specific) MHC alleles was lower in old urban populations, as compared to the rural ones. These patterns of differentiation at the MHC were not consistent with patterns found for neutral genetic markers (microsatellites), which showed few differences between the populations. Our results indicate that MHC allele composition depended on the level of anthropogenic disturbance and the time which passed since urban colonization, possibly due to the processes of genotype sorting and local adaptation. As such, our study contributes to the understanding of genetic mechanisms associated with urbanization processes in wildlife.

AB Light availability is a crucial resource determining seedling survival, establishment, and growth. Competition for light is asymmetric, giving the taller individuals a competitive advantage for obtaining light resources. Species-specific traits, e.g., shade tolerance, rooting depth, and leaf morphology, determine their strategical growth response under limited resource availability and different competitive interactions. We established a controlled pot experiment using European beech, Norway spruce, and Douglas fir seedlings and applying three different light availability levels-10%, 20%, and 50%. The experiment's main aim was to better understand the effects of light availability and competition type on the growth, growth allocation, and biomass production of recently planted seedlings. We planted four seedlings per pot in either monocultures or mixtures of two species. Relative height and diameter growth and aboveground woody biomass of seedlings increased with increasing light availability. All seedlings allocated more growth to height than diameter with decreasing light availability. Seedlings that reached on average greater height in the previous year allocated less growth to height in the following year. Additionally, there were general differences in growth allocation to the height between gymnosperms and angiosperms, but we did not find an effect of the competitor's identity. Our mixture effect analysis trends suggested that mixtures of functionally dissimilar species are more likely to produce higher biomass than mixtures of more similar species such as the two studied conifers. This finding points towards increased productivity through complementarity.

AB Although many studies have shown that species richness increases from high to low latitudes (the latitudinal diversity gradient), the mechanisms responsible for generating and maintaining higher species richness in the tropics remain intensely debated. Here we investigate how the effects of temperature on speciation rates (kinetic effects) and the effects of productivity on community size (chemical effects) explain the latitudinal diversity gradient of South American small mammals. We implemented Bayesian models that integrate processes from the neutral and metabolic theories, comparing model predictions with empirical richness patterns. The neutral-metabolic model predicted the latitudinal richness gradient in South American small mammals. We found evidence that the effects of productivity on community size are more important for explaining differences in species richness than the effects of temperature on speciation rates. These results suggest that differences in species richness along latitudinal gradients are regulated primarily by the chemical effects of productivity on speciation-extinction dynamics.

AB Senecio vulgaris L., an annual herb belonging to the Asteraceae, is widely distributed in different regions of the world. There is no information on the intraspecific variations of the morphological and molecular features of this species. In the present investigation, we studied the morphological and genetic diversity of 81 accessions of S. vulgaris collected from 10 geographical populations. Eleven inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers were used for the ex-amination of genetic variations among the populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and GST analyses revealed significant differences among the investigated populations. A significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance was revealed by the Mantel test. However, reticulation analysis indicated the occurrence of gene flow among most of the populations studied. Principal component analysis (PCA) plot showed that the number of capitula, length of the cauline leaf and plant height were the most variable morphological characters. Principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) plot revealed two groups of populations, according to molecular and morphological data. The results suggested the existence of possible intraspecific taxonomic ranks within this species.

AB Tropical montane landscapes harbor diverse flora and fauna, and many species there are ecological specialists with narrow elevational distributions, limited geographic ranges, and small global populations. Along elevational gradients, environmental conditions and community composition change dramatically over small spatial scales. As forests are disturbed and edges formed with modified habitat, natural communities could be affected differently across elevations by the many physical and biotic changes at edges. We asked whether forest edges produced altered patterns of avian species composition along a cloud forest - dry forest gradient on the Pacific slope of the Tilar ' an mountains in Monteverde, Costa Rica. A strong moisture gradient produces cloud forests near the ridgetops, with a concentration of species endemic to the Costa Rica - Panama highlands that are habitat specialists. We conducted 552 point counts across 110 locations from 1100 to 1800 m elevation, yielding 6586 detections of 115 species in 10 km2 of montane forest. We analyzed differences in species composition and single-species abundances between interior and near-edge forest habitats for species grouped by geographic range size. Species composition changed markedly from forest edge to interior in cloud forest habitats, but not in drier forests downslope. Endemic species, especially in cloud forest, were detected less frequently in mature forest near edges than in mature forest interior, and this difference was more pronounced than for cosmopolitan species. On tropical mountainsides, we can expect habitatspecialist endemic species to be more sensitive to further habitat modification. This sensitivity could limit the resilience of tropical bird communities.

AB A panel of 15 microsatellite loci was used to study the modern structure of the sable gene pool in the southern part of the range. A high level of population differentiation was determined. The existence of several population clusters of the sable was revealed on the vast territory from Western Siberia to Transbaikalia. This part of the species range is distinguished by a high number of sables; another peculiarity is that the territories allowed for hunting alternate with a significant number of reserve territories. The abilities to identify individuals by population and regional affiliations were determined. In the study, the reliability of the prediction of population belonging (SCOR coefficient) of individuals to the pooled sample was estimated; the estimate showed that the accuracy (the number of correctly identified individuals) and reliability of identification significantly increases on average for each individual with an increase in the number of loci from 8 to 15. The results of the study complement the reference database of genetic data of populations of geographic regions of the species and make it possible to solve a number of problems associated with hunting on the territories bordering the nature reserves, which contributes to the preservation of intraspecific diversity of the sable.

AB Although soil phosphorus is essential for vegetation growth it is not always found in labile forms, hampering its absorption by plants, and is limited in forest ecosystems. This study explores soil P state and availability in calcareous soils, determining which processes affect its different pools and which soil parameters influence forest productivity of a Mediterranean pine species. We used a sequential fractionation method to determine P fractions in the soil according to their lability and their organic or inorganic nature. Those fractions were related to different soil and climatic parameters and to the site index in 32 Pinus halepensis plots of the National Spanish Forest Inventory. Soil texture, carbonates content, water retention capacity and organic matter substantially affected P fractions in the calcareous soils studied. Membrane extractable P was mainly influenced by organic matter-related parameters while the predominant P fraction in these soils, the primary P, was linked to the carbonates content. The biological mineralization processes played a key role in the soil P cycle. Total P, carbonates content, soil texture and water availability drove forest productivity in the studied plots.

AB Although historical records of introductions that trigger successful biological invasions are common, subsequent patterns of dispersal and colonisation mutes are unclear. We use microsatellites to examine genetic population structuring of established invasive brown trout (Sabno trutta) populations in Newfoundland, Canada for evidence of "natural" dispersal, human-mediated introductions, and colonisation routes. We also explored ancestry of contemporary populations relative to presumed progenitors. Results analysed using STRUCTURE, DAPC, a NJ tree and F-ST comparisons support records of historical introductions; current Newfoundland populations are largely descended from Scottish stock, with St. John's the primary introduction site. Subsequent dispersal of these trout was facilitated principally by anadromy, largely consistent with a classic stepping-stone model, with significant isolation-by-distance. With one exception, dispersal along the north and south coasts of the Avalon peninsula appears to be natural and independent, involving stochastic processes resulting in unique outcomes for population composition. This study is a good example of dispersal patterns during a contemporary invasion underscoring the potential for non-anadromous founders to re-express anadromy, facilitating colonization of distant sites.

AB Quality of the riparian zones, diversity, and structure of the woody vegetation were evaluated in 13 sections of the Margaritas River in Chiapas, Mexico, based on vegetation cover type. Riparian Quality Index (RQI) scores and woody species composition were compared in 3 vegetation cover types surrounding the riparian zones: sub-deciduous tropical forest (S), secondary tree vegetation (VSA), and without tree cover (SCA). RQI scores were different among the 3 vegetation cover types; was greater in the sections with S, followed by the VSA and the SCA. A total of 1,099 individuals from 34 families, 71 genera and 90 species were registered. Alpha diversity was higher in S sections while beta diversity was not modified by coverage types. It was shown that the type of coverage adjacent to the riverbank influences its quality and modifies attributes of the woody riverside vegetation, such as the richness and composition of species and stem density. Other variables such as distance to agricultural areas, altitude, slope and temperature influenced the variation detected in the vegetation between the 3 cover types. This study is relevant for the development of strategies that contribute to the restoration and conservation of riparian vegetation in Mexico.

AB Understanding reproductive traits of invasive species and their modulation by different invaded habitats is crucial for monitoring invasive processes. The invasive ecosystem engineers (IEE) affect their habitat structure, generating cascading effects that may modulate their own or other species' reproductive traits. In this study, we aim to evaluate the reproductive activity of a nonindigenous species (NIS), the amphipod Melita palmata, in a SW Atlantic coastal lagoon whose habitat structure has been modified by the IEE (reef builder) Ficopomatus enigmaticus. Experiments showed that: (1) the frequency of M. palmata mate pairings (reproductive rate) is higher in reefs built by the IEE than in the facies formed by sediment and valves in reef-free areas (namely sediment); (2) the ratio of mate pairings relative to receptive available females (mate access ratio) is higher in sediment; (3) higher density of M. palmata increases its reproductive rate in both habitats, and (4) lower M. palmata density and reduced habitat structure enhance the mate access ratio. Results suggest that M. palmata reproduction is either density- or habitat-dependent at higher or lower population densities, respectively. This reproductive plasticity might contribute to the permanence of NIS in new systems, the recognition of new habitats, and counteract potential reproductive isolation.

AB Generating genomic data for 19 tropical reef fish species of the Western Indian Ocean, we investigate how species ecology influences genetic diversity patterns from local to regional scales. We distinguish between the alpha, beta and gamma components of genetic diversity, which we subsequently link to six ecological traits. We find that the alpha and gamma components of genetic diversity are strongly correlated so that species with a high total regional genetic diversity display systematically high local diversity. The alpha and gamma diversity components are negatively associated with species abundance recorded using underwater visual surveys and positively associated with body size. Pelagic larval duration is found to be negatively related to genetic beta diversity supporting its role as a dispersal trait in marine fishes. Deviation from the neutral theory of molecular evolution motivates further effort to understand the processes shaping genetic diversity and ultimately the diversification of the exceptional diversity of tropical reef fishes.

AB Habitat fragmentation is a leading cause of biodiversity and ecosystem function loss in the Anthropocene. Despite the importance of plant-microbiome interactions to ecosystem productivity, we have limited knowledge of how fragmentation affects microbiomes and even less knowledge of its consequences for microbial interactions with plants. Combining field surveys, microbiome sequencing, manipulative experiments, and random forest models, we investigated fragmentation legacy effects on soil microbiomes in imperiled pine rocklands, tested how compositional shifts across 14 fragmentation-altered soil microbiomes affected performance and resource allocation of three native plant species, and identified fragmentation-responding microbial families underpinning plant performance. Legacies of habitat fragmentation were associated with significant changes in microbial diversity and composition (across three of four community axes). Experiments showed plants often strongly benefited from the microbiome's presence, but fragmentation-associated changes in microbiome composition also significantly affected plant performance and resource allocation across all seven metrics examined. Finally, random forest models identified ten fungal and six bacterial families important for plant performance that changed significantly with fragmentation. Our findings not only support the existence of significant fragmentation effects on natural microbiomes, but also demonstrate for the first time that fragmentation-associated changes in microbiomes can have meaningful consequences for native plant performance and investment.

AB Marine species that are widely distributed in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) has served as a model for studying biogeographic patterns resulting from the effects of intraregional habitat discontinuities and oceanographic processes on the diversification and evolution of cryptobenthic reef fishes. Tomicodon petersii, a clingfish (Gobiesocidae) endemic to the TEP, is found on very shallow rocky reefs from central Mexico to northern Peru, and in the Cocos and Galapagos islands. We evaluated the effect of likely biogeographic barriers in different parts of the TEP on the diversification process of this species. We used one mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA markers from 112 individuals collected across the distribution range of T. petersii. Our phylogenetic results showed the samples constituted a monophyletic group, with three well-supported, allopatric subgroups: in the Mexican province, the Panamic province (from El Salvador to Ecuador), and the Galapagos Islands. The split between the Mexican and more southerly clades was estimated to occur at the end of the Miocene ca. 5.74 Mya, and the subsequent cladogenetic event separating the Galapagos population from the Panamic population at the junction of the Pliocene and Pleistocene, ca. 2.85 Mya. The species tree, Bayesian species delimitation tests (BPP), STACEY, and substantial genetic distances separating these three populations indicate that these three independent evolutionary units likely include two unnamed species. The cladogenetic events that promoted the formation of those genetically differentiated groups are consistent with disruptive effects on gene flow of habitat discontinuities and oceanographic processes along the mainland shoreline in the TEP and of ocean-island isolation, in conjunction with the species intrinsic life-history characteristics.

AB Plant-plant interactions influence community assembly and species responses to environmental change. However, species interactions are complex phenomena influenced by context and scale. We conducted a one-year replacement experiment between two grasses in subtropical grasslands (native Axonopus fissifolius and non-native Paspalum notatum) in central Florida, USA. We evaluated interactions between these species at three ecological scales, 'pairwise interactions,' 'patch' (33 cm x 33 cm), and 'plot' (1 m x 3 m) and along a gradient (15 levels) of increasing non-native and decreasing native plot ground cover within enclosures in semi-native pastures. We transplanted 18 individuals of each species per plot (18 x 30 plots = 1080 plants in total) in a 2 x 2 design intersecting direct pairwise interactions (additional transplanted neighbor: absent/present) with recipient patch type (Axonopus fissifolius/Paspalum notatum). Leaf length, leaf number, and plant biomass were measured at the beginning and the end of the experiment along with soil nutrients and pH at patch level. Over 92% of the transplants survived. We observed an interactive effect between patch type (non-native vs. native dominated) and plant abundance at plot level on plant performance, suggesting that indirect effects at larger spatial scales can influence effects at smaller scales. Surprisingly, both species exhibited enhanced performance with increasing abundance of the non-native species at plot level. We discuss several mechanisms explaining these indirect effects including Paspalum notatum-induced changes in soil pH, soil feedbacks from the soil microbial community, preconditioning effects of the native species on the recipient soil, and positive density dependence effects after transplantation.

AB Understanding the main determinants of species coexistence across space and time is a central question in ecology. However, ecologists still know little about the scales and conditions at which biotic interactions matter and how these interact with the environment to structure species assemblages. Here we use recent theoretical developments to analyse plant distribution and trait data across Europe and find that plant height clustering is related to both evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity. This clustering is a signal of interspecies competition between plants, which is most evident in mid-latitude ecoregions, where conditions for growth (reflected in actual ET rates and gross primary productivities) are optimal. Away from this optimum, climate severity probably overrides the effect of competition, or other interactions become increasingly important. Our approach bridges the gap between species-rich competition theories and large-scale species distribution data analysis.

AB Persistence and colonization by tree species in an environment following a fire depends on the effects on seed germination and seedling development. We used seeds of Kielmeyera coriacea and Qualea parviflora as a model to test the effects of high temperatures on germination and initial development of tree seedlings. We exposed the seeds to heat flow (70, 100, 130, 150 or 170 degrees C) for 2 or 5 min and compared the germination with that of unheated seeds (control). Seedlings were then harvested after 3, 7 or 15 days to evaluate aerial and root mass, root:shoot ratio, presence of cotyledon opening, true leaves, and secondary roots. We found no effect on germination for seeds exposed to temperatures >= 150 degrees C. However, germination was significantly reduced for seeds exposed to 100 degrees C for both 2 and 5 min. The mass of 15-day-old K. coriacea seedlings was smaller when seeds were heated at 70 degrees C for 5 min or at temperatures higher or equal to 100 degrees C. Qualea parviflora seedlings did not show any difference in mass, but there were marginal differences in the presence of roots and the opening of cotyledons. Kielmeyera coriacea seedlings allocated biomass faster than Q. parviflora. High temperatures affect both quantity and quality of germinable seeds, as well as biomass allocation during initial seedling development. These factors may explain the decrease in seedlings observed after fire, suggesting a bottleneck effect that influences population dynamics and species persistence in systems with frequent fires.

AB Recent waves of illegal deforestation for cattle pasture are damaging the Indio Maiz Biological Reserve and Rama-Kriol Territory of Nicaragua, with negative consequences to aquatic ecosystems and the people they support. This study creates a framework for how deforestation from cattle ranching causes shifts in stream community structure, mediated by changes in stream habitat over time. It integrates temporally explicit land use information with stream habitat, macroinvertebrate, freshwater shrimp, and fish community data to assess impacts of cattle ranching on 15 headwater streams. The deforestation history measure (DHM), a product of deforestation amount and time since deforestation for each catchment, strongly predicted stream habitat and biotic responses. Delayed effects of land-use change such as decreased allochthonous inputs (large wood, debris) and increased bank destabilization, sedimentation, flashiness, and the scouring effect were apparent in longer deforested catchments, causing lower richness and density and higher evenness of macroinvertebrates; lower shrimp abundance; and distinct changes in fish and invertebrate community composition. Both recently and longer deforested catchments had degraded riparia and smaller sized game fish. Otherwise, recently deforested catchments were more similar to forested catchments. Nicaragua's understudied primary rainforest ecosystems should be high priority for research and conservation before they are lost.

AB Brazilian beef systems contribute 14.9% of global beef production, therefore given climate change concerns, there is a clear need to reduce environmental impacts while maintaining economic viability. This study evaluated the hypothesis that steroid implant use in Brazilian beef cattle would reduce resource use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic costs of production, thereby improving environmental and economic sustainability. A deterministic model based on beef cattle population demographics, nutrition and performance was used to quantify resource inputs and GHG emissions per 1.0 x 10(6) kg of hot carcass weight (HCW) beef. System boundaries extended from cropping input manufacture to cattle arriving at the slaughterhouse. Beef systems were modeled using herd population dynamics, feed and performance data sourced from producers in four Brazilian states, with additional data from global databases. Implants were used in calves, growing and finishing cattle at low (LI), medium (MI), and high (HI) levels of performance enhancement, compared to non-implanted (NI) controls. Feed use results were used in combination with producer-derived input costs to assess the economic impacts of implant use, including production costs and returns on investment. Improved FCE, ADG, and carcass weights conferred by implant use reduced the number of cattle and the time taken to produce 1.0 x 10(6) kg HCW beef. Compared to NI controls, the quantities of feed, land, water and fossil fuels required to produce 1.0 x 10(6) kg HCW beef was reduced in implanted cattle, with reductions proportional to the performance-enhancing effect of the implant (HI > MI > LI). Implant use reduced GHG emissions per 1.0 x 10(6) kg HCW beef by 9.4% (LI), 12.6% (MI), or 15.8% (HI). Scaling up the MI effects to represent all eligible Brazilian cattle being implanted, revealed avoided GHG emissions equivalent to the annual exhaust emissions of 62.0 x 10(6) cars. Economic impacts of implant use reflected the environmental results, resulting in a greater margin for the producers within each system (cow-calf through to finishing). The 6.13% increase in kg of HCW beef produced generates a cost reduction of 3.76% and an increase in the return on invested capital of 4.14% on average. Implants offer the opportunity for Brazilian beef producers to demonstrate their dedication to improving environmental and economic sustainability through improved productivity, although care must be taken to avoid negative trade-offs.

AB Premise Primates are important seed dispersers, especially for large-seeded (>1 cm long) tropical species in continuous and fragmented rainforests. Methods In three forest fragments within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, southern Mexico, we investigated the effect of seed passage through the gut of howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) on the germination rate and maximum germination (%) of native, large-seeded species. One group of howler monkeys, per fragment, was followed and fresh feces collected. Large seeds were removed to compare their germination success with non-ingested seeds of the same species collected underneath parent plants. Results Feces contained large seeds from seven tree species (Ampelocera hottlei, Castilla elastica, Dialium guianense, Garcinia intermedia, Pourouma bicolor, Spondias mombin, Trophis racemosa) and one liana species (Abuta panamensis). Except for G. intermedia, ingested seeds germinated significantly faster than non-ingested seeds, which had negligible germination. Ingested seeds of D. guianense, P. bicolor, S. mombin, T. racemosa, and A. panamensis had significantly greater germination, while G. intermedia had significantly lower germination and seed ingestion had no apparent effect for A. hottlei and C. elastica. Conclusions In general, seed ingestion by howler monkeys confers faster germination compared with non-ingested seeds. Faster germination reduces predation probabilities and increases seedling establishment in forest fragments. Primate dispersal services contribute to germination heterogeneity within plant populations of old-growth forest species and to their persistence in forest fragments.

AB Landscape features impact gene flow and the spatial patterns of genetic variation between populations of a species. Because many Magnoliaceae species occur in fragmented and highly disturbed landscapes, the family provide an excellent model for landscape genetic studies. This research focuses on the subspecies and subpopulations of Magnolia cubensis and aims to: (1) compare the genetic diversity between the different subspecies and their subpopulations, (2) search for patterns between the spatial and genetic distance, (3) quantify the functional connectivity and (4) assess the structural connectivity of the landscape. This study employs 21 microsatellite markers to quantify the genetic diversity, complemented with seven landscape characteristics of the Guamuhaya and Sierra Maestra massifs in Cuba. Magnolia cubensis subsp. acunae does not have a well-defined spatial genetic pattern: there is no evidence of isolation by distance or spatial autocorrelation and the little genetic differentiation between the two subpopulations does not reflect the characteristics of the landscape that separates them or the cost values to cross it. Magnolia cubensis subsp. cubensis presents evidence of isolation by distance and the autocorrelation analyses indicate that the approximate scale of the genetic neighborhood is between 35 and 40 km. There is a marked genetic structure with probability values that indicate the existence of three genetic groups. Large genetic differentiation was only found between Gran Piedra and the other subpopulations, which reflects low gene flow. Our results support the recognition of these subspecies at the species level. We define one evolutionary significant unit in Magnolia cubensis subsp. acunae and two evolutionary significant units in Magnolia cubensis subsp. cubensis. These results must be combined with ecological, social and distribution data, in order to obtain a more accurate and realistic perspective of the conservation management strategies for these taxa.

AB The species within Xenarthra (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) are quintessential South American mammals. Of the three groups, Vermilingua (anteaters) contains the fewest extant and paleontological species. Here, we sampled and sequenced the entire mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of two Tamandua species (Tamandua tetradactyla and T. mexicana) (n=74) from Central and South America, as well as Myrmecophaga tridactyla (n=41) from South America. Within Tamandua, we detected three different haplogroups. The oldest (THI) contained many specimens with the T. tetradactyla morphotype (but also several with the T. mexicana morphotype) and originated in southeastern South America (currently Uruguay) before moving towards northern South America, where the THII haplogroup originated. THII primarily contained specimens with the T. mexicana morphotype (but also several with the T. tetradactyla morphotype) and was distributed in Central America, Colombia, and Ecuador. THI and THII yielded a genetic distance of 4%. THII originated in either northern South America or " in situ" in Central America with haplogroup THIII, which consisted of similar to 50% T. mexicana and 50% T. tetradactyla phenotypes. THIII was mostly located in the same areas as THII, i.e., Central America, Ecuador, and Colombia, though mainly in the latter. The three haplogroups overlapped in Colombia and Ecuador. Thus, T. tetradactyla and T. mexicana were not reciprocally monophyletic. For this reason, we considered that a unique species of Tamandua likely exists, i.e., T. tetradactyla. In contrast to Tamandua, M. tridactyla did not show different morphotypes throughout its geographical range in the Neotropics. However, two very divergent genetic haplogroups (MHI and MHII), with a genetic distance of similar to 10%, were detected. The basal haplogroup, MHI, originated in northwestern South America, whereas the more geographically derived haplogroup, MHII, overlapped with MHI, but also expanded into central and southern South America. Thus, Tamandua migrated from south to north whereas Myrmecophaga migrated from north to south. Our results also showed that temporal mitochondrial diversification for Tamandua began during the Late Pliocene and Upper Pleistocene, but for Myrmecophaga began during the Late Miocene. Furthermore, both taxa showed elevated levels of mitochondrial genetic diversity. Tamandua showed more evidence of female population expansion than Myrmecophaga. Tamandua experienced population expansion similar to 0.6-0.17 million years ago (Mya), whereas Myrmecophaga showed possible population expansion similar to 0.3-0.2 Mya. However, both taxa experienced a conspicuous female decline in the last 10 000-20 000 years. Our results also showed little spatial genetic structure for both taxa. However, several analyses revealed higher spatial structure in Tamandua than in Myrmecophaga. Therefore, Tamandua and Myrmecophaga were not subjected to the same biogeographical, geological, or climatological events in shaping their genetic structures.

AB Forest restoration depends on the availability of seeds in the soils. Understanding relationships between soil seed banks and aboveground flora is vital for framing strategies to ensure sustainable use of forest ecosystems. Human-induced pressures are threatening the natural forests of Southern Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to compare the relationships between aboveground and soil seed bank flora of the plantation and natural forest, Southern Ethiopia. Thirty-nine 20 m by 20 m quadrats were laid along six transects. Woody species with DBH >= 2.5 cm were recorded in each quadrat. Overall, 117 composite soil samples were collected from three soil layers of 1 m x 1 m subplots. The soil seed bank was analyzed using the seedling emergence technique. The findings revealed that the aboveground vegetation was represented by 55 woody species, whereas the soil seed bank flora was represented by 31. The seed abundance, species richness and diversity decreased with increasing soil depth. Sorensen's similarity between the soil seed bank and aboveground flora was low inferring low restoration potential from the SSB in the natural and plantation forests. Therefore, in-situ conservation measures other than SSB alone should be implemented for sustainable development and use of the forest ecosystem.

AB The emergence of the diagonal of open/dry vegetations, including Chaco, Cerrado and Caatinga, is suggested to have acted as a dispersal barrier for terrestrial organisms by fragmenting a single large forest that existed in South America into the present Atlantic and Amazon forests. Here we tested the hypothesis that the expansion of the South American diagonal of open/dry landscapes acted as a vicariant process for forest lanceheads of the genus Bothrops, by analyzing the temporal range dynamics of those snakes. We estimated ancestral geographic ranges of the focal lancehead clade and its sister clade using a Bayesian dated phylogeny and the BioGeoBEARS package. We compared nine Maximum Likelihood models to infer ancestral range probabilities and their related biogeographic processes. The best fitting models (DECTS and DIVALIKETS) recovered the ancestor of our focal clade in the Amazon biogeographic region of northwestern South America. Vicariant processes in two different subclades resulted in disjunct geographic distributions in the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest. Dispersal processes must have occurred mostly within the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest and not between them. Our results suggest the fragmentation of a single ancient large forest into the Atlantic and Amazon forests acting as a driver of vicariant processes for the snake lineage studied, highlighting the importance of the diagonal of open/dry landscapes in shaping distribution patterns of terrestrial biota in South America.

AB Tropical forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems and home to numerous tree species competing for resources in space and time. Functional traits influence the ecophysiological performance of tree species, yet the relationship between traits and emergent long-term growth patterns is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel 3D forest stand model in which growth patterns of individual trees and forest stands are emergent properties of leaf traits. Individual trees are simulated as 3D functional-structural tree models (FSTMs), considering branches up to the second order and leaf dynamics at a resolution of one cubic meter. Each species is characterized by a set of leaf traits that corresponds to a specific position on the leaf economics spectrum and determines light-driven carbon assimilation, respiration and mortality rates. Applying principles of the pipe model theory, these leaf scale processes are coupled with within-tree carbon allocation, i.e., 3D tree growth emerges from low-level processes. By integrating these FSTMs into a dynamic forest stand model, we go beyond modern stand models to integrate structurally detailed internal physiological processes with interspecific competition and interactions with the environment in diverse tree communities. For model calibration and validation, we simultaneously compared a large number of emergent patterns at both the tree and forest levels in a pattern-oriented modelling framework. At the tree level, the specific leaf area and correlated leaf traits determined the maximum height and age of trees, as well as their size-dependent growth rate and shade tolerance. Trait variations along the leaf economics spectrum led to a continuous transition from fast-growing, short-lived and shade-intolerant to slow-growing, long-lived and shade-tolerant trees. These emerging patterns resemble well-known functional tree types, indicating a fundamental impact of leaf traits on long-term growth patterns. At the forest level, a large number of patterns taken from lowland Neotropical forests were reproduced, indicating that our forest model simulates structurally realistic forests over long time spans. Our ecophysiological approach improves the understanding of how leaf level processes scale up to the tree and the stand level, and facilitates the development of next-generation forest models for species-rich forests in which tree performance emerges directly from functional traits.

AB Increasing evidence suggests that tree growth is sink-limited by environmental and internal controls rather than by carbon availability. However, the mechanisms underlying sink-limitations are not fully understood and thus not represented in large-scale vegetation models. We develop a simple, analytically solved, mechanistic, turgor-driven growth model (TDGM) and a phloem transport model (PTM) to explore the mechanics of phloem transport and evaluate three hypotheses. First, phloem transport must be explicitly considered to accurately predict turgor distributions and thus growth. Second, turgor-limitations can explain growth-scaling with size (metabolic scaling). Third, turgor can explain realistic growth rates and increments. We show that mechanistic, sink-limited growth schemes based on plant turgor limitations are feasible for large-scale model implementations with minimal computational demands. Our PTM predicted nearly uniform sugar concentrations along the phloem transport path regardless of phloem conductance, stem water potential gradients and the strength of sink-demands contrary to our first hypothesis, suggesting that phloem transport is not limited generally by phloem transport capacity per se but rather by carbon demand for growth and respiration. These results enabled TDGM implementation without explicit coupling to the PTM, further simplifying computation. We test the TDGM by comparing predictions of whole-tree growth rate to well-established observations (site indices) and allometric theory. Our simple TDGM predicts realistic tree heights, growth rates and metabolic scaling over decadal to centurial timescales, suggesting that tree growth is generally sink and turgor limited. Like observed trees, our TDGM captures tree-size- and resource-based deviations from the classical 3/4 power-law metabolic scaling for which turgor is responsible.

AB Periwinkles (Littorinidae: genus Littoraria) are one of the very few molluscan clades showing an adaptive radiation closely associated to the mangrove habitat. However, pervasive land use changes associated to urbanization is prompting mangrove loss or degradation, with unknown consequences for mangrove-associated fauna. In the southern Colombian Caribbean, mangrove ecosystems have been encroached by human settlements and different populations of Littoraria angulifera (Lamarck, 1822) now inhabit anthropogenic intertidal substrates in urban areas, but the demographic traits of populations thriving in these novel environments are unknown. We studied the relative abundance and size structure of L. angulifera in remnant mangrove patches, woody debris and anthropogenic substrates (boulder seawalls and built structures) in 13 locations throughout the Uraba Gulf, a human-transformed tropical estuarine system. The abundance of L. angulifera was up to two orders of magnitude higher in anthropogenic than in quasi-natural or natural substrates. Snails also displayed a significant preference for wave protected positions in boulder seawalls and built structures exposed to heavy wave action, which was not previously reported in mangrove forests. Moreover, snail populations in anthropogenic substrate were consistently dominated by individuals of small sizes in comparison with mangroves or driftwood. We argue that the anthropogenic disturbances caused by the expansion of Turbo city during nearly one century in a coast formerly dominated by mangrove forests are providing novel and expanding habitats, whose quality might be good enough as to support high-density populations of L. angulifera. However, we hypothesize that shifted thermal regimes in hard and novel wave-exposed urban seascapes might also be prompting behavioral adjustments and the selection of smaller size ranges than those observed in mangrove forests.

AB Edge effects, driven by human modification of landscapes, can have critical impacts on ecological processes such as species interactions, with cascading impacts on biodiversity as a whole. Characterizing how edges affect vital biotic interactions such as seed dispersal by frugivores is important for better understanding potential mechanisms that drive species coexistence and diversity within a plant community. Here, we investigated how differences between frugivore communities at the forest edge and interior habitats of a diverse tropical rainforest relate to patterns of animal-mediated seed dispersal and early seedling recruitment. We found that the lemur communities across the forest edge-interior gradient in this system showed the highest species richness and variability in body sizes at intermediate distances; the community of birds showed the opposite pattern for species richness. Three large-bodied frugivores, known to be effective dispersers of large seeds, tended to avoid the forest edge. As result, the forest edges received a lower rate of animal-mediated seed dispersal compared to the interior habitats. In addition, we also found that the seeds that were actively dispersed by animals in forest edge habitats were smaller in size than seeds dispersed in the forest interior. This pattern was found despite a similarity in seed size of seasonally fruiting adult trees and shrubs between the two habitats. Despite these differences in dispersal patterns, we did not observe any differences in the rates of seedling recruitment or seed-size distribution of successful recruit species. Our results suggest that a small number of frugivores may act as a potential biotic filter, acting on seed size, for the arrival of certain plant species to edge habitats, but other factors may be more important for driving recruitment patterns, at least in the short term. Further research is needed to better understand the potential long-term impacts of altered dispersal regimes relative to other environmental factors on the successional dynamics of edge communities. Our findings are important for understanding potential ecological drivers of tree community changes in forest edges and have implications for conservation management and restoration of large-seeded tree species in disturbed habitats.

AB Aim How historical and contemporary eco-evolutionary processes shape the patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation across species' distribution range remains an open question with strong conservation implications. Focusing on the orange stony coral, Astroides calycularis, we (a) characterized the pattern of neutral genetic diversity across the distribution range; (b) gave insights into the underlying processes; and (c) discussed conservation implications with emphasis on a national park located on a hotspot of genetic diversity. Location South Mediterranean Sea and Zembra National Park. Methods We combined new data from 12 microsatellites in 13 populations located in the Centre and in the Western Periphery of the distribution range with a published dataset including 16 populations from the Western and Eastern Peripheries. We analysed the relationship among parameters of genetic diversity (H (e), Ar ((g))) and structure (population-specific F (ST)) and two measures of geographic peripherality. We compared two estimators of pairwise genetic structure (G (ST), D (EST)) across the distribution range. The evolutionary and demographic history of the populations following the Last Glacial Maximum was reconstructed using approximate Bayesian computations and maximum-likelihood analyses. We inferred the contemporary connectivity among populations from Zembra National Park and with the neighbouring area of Cap Bon. Results We demonstrate a decrease in genetic diversity and an increase in genetic differentiation from the Centre to the Eastern and Western Peripheries of the distribution range. Populations from Zembra show the highest genetic diversity reported in the species. We identified a spillover effect towards Cap Bon. Main conclusions The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation are most likely explained by "the postglacial range expansion hypothesis" rather than the "central-peripheral hypothesis." Enforcement of conservation measures should be considered to protect this genetic diversity pattern, in particular when considering the low effective population size inferred at many sites.

AB Premise The mechanisms generating the geographical distributions of genetic diversity are a central theme in evolutionary biology. The amount of genetic diversity and its distribution are controlled by several factors, including dispersal abilities, physical barriers, and environmental and climatic changes. We investigated the patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation among populations of the widespread species Brosimum alicastrum in Mexico. Methods Using nuclear DNA microsatellite data, we tested whether the genetic structure of B. alicastrum was associated with the roles of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as geographical barriers to gene flow and to infer the role of past events in the genetic diversity patterns. We further used a maximum-likelihood population-effects mixed model (MLPE) to identify the main factor affecting population differentiation in B. alicastrum. Results Our results suggested that Mexican B. alicastrum is well differentiated into three main lineages. Patterns of the genetic structure at a finer scale did not fully correspond to the current geographical barriers to gene flow. According to the MLPE mixed model, isolation by distance is the best model for explaining the genetic differentiation of B. alicastrum in Mexico. Conclusions We propose that the differentiation patterns might reflect (1) an ancient differentiation that occurred in Central and South America, (2) the effects of past climatic changes, and (3) the functions of some physical barriers to gene flow. This study provides insights into the possible mechanisms underlying the geographic genetic variation of B. alicastrum along a moisture gradient in tropical lowland forests.

AB Aim We investigated evolutionary relationships and biogeographical patterns within the genus Boeckella to evaluate (1) whether its current widespread distribution in the Southern Hemisphere is due to recent long-distance dispersal or long-term diversification; and (2) the age and origin of sub-Antarctic and Antarctic Boeckella species, with particular focus on the most widely distributed species: Boeckella poppei. Location South America, sub-Antarctic islands, maritime Antarctica, continental Antarctica and Australasia. Methods To reconstruct phylogenetic patterns of Boeckella, we used molecular sequence data collected from 12 regions and applied Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses using multiple loci. We also estimated divergence times and reconstructed ancestral ranges using two different models of species evolution. Results Phylogenetic analyses and divergence time estimates suggested that Boeckella originated on the Gondwanan supercontinent and initially split into two main clades during the late Cretaceous (ca. 80 Ma). The first clade diversified in Australasia, and the second clade is currently distributed in South America, various sub-Antarctic islands and Antarctica. Dispersal from South America to the Kerguelen and Crozet archipelagos occurred during the Eocene/Oligocene (B. vallentini) and in the late Pliocene (B. brevicaudata), while South Georgia and the maritime Antarctic were likely colonized during the late Pleistocene (B. poppei). Main conclusions Boeckella has a Gondwanan origin, with further diversifications after the physical separation of the continental landmasses. Extant populations of Boeckella from the Scotia Arc islands and Antarctic Peninsula originated from South America during the Pleistocene, suggesting that original Antarctic Gondwanan lineages did not survive repeated glacial cycles during the Quaternary ice ages. A continuous decline in the species accumulation rate is apparent within the genus as the early Eocene, suggesting that Boeckella diversification may have decreased due to progressive cooling throughout the Cenozoic era.

AB Fire is a natural phenomenon that affects the Earth's biogeochemical cycle. Wildland fires are increasing in frequency and magnitude, possibly owing to climate change. In addition, fire is applied as a tool in agroecosystem management. However, several detrimental effects on soil properties, particularly on soil aggregate stability, might occur. A general explanation is that "the effects of fire on soil aggregate stability in soil with high clay content, calcium carbonate, and Fe and Al oxides as the principal cementing substances cause gradual improvement in aggregate stability, following fire-heating severity." In short, the higher the fire severity, the higher is the aggregate stability. A meta-analysis was conducted for assessing the laboratory and field studies to verify this concept. The Scopus (R) platform was used to search for the literature related to "soil aggregate stability" AND fire OR heating AND clay OR "clayey soil." A total of 10 studies were selected with 16 soil types, 244 burned or heated samples, and 160 control samples. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Metaanalysis was delineated according to the following assumptions: a) field and laboratory studies were tested as two independent subgroups, and a pooled effect was subsequently calculated; b) a random-effects model was used; c) mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for continuous variables. Laboratory and field measurements showed dissimilar effects on soil aggregate stability and evidenced positive effects in the laboratory experiments compared with those in the field. Aggregate stability measured in the laboratory increased by 2.80% after heating. Fire effects measured in the field did not show a significant increase in soil aggregate stability (-0.16%). The overall effects of combined subgroups showed an aggregate stability improvement of 1.49% (confidence intervals 0.80% to 2.17%). However, the weight of the results from the laboratory studies played an important role in the overall effect. The soil clay content was found to be inversely associated with aggregate stability, i.e., the lower the clay content the higher the aggregate stability in soil subjected to fire heating. In conclusion, the aggregate stability of clayey soils rich in Al and Fe oxides does not necessarily improves following fire heating.

AB Halophila stipulacea, a seagrass native to the Indian Ocean, spread to the Caribbean in 2002. Few studies have explored the spatiotemporal distribution of H. stipulacea throughout the Caribbean and whether native invertebrates utilize this non-native seagrass as habitat. We surveyed the shallow, nearshore subtidal zones of four bays in St. John, US Virgin Islands over a two-year period to assess the abundance of both H. stipulacea and native seagrass species. We then surveyed macroinvertebrate communities in one bay with large areas of H. stipulacea, native seagrasses, and bare substrate to assess how macroinvertebrate species composition varied in these habitats. Our survey of the benthic macroinvertebrates revealed that: (1) native invertebrate species utilize H. stipulacea beds and (2) the density and richness of invertebrates was significantly higher in H. stipulacea beds compared to both native seagrass beds and bare substrate. Our results show that H. stipulacea is a common component of nearshore communities in St. John, USVI and that native invertebrates use H. stipulacea beds as habitat - results that agree with findings from other recent studies. While these findings indicate that native macroinvertebrate species can be abundant in non-native seagrass, further investigation, including experimental manipulations, preference tests, and surveys across broad spatial scales, are required to develop a robust understanding of the ecological impacts of this non-native grass.

AB Root-associated fungal communities modify the climatic niches and even the competitive ability of their hosts, yet how the different components of the root microbiome are modified by habitat loss remains a key knowledge gap. Using principles of landscape ecology, we tested how free-living versus host-associated microbes differ in their response to landscape heterogeneity. Further, we explore how compartmentalisation of microbes into specialised root structures filters for key fungal symbionts. Our study demonstrates that free-living fungal community structure correlates with landscape heterogeneity, but that host-associated fungal communities depart from these patterns. Specifically, biotic filtering in roots, especially via compartmentalisation within specialised root structures, decouples the biogeographic patterns of host-associated fungal communities from the soil community. In this way, even as habitat loss and fragmentation threaten fungal diversity in the soils, plant hosts exert biotic controls to ensure associations with critical mutualists, helping to preserve the root mycobiome.

AB Functional traits are measurable characteristics that affect an organism's fitness under certain environmental conditions. The use of functional traits in microbial ecology holds great promise for improving our ability to develop biogeochemical models and predict ecosystem responses to global changes. Notably, functional traits could be decoupled from taxonomic relatedness, owing to horizontal gene transfer among microorganisms and adaptive evolution. In recent years, our knowledge about microbial functional traits has been substantially enhanced, thereby revealing the multitude of ecological processes in driving community assembly and dynamics. Here, I summarize the emerging patterns of how microbial functional traits respond to changing environments, which considerably differ from better-studied microbial taxonomy. I use niche and neutral theories to explain microbial functional traits. Finally, I highlight future challenges to analyze, elucidate, and utilize functional traits in microbial ecology.

AB Highly diverse plant communities growing on nutrient-impoverished soils are test beds for theories on species coexistence. Here, neighbouring mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants compete for limited phosphorus. The impact of below-ground interactions on community dynamics is underexplored. We used an experimental approach to investigate effects of inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and a phosphorus supply gradient on competitive and facilitative interactions among mixed assemblages of woody plants in microcosms. The plant species, one cluster root-forming (CR) species and four AM species, are native to jarrah forest that grows on nutrient-impoverished soils in south-western Australia. We measured plant growth in microcosms, with and without inoculation with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis, and across a gradient of P supply: 0, 9, 27 and 243 mg P per kg of soil. Our data show evidence of plant-plant facilitation at low P supply and competition at high P supply. Growth of the CR species, Hakea undulata, was highest in microcosms with 0P and without AM inoculation. One AM species, Bossiaea aquifolium, also performed better at lower P levels, possibly benefitting from P mobilised by H. undulata. The other three AM species, one strongly obligates, performed better at higher P levels. Data for Acacia celastrifolia suggested it was facultatively mycotropic, and because there was no correlation between AM colonisation and the relative inoculum effect, we suggest positive effects of AM inoculation at 9P might be due to benefits other than P acquisition, such as pathogen defence. Benefit of AM inoculation diminished for three of four mycorrhizal species at the highest P level as we had predicted. The fourth species, Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah), had higher growth in microcosms that were not inoculated with AM, perhaps because the species benefits more from ectomycorrhizas. Synthesis. Our experimental data suggest spatial heterogeneity of soil P, coupled with a diversity of nutrient-acquisition strategies, and plasticity among plant-plant and plant-AM fungi interactions, contributes to plant species coexistence in the nutrient-impoverished jarrah forest. Our research highlights the importance of below-ground mechanisms for understanding factors determining community structure including a potential role of AM fungi in plant pathogen defence.

AB As the most remote archipelago in the world, the Hawaiian Islands are home to a highly endemic and disharmonic biota that has fascinated biologists for centuries. Forests are the dominant terrestrial biome in Hawai'i, spanning complex, heterogeneous climates across substrates that vary tremendously in age, soil structure, and nutrient availability. Species richness is low in Hawaiian forests compared to other tropical forests, as a consequence of dispersal limitation from continents and adaptive radiations in only some lineages, and forests are dominated by the widespread Metrosideros species complex. Low species richness provides a relatively tractable model system for studies of community assembly, local adaptation, and species interactions. Moreover, Hawaiian forests provide insights into predicted patterns of evolution on islands, revealing that while some evidence supports "island syndromes," there are exceptions to them all. For example, Hawaiian plants are not as a whole less defended against herbivores, less dispersible, more conservative in resource use, or more slowgrowing than their continental relatives. Clearly, more work is needed to understand the drivers, sources, and constraints on phenotypic variation among Hawaiian species, including both widespread and rare species, and to understand the role of this variation for ecological and evolutionary processes, which will further contribute to conservation of this unique biota. Today, Hawaiian forests are among the most threatened globally. Resource management failures - the proliferation of non-native species in particular - have led to devastating declines in native taxa and resulted in dominance by novel species assemblages. Conservation and restoration of Hawaiian forests now rely on managing threats including climate change, ongoing species introductions, novel pathogens, lost mutualists, and altered ecosystem dynamics through the use of diverse tools and strategies grounded in basic ecological, evolutionary, and biocultural principles. The future of Hawaiian forests thus depends on the synthesis of ecological and evolutionary research, which will continue to inform future conservation and restoration practices.

AB Environmental filters and functional adjustments of species to local conditions are major determinants of plant communities in stressing habitats. We set out to understand the role of different substrates in functional trait variation in wood plants by investigating key functional traits at the community and intraspecific levels in different types of Brazilian savanna: two sites of alluvial savannas (lowland savannas that occur in old alluvial deposits in riverbeds with sandy soils and low water-holding capacity), and two sites of typical savannas (upland savannas that occur in interfluvial zones, far from the influence of rivers, in which clay soils with higher fertility and water-holding capacity predominate). We conducted this study in four sites with savanna vegetation in the northeast region of the Cerrado Biome, nearby the transition with the Amazon. In each site we sampled six functional traits for each tree species: leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area (SLA), stem-specific density, relative bark thickness and maximum plant height. We sampled 101 wood species, ranging from 26 to 62 species within each site. In both community and intraspecific levels, alluvial savanna plants showed higher SLA and specific-stem density, and lower leaf area, leaf thickness, bark thickness, and plant height compared with the typical savanna. We also found that, at a given leaf thickness, species from typical savanna exhibited -20% higher SLA. In addition, at a given plant height, typical species showed -56% higher bark thickness and -20% lower specific-stem density. Our findings suggest that savanna tree species growing on alluvial savannas tend to adopt strategies related to water acquisition while species growing on typical savannas invest in both water conservation strategies and protection against high-intensity fires. We conclude that water deficit and fire, both related to substrate properties, play a key role in determining the woody plant communities functioning in savannas.

AB Although cerrado trees have evolved with fire for millions of years, it is not well-understood which tree attributes are more important to survive fire in the Brazilian savanna. To address this issue, we used pre- and post-fire data on 367 cerrado trees (113 native species) planted in an arboretum in south-east Brazil and then left =burnt until 2019, when a prescribed burn was applied. Tree size (height and diameter) had been measured in 2017. Four months after the fire, we assessed tree size, relative bark thickness (bark-to-diameter ratio), leaf habit (evergreen or deciduous) and habitat preference (savanna specialist or generalist). These were the predictor variables used in generalised linear models exploring tree survival and resprouting type. Most trees survived fire: 59% resprouted epicormically, 25% resprouted basally, 6% had root suckers, and only four trees died. Basal and epicormic resprouting were related to tree size: small trees (diameter <= 5 cm) resprouted basally more frequently, whereas tall trees (height >= 3.7 m) resprouted epicormically more frequently. Our results suggest that rapid growth is more important than bark thickness, leaf habit or habitat preference to escape the fire trap, because it allows cerrado trees to reach a fire-resistant height more quickly.

AB Biological communities may be assembled by both niche-based and dispersal-based (= historic) processes with the relative importance of these processes in community assembly being scale- and context-dependent. To infer whether (a) niche-based or dispersal-based processes play the main role in the assembly of flea communities parasitic on small mammals and whether (b) the main processes of flea community assembly are scale-dependent, we applied a novel permutation-based algorithm (PER-SIMPER) and the dispersal-niche continuum index (DNCI), to data on the species incidence of fleas and their hosts at two spatial scales. At the larger (continental) scale, we analysed flea communities in four biogeographic realms across adjacent continental sections. At the smaller (local) scale, we considered flea communities across two main regions (lowlands and mountains) and seven habitat types within Slovakia. Our analyses demonstrated that species composition of fleas and their small mammalian hosts depended predominantly on historical processes (dispersal) at both scale. This was true for the majority of biogeographic realms at continental scale (except the Nearctic) and both regions at local scale. Nevertheless, strong niche-based assembly mechanism was found in the Nearctic assemblages. At local scale, the intensity of dispersal processes was weaker and niche-driven processes were stronger between habitats within a region than between mountain and lowland regions. We provide historical and ecological explanations for these patterns. We conclude that the assembly of compound flea communities is governed, to a great extent, by the dispersal processes acting on their hosts and, to a lesser extent, by the niche-based processes.

AB Light competition, the main force in shaping plant height, is ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Plant height was commonly treated as a competitive strategy and investigated under the game-theoretic framework. However, how plant heights are shaped by light environment under natural selection has not yet been fully understood. Aiming at revealing the potential mechanism causing the height diversification and complex evolutionary dynamics, we here propose an eco-evolutionary model of the plant competing for light, in which the benefit and cost due to light competition as well as density-dependent selection are considered. We provide the criteria for producing different evolutionary consequences. The results show that the moderate levels of competitive costs boost the diversity of plant height, and that the eco-evolutionary feedback results in complex nature of the height evolution. In the power-type cost, the evolutionary consequence of plant height highly depends on the shape of benefit and cost functions, and the height evolution under convex benefit or concave cost displays a trend of evident diversification, which is most pronounced when the two factors are added together, whereas a homogenization tendency of the height evolution occurs in the opposite cases. Meantime, the classification of evolutionary states under different benefit-cost combinations exhibits distinct structure patterns. Generally, more complex evolutionary dynamics are caused if we consider the Hill-type cost: the multiple evolutionary equilibria and phase transitions between these evolutionary equilibria could occur. These results help us in part understand why plant heights in the plant kingdom are highly diverse. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prior to European settlement the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem covered over 92 million hectares in the southeastern United States. Historically, fire was an important driver of species composition in the longleaf pine ecosystem, but fire exclusion since the early 20th century has led to the degradation of longleaf pine communities and has had a detrimental effect on the large number of rare and endemic species found within this system. Thus, accurate estimates of fire history are important for better informed management of longleaf pine communities. Recently, satellite imagery has been used to identify burned areas. However, results have been inconsistent across physiographic regions and vegetation types (e.g. wetlands under high canopy). We developed a model using Landsat satellite imagery, coupled with a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, to identify burned areas and estimate the fire history from 1991 to 2019 for Fort Bragg, NC, one of the largest contiguous areas of longleaf pine ecosystem remaining. We calculated six spectral indices from the Landsat band values, including the Mid-Infrared Burn Index (MIRBI) and the change in MIRBI through time (Delta MIRBI), and used them as predictors in our RF model. We used the developed RF model to estimate the fire history for all known populations of 24 rare upland and wetland plant species found on Fort Bragg. We compared our results to a recent continental U.S. fire occurrence dataset, as well as the prescribed fire records from Fort Bragg. The overall AUC (area under the curve) for our RF model (0.74) compared favorably to the continental U.S. dataset results for Fort Bragg (0.69), and was able to capture the reduced fire frequency in wetlands. The most important predictor in our RF model was Delta MIRBI. Depending on the model, individual plant species were estimated to have experienced significant differences in fire frequency relative to the prescribed fire records. For our RF model, we estimated that 50% of wetland and 25% of upland species experienced a lower fire frequency relative to that represented in the prescribed fire records. The burn probability and classification tool generated in this paper provides land managers in the southeastern U.S. with a novel approach for accurately identifying burned areas and estimating local fire frequency across landscapes.

AB Brazil faces its greatest period of environmental setback, where "ruralists" (large landholders and their representatives) gain access to government land in the Amazon. New roads are being paved, such as Highway BR-319 connecting Porto Velho in Brazil's notorious "arc of deforestation" to Manaus in relatively intact central Amazo<SIC>nia. This highway acts as a spearhead penetrating one of the Amazon's most preserved forest blocks. Here we report how the Brazilian government has been favoring land grabbing (grilagem) in the Amazon and how BR319 has given access to public lands and encouraged the invasion of these areas together with land grabbing and deforestation. This is not just a process linked to the highway, as it also involves the actions of government agencies such as the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA). Illegal logging is rampant and areas of government land are being marked out by land grabbers (grileiros) for illegal sale to arriving migrants. Despite environmental legislation requiring an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for "Lot C," which is one of stretches where deforestation is advancing, a judge has authorized paving this stretch without an EIA. Opening BR-319 and its associated side roads represents a path with no return to a tipping point of selfdegradation and loss of Amazonia's vital biodiversity and climate-stabilization functions.

AB Characterizing and measuring the extent of change at forest edges is important for making management decisions, especially in the face of climate change, but is difficult due to the large number of factors that can modify the response. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery may serve as a tool to detect and measure the forest response at the edge quickly and repeatedly, thus allowing a larger amount of area to be covered with less work. This study is a preliminary attempt to utilize UAS imagery to detect changes in canopy cover, known to exhibit changes due to edge influences, across forest edges in a New England forest. Changes in canopy cover with increasing distance from the forest edge were measured on the ground using digital cover photography and from photogrammetric point clouds and imagery-based maps of canopy gaps produced with UAS imagery. The imagery-based canopy gap products were significantly more similar to ground estimates for canopy cover (p value > 0.05) than the photogrammetric point clouds, but still suffered overestimation (RMSE of 0.088) due to the inability to detect small canopy openings. Both the ground and UAS data were able to detect a decrease in canopy cover to between 45-50 m from the edge, followed by an increase to 100 m. The UAS data had the advantage of a greater sampling intensity and was thus better able to detect a significant edge effect of minimal magnitude effect in the presence of heavy variability.

AB Aims Understanding the contributions of abiotic and biotic conditions to soil microbial diversity, structure, and function, remains a central focus in soil biology and biogeochemistry. Here we aim to determine how geography and host plant identity influence these different components of rhizosphere bacterial communities and endosymbionts associated with Acacia heterophylla on Reunion island (Mascarene archipelago, Indian Ocean) and A. koa in the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaiian archipelago, Pacific Ocean). These two tree species are remarkable: they are each other's closest living relatives despite their habitats being more than 16 000 km apart. Methods Using 16S rRNA amplicon next-generation sequencing data we show that the structure of rhizosphere communities of these two acacias is largely driven by dispersal limitation between sites and local soil chemical conditions within sites. Results Despite high taxonomic turnover in soils collected from different sites, we found their predicted functions to be largely similar, suggestive of functional redundancy. We also identify a core of rhizosphere taxa associated with both Acacia species in both archipelagos, which included potential nitrogen-fixing mutualists. Isolation and characterisation of rhizobia from root nodules of both acacias further supported strong selection by these plants for the same Bradyrhizobium endosymbionts. Conclusions Overall, our data suggest that phylogenetically-closely related plants may show remarkably similar selectivity for bacterial mutualists over vast geographic distances.

AB Despite their economic, ecological and cultural importance, few studies have examined the population size, distribution and trends of the red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta leporina) on the island of Trinidad. This study reports densities of agouti on Trinidad during a three-year period, including two years of a moratorium on hunting. Diurnal transect surveys were conducted and density estimates were calculated using the DISTANCE programme and King's Estimator. Density varied between 7 and 44 individuals/km(2) between different sites, 19-28 individuals/km(2) island-wide, and with two of four sites showing a potential decline in estimated density in the final year of sampling after hunting resumed.

AB Long-term stand-level resilience in three natural secondary forests after a stand-replacing windthrow damage event was examined by analyzing stand composition, structure, and function using repetitive measurement data collected in permanent plots over 60 yr. The secondary forests differed among pre-disturbance forest types. For the purposes of this study, stand resilience comprised resistance to and recovery from windthrow damage. To analyze composition, the dynamics of species numbers in the permanent plots were tracked and temporal trends in similarity between pre- and post-disturbance compositions were examined. To investigate stand structure, the dynamics of tree density, mean diameter at breast height (DBH), and temporal trends in similarity between pre- and post-disturbance DBH frequency distributions were analyzed. To investigate stand function, the dynamics of stand basal area were analyzed. The calculations showed that tree density, basal area, species composition, and DBH frequency distribution were associated with low resistance to windthrow damage. By contrast, the number of species and mean DBH were resistant to windthrow damage. Basal areas recovered quickly in the 60 yr post-windthrow damage, but recovery of the pre-damage mean DBH and DBH frequency distribution was slow. Tree density and the number of species recovered to levels that exceeded those in the stands prior to the windthrow event. The recovery of species composition varied by pre-disturbance forest type. Among the stands analyzed, the hardwood forest that existed prior to disturbance was resistant to and recovered well from windthrow damage in comparison with other types of pre-disturbance forests. In conclusion, stand-replacing windthrow damage can have a long-lasting influence on secondary forests, especially in terms of stand composition and structure.

AB The U-net is nowadays among the most popular deep learning algorithms for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping; nevertheless, it has rarely been used with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral (MS) imagery. On the other hand, the discrimination between plantations and forests in LULC maps has been emphasized, especially for tropical areas, due to their differences in biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. In this study, we trained a U-net using different imagery inputs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, MS, SAR and a combination of both (MS + SAR); while a random forests algorithm (RF) with the MS + SAR input was also trained to evaluate the difference in algorithm selection. The classification system included ten classes, including old-growth and secondary forests, as well as old-growth and young plantations. The most accurate results were obtained with the MS + SAR U-net, where the highest overall accuracy (0.76) and average F1-score (0.58) were achieved. Although MS + SAR and MS U-nets gave similar results for almost all of the classes, for old-growth plantations and secondary forest, the addition of the SAR band caused an F1-score increment of 0.08-0.11 (0.62 vs. 0.54 and 0.45 vs. 0.34, respectively). Consecutively, in comparison with the MS + SAR RF, the MS + SAR U-net obtained higher F1-scores for almost all the classes. Our results show that using the U-net with a combined input of SAR and MS images enabled a higher F1-score and accuracy for a detailed LULC map, in comparison with other evaluated methods.

AB The diadematid sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii occurs in Australia and New Zealand and has undergone recent southward range extension in Australia as a result of regional warming. Clarifying the population genetic structure of this species across its New Zealand range would allow a better understanding of recent and future mechanisms driving range changes in the species. Here, we use microsatellite DNA data to assess connectivity and genetic structure in 385 individuals from 14 locations across the Australian and New Zealand ranges of the species. We detected substantial genetic differentiation among C. rodgersii populations from Australia and New Zealand. However, the population from Port Stephens (located north of Newcastle), Australia, strongly clustered with New Zealand samples. This suggests that the New Zealand populations recently originated from this area, likely via larval transport in the Tasman Front flow that arises in this region. The weak population genetic structure and relatively low genetic diversity detected in New Zealand (global F-st = 0.0021) relative to Australia (global F-st = 0.0339) is consistent with the former population's inferred history of recent climate-driven expansion. Population-level inbreeding is low in most populations, but were higher in New Zealand (global F-is = 0.0833) than in Australia (global F-is = 0.0202), suggesting that self-recruitment is playing an increasingly important role in the New Zealand region. Our results suggest that C. rodgersii is likely to spread southwards as ocean temperatures increase; therefore, it is crucial that researchers develop a clearer understanding of how New Zealand ecosystems will be reshaped by this species (and others) under climate change.

AB This study assesses the incremental impact of the first transboundary Payments for Watershed Services (PWS) scheme on water quality in China. Due to the absence of a control situation without the PWS scheme, the synthetic control method (SCM) is applied to construct a counterfactual for the prefecture city Huangshan in Eastern China where the PWS is implemented based on the socio-economic characteristics of more than 75 other prefecture cities. The creation of such a counterfactual is crucial in view of the declining trend in water pollution observed before implementation of the PWS scheme. Despite this downward trend in water pollution, an additional effect of the PWS scheme is observed. This result is not obtained when using any of the other prefecture cities as a placebo to test the robustness of this outcome. The application of the SCM in this study is a promising new avenue for the evaluation of PWS schemes elsewhere where similar control conditions are lacking. However, as we show, its applicability depends crucially on the availability of relevant water quality monitoring data.

AB We assessed fragmentation impact on liana community structure and patterns of liana-tree interaction network structure, and edge effects on liana community structure in a rainforest and a moist semi-deciduous (MSD) forest in Ghana. In each forest, we randomly established 30 20 x 20 m(2) plots at varied distances (0-20 m, 20-40 m, 40-60 m, 60-80 m, 80-100 m) from forest edge to interior in fragmented and intact sites. Lianas with diameter at 1.30 m from rooting base >= 1 cm and their host trees (diameter at breast height >= 5 cm) were identified and counted. Our findings revealed that fragmentation caused an increase in liana diversity in the rainforest, but not in the MSD. Fragmentation also resulted in shifts in species composition in both forests, and together with edge effects increased liana abundance in both forest ecosystems. Liana-tree networks in the two forest ecosystems were less nested and connected, but more modular and specialized than their corresponding null models irrespective of fragmentation. Some species of lianas (rainforest fragment/intact: 0.80/0.76%; MSD fragment/intact: 0.47/0.38%) and trees (rainforest fragment/intact: 0.65/0.35%; MSD fragment/intact: 0.54/0.36%) exhibited higher specialization than their null models. Topologically, most lianas in fragmented and intact sites of the forests played peripheral/specialist roles, whereas a few species exhibited structural importance in the form of connectors, network hubs and module hubs. The structural important species in fragmented sites did not also occur in intact sites, suggesting that fragmentation might have influenced topological roles of the species in fragmented sites.

AB Forest age is a major predictor of secondary forest functional properties and through the chronosequence approach continues to be a principal focus in local, landscape, and regional-scale studies of secondary succession. Recent work has shown that patterns of temporal change in functional properties differ markedly between wet and seasonally dry lowland forests, suggesting that decreasing light and increasing water availability, respectively, are the main drivers of successional change. Meanwhile, however, the potentially marked effects of anthropogenic factors (especially fire), soils, climate, and dispersal limitation on the variation of forest characteristics over landscapes remain poorly understood. We studied the functional properties of seasonally dry secondary forests 5-35 years after pasture abandonment on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. We measured 11 functional traits for 63 dominant tree and palm species in 52 plots of 0.12 ha. We used linear regression and variation partitioning to determine the relative importance of soil, climate, site use, fire history, spatial factors, and forest age in the determination of community weighted mean (CWM) trait values. CWM leaf trait and stem trait spectra of the 52 plots were orthogonal in a PCA ordination. Our seasonal forest hypothesis, that forest functional properties become more acquisitive with age as suggested by other authors, was not supported, perhaps because our chronosequence was relatively short. Our fire tolerance hypothesis was that bark thickness, wood specific gravity and resprouting capacity would increase with time of exposure to fires. This hypothesis was not supported for bark thickness. Rather, our results suggest that wood specific gravity and resprouting capacity are better predictors of fire tolerance. Also, our results suggest that >10 years of exposure to fire generates changes in forest fire tolerance strategies from high CWM bark thickness to high wood specific gravity. Finally, we tested our dispersal limitation hypothesis, that spatial variables, expressed as principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) eigenfunctions, predict variation in forest functional properties, using variation partitioning analysis with matrices of climate, soil, anthropogenic and spatial variables. The results (overall model R2 = 0.46) indicated that spatial variables, followed by soil (acidity, depth, and extractable Mn), are the best overall predictors of forest functional traits values, supporting this hypothesis. Overall, fire, dispersal limitation and soil characteristics explain the functional properties of these secondary forests, with no effect of age in the 5-35 years range. This indicates a critical need for sampling designs and analytical approaches that take into account all these factors to advance understanding of tropical seasonal forest recovery at the landscape scale.

AB Maintaining standing genetic variation is a challenge in human-dominated landscapes. We used genetic (i.e., 16 short tandem repeats) and morphological (i.e., length and weight) measurements of 593 contemporary and historical brown trout (Salmo trutta) samples to study fine-scale and short-term impacts of different management practices. These had changed from traditional breeding practices, using the same broodstock for several years, to modern breeding practices, including annual broodstock replacement, in the transnational subarctic Pasvik River. Using population genetic structure analyses (i.e., Bayesian assignment tests, DAPCs, and PCAs), four historical genetic clusters (E2001A-D), likely representing family lineages resulting from different crosses, were found in zone E. These groups were characterized by consistently lower genetic diversity, higher within-group relatedness, lower effective population size, and significantly smaller body size than contemporary stocked (E2001E) and wild fish (E2001F). However, even current breeding practices are insufficient to prevent genetic diversity loss and morphological changes as demonstrated by on average smaller body sizes and recent genetic bottleneck signatures in the modern breeding stock compared to wild fish. Conservation management must evaluate breeding protocols for stocking programs and assess if these can preserve remaining natural genetic diversity and morphology in brown trout for long-term preservation of freshwater fauna.

AB High genetic variation and extensive gene flow may help forest trees with adapting to ongoing climate change, yet the genetic bases underlying their adaptive potential remain largely unknown. We investigated range-wide patterns of potentially adaptive genetic variation in 64 populations of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) using 270 SNPs from 139 candidate genes involved either in phenology or in stress responses. We inferred neutral genetic structure and processes (drift and gene flow) and performed differentiation outlier analyses and gene-environment association (GEA) analyses to detect signatures of divergent selection. Beech range-wide genetic structure was consistent with the species' previously identified postglacial expansion scenario and recolonization routes. Populations showed high diversity and low differentiation along the major expansion routes. A total of 52 loci were found to be putatively under selection and 15 of them turned up in multiple GEA analyses. Temperature and precipitation related variables were equally represented in significant genotype-climate associations. Signatures of divergent selection were detected in the same proportion for stress response and phenology-related genes. The range-wide adaptive genetic structure of beech appears highly integrated, suggesting a balanced contribution of phenology and stress-related genes to local adaptation, and of temperature and precipitation regimes to genetic clines. Our results imply a best-case scenario for the maintenance of high genetic diversity during range shifts in beech (and putatively other forest trees) with a combination of gene flow maintaining within-population neutral diversity and selection maintaining between-population adaptive differentiation.

AB The weevil Gonipterus platensis is among the most important eucalypt (Eucalyptus spp.) pest species worldwide. In Portugal, weevil-induced damage has great economic significance and efforts are being taken to find adequate alternatives to the biological control of this defoliator by its parasitoid Anaphes nitens, which is ineffective at altitudes above 400 m. With the aim of improving current knowledge on the ecology of G. platensis, we evaluated its interactions with local and landscape factors through the application of generalized linear mixed models for (1) the probability of weevil occurrence in sampling points, and (2) the relative abundance of each of its two annual generations on eucalypt trees. Our models confirmed the significant positive effect of elevation, here found to come off just above 360 m a.s.l., on both the occurrence and the abundance of G. platensis. Moreover, our results denoted that stand-level variables can likewise affect this pest. Points located more than 400 m inside the stands and, to a lesser extent, those comprising smaller (yet mature) eucalypt trees and where trees of other species were absent, showed an increased probability of G. platensis occurrence. Concordantly, significantly higher abundances of both weevil generations were observed on 3-8 years-old eucalypt trees. In addition, there was a negative effect of coppiced stands on G. platensis abundance which was only significant for the first annual generation and probably was related with weevil's recent colonization of stands ravaged by wildfires two years before our field surveys. Weevil populations were not influenced by the density of stand canopy, neither by understory structure and composition, nor by bare soil cover, hence it is not expected that thinning, shrub removal and soil scarification practices can affect G. platensis attacks in eucalypt stands. Overall, our study provides key knowledge on the ecology of G. platensis and its response to local and landscape features, paving the way for enhanced management of eucalypt plantations.

AB Hybrid zones have the potential to shed light on evolutionary processes driving adaptation and speciation. Secondary contact hybrid zones are particularly powerful natural systems for studying the interaction between divergent genomes to understand the mode and rate at which reproductive isolation accumulates during speciation. We have studied a total of 720 plants belonging to five populations from two Erysimum (Brassicaceae) species presenting a contact zone in the Sierra Nevada mountains (SE Spain). The plants were phenotyped in 2007 and 2017, and most of them were genotyped the first year using 10 microsatellite markers. Plants coming from natural populations were grown in a common garden to evaluate the reproductive barriers between both species by means of controlled crosses. All the plants used for the field and greenhouse study were characterized by measuring traits related to plant size and flower size. We estimated the genetic molecular variances, the genetic differentiation, and the genetic structure by means of the F-statistic and Bayesian inference. We also estimated the amount of recent gene flow between populations. We found a narrow unimodal hybrid zone where the hybrid genotypes appear to have been maintained by significant levels of a unidirectional gene flow coming from parental populations and from weak reproductive isolation between them. Hybrid plants exhibited intermediate or vigorous phenotypes depending on the analyzed trait. The phenotypic differences between the hybrid and the parental plants were highly coherent between the field and controlled cross experiments and through time. The highly coherent results obtained by combining field, experimental, and genetic data demonstrate the existence of a stable and narrow unimodal hybrid zone between Erysimum mediohispanicum and Erysimum nevadense at the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

AB Climate, topography and edaphic characteristics are important factors for plant community dynamics when considering spatial and temporal scales. Efforts on vegetation dynamics in tropical regions are mostly focused on forests, with far less attention dedicated to open vegetation ecosystems. This study aimed to understand how demographic rates (based on models and maps) are affected by climate, soil and terrain variables in the Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado, which is a hotspot for the world biodiversity conservation. To do so, we used forest inventory data collected from 354 plots (10 x 100 m) distributed in the savanna of Minas Gerais State, southeast of Brazil, in the years of 2005-2006 and 2010-2011. Next, we calculated the rates of mortality, recruitment, net change in number of individuals, basal area loss and gain, and net change in basal area for the plots. We used the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to model the demographic rates in function of climate, soil and terrain variables obtained from the WorldClim 2, Harmonized World Soil Database and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), respectively. The models presented good performance with coefficient of determination (R-2) values ranging from 0.68 to 0.84, mean absolute error (MAE) between 0.32 and 0.96%.year(-1), and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 60 a 160%. The recruitment was higher than mortality, and the basal area gain was greater than the basal area loss, resulting in positive net change rates. The most important variables for the model and best predictors of vegetation dynamics rates of Brazilian savanna were the terrain variables, since they encompass characteristics such as soil water content, erosion, altitudes and slope. We showed that the gain in number of individuals and basal area were greater at low regions, that is, near drainage lines and with higher humidity. The losses in number of individuals and basal area were higher in boundary regions of the savanna vegetation, that is, regions of higher altitude and consequently, low humidity. Therefore, our findings provide support for conservation and management strategies of the biome, since from the vegetation dynamics drivers identification, we may identify priority areas as well as the vegetation vulnerability.

AB Precopulatory courtship plays an essential role in the insemination process and influences postcopulatory behavior between males and females. Male precopulatory oral stimulation of female genitals is rare for invertebrates. Here, we describe an intriguing oral sexual courtship in a cryptic desert beetle Platyope mongolica Faldermann. The males repeatedly contact the female's genitals using their mouths to gain consent to mate. Furthermore, the rate at which males contact the female's genitals relates to the copulation success in a series of observations. However, interference in oral sexual contacts decreased the proportion of successful copulation. Further no-choice tests found homosexual behavior between males with antenna removed. We report the precopulatory oral sexual behavior and its important role for copulation success in P. mongolica for the first time. These findings highlight the significance of oral sexual courtship in sexual selection.

AB Rapid environmental change is reshaping ecosystems and driving species loss globally. Carnivore populations have declined and retracted rapidly and have been the target of numerous translocation projects. Success, however, is complicated when these efforts occur in novel ecosystems. Identifying refuges, locations that are resistant to environmental change, within a translocation framework should improve population recovery and persistence. American martens (Martes americana) are the most frequently translocated carnivore in North America. As elsewhere, martens were extirpated across much of the Great Lakes region by the 1930s and, despite multiple translocations beginning in the 1950s, martens remain of regional conservation concern. Surprisingly, martens were rediscovered in 2014 on the Apostle Islands of Lake Superior after a putative absence of >40 yr. To identify the source of martens to the islands and understand connectivity of the reintroduction network, we collected genetic data on martens from the archipelago and from all regional reintroduction sites. In total, we genotyped 483 individual martens, 43 of which inhabited the Apostle Islands (densities 0.42-1.46 km(-2)). Coalescent analyses supported the contemporary recolonization of the Apostle Islands with progenitors likely originating from Michigan, which were sourced from Ontario. We also identified movements by a first-order relative between the Apostle Islands and the recovery network. We detected some regional gene flow, but in an unexpected direction: individuals moving from the islands to the mainland. Our findings suggest that the Apostle Islands were naturally recolonized by progeny of translocated individuals and now act as a source back to the reintroduction sites on the mainland. We suggest that the Apostle Islands, given its protection from disturbance, complex forest structure, and reduced carnivore competition, will act as a potential refuge for marten along their trailing range boundary and a central node for regional recovery. Our work reveals that translocations, even those occurring along southern range boundaries, can create recovery networks that function like natural metapopulations. Identifying refuges, locations that are resistant to environmental change, within these recovery networks can further improve species recovery, even within novel environments. Future translocation planning should a priori identify potential refuges and sources to improve short-term recovery and long-term persistence.

AB Variation among Puccinia triticina isolates collected from triticale in Poland between 2012 and 2015 was studied based on virulence and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Two hundred and forty-two single-uredinial isolates from four geographically separated locations were tested for virulence against 33 near-isogenic Thatcher lines containing known Lr resistance genes, and their molecular genotypes were characterized with 34 SSR markers. Structure and relationships of the regional and annual populations of P. triticina were analysed using an assignment-based approach for both the virulence and SSR data. The molecular marker analysis was based on two different models of SSR evolution: the stepwise mutation model with a variable mutation rate (SMMv) and the infinite alleles model (IAM). A highly significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among SSR genotypes, a high proportion of heterozygotes, and a moderate association of relationships between virulence phenotypes and SSR genotypes were consistent with the occurrence of clonal lineages of related races within the population. While the results suggest that genetic drift and mutation affect variation within the pathogen population, it seems that migration has the most significant role in shaping the population structure of P. triticina occurring on triticale in Poland.

AB Early blight (EB) caused by Alternaria linariae or Alternaria solani and leaf blight (LB) caused by A. alternata are economically important diseases of tomato and potato. Little is known about the genetic diversity and population structure of these pathogens in the United States. A total of 214 isolates of A. alternata (n = 61), A. linariae (n = 96), and A. solani (n = 57) were collected from tomato and potato in North Carolina and Wisconsin and grouped into populations based on geographic locations and tomato varieties. We exploited 220 single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from DNA sequences of 10 microsatellite loci to analyse the population genetic structure between species and between populations within species and infer the mode of reproduction. High genetic variation and genotypic diversity were observed in all the populations analysed. The null hypothesis of the clonality test based on the index of association ((r) over bar (d)) was rejected, and equal frequencies of mating types under random mating were detected in some studied populations of Alternaria spp., suggesting that recombination can play an important role in the evolution of these pathogens. Most genetic differences were found between species, and the results showed three distinct genetic clusters corresponding to the three Alternaria spp. We found no evidence for clustering of geographic location populations or tomato variety populations. Analyses of molecular variance revealed high (> 85%) genetic variation within individuals in a population, confirming a lack of population subdivision within species. Alternaria linariae populations harboured more multilocus genotypes (MLGs) than A. alternata and A. solani populations and shared the same MLG between populations within a species, which was suggestive of gene flow and population expansion. Although both A. linariae and A. solani can cause EB on tomatoes and potatoes, these two species are genetically differentiated. Our results provide new insights into the evolution and structure of Alternaria spp. and can lead to new directions in optimizing management strategies to mitigate the impact of these pathogens on tomato and potato production in North Carolina and Wisconsin.

AB Crop pollination is one of Nature's Contributions to People (NCP) that reconciles biodiversity conservation and agricultural production. NCP benefits vary across space, including among distinct political-administrative levels within nations. Moreover, initiatives to restore ecosystems may enhance NCP provision, such as crop pollination delivered by native pollinators. We mapped crop pollination demand (PD), diversity of pollinator-dependent crops, and vegetation deficit (VD) (vis-a-vis Brazilian legal requirements) across all 5570 municipalities in Brazil. Pollinator-dependent crops represented similar to 55% of the annual monetary value of agricultural production and similar to 15% of the annual crop production. Municipalities with greater crop PD (i.e., higher degree of pollinator dependence of crop production) also had greater VD, associated with large properties and monocultures. In contrast, municipalities with a greater diversity of pollinator-dependent crops and predominantly small properties presented a smaller VD. Our results support that ecological restoration prompted by legal requirements offers great potential to promote crop productivity in larger properties. Moreover, conservation of vegetation remnants could support food security in small properties. We provided the first steps to identify spatial patterns linking biodiversity conservation and pollination service. Using Brazilian legal requirements as an example, we show that land-use management policies may be successfully used to ensure agricultural sustainability and crop production.

AB There are currently few predictions about when evolutionary processes are likely to play an important role in structuring community features. Determining predictors that indicate when evolution is expected to impact ecological processes in natural landscapes can help researchers identify eco-evolutionary 'hotspots', where eco-evolutionary interactions are more likely to occur. Using data collected from a survey in freshwater cladoceran communities, landscape population genetic data and phenotypic trait data measured in a common garden, we applied a Bayesian linear model to assess whether the impact of local trait evolution in the keystone species Daphnia magna on cladoceran community trait values could be predicted by population genetic properties (within-population genetic diversity, genetic distance among populations), ecological properties (Simpson's diversity, phenotypic divergence) or environmental divergence. We found that the impact of local trait evolution varied among communities. Moreover, community diversity and phenotypic divergence were found to be better predictors of the contribution of evolution to community trait values than environmental features or genetic properties of the evolving species. Our results thus indicate the importance of ecological context for the impact of evolution on community features. Our study also demonstrates one way to detect signatures of eco-evolutionary interactions in communities inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes using survey data of contemporary ecological and evolutionary structure.

AB Plants and their soil microbial symbionts influence ecosystem productivity and nutrient cycling, but the controls on these symbioses remain poorly understood. This is particularly true for plants in the Fabaceae family (hereafter legumes), which can associate with both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen (N) -fixing bacteria. Here we report results of the first manipulated field experiment to explore the abiotic and biotic controls of this tripartite symbiosis in Neotropical canopy gaps (hereafter gaps). We grew three species of Neotropical N-fixing legume seedlings under different light (gap-full light, gap-shadecloth, and understory) and soil nitrogen (20 g N center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) vs. 0 g N center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) conditions across a lowland tropical forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We harvested the seedlings after 4 months of growth in the field and measured percent AMF root colonization (%AMF), nodule and seeding biomass, and seedling aboveground:belowground biomass ratios. Our expectation was that seedlings in gaps would grow larger and, as a result of higher light, invest more carbon in both AMF and N-fixing bacteria. Indeed, seedlings in gaps had higher total biomass, nodule biomass (a proxy for N-fixing bacteria investment) and rates of AMF root colonization, and the three were significantly positively correlated. However, we only found a significant positive effect of light availability on %AMF when seedlings were fertilized with N. Furthermore, when we statistically controlled for treatment, species, and site effects, we found %AMF and seedling biomass had a negative relationship. This was likely driven by the fact that seedlings invested relatively less in AMF as they increased in biomass (lower %AMF per gram of seedling). Taken together, these results challenge the long-held assumption that high light conditions universally increase carbon investment in AMF and demonstrate that this tripartite symbiosis is influenced by soil nutrient and light conditions.

AB Using 2,733 longitudinal vaginal microbiome samples (representing local microbial communities) from 79 individuals (representing meta-communities) in the states of healthy, BV (bacterial vaginosis) and pregnancy, we assess and interpret the relative importance of stochastic forces (e.g., stochastic drifts in bacteria demography, and stochastic dispersal) vs. deterministic selection (e.g., host genome, and host physiology) in shaping the dynamics of human vaginal microbiome (HVM) diversity by an integrated analysis with multi-site neutral (MSN) and niche-neutral hybrid (NNH) modeling. It was found that, when the traditional "default" P-value = 0.05 was specified, the neutral drifts were predominant (>= 50% metacommunities indistinguishable from the MSN prediction), while the niche differentiations were moderate (<20% from the NNH prediction). The study also analyzed two challenging uncertainties in testing the neutral and/or niche-neutral hybrid models, i.e., lack of full model specificity - non-unique fittings of same datasets to multiple models with potentially different mechanistic assumptions - and lack of definite rules for setting the P-value thresholds (also noted as P-t-value when referring to the threshold of P-value in this article) in testing null hypothesis (model). Indeed, the two uncertainties can be interdependent, which further complicates the statistical inferences. To deal with the uncertainties, the MSN/NNH test results under a series of P-values ranged from 0.05 to 0.95 were presented. Furthermore, the influence of P-value threshold-setting on the model specificity, and the effects of woman's health status on the neutrality level of HVM were examined. It was found that with the increase of P-value threshold from 0.05 to 0.95, the overlap (non-unique) fitting of MSN and NNH decreased from 29.1 to 1.3%, whereas the specificity (uniquely fitted to data) of MSN model was kept between 55.7 and 82.3%. Also with the rising P-value threshold, the difference between healthy and BV groups become significant. These findings suggested that traditional single P-value threshold (such as the de facto standard P-value = 0.05) might be insufficient for testing the neutral and/or niche neutral hybrid models.

AB Climate and land management are important environmental drivers that affect the structure of terrestrial plant communities worldwide. Demographic studies allow a mechanistic understanding of the pathways in which environmental factors change population size. Climate and land management might interactively influence vital rates and growth rates of populations, however, demographic studies have not heretofore considered both factors in combination. We used the Global Change Experimental Facility as a platform to study the effect of climate (ambient climate conditions vs. future climate conditions) and land management (sheep grazing vs. mowing) on the demography of the common grass, Bromus erectus growing in semi-natural grassland communities. Using an integral projection model, we found positive population growth rates for B. erectus under all treatment combinations, and an interactive effect of climate and land management. Under ambient climate conditions, population growth of B. erectus was higher in mowed than grazed grassland plots, while population growth rates were similar across both management types under future climatic conditions. This interaction was primarily due to between-treatment changes in seedling recruitment, a vital rate to which the population growth rate is particularly sensitive. The interaction found in this study highlights the importance of considering multiple environmental drivers in demographic studies, to better predict future plant population dynamics and ultimately changes in community structure.

AB Biotic invasions can predominantly alter the dynamics, composition, functions, and structure of natural ecosystems. Social insects, particularly ants, are among the most damaging invasive alien species. Invasive ant species are among the supreme threats to ecosystems. There are about 23 species of invasive ants recorded worldwide, according to the ant invasive databases. The ecological impacts of invasive ants comprise predation, hybridization, and competition with native species that changes the ecosystem processes with the biodiversity loss and upsurge of pests. The effects of invasion on native fauna in the same habitats might be catastrophic for the native community through various ecological mechanisms, e.g., habitat disturbance, resource competition, limiting the foraging activity of native species, and various other indirect mechanisms of invasive species. Invasive species may have harmful impacts on habitats and devastating effects on natural flora and fauna, and stopping these new species from being introduced is the most effective way to deter future invasions and maintain biodiversity. This paper reviews the literature to evaluate the effects of invasive ant species on the native species, including vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants sharing the same habitats as the non-native species under global environmental changes. We also highlighted the various management strategies that could be adopted in minimizing the adverse effects of these invasive ant species on the natural ecosystem. To this end, strategies that could regulate the mode and rate of invasion by these alien ant species are the most effective ways to deter future invasions and maintain biodiversity.

AB Based on a synthesis of new molecular phylogenetic data, a detailed review is presented for the origins of the Galapagos' native land-locked vertebrates [42 species; 11 clades: geckos (3), lava lizards (2), giant tortoises (1), iguanas (1), racer snakes (1) and oryzomyine rodents (3)]. Nine groups have roots in coastal Ecuador and Peru and would have been transported to the archipelago on rafts, many on the Humboldt Current. Inferring the sources of the giant tortoises, which probably floated over unaided, and the iguanas is more challenging because their closest living relatives occupy ground remote from the Pacific. Acknowledging uncertainties with the age-dating of both the phylogenetic tree nodes and the landmass emergences, seven, probably eight, of the colonizations likely involved beachings on the modern-day islands within the last 4 Myr. Three, possibly four, of the earlier arrivals may have been on now-submerged landmasses that were created by the Galapagos volcanic hotspot. Alternatively, the true sister taxa of the Galapagos species could be extinct and these colonizations, too, are more recent. This is likely for the giant tortoises. The assembled data set hints at the oldest/youngest clades showing the highest/lowest levels of diversification, although other factors also exert an influence.

AB When an ecosystem undergoing restoration does not follow the desired trajectory, management interventions may be warranted. Where the initial steps towards restoration include tree planting at high densities, reduction of stand basal area (BA) by overstory thinning is a potential adaptive management tool to stimulate natural regeneration, although it can also damage young plants. We ask how tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest responds to different intensities of thinning. We applied two intensities of thinning to a 22-yr-old restored forest in southeastern Brazil and then sampled seedlings and saplings before and over an eight year period after thinning; unthinned plots were retained as controls. Thinning impacts on the woody understory were negligible, far below annual mortality in control plots. Positive responses to thinning were stronger in the treatment with low remaining basal area (ca. 30% below the reference forests), with increases in seedling density, numbers of recruits, and seedling-to-sapling and sapling-to-tree transitions. Understory dynamics were clearly intensified by gap opening, with a pulse of natural regeneration in the first years after thinning. These changes, however, were not simultaneous and did not usually persist over time. Rarefied richness of the understory increased over time after all treatments and changes in species composition of saplings were enhanced by thinning. Our study gives support to selective timber harvests from restored tropical forests insofar as thinning did not threaten the understory and stimulated natural regeneration. Frequency and intensity of thinning operations, however, should be locally adjusted based on monitoring data.

AB Introductions of invasive, non-native species in the marine environment are increasing as human activity within coastal areas rises. Genetic datasets are useful tools to identify source populations, track routes of invasions, and illuminate the role of genetic variation in the establishment and subsequent spread of novel introductions. Here, a microsatellite dataset is used to estimate the genetic diversity and population structure of 7 introduced Didemnum vexillum populations in Britain and Ireland, 4 of which are associated with aquaculture and 3 with marinas. Genetic differentiation observed between these populations indicates human-mediated transport as the main mechanism underlying the population structure of D. vexillum in Britain and Ireland. In addition to elucidating patterns of population structure we found that aquaculture sites showed significantly higher genetic diversity (measured as allelic richness) in comparison to the marina sites. We discuss these findings in relation to the history of each invasion, the complex life history of D. vexillum, and available evidence of the relative invasiveness of these populations. Our results show numerous interesting patterns which highlight further research avenues to elucidate the complex factors underlying the global spread of this successful invader.

AB Deforestation and agricultural intensification have resulted in an alarming change in the global land cover over the past 300 years, posing a threat to species conservation. Dhole is a monophyletic, social canid and, being an endangered and highly forest-dependent species, is more prone to the loss of favorable habitat in the Anthropocene. We determined the genetic differentiation and demographic history of dhole across the tiger reserves of Maharashtra using the microsatellite data of 305 individuals. Simulation-based analyses revealed a 77-85% decline in the major dhole sub-populations. Protected areas have provided refuge to the historically declining dhole population resulting in clustering with strong genetic structure in the remnant dhole population. The historical population decline coincides with the extreme events in the landscape over the past 300 years. The study highlights the pattern of genetic differentiation and diversity of a highly forest-dependent species which can be associated with the loss of forest cover outside tiger reserves. It also warrants attention to develop conservation plans for the remnant surviving population of dholes in India.

AB Coral reefs are home to the greatest diversity of marine life, and many species on reefs live in symbiotic associations. Studying the historical biogeography of symbiotic species is key to unravelling (potential) coevolutionary processes and explaining species richness patterns. Coral-dwelling gall crabs (Cryptochiridae) live in obligate symbiosis with a scleractinian host, and are ideally suited to study the evolutionary history between heterogeneous taxa involved in a symbiotic relationship. The genus Opecarcinus Kropp and Manning, 1987, like its host coral family Agariciidae, occurs in both Indo-Pacific and Caribbean seas, and is the only cryptochirid genus with a circumtropical distribution. Here, we use mitochondrial and nuclear DNA gene fragments of Opecarcinus specimens sampled from 21 Indo-Pacific localities and one Atlantic (Caribbean) locality. We applied several species delimitation tests to characterise species diversity, inferred a Bayesian molecular-clock time-calibrated phylogeny to estimate divergence times and performed an ancestral area reconstruction. Time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of Opecarcinus is estimated at 15-6 Mya (middle Miocene-late Miocene). The genus harbours similar to 15 undescribed species as well as several potential species complexes. There are indications of strict host-specificity patterns in certain Opecarcinus species in the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic, however, a robust phylogeny reconstruction of Agariciidae corals-needed to test this further-is currently lacking. The Indo-West Pacific was inferred to be the most probable ancestral area, from where the Opecarcinus lineage colonised the Western Atlantic and subsequently speciated into O. hypostegus. Opecarcinus likely invaded from the Indo-West Pacific across the East Pacific Barrier to the Atlantic, before the full closure of the Isthmus of Panama. The subsequent speciation of O. hypostegus, is possibly associated with newly available niches in the Caribbean, in combination with genetic isolation following the closure of the Panama Isthmus.

AB Species are disappearing worldwide with increasing rates through the time, especially in the tropics. The human-induced impacts have a pivotal role in the discussion about the cause of these extinctions events. Although researchers are nearly unanimous about the current biodiversity crisis, there is still a debate about how these human-induced impacts affect biodiversity across different geographical scales. While our perception about landscape modification promoted by deforestation occurs at local scales, we treat the increase of greenhouse gas emissions and its consequences in a global perspective. This diffuse view about different processes but potential assembling properties illustrates the importance of combining small and broad-scales to improve our conservation actions and decelerate extinction events. Here, we propose an integrated framework (Ecoland) combining landscape ecology and macroecology for niche modelling applications, aiming to disentangle the effects of human-induced impacts on biodiversity and guide conservation tasks at multiple scales. We demonstrated the EcoLand application using a dataset of fruit-feeding butterfly species occurrence from the Atlantic Forest. Our findings highlight the impact of the land-use modification on the number of butterfly species. Finally, we discuss the method implications, its limitations and perspectives, and how it the Ecoland can help us to design conservation strategies aiming at the maintenance of biodiversity and its related policy practices.

AB The Atlantic Forest is one of the most threatened tropical forests in the world, being drastically reduced, fragmented, and disturbed. The drastic process of anthropic occupation and exploitation of this biome has, in many cases, led to the introduction of exotic species, such as the jackfruits (Artocarpus heterophyllus). However, studies on the influence of jackfruits on the native biota are still scarce. Here we investigated the influence of fruit trees on the seed rain and early recruitment of seedlings in native remnants, comparing these patterns with those observed for a native species tapirira (Tapirira guianensis), which similarly to jackfruits, produces many fruits throughout the year, attracting a variety of frugivore species. Seed rain and seedlings observed under the jackfruits were both more abundant and equally rich to the assemblages reported under the native tapirira trees. In both species, co-specifics comprise a large part of the number of seeds (> 70%) and seedlings (> 45%) individuals and, although they attract similar seed assemblages, seedling composition diverge, particularly when co-specifics are excluded. We reported that jackfruits can attract a diverse seed and seedling assemblages, and we find no evidence that the presence of jackfruits negatively affects the arrival and initial recruitment of native plant species in the study area. These results should be analyzed with caution but considered when evaluating costs and benefits of management options to control exotic species.

AB To predict the effects of habitat alterations on animal populations we need insight into how the habitat configuration influences local scale movements. This relationship may be particularly important for effective management of pest species. We tracked 80 PIT-tagged Spanish slugs (Arion vulgaris) in 16 x 16 m arenas with manipulated habitat fragmentation. The arenas had habitat patches consisting of high grass residing within a matrix of short grass, and the arenas with a high degree of fragmentation had 12 large (2 x 2 m), 13 medium-sized (1 x 1 m) and 12 small (0.5 x 0.5 m) patches, whereas the arenas with low fragmentation had four 4 x 4 m patches, resulting in equal amounts of total habitat patch area in the two treatments. The measured mean distance moved per day was 3.8 m, and between 0 and 25% of the slugs left the arenas each day. Fragmentation treatment had no effect on these two measurements. In the treatment with patches of different sizes, slugs distributed themselves among the patch size classes according to the total amount of habitat area for each habitat patch class, whereas patch edge did not explain the distribution pattern. All in all, fragmentation per se seems to play a minor role in the local movement and distribution of Spanish slugs.

AB Background Ecological processes such as seedling establishment, biotic interactions, and mortality can leave footprints on species spatial structure that can be detectable through spatial point-pattern analysis (SPPA). Being widely used in plant ecology, SPPA is increasingly carried out to describe biotic interactions and interpret pattern-process relationships. However, some aspects are still subjected to a non-negligible debate such as required sample size (in terms of the number of points and plot area), the link between the low number of points and frequently observed random (or independent) patterns, and relating patterns to processes. In this paper, an overview of SPPA is given based on rich and updated literature providing guidance for ecologists (especially beginners) on summary statistics, uni-/bi-/multivariate analysis, unmarked/marked analysis, types of marks, etc. Some ambiguities in SPPA are also discussed. Results SPPA has a long history in plant ecology and is based on a large set of summary statistics aiming to describe species spatial patterns. Several mechanisms known to be responsible for species spatial patterns are actually investigated in different biomes and for different species. Natural processes, plant environmental conditions, and human intervention are interrelated and are key drivers of plant spatial distribution. In spite of being not recommended, small sample sizes are more common in SPPA. In some areas, periodic forest inventories and permanent plots are scarce although they are key tools for spatial data availability and plant dynamic monitoring. Conclusion The spatial position of plants is an interesting source of information that helps to make hypotheses about processes responsible for plant spatial structures. Despite the continuous progress of SPPA, some ambiguities require further clarifications.

AB Fire regimes are shifting under climate change. Decadal-scale shifts in fire regime can disrupt the biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) within forest ecosystems, but the full extent of these disruptions is unknown. It is also unclear whether these disruptions have consequences for the ecological characteristics (e.g., biomass, abundance, and composition) of microbial and invertebrate communities, which together comprise the majority of terrestrial biodiversity and underpin many ecosystem processes. The theoretical framework of ecological stoichiometry has great potential in this context, but it has rarely been used to develop an integrated understanding of the biogeochemical and ecological effects of altered fire regime across trophic levels. Using one of the world's longest-running fire experiments, located in Queensland, Australia, we carried out a comprehensive investigation into the stoichiometric consequences of a decadal-scale divergence in prescribed fire frequency and their links to coinciding changes in various ecological characteristics of forest floor microbial and invertebrate communities. Compared to long-term fire exclusion, forty-three years of biennial burning led to significantly N-depleted and/or P-enriched stoichiometry in soil, leaf litter, leaf litter-associated microbial biomass, and certain groups of invertebrates, although total invertebrate community stoichiometry was not affected. Microbial biomass was 42% lower in biennially burned soils. Invertebrate community composition differed between fire regime treatments on some sampling dates, but fire regime did not have consistent effects on invertebrate biomass or abundance. Microbial biomass and the abundances of some invertebrate taxa were depressed at particularly low and/or high resource N:P, consistent with a coupling of these variables to the stoichiometric effects of decadal-scale fire regime. Litter transplants likewise indicated that some invertebrate abundances were sensitive to litter properties over 12 months. Together, our results indicate that long-term changes in fire regime can decouple the within-ecosystem cycling of N and P, with N and P cycling growing more and less conservative, respectively, under high-frequency fire in a way that propagates throughout forest floor food webs. Our study provides new insights into the coupled biogeochemical and ecological responses of forest ecosystems to novel fire regimes and establishes a basis for a stoichiometric framework for fire ecology.

AB In fire-prone ecosystems, such as savannas, fire has been a common event for thousands of years. In these biomes, phenology is a functional trait characterizing the responses of plant communities to fire. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of fire on the period of occurrence, seasonality, and number of species expressing vegetative and reproductive phenophases (sprouting, flowering, and fruiting) in a South American savanna community. We burned experimental plots in 2013, and during the subsequent year, we performed monthly evaluations of the presence and absence of vegetative and reproductive structures in 44 species of angiosperms in the control and burned plots. We described plant phenology at two levels: (i) considering all sampled plant species together (community); and (ii) separately considering the species found in the herbaceous-subshrub and shrub-tree layers (vegetation strata). We analyzed the data using circular statistics and generalized linear mixed models. At the community level, fire did not alter the mean period of occurrence of vegetative and reproductive phenophases; however, we observed changes in fruiting seasonality, which were mainly caused by the changes occurring in the shrub-tree layer. Except for those found in the shrub-tree layer, more species expressed the analyzed phenophases after fire compared to the "control" treatment. This study provides information regarding the responses of plants to burning at the end of the dry season, when most anthropogenic fires occur. Additionally, according to climate change predictions, the Southern Hemisphere is expected to experience longer dry seasons, which may contribute to an increased frequency of anthropogenic fires. Therefore, this phenological information can motivate subsidies that are important for the conservation of this biome and management plans related to the prescription of fires.

AB Many countries have undertaken large and high-profile payment-for-ecosystem-services (PES) programs to sustain the use of their natural resources. Nevertheless, few studies have comprehensively examined the impacts of existing PES programs. Grassland Ecological Compensation Policy (GECP) is one of the few pastorally focused PES programs with large investments and long duration, which aim to improve grassland quality and increase herder income. Here we present empirical evidence of the effects of GECP on grassland quality and herder income. Through a thorough and in-depth econometric analysis of remote sensing and household survey data, we find that, although GECP improves grassland quality (albeit to only a small extent) and has a large positive effect on income, it exacerbates existing income inequality among herders within their local communities. The analysis demonstrates that the program has induced herders to change their livestock production behavior. Heterogeneity analysis emphasizes the importance of making sure the programs are flexible and are adapted to local resource circumstances.

AB Apex predators are widely threatened globally and generally considered a priority on the conservation biology agenda. The harpy eagle, Harpia harpyja, is an apex predator threatened by habitat loss and persecution and a flagship species for Neotropical conservation. We investigated the roles of social, economic and environmental factors related to livestock depredation by harpy eagles, causes of reported harpy eagle persecution by local landholders and the intent of future harpy eagle killings. We explored these issues using structured interviews with 184 local livestock owners, who had admitted killing a combined total of 181 harpy eagles. We found that livestock abundance and livestock husbandry were the best positive predictors of levels of self-reported livestock predation by harpy eagles. Domestic livestock reported to be killed by harpy eagles (192) were mainly chickens (47.9%), followed by goats (22.4%), pigs (18.2%) and sheep (8.3%), with pets representing only similar to 3% of kills. Few harpy eagle killings were related to livestock predation, which accounted for less than 20% of all eagles killed. Instead, the main reason for killing harpy eagles was simple curiosity, and many interviewees reported later regretting their acts. Regarding intent to kill harpy eagles in the future, interviewees' perceptions of the threat posed to livestock and humans by eagles, and the subjective norm, were unrelated to intent to kill harpy eagles further. The single most important factor in predicting intent to kill harpy eagles was whether the interviewee had suffered livestock predation by eagles in the past. Additionally, the intention to kill eagles was negatively associated with landholding size. Most of our interviewees were relatively large landowners, but they are typically outnumbered by smallholders who are more likely to persecute harpy eagles. Consequently, education, compensation and tourism activities should be directed to smallholders to mitigate unnecessary persecution and mortality of harpy eagles.

AB The comparative molecular genetic study of museum and modern representatives of cattle breeds can help to elucidate the origin and maintenance of historical genetic components in modern populations. We generated the consensus genotypes for 11 microsatellite loci for 24 museum samples of Kalmyk, Kyrgyz, and Kazakh cattle, dated from the first quarter of the 20th century, and compared them with those of modern Kalmyk, Kyrgyz, and Kazakh white-headed breeds. The level of genetic diversity of the modern Kalmyk and Kyrgyz cattle (uHe = 0.771-0.778) was similar to those observed in the museum samples (uHe = 0.772-0.776), while a visible decrease in genetic variability in the modern Kazakh white-headed breed compared to museum Kazakh cattle was detected (uHe = 0.726 and 0.767, respectively). The PCA plot, F-ST- and Jost's D-based networks, and STRUCTURE clustering provided strong evidence of the maintenance of the historical genetic background in modern populations of Kalmyk and Kyrgyz cattle. In spite of the allele pool of Kazakh white-headed cattle having undergone great changes compared to the museum Kazakh cattle, several animals still carry the visible aspect of the historical genetic components. Our results can be used for the selection of individuals for the creation of gene banks and may significantly improve the efficiency of conservation programs aimed at preserving genetic diversity in the national genetic resources of cattle.

AB Complex agroforestry systems can host similar biodiversity levels to adjacent continuous forests and can offer important ecosystem services for wildlife. Species inhabiting adjacent forests, as well as species that prefer agroforestry systems, can benefit from this habitat matrix. It is necessary, however, to understand the species-specific adaptability to such a complex matrix. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts many endemic species that are threatened with extinction. Its human population relies heavily on agriculture, meaning that finding a balance between crop productivity and biodiversity is key for the long-term sustainability of local communities and wildlife. We aim to determine the influence of the presence of shade trees and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife in coffee home gardens. In West Java, Indonesia, we monitored 23 gardens between April 2018 and March 2021 via camera traps, totalling 3856 days of monitoring in shade-grown and 3338 days in sun-exposed gardens. We also collected data in the nearby montane rainforest, totalling 1183 days of monitoring. We used Generalized Additive Models to estimate the influence of shade cover and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife. The Sunda leopard cat Prionailurus javanensis was found more frequently in shade-grown gardens and used both the forest and agroforest matrix. Wild boars Sus scrofa mostly occurred in gardens adjacent to the forest, while barred buttonquails Turnix suscitator were associated with gardens far (>1 km) from the forest. Several species (civets Viverricula indica and Paradoxus musangus javanicus, Horsfield's treeshrew Tupaia javanica, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis, Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus) were not influenced by shade cover and distance to the forest, suggesting they are well adapted to the agroforestry system. Still, species of high conservation importance, such as Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas, Sunda porcupine Hystrix javanica, and grizzled langur Presbytis comata, were present in the forest but not in the agroforest, suggesting that the replacement of the forest by the agroforestry matrix is still detrimental. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain the complexity of the agroforestry system and connectivity with the neighbouring continuous forest to favour the long-term sustainability of this environment and the conservation of endemic species.

AB Changes in natural habitats for human use can alter the distribution of biodiversity, favoring species that are more tolerant to environmental disturbance. Usually, these species comprise clades of habitat generalists, which have biological mechanisms to colonize environments with different environmental conditions. However, such effects are still poorly understood for most biological groups, such as the Amazon odonates. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effects of land use along an environmental gradient on the phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity of Odonata in the Amazon. We tested the following hypotheses: In deforested areas (e.g., pasture for cattle, palm plantation, and logging), the Odonata community will be more taxonomically and phylogenetically impoverished than in forested areas. We assume that the modification of the natural habitat causes loss of specialist forest species and favors specialist species of open areas and/or habitat generalists. Data sampling was performed in 195 streams under different land-use types: livestock areas, palm monoculture, timber exploitation, and forest areas taken as reference sites. Our results showed that anthropogenic impacts affected the phylogenetic diversity of odonates and the increase in shrub vegetation was related to the increase in the phylogenetic diversity of communities. On the other hand, shrub vegetation is indicative of disturbed areas, where secondary vegetation predominates, with less canopy cover due to the absence or discontinuity of the native tree cover in these habitats. Nonetheless, species richness and abundance were not related to the effects of anthropogenic land use. Finally, our results suggest that the phylogenetic diversity of Amazonian odonates is related to riparian vegetation structure.

AB Small-scale treefall gaps are among the most important forms of forest disturbance in tropical forests. These gaps expose surrounding trees to more light, promoting rapid growth of understory plants. However, the effects of such small-scale disturbances on the distribution of plant water use across tree canopy levels are less known. To address this, we explored plant transpiration response to the death of a large emergent tree, Mortoniodendron anisophyllum Standl. & Steyerm (DBH > 220 cm; height similar to 40 m). Three suppressed, four mid-story, and two subdominant trees were selected within a 50 x 44 m premontane tropical forest plot at the Texas A&M Soltis Center for Research and Education located in Costa Rica. We compared water use rates of the selected trees before (2015) and after (2019) the tree gap using thermal dissipation sap flow sensors. Hemispherical photography indicated a 40% increase in gap fraction as a result of changes in canopy structure after the treefall gap. Micrometeorological differences (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)) could not explain the observed trends. Rather, light penetration, as measured by sensors within the canopy, increased significantly in 2019. One year after the tree fell, the water usage of trees across all canopy levels increased modestly (15%). Moreover, average water usage by understory trees increased by 36%, possibly as a result of the treefall gap, exceeding even that of overstory trees. These observations suggest the possible reallocation of water use between overstory and understory trees in response to the emergent tree death. With increasing global temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns increasing the likelihood of tree mortality in tropical forests, there is a greater need to enhance our understanding of treefall disturbances that have the potential to redistribute resources within forests.

AB Apple powdery mildew (APM), caused by Podosphaera leucotricha, is a constant threat to apple production worldwide. Very little is known about the biology and population structure of this pathogen in the United States and other growing regions, which affects APM management. A total of 253 P. leucotricha isolates, sampled from 10 apple orchards in Washington, New York, and Virginia, were genetically characterized with novel single sequence repeat and mating type markers. Eighty-three multilocus genotypes (MLGs) were identified, most of which were unique to a given orchard. Each isolate carried either a MAT1-1 or a MAT1-2 idiomorph at the mating type locus, indicating that P. leucotricha is heterothallic. Virulence tests on detached apple leaves showed that the 10 most frequent P. leucotricha MLGs were avirulent on a line containing a major resistance gene. Analysis of molecular variance showed significant differentiation (P < 0.001) among populations, a result supported by principal coordinate analysis revealing three genetic groups, each represented by nonoverlapping MLGs from Washington, New York, and Virginia. A Bayesian cluster analysis showed genetic heterogeneity between Washington populations, and a relative migration analysis indicated substantial gene flow among neighboring orchards. Random mating tests indicated that APM epidemics during the active cycle were dominated by clonal reproduction. However, the presence of sexual structures in orchards, the likelihood that five repeated MLGs resulted from sexual reproduction, and high genotypic diversity observed in some populations suggest that sexual spores play some role in APM epidemics.
   IMPORTANCE Understanding the population biology and epidemiology of plant pathogens is essential to develop effective strategies for controlling plant diseases. Herein, we gathered insights into the population biology of P. leucotricha populations from conventional and organic apple orchards in the United States. We showed genetic heterogeneity between P. leucotricha populations in Washington and structure between populations from different U.S. regions, suggesting that short-distance spore dispersal plays an important role in the disease's epidemiology. We presented evidence that P. leucotricha is heterothallic and that populations likely result from a mixed (i.e., sexual and asexual) reproductive system, revealing that the sexual stage contributes to apple powdery mildew epidemics. We showed that the major resistance gene Pl-1 is valuable for apple breeding because virulent isolates have most likely not emerged yet in U.S. commercial orchards. These results will be important to achieve sustainability of disease management strategies and maintenance of plant health in apple orchards.

It aims at ensuring that the species listed in the Annexes of the Habitats Directive show a favourable conservation status, i.e., that they are able to maintain viable populations and that their natural range is sufficient and not decreasing currently, nor will in the future. However, climate change may hamper Habitats Directive species in achieving (or maintaining) a favourable conservation status, particularly when these impacts are amplified by adverse land use. Here, we studied Habitats Directive species in Finland for which >= 70% of the occurrences were recorded with the resolution of <= 100 m. The number of occurrence sites for the 52 species studied ranged from one site to 13,653 sites, summing up to 19,367 sites. For all these sites and their surroundings, we assessed the vulnerabilities caused by climate change and land use. The climate exposure of occurrence sites was measured based on the rapidity of climatic changes (i.e. climate velocity) in three climate variables (growing degree days, mean January air temperature, water balance) at each site. Risks caused by land use were assessed using two negative and four positive variables that respectively described the quantity of land cover and habitats that is either harmful (e.g. clear-cut forest and drained peatlands) or supportive (protected areas and suitable habitats) to species occurrences. To complement climate and land-use variables, three additional variables describing protection status of the sites and the number of occurrences of the same species in the landscape were examined. Comparison of the mean vulnerability values for each species showed that some of the species inhabit, on average, areas with high climate exposure. Moreover, in certain species climate change-induced vulnerabilities consistently coincide with negative land use. However, in many of the 52 species there was large variation in the vulnerability levels between individual occurrence sites, concerning both climate exposure and land-use variables. Considering the vulnerabilities due to climate change separately, 40-60% of the species occurrence sites are expected to face high exposure caused by rapid changes in summer or winter temperatures, which presents challenges in maintaining a favourable conservation status. Our results also revealed numerous species occurrences where high climate velocity coincided with a large amount of negative land use and low amount of suitable habitat, for which climate-wise conservation planning could be targeted.

AB Animal interactions are an integral part of a community's function, with influences ranging from the spatiotemporal habitat use of species to population effects to ecosystem management. Numerous non-native species are established or maintained through stocking in freshwater ecosystems with the potential to affect restoration of native species. Using acoustic telemetry, this study quantified the spatiotemporal co-occurrence of the native top-predator lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) with non-native Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in Lake Ontario over 2.5 years. Core home range overlap was observed during the summer, with depth acting as a mechanism of segregation, but with potential for interactions during vertical exploration. Fine-scale individual pairwise interactions confirmed the home range results. No horizontal overlap was observed during the winter and spring, but confidence was lower due to poor instrument coverage in deeper water, which the two species may frequent in these seasons. These results demonstrate the importance of depth in understanding fish interactions and highlight the usefulness of considering pairwise species interactions for understanding ecosystem community function to resource managers with multiple projects involving both native and non-native species.

AB The objective of the present study was to determine changes in land coverage for 31 satellite cities surrounding Seoul and changes in values of MSPA (Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis) for a time period of about 30 years (from 1988 to 2018). Cities that showed similar environmental changes were grouped utilizing a hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of this study are summarized as follows: First, as a result of analyzing changes in land coverage, urbanized areas in all 31 cities greatly increased, whereas areas of forest, grassland, farmland, wetland, etc., greatly decreased. Second, as a result of carrying out MSPA for green areas in each city, the number of Cores, Islets as stepping-stone green areas, and Branches greatly decreased. As a result of analyzing factors in cluster analysis, 12 variables were classified into four groups. After performing a cluster analysis, the 31 cities were classified into six clusters. Cluster-6 showed the biggest decrease in wetland areas. These results could be used as basic data for establishing differentiated environmental policies for clusters of cities that show similar environmental changes, and for establishing policy priorities that break away from uniform environmental policies at the local level.

AB The temperate forests of northern Mexico possess a great diversity of unique and endemic species, with the greatest associations of pine-oak in the planet occurring within them. However, the ecosystems in this region had experienced an accelerated fragmentation process in the past decades. This study described and quantified the landscape fragmentation level of a degraded watershed located in this region. For that, data from the Landsat series from 1990, 2005 and 2017, classified with the Support Vector Machine method, were used. The landscape structure was analyzed based on six metrics applied at both, the landscape and class levels. Results show considerable gains in surface area for the land use land cover change (LULC) of secondary forest while the Primary Forest (PF) lost 18.1% of its area during 1990-2017. The PF increased its number of patches from 7075 to 12,318, increased its patch density (PD) from 53.51 to 58.46 # of patches/100 ha, and reduced its average patch size from 39.21 to 15.05 ha. This made the PF the most fragmented LULC from the 5 LULCs evaluated. In this study, strong fluctuations in edge density and PD were registered, which indicates the forests of northern Mexico have experienced a reduction in their productivity and have been subjected to a continuous degradation process due to disturbances such as fires, clandestine and non-properly controlled logging, among others.

AB Marine multicellular organisms host a diverse collection of bacteria, archaea, microbial eukaryotes, and viruses that form their microbiome. Such host-associated microbes can significantly influence the host's physiological capacities; however, the identity and functional role(s) of key members of the microbiome ("core microbiome") in most marine hosts coexisting in natural settings remain obscure. Also unclear is how dynamic interactions between hosts and the immense standing pool of microbial genetic variation will affect marine ecosystems' capacity to adjust to environmental changes. Here, we argue that significantly advancing our understanding of how host-associated microbes shape marine hosts' plastic and adaptive responses to environmental change requires (i) recognizing that individual host-microbe systems do not exist in an ecological or evolutionary vacuum and (ii) expanding the field toward long-term, multidisciplinary research on entire communities of hosts and microbes. Natural experiments, such as time-calibrated geological events associated with well-characterized environmental gradients, provide unique ecological and evolutionary contexts to address this challenge. We focus here particularly on mutualistic interactions between hosts and microbes, but note that many of the same lessons and approaches would apply to other types of interactions.

AB The Semi-arid wildlands of the West Bengal state of India are known habitats of Indian Grey Wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) and Striped Hyaena (Hyaena hyaena) in India. However, increasing anthropogenic pressure in these regions is one major factor behind habitat loss and rising carnivore-human conflict. We mapped the suitable habitat and estimated the niche overlap of both species in the study landscape. Further, we assessed the habitat quality, identified corridors and quantified land sharing by both species. The anthropogenic disturbance (human settlements) was found to be one of the most significant contributors for both species. The higher Schoener's D (0.612) and Hellinger's based I value (0.858) indicates a considerable niche overlap of about 3529 km2. We observed a high level of fragmentation in suitable patches of Grey Wolf compared to the Striped Hyaena. For both Striped Hyaena and Grey Wolf, connectivity exists among the large patch of western and southern Purulia and Bankura. The Grey Wolf corridors in the Jhargram district were also found connected with other areas. We found that both the species, which are generally known rivals showing tolerance towards each other, which is an strong evidence of land sharing among the species. We recommend that the suitable patches and corridors identified in the study may be prioritized for conservation and management.

AB Liana dynamics may influence tree dynamics and vice versa. Only long-term studies can perhaps disentangle them. In two permanent plots of lowland dipterocarp forest at Danum, a liana census in 1988 was repeated in 2018. The primary forest was still in a late stage of recovery from an inferred large and natural disturbance in the past. Mean number of lianas per tree decreased by 22% and 34% in plots 1 and 2, and in different ways. By 2018, there were relatively more trees with few lianas and relatively fewer trees with many lianas than in 1988. The redistribution was strongest for overstory trees of the Dipterocarpaceae (more with no lianas by 2018) and understory trees of the Euphorbiaceae (many losing high loads in especially plot 2). Proportion of trees with lianas increased overall by 3.5%. The number of lianas per tree showed a quadratic relationship with tree size: maximal for large trees, and fewer for smaller and very large trees. Tree survival and stem growth rate were significantly negatively related to the number of lianas after accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Monte Carlo random subsampling of trees in 1988 and 2018, to achieve statistical independence, established significance of change. Dipterocarps and euphorbs clearly differed in their liana dynamics between plots. Regression models had different forms for the two plots, which reflected a complicated structural-spatial variability in host-liana dynamics. Analysis of the abundant tree species individually highlighted a group of emergent dipterocarps with low liana counts decreasing with time. Building on an earlier hypothesis for this forest type and site, these very large trees appear to have been losing their lianas by branch shedding, as they moved into and out of the main canopy. They were evidently escaping from the parasite. The process may in part explain the characteristically very uneven forest canopy at Danum. Change in liana density was therefore contingent on both forest history and site succession, and plot-level structure and tree dynamics. Liana promotion in the intermittent ENSO dry periods was seemingly being offset by closing of the forest and dominance by dipterocarps in late seral stages.

AB The Amazon moisture recycling system has been widely examined because it is fundamental to maintain some of the global climate processes, however, we have yet to know to what extent the agricultural growing season is dependent on the evapotranspiration contribution from the Amazon forest. Here we use a moisture tracking model to calculate the forest's contribution to downwind precipitation. Specifically, we calculate the influence of moisture recycling on the seasonality of precipitation in the arc of deforestation with respect to the agricultural growing season. We calculated the wet season start, end and length using three scenarios (a) total precipitation with existing vegetation cover; (b) where we replace forest's contribution to precipitation by replacing it with the equivalent from short vegetation; (c) where the forest's contribution to precipitation is completely removed. We found that forest moisture recycling contributes up to 40% of monthly precipitation in the arc of deforestation. However, there is a strong spatial gradient in the forest's contribution to precipitation, which decreases from west to east. This gradient also coincides with suitability for double-cropping agriculture. Our scenarios excluding precipitation originating from forest indicated that forest is a key contributing factor in determining the wet season start. We found that even when the precipitation originating from forest was replaced by short vegetation there was a significant delay in the wet season start in our study regions. Interestingly the wet season end was more resilient to changes in precipitation source. However it is clear that moisture recycling plays a key role in determining the wet season end as when forest's contribution to precipitation was entirely removed the wet season end arrived significantly earlier. These differences in wet season length were not detectable in the eastern states of Tocantins and Maranhao, as much less of the precipitation in these states originates from the forest. Our findings demonstrate the importance of forest in supporting double-cropping agriculture in the arc of deforestation. As agricultural intensification by double-cropping increases land-use efficiency, it may also reduce the demand for further deforestation. Therefore it is important to identify how the current forest extent provides this important ecosystem service.

AB Although nature-based tourism is increasingly recognized in forest strategies, economic incentives for private landowners supporting the production of amenity values are largely lacking. This study focused on possibilities to enhance the scenic and recreational values of private forests for nature-based tourism in Finland. More specifically, we studied forest owners' attitudes towards - and willingness to participate in - a Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiative called Landscape and Recreation Value Trade. We also investigated the acceptability of forest management alternatives sustaining landscape qualities, the relative importance of different features of Landscape and Recreation Value Trade for landowners, and the magnitude of overall compensation claims of alternative Landscape and Recreation Value Trade models. A choice experiment survey was conducted in Kuusamo, a popular nature-based tourism destination, located in northeastern Finland. The results show that several forest owners were interested in the suggested scheme if economic losses were to be compensated. The landowners' preferences for Landscape and Recreation Value Trade were somewhat heterogeneous, suggesting that private forest owners in Kuusamo have rather diverse motivations and objectives for their ownership. Owners who stated to have scenic landscapes on their land, and those living outside Kuusamo area, were more willing to join in the suggested mechanism. In general, landowners' willingness to participate was strongly dependent on the amount of compensation as well as on other terms of the contract, such as the duration and severity of harvesting restrictions. The largest marginal compensation claims were related to long contract durations and the stringent "no harvesting at all" restriction. Given the heterogeneity in landowners' preferences, a Landscape and Recreation Value Trade model, offering flexibility to join the system, is needed to attract landowners of forests in hotspot locations for tourism that would help in designing a cost-efficient model for practical application.

AB Oysters (Bivalvia: Ostreidae Rafinesque, 1815) live in the intertidal and shallow subtidal areas worldwide. Despite their long evolutionary histories, abundant fossil records, global distribution, and ecological significance, a systematic time-dependent biogeographical analysis of this family is still lacking. Using combined mitochondrial (COI and 16S rRNA) and nuclear (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, H3 and ITS2) gene makers for 80% (70/88) of the recognized extant Ostreidae, we reconstructed the global phylogenetic and biogeographical relationships throughout the evolutionary history of oysters. The result provided a holistic view of the origin, migration and dispersal patterns of Ostreidae. The phylogenetic results and fossil evidence indicated that Ostreidae originated from the circum-Arctic region in the Early Jurassic. The widening of the Atlantic Ocean and changes in the Tethys Ocean further facilitated their subsequent diversification during the Cretaceous and the Palaeogene periods. In particular, Crassostrea and Saccostrea exhibited relatively low dispersal abilities and their major diversifications were consistent with the tectonic events. Environmental adaptations and reproductive patterns, therefore, should play key roles in the formation of oyster distribution patterners, rather than the dispersal ability of their planktonic larvae. The diversity dynamics inferred by standard phylogenetic are consistent with the fossil record, however, further systematic classification, especially for fossil genus Ostrea, would enhance our understanding on extant and fossil oysters. The present study of the historical biogeography of oysters provides new insights into the evolution and speciation of oysters. Our findings also provide a foundation for the assessment of evolutionary patterns and ecological processes in intertidal and inshore life.

AB To contribute to what is known about involvement of vegetation dynamics in Neotropical speciation, we used the Epidendrum latilabre complex, a taxonomically well-defined species group, to investigate past connections between Amazonian (AM) and Atlantic (AF) forests and address the following topics: (1) divergence times between sister species currently distributed in AM and AF; (2) distribution patterns of ancestral species of the E. latilabre complex and (3) potential routes connecting ancestral ranges between AM and AF. We developed a robust phylogenetic estimate for species of the E. latilabre complex by sequencing two nuclear and six plastid loci. Then, we combined divergence time estimation, ancestral range reconstruction and ecological niche modelling. Our biogeographic reconstruction exhibits a complex pattern of connections among tropical forests east of the Andes in South America. The AM and AF species of the E. latilabre complex are intermixed in the results, and climatic shifts during the Pleistocene (Chibanian) are suggested here as a major force promoting speciation. Sister species tend to be ecologically distinct in their climate niche spaces, and vicariance and peripheral isolation are reconstructed as the main drivers of speciation. There is evidence to suggest that the south-east/north-west bridge and the northern/north-eastern coastal route have been occupied by the ancestors of the E. latilabre complex, and alternative routes across the South American dry diagonal were unlikely. Further studies on Neotropical epiphytic taxa are still necessary for understanding the dynamics of historical connections between AM and AF.

AB Human activities have disturbed global phosphorus (P) cycling by introducing substantial amounts of P to natural ecosystems. Although natural P gradients and fertilization studies have found that plant community traits are closely related to P availability, it remains unclear how increased P supply affects plant growth and diversity in P-deficient tropical forests. We used a decadal P-addition experiment (2007-2017) to study the effects of increased P input on plant growth and diversity in understory layer in tropical forests. We monitored the dynamics of seedling growth, survival rate, and diversity of understory plants throughout the fertilization period under control and P addition at 15 g P m-2 yr-1. To identify the drivers of responses, P concentration, photosynthesis rate and nonstructural carbon were analyzed. Results showed that long-term P addition significantly increased P concentrations both in soil pools and plant tissues. However, P addition did not increase the light-saturated photosynthesis rate or growth rate of the understory plants. Furthermore, P addition significantly decreased the survival rate of seedlings and reduced the species richness and density of understory plants. The negative effects of P addition may be attributed to an increased carbon cost due to the tissue maintenance of plants with higher P concentrations. These findings indicate that increased P supply alone is not necessary to benefit the growth of plants in ecosystems with low P availability, and P inputs can inhibit understory plants and may alter community composition. Therefore, we appeal to a need for caution when inputting P to tropical forests ecosystems. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Macroevolutionary studies frequently emphasize the importance of pollinator shifts for driving speciation within the angiosperms. Pollinators have been identified as a driver of diversification in the mega-diverse genus Erica in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, but basic information on pollinator-driven divergence at the initial stages of speciation in this genus is lacking. We focus on two populations of Erica junonia (var. junonia and var. minor) that occur on adjacent mountain ranges separated by c. 10 km and which differ in floral tube length, and ask whether these differences in tube length are associated with a shift between pollinators with different proboscis lengths. In addition, we assess whether the two forms differ in their ability to reproduce in the absence of pollinators. Our findings show that different Erica junonia varieties are visited by different nemestrinid fly species in the genus Moegistorhynchus, and that their floral tube lengths correspond to the proboscis lengths of these flies. Pollinator exclusion experiments show that the short-tubed var. minor is capable of producing seeds in the absence of pollinators, whereas the long-tubed var. junonia depends fully on pollinators. Our study provides an example of pollinator-driven divergence on a small spatial scale and contributes to an understanding of diversification of the genus Erica. (C) 2021 SAAB.

AB Restoration interventions aim to accelerate forest recovery by skipping the early stages of succession where short-lived early-successional tree species dominate. Large trees (>= 30 cm of Diameter at Breast Height [DBH]) provide ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage and acting as stepping stones for the movement of animals through the landscape. Here, we evaluated two mixtures of planted and, unplanted areas to figure out which restoration treatment was more successful in skipping the early stages of succession. For this, we measured forest structure of large trees in restoration settings after 10 years in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. In 2006, cattle grazing was excluded from 24 plots (30 x 30 m). Eight of those plots were planted with 12 wind-dispersed species, eight plots were planted with 12 animal-dispersed species (a total of 2,304 planted trees), and eight plots were left to undergo natural succession without plantings. Planted and naturally recruited trees have been assessed periodically since 2007. A total of 835 planted and naturally recruited trees of 45 species reached large size. Including all trees (planted and recruited), the richness and abundance of late-successional trees was higher in plantings than under natural succession while richness of large recruits of late-successional species was as higher in plantings as in natural succession. Also, including all trees, plantings of animal-dispersed species have higher richness and abundance of trees dispersed by bats and both bats and birds; while species and trees dispersed by birds were present equally at all treatments. Richness and abundance of bat-dispersed recruits were similar in plantings and natural succession while plantings of wind-dispersed species had higher bird-dispersed recruits. Composition heterogeneity, driven by natural recruitment, was largest for early-successional trees in natural succession. After 10 years, the first stages of succession (20-30 years) were skipped in plantings: plantings have higher abundance of large seeded late-successional species. For an overall increase in composition heterogeneity in permanent agricultural landscapes, we suggest establishing areas to undergo natural succession along with plantings that include a higher percentage of late-successional species with large seeds.

AB Large amounts of carbon flow through tropical ecosystems every year, from which a part is sequestered in biomass through tree growth. However, the effects of ongoing warming and drying on tree growth and carbon sequestration in tropical forest is still highly uncertain. Field observations are sparse and limited to a few sites, while remote sensing analysis shows diverging growth responses to past droughts that cannot be interpreted with confidence. To reconcile data from field observations and remote sensing, we collated in situ measurements of stem growth and leaf litterfall from inventory plots across the Amazon region and other neotropical ecosystems. These data were used to train two machine-learning models and to evaluate model performance on reproducing stem growth and litterfall rates. The models utilized multiple climatological variables and other geospatial datasets (terrain, soil and vegetation properties) as explanatory variables. The output consisted of monthly estimates of leaf litterfall (R-2 = 0.71, NRMSE = 9.4 %) and stem growth (R-2 = 0.54, NRMSE = 10.6 %) across the neotropics from 1982 to 2019 at a high spatial resolution (0.1 degrees). Modelled time series allow us to assess the impacts of the 2005 and 2015 droughts in the Amazon basin on regional scales. The more severe 2015 drought was estimated to have caused widespread declines in stem growth (-1.8a), coinciding with enhanced leaf fall (+1.4a), which were only locally apparent in 2005. Regions in the Amazon basin that flushed leaves at the onset of both droughts (+0.9a similar to +2.00) showed positive anomalies in remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index, while sun-induced fluorescence and vegetation optical depth were reduced. The previously observed counterintuitive response of canopy greenup during drought in the Amazon basin detected by many remote sensing analyses can therefore be a result of enhanced leaf flushing at the onset of a drought. The long-term estimates of leaf litterfall and stem growth point to a decline in stem growth and a simultaneous increase in leaf litterfall in the Amazon basin since 1982. These trends are associated with increased warming and drying of the Amazonian climate and could point to a further decline in the Amazon carbon sink strength.

AB Biological repellents have been used as a control method to mitigate human-wildlife conflict worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the effect of jaguar (Panthera onca) feces as a repellent for a free-living urban population of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), which are considered a vertebrate pest in some regions of their range. Observational data were collected during two consecutive 5-day periods: control and treatment. Scan samples within a 2-h observational session were carried out, recording capybara incursions into a 15 m x 15 m marked perimeter and alertness behavioral state. During the treatment period, 30 g of jaguar feces were added daily every 5.0 m around the perimeter in four selected areas (around Lake Paranoa, Brasilia, Brazil) frequented by capybara. The presence of predator feces induced changes in capybaras' behavior as there was a decrease in actual presence at the sites as a whole with the presence of jaguar feces. Of those capybaras that did continue to visit a site, incursions into the marked perimeter were initially greatly reduced, but did rebound relatively rapidly over the trial period. Although our results showed that capybaras recognize jaguar's feces as a predator threat, odor habituation may limit the repellent's efficacy at a local level, but appeared to have a longer term effect on the overall numbers of capybara visiting a site in general. Improvements in this technique will be required for it to become practicable, to reinforce capybaras' aversion to predators, to decrease their habituation to predator's feces, and to provide more humanitarian control.

AB Information about the distribution of alleles among marine populations is critical for determining patterns of genetic connectivity that are essential in modern conservation planning. To estimate population connectivity in Singapore's urbanized equatorial reef system, we analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from two species of reef-building corals with distinct life histories. For Porites sp., a broadcast-spawning coral, we found cryptic lineages that were differentially distributed at inshore and central-offshore sites that could be attributed to contemporary surface current regimes. Near panmixia was observed for Pocillopora acuta with differentiation of colonies at the farthest site from mainland Singapore, a possible consequence of the brooding nature and relatively long pelagic larval duration of the species. Furthermore, analysis of recent gene flow showed that 60-80% of colonies in each population were nonmigrants, underscoring self-recruitment as an important demographic process in this reef system. Apart from helping to enhance the management of Singapore's coral reef ecosystems, findings here pave the way for better understanding of the evolution of marine populations in South-East Asia.

AB Understanding the timescales that shape spatial genetic structure is pivotal to ascertain the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity and reproductive viability of long-lived plant populations. Combining genetic and ecological information with current and past fragmentation conditions allows the identification of the main drivers important in shaping population structure and declines in reproduction, which is crucial for informing conservation strategies. Using historic aerial photographs, we defined the past fragmentation conditions for the shrub Conospermum undulatum, a species now completely embedded in an urban area. We explored the impact of current and past conditions on its genetic layout and assessed the effects of genetic and environmental factors on its reproduction. The historically high structural connectivity was evident in the genetics of the species. Despite the current intense fragmentation, we found similar levels of genetic diversity across populations and a weak spatial genetic structure. Historical connectivity was negatively associated with genetic differentiation among populations and positively related to within-population genetic diversity. Variation partitioning of reproductive performance explained similar to 66% of the variance, showing significant influences for genetic (9%), environmental (15%), and combined (42%) fractions. Our study highlights the importance of considering the historical habitat dynamics when investigating fragmentation consequences in long-lived plants. A detailed characterization of fragmentation from 1953 has shown how low levels of genetic fixation are due to extensive gene flow through the non-fragmented landscape. Moreover, knowledge of the relationships between genetic and environmental variation and reproduction can help to implement effective conservation strategies, particularly in highly dynamic landscapes.

AB Emergent neutrality (EN) suggests that species must be sufficiently similar or sufficiently different in their niches to avoid interspecific competition. Such a scenario results in a transient pattern with clumps and gaps of species abundance along the niche axis (e.g. represented by body size). From this perspective, clumps are groups of coexisting species with negligible fitness differences and stochastic abundance fluctuations. Plankton is an excellent model system for developing and testing ecological theories, especially those related to size structure and species coexistence. We tested EN predictions using the phytoplankton community along the course of a tropical river considering 1) body size structure, 2) functional clustering of species in terms of morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and 3) the functional similarity among species concerning their functional traits. Two main clumps in the body size axis (clump I and II) were conspicuous through time and were detected in different stretches of the river. Clump I comprised medium-sized species from the MBFGs IV, V and VI while clump II included large-bodied species from the MBFGs V and VI. Pairwise differences in species biovolume correlated with species functional similarity when the whole species pool was considered, but not among species within the same clump. Although clumps comprised multiple MBFGs, the dominant species within the clump belonged always to the same MBFG. Also, within-clump species biovolume increased with functional distinctiveness considering both seasons and stretches, except the lower course. These results suggest that species within clumps behave in a quasi-neutral state, but even minor shifts in trait composition may affect species biovolume. Our findings point that EN belongs to the plausible mechanisms explaining community assembly in river ecosystems.

AB 1. Recent studies demonstrate that ecological and evolutionary processes can occur over similar temporal and spatial scales and might thus frequently interact. Although concepts such as the evolving metacommunity, diffuse (co)evolution and community genetics integrate multi-species dynamics, most experimental studies usually consider how evolution affects only one focal species. Hence, our understanding of evolution in multi-species communities is still underdeveloped.
   2. We highlight key community and evolutionary mechanisms and their interactions to facilitate a broader understanding of evolution in multi-species communities. We propose a framework that explicitly considers interactions between each of the four analogous processes of evolutionary biology (selection, gene flow, genetic drift and mutation) and community ecology (species sorting, dispersal, ecological drift and speciation).
   3. Focusing on interactions between processes of evolutionary biology and community ecology enables explorations of the full range of eco-evolutionary dynamics in multi-species communities and guides the design of novel experiments. Furthermore, the proposed framework develops a shared language between evolutionary biologists and community ecologists and indicates new research avenues.
   4. Overall, we propose that explicitly incorporating interactions between these evolutionary and community processes to study eco-evolutionary dynamics in multi-species communities will better inform broader questions about the maintenance of diversity and the resilience of diverse communities to disturbances, both natural and manmade.

AB Capsule Sooty Falcon Falco concolor movement patterns were strongly dependent on the phase of their annual cycle, and were clearly discernible in terms of the average hourly travel speeds of falcons during those phases. Aims To better understand the movements of Sooty Falcons on migration, during the winter and as non-breeding individuals. Methods Eleven Sooty Falcons were tracked via satellite, and their movements were analysed. Results Movement patterns were strongly dependent on the phases of the annual cycle. Falcons exhibited limited movement (i.e. shortest step-lengths and smallest areas) when on the wintering and breeding grounds. Migration to and from the wintering grounds in Madagascar was characterized by high movement rates (long step-lengths), sometimes over 50 km/h. Some Sooty Falcons stopped on the African mainland coast prior to crossing the Mozambique Channel. Movement patterns during winter were similar to those exhibited by falcons while summering, except that the movements of breeding birds were spatially more restricted. Conclusions Our results highlight the need for conservation approaches appropriate to the different phases of the annual cycle, including the importance of areas immediately around island breeding sites, summering and coastal staging areas, and the need to support prey abundance along the migration route and on wintering grounds.

AB Resprouting is an efficient life history strategy by which woody savanna species can recover their aboveground biomass after fire. However, resprouting dynamics after fire and the time it takes to start producing flowers and fruits are still poorly understood, especially for the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado biome), where fire is an important driver of vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning. We investigated the resprouting dynamics and production of flowers and fruits of 26 woody species (20 tree and 6 shrub species for a total of 485 individuals) that were burned and the production of flowers and fruits for a subset of 12 species (139 individuals) in an unburned area in a Brazilian savanna. We classified the species' resprouting strategies as hypogeal (at the soil level, with main stem death), epigeal (on the main stem or crown), and hypogeal + epigeal. We used generalized linear mixed-effect models to identify the post-fire recovery patterns for five years. Individuals with basal resprouts (hypogeal and hypogeal + epigeal resprouting) produced an average of 6 basal resprouts, but only 33% of resprouts survived after five years. Individuals in burned areas produced fewer flowers and fruits than individuals in unburned areas. At least a subset of individuals in all the resprouting strategies started to produce flowers and fruits in the first-year post-fire. About 68% of the species with hypogeal resprouts produced flowers and fruits in the first-year post-fire, but the intensity of flowering and fruiting was lower compared to individuals with other resprouting strategies over time. Although woody species have invested in post-fire growth and sexual reproduction in all resprouting strategies, the long time needed to recover these processes can make these species more vulnerable to frequent fires.

AB There are multiple pressures on Amazon forests due to, anthropic activities such as extensive cattle ranching, logging, and legal and illegal crops. These pressures generate highly fragmented landscapes that leads to an increase in forest edges. Thus, forest vegetation exposed to the surrounding open environment generates a series of direct effects that extend into the interior of the forest. Changes in the microclimate are among the most notable effects, and these can impact the composition and structure of the vegetation and affect the alteration of multiple ecological processes and ecosystem services. To better understand these consequences, we evaluated the distance of the edge influence on the microclimate, the composition of the vegetation, and the forest structure in the northern Amazon. We considered two types of edges according to adjacent cover: grasslands dedicated to extensive cattle ranching and rubber plantations (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A.Juss.) Mull.Arg.). We recorded significant differences in the composition and abundance of plants of all size categories. We found less richness and dominance of generalist species, that are characteristic of disturbed environments, in the forest sector adjacent to pastures. These edges had also lower humidity and higher temperatures than rubber plantations ones. The distance from the edge to the interior also affected the structure of the vegetation, with a higher density of individuals in the interior of the forest and significant differences in the diameter and height of individuals. We argue that the rubber plantations could be used as a forest management strategy of drought adaptation since it forms a less abrupt border and has a buffer function, keeping higher humidity values and lower temperatures than forest edges adjacent to pastures.

AB To determine the diversity and connectivity of infections in Northwestern and Southwestern Cameroon, 232 Plasmodium falciparum infections, collected in 2018 from the Ndop Health District (NHD) in the western savannah highlands in the Northwest and the Limbe Health District (LHD) in the coastal lowland forests in the Southwest of Cameroon were genotyped for nine neutral microsatellite markers. Overall infection complexity and genetic diversity was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in NHD than LHD, (Mean MOI = 2.45 vs. 2.97; Fws = 0.42 vs. 0.47; Mean He = 0.84 vs. 0.89, respectively). Multi-locus linkage disequilibrium was generally low but significantly higher in the NHD than LHD population (mean I-A(S)= 0.376 vs 0.093). Consequently, highly related pairs of isolates were observed in NHD (mean IBS = 0.086) compared to those from the LHD (mean IBS = 0.059). Infections from the two regions were mostly unrelated (mean IBS = 0.059), though the overall genetic differentiation across the geographical range was low. Indices of differentiation between the populations were however significant (overall pairwise Fst = 0.048, Jost's D = 0.133, p < 0.01). Despite the high human migration across the 270km separating the study sites, these results suggest significant restrictions to gene flow against contiguous geospatial transmission of malaria in west Cameroon. Clonal infections in the highland sites could be driven by lower levels of malaria prevalence and seasonal transmission. How these differences in genetic diversity and complexity affect responses to interventions such as drugs will require further investigations from broader community sampling.

AB Conservation is predominantly an exercise in trying to change human behaviour - whether that of consumers whose choices drive unsustainable resource use, of land managers clearing natural habitats, or of policymakers failing to deliver on environmental commitments. Yet conservation research and practice have made only limited use of recent advances in behavioural science, including more novel behaviour change interventions. Instead conservationists mostly still rely on traditional behaviour change interventions - education, regulation and material incentivisation - largely without applying recent insights from behavioural science about how to improve such approaches. This paper explores how behavioural science could be more widely and powerfully applied in biodiversity conservation. We consider the diverse cast of actors involved in conservation problems and the resulting breadth of behaviour change that conservationists might want to achieve. Drawing on health research, we present a catalogue of types of interventions for changing behaviour, considering both novel, standalone interventions and the enhancement of more traditional conservation interventions. We outline a framework for setting priorities among interventions based on their likely impact, using ideas developed for climate change mitigation. We caution that, despite its promise, behavioural science is not a silver bullet for conservation. The effects of interventions aimed at changing behaviour can be modest, temporary, and context dependent in ways that are as-yet poorly understood. We therefore close with a call for interventions to be tested and the findings widely disseminated to enable researchers and practitioners to build a much-needed evidence base on the effectiveness and limitations of these tools.

AB Aim The island species-area relationship (ISAR) quantifies how the number of species increases as the area of an island or island-like habitat gets larger and is one of the most general patterns in ecology. However, studies that measure the ISAR often confound variation in sampling methodology and analyses, precluding appropriate syntheses of its underlying mechanisms. Most ISAR studies use only presence-absence data at the whole-island scale, whereas we planned to use a framework that applies individual-based rarefaction to synthesize whether and how the ISAR differs from the null expectation of the passive sampling hypothesis. Location Five hundred and five islands from 34 different archipelagos across the world, including oceanic islands, lake islands and forest islands. Major taxa studied Local assemblages of plants, invertebrates, herpetofauna, birds and mammals. Methods We collated local-scale species abundance data from multiple archipelagos (median of 12 islands per study) and used a rarefaction-based approach to synthesize the relationship between island size and (1) sample effort-controlled rarefied species richness, or (2) an effective number of species derived from the probability of interspecific encounter (an index of community evenness). Results When we applied rarefaction to control for sampling effort, the numbers of species and their relative abundances across all studies differed from the passive sampling hypothesis. Our measure of evenness also increased with island size, suggesting that the disproportionate effects we observed influenced both rarer and more common species. We found few associations between the slope of this effect and island type or taxon, but we did find that island archipelagos with greater elevational heterogeneity also deviated more from the null expectation than those with less heterogeneity. Main conclusions Using a synthetic approach across island archipelagos, we reject the null expectation that passive sampling causes the ISAR and instead suggest that ecological mechanisms leading to disproportionate (non-random) effects on larger relative to smaller islands are predominant.

AB Internally fertilized animals are characterized by the transfer of their spermatozoa during copulation. However, the duration of copulation is highly variable, which suggests that they may serve for other functions apart from spermatozoa transfer. For example, during copulation, males can stimulate the female by using genitalic movements and/or by positioning their spermatozoa adequately within the female genitalia. In the spider Holocnemus pluchei, males perform strong squeezes and torsion movements with their pedipalps (part of their genitalia actively related to copulation) inside the female genitalia and transfer their spermatozoa during Phase I of copulation. However, the exact moment in which such transfer occurs and its relation to the pedipalp movements are still unknown. Herein, we first have identified the precise moment when the spermatozoa transfer occurs during phase I and its relation to genital movements by interrupting mating couples at the beginning, at middle and at end of this phase. Subsequently, the spermatozoa number remaining in male genitalia and stored in female genitalia were counted. We detected no relation between the number of genital movements and the spermatozoa number present in both, female and male genitalia and body size. As stated above, male genital movements serve another role during copulation in addition to spermatozoa transfer in a context of post-copulatory sexual selection; most likely, they stimulate the female in a cryptic female choice framework.

AB The structure and dynamics of breast tissue bacteria can have far-reaching influences on women's health, particularly on breast tumor development. However, there is little understanding on the ecological processes that shape the structure and dynamics of breast tissue bacteria. Here, we fill the gap by applying three metacommunity models for investigating the community assembly and diversity maintenance, including Sloan near neutral model, Harris et al. multisite neutral and Tang & Zhou niche-neutral hybrid models to reanalyze the 16S-rRNA sequencing datasets of 23 healthy, 12 benign tumor, and 33 malignant tumor tissue samples. First, we found that, at the community/metacommunity levels, the mechanisms of bacteria assembly and diversity maintenance of breast tissue bacteria were moderately influenced by stochastic drifts of bacteria demography (division, death, and dispersal of bacterial cells). At species level, on average, approximately 10 and 5% species were above (positively selected) and below (negatively selected) neutral, respectively. Furthermore, malignant tumor may raise the positively selected species up to 17%. Second, malignant tumor appears to inhibit microbial dispersal as evidenced by lowered migration rates, compared with the migration in normal and benign tumor tissues. These theoretic findings can be inspirational for further investigating the relationships between tissue bacteria and breast tumor progression/development.

AB Stable species coexistence is a result of a balance between niche and fitness differences. One of the most common competitive patterns that arise from interactions between closely related species is character displacement, which may lead to divergence of certain traits and niche partitioning in areas where species co-occur. In this study, we used data on 35 groups of two parapatric tamarins (Saguinus midas and S. bicolor) to test for asymmetries in group size and competitively driven divergence in forest strata use, under the influence of resource availability fluctuation across the year. We hypothesised that S. midas is competitively superior to S. bicolor, and this would result from differences in fitness-related traits (group size). If so, species patterns of vertical habitat across the year should shift in sympatry relative to allopatry. We found that species had similar group sizes, suggesting they have similar competitive abilities. Further, both pied and red-handed tamarins used lower heights whenever in larger groups, which may be related to a diet shift in response to increases in intragroup competition. In addition, we refuted our prediction of vertical niche partitioning in sympatry. Instead, S. midas moved upwards into the canopy with increasing rainfall over the year (a proxy for resource availability) both in sympatry and allopatry, whereas S. bicolor was unresponsive to both rainfall and geographic contact with S. midas groups. Therefore, the difference in vertical habitat use between these species over part of the year is probably more related to the degree of resource seasonality experienced by each species within their ranges, than to competition.

AB Phylogeography infers the demographic history of various species by resolving genetic relationships among populations across a geographic range. Comparison of phylogeographic patterns of multiple species with similar geographic distributions, i.e., comparative phylogeography, allows us to assess the roles of regional historical events and species-specific ecological factors in shaping intraspecific genetic diversity, providing model systems for studying the processes and genetic basis of adaptive evolution and speciation. In addition, these patterns can also be compared among species from different regions to infer the impact of global-scale historical and present events, such as Pleistocene glacial cycles, on current biodiversity. In this review, I summarize and integrate recent findings of phylogeographic studies for two geographic lineages, Pacific Ocean (PO) and Sea of Japan (SJ) lineages, of five coastal gobies distributed around the Japanese Archipelago. Using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers, these studies revealed genetic divergences of the PO and SJ lineages in the coastal gobies. However, the two types of markers showed discordant patterns for genetic divergences between the two lineages (mitonuclear discordance), suggesting different coalescent processes between these genetic markers. Ecological features that depend on shallow coastal resources may contribute to restricted gene flow and be responsible for the existence of the two lineages that are predominantly found in the coastal gobies. All coastal gobies shared sharp contrasts in genetic diversity between the two lineages, with the SJ lineages rapidly expanding during Pleistocene interglacial periods. Such rapid population expansions can provide alternative ways to obtain recent calibration points to estimate divergence times of the two lineages. A comparison of the geographic distributions between the two lineages indicated that the centers of their secondary contact zones vary, which may appear to represent the continuous transition process of the two lineage distributions. Compared with results of phylogeographic studies from other oceans, multiple divergence times, sharply contrasting demographic histories, and two independent secondary contact zones are unique characteristics of the divergence between the PO and SJ lineages. These characteristics will allow us to test the continuous processes of genomic divergence during geographical isolation with environmental fluctuations and the consequences of hybridization of divergent lineages in independent secondary contact zones with different environmental settings.

AB Background Local breeds retained unique genetic variability important for adaptive potential especially in light of challenges related to climate change. Our first objective was to perform, for the first time, a genome-wide diversity characterization using Illumina GoatSNP50 BeadChip of autochthonous Dreznica goat breed from Slovenia, and five and one local breeds from neighboring Austria and Italy, respectively. For optimal conservation and breeding programs of endangered local breeds, it is important to detect past admixture events and strive for preservation of purebred representatives of each breed with low or without admixture. In the second objective, we hence investigated the effect of inclusion or exclusion of outliers from datasets on genetic diversity and population structure parameters. Results Distinct genetic origin of the Dreznica goat was demonstrated as having closest nodes to Austrian and Italian breeds. A phylogenetic study of these breeds with other goat breeds having SNP data available in the DRYAD repository positioned them in the alpine, European and global context. Swiss breeds clustered with cosmopolitan alpine breeds and were closer to French and Spanish breeds. On the other hand, the Dreznica goat, Austrian and Italian breeds were closer to Turkish breeds. Datasets where outliers were excluded affected estimates of genetic diversity parameters within the breed and increased the pairwise genetic distances between most of the breeds. Alpine breeds, including Dreznica, Austrian and Italian goats analyzed here, still exhibit relatively high levels of genetic variability, homogeneous genetic structure and strong geographical partitioning. Conclusions Genetic diversity analyses revealed that the Slovenian Dreznica goat has a distinct genetic identity and is closely related to the neighboring Austrian and Italian alpine breeds. These results expand our knowledge on phylogeny of goat breeds from easternmost part of the European Alps. The here employed outlier test and datasets optimization approaches provided an objective and statistically powerful tool for removal of admixed outliers. Importance of this test in selecting the representatives of each breed is warranted to obtain more objective diversity parameters and phylogenetic analysis. Such parameters are often the basis of breeding and management programs and are therefore important for preserving genetic variability and uniqueness of local rare breeds.

AB Boreal peatlands of Alberta (Canada) are heavily dissected by a large network of linear disturbances, including seismic lines used for Oil and Gas exploration. Edge effects resulting from these linear disturbances can increase their footprint and affect wildlife habitat, including the quality and quantity of plant and lichen forage. In 2012, seismic line restoration became a priority in Alberta, under the realm of restoration of habitat of threatened boreal woodland caribou. More accurate understanding of biotic and abiotic interactions leading to edge effects can be important in choosing appropriate restoration practices and prompting natural regeneration. We assessed the extent of edge effects of seismic lines on the adjacent boreal peatland near Peace River, northwestern Alberta. We compared plant and lichen community composition and environmental conditions on seismic lines and along 22 transects, which extended perpendicularly 75 m into the peatland from both lines edges. Soil moisture and light were higher on the lines, but frozen ground was less frequent than in the adjacent peatland. Seismic lines were also subsided by approximately 1.2 cm. Lichens were less abundant in the 2-25 m zone from the edge-indicating edge effects. On the lines, Sphagnum constituted a nearly 100% cover while lichens, trees, herbs, and other bryophytes were less abundant than in the peatland. We demonstrate how knowledge of edge effects on plants and lichens could be applied in assessing caribou habitat quality based on forage availability and predation risk, and how such knowledge could inform restoration practices of seismic lines in peatlands.

AB The maintenance of seedling diversity of animal-dispersed tree species is fundamental for the structure and function of forest patches in fragmented tropical rainforests. Nonetheless, the effects of landscape structure at different spatial scales on alpha- and beta-diversity of tree seedling communities are recently explored. Using a multi-scale approach, we assessed the relative effect of landscape composition and configuration on alpha- and beta-diversity of animal-dispersed seedlings within 16 forest patches in the Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. We assessed these effects at 13 spatial scales (from 300 to 1500 m radius, at 100 m intervals) for three metrics of effective number of species considering alpha- and beta-diversity. We found that alpha-diversity was largely affected by landscape composition and beta-diversity by landscape configuration. On the one hand, the amount of secondary forest influenced alpha-diversity. Additionally, species richness increased in landscapes with highly aggregated forest patches. On the other hand, beta-diversity was affected positively by forest fragmentation and negatively by the edge contrast of forest patches with the surrounding matrix. Our findings indicate that landscape configuration is a strong driver of seedling diversity in highly deforested rainforests. Promoting forest patches and secondary forests through payment for ecosystem services' programs, favoring matrix quality within land-sharing schemes of smallholder agriculture and secondary forest management, and identifying restoration opportunities for assisted or unassisted natural regeneration are urgently needed for conservation of seedling diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes.

AB The conversion of tropical habitats has dramatic implications on biodiversity and represents one of the greatest conservation challenges of our time. Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF), which are disjointly distributed throughout the Neotropics, are especially susceptible to human activities. The Caatinga Dry Forest, located in the semi-arid interior of northeastern Brazil, represents not only the largest and most biologically diverse nucleus of SDTF, but also the world's most densely populated semi-arid region, with ever-growing pressure on its natural resources. To prevent illegal logging, conservation agencies looked at forest management, where an area is divided in smaller stands which are gradually logged and allowed to regrow for a period of time, when a new cutting cycle should reinitiate. The impacts of these management schemes on biodiversity, however, remain largely untested. We conducted standardized avian surveys to evaluate the effects of forest management on the avian community at a 1,670 ha privately owned property located on the Chapada do Araripe, northeastern Brazil. This area was divided in 22 forest stands, half of which had already been logged at the time of our sampling, creating a gradient of logged and natural forests and an 11-yr chrono-sequence of forest regeneration. Our results show that logged areas present fewer individuals, fewer species, and different avian assemblages than unlogged forests. Such differences are mostly driven by forest-dependent species, which were overwhelmingly affected by forest management. Our results show that although logged forests tend to recover its height after a decade, they do not recover the originally forest cover, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Likewise, decade-long recovering stands continue to show lower species richness, lower bird abundance, and different avian composition than unlogged forests. We identified a set of bird species that are more affected by forest management (ecological losers) and a group of birds that apparently benefit from the referred changes in land use (ecological winners). We conclude that completely managing an entire area may cause the extirpation of several forest-dependent species. We therefore suggest keeping logged and unlogged plots intermingled, to avoid local extinctions and the complete modification of the original avifauna.

AB Forest structure and composition change are driven by complex interactions among local site factors, past site history, and region-specific socio-demographic factors. Previous studies suggest the structural, functional, taxonomic, and carbon storage potential of vegetation increases during succession. However, information on these attributes along an altitudinal gradient from the North East India is lacking for the old growth secondary forests. Therefore, the present study investigates (i) tree diversity and biomass carbon storage, and (ii) dominating and carbon important tree species, along an altitudinal gradient (30-700 m) in the tropical semi-evergreen forests of southern Assam. Random quadrats of 0.1 ha were laid over selected elevation gradient of secondary forest to evaluate tree diversity, density, basal area, and biomass carbon stock. Shannon-wiener index increases from 2.88 (at 30 m) to 3.33 (at 700 m) indicating an increase in species diversity with elevation. The stand density ranges from 920-1630 stems ha(-1) and reciprocally related to the altitude. Palaquium polyanthum, Dysoxylum binectariferum, and Maniltoa polyandra were the most dominant species at 30 m, 300 m and 700 m, respectively. Biomass carbon stock decreases with the increase in altitude and ranges from 71.20 to 77.47 Mg ha(-1). Palaquium ployanthum, Sterculia sp. and Syzygium cumini were the most carbon important species at 30 m, 300 m and 700 m, respectively. Present study suggests conservation and management of old-growth secondary forests have carbon storage and regional climate benefits. Management of such secondary forests can also enhance the resiliency of forest ecosystems to nature conservancy.

AB Downy mildews caused by obligate biotrophic oomycetes result in severe crop losses worldwide. Among these pathogens, Pseudoperonospora cubensis and P. humuli, two closely related oomycetes, adversely affect cucurbits and hop, respectively. Discordant hypotheses concerning their taxonomic relationships have been proposed based on host-pathogen interactions and specificity evidence and gene sequences of a few individuals, but population genetics evidence supporting these scenarios is missing. Furthermore, nuclear and mitochondrial regions of both pathogens have been analyzed using microsatellites and phylogenetically informative molecular markers, but extensive comparative population genetics research has not been done. Here, we genotyped 138 current and historical herbarium specimens of those two taxa using microsatellites (SSRs). Our goals were to assess genetic diversity and spatial distribution, to infer the evolutionary history of P. cubensis and P. humuli, and to visualize genome-scale organizational relationship between both pathogens. High genetic diversity, modest gene flow, and presence of population structure, particularly in P. cubensis, were observed. When tested for cross-amplification, 20 out of 27 P. cubensis-derived gSSRs cross-amplified DNA of P. humuli individuals, but few amplified DNA of downy mildew pathogens from related genera. Collectively, our analyses provided a definite argument for the hypothesis that both pathogens are distinct species, and suggested further speciation in the P. cubensis complex.

AB Tree species that are successful in tropical lowlands have different acquisition strategies to overcome soil phosphorus (P) limitations. Some of these strategies belowground include adjustments in fine-root traits, such as morphology, architecture, association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and phosphatase activity. Trade-offs among P-acquisition strategies are expected because of their respective carbon cost. However, empirical evidence remains scarce which hinders our understanding of soil P-acquisition processes in tropical forests. Here, we measured seven fine-root functional traits related to P acquisition of five common tree species in three sites of the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico. We then described species-specific P-acquisition strategies and explored the changes in fine-root trait expression from 6 months before to 6 months after two consecutive hurricanes, Irma and Maria, passed over the island. We found that variations in root trait expression were driven mainly by the large interspecific differences across the three selected sites. In addition, we revealed a trade-off between highly colonized fine roots with high phosphatase activity and fine roots that have a high degree of branching. Furthermore, the former strategy was adopted by pioneer species (Spathodea campanulata and Cecropia schreberiana), whereas the latter was adopted by non-pioneer species (mostly Dacryodes excelsa and Prestoea montana). Additionally, we found that root trait expression did not change comparing 6 months before and after the hurricanes, with the exception of root phosphatase activity. Altogether, our results suggest a combination of structural and physiological root traits for soil P acquisition in P-poor tropical soils by common tropical tree species, and show stability on most of the root trait expression after hurricane disturbances.

AB Anuran amphibians are extremely sensitive to changes in the environment and are severely threatened with extinction by human activities. The conversion of natural habitats to tree plantations is expanding in southern Brazil, emphasising the need for both scientists and society to understand the potential effects of this practice on animal communities. Here, we evaluated whether the richness, composition and abundance of leaf-litter frogs change among natural forests, plantations of the native Araucaria angustifolia and plantations of an introduced pine Pinus spp. We obtained data on the composition of the leaf-litter frog assemblages by sampling natural forest and tree plantations in the Passo Fundo National Forest, southern Brazil. We sampled leaf-litter frogs using pitfall trap arrays from March 2017 to February 2018. We used generalised linear mixed models to estimate the effect of habitat type on leaf-litter frogs while considering variation induced by season effect and spatial autocorrelation. We recorded 311 individual leaf-litter frogs belonging to nine species and five families. We did not find differences in species richness and composition, total abundance and abundance of the most frequent species Physalaemus cuvieri, P. carrizorum and Rhinella icterica among Pinus plantations, Araucaria angustifolia plantations and natural forests. These results indicate that tree plantations and natural forests can be equally suitable to leaf-litter frogs. Such suitability is promoted by the light levels of management exerted on these plantations, the old age of the plantations and the heterogeneous mosaic of habitat types maintained within this National Forest. Our study shows that some management decisions can preserve habitat quality to wildlife in modified landscapes.

AB Non-native invasive grasses are driving intense fires across the globe but the impacts of native versus invader-fuelled fires on community assemblages are poorly understood. By increasing fire intensity, grass invasions might increase below-ground mortality of heat-sensitive seeds and buds, thereby shifting community composition. We compared fuel loads in native and non-native invasive (cogongrass, Imperata cylindrica) plant-dominated areas of pine savannas in Florida. Then, we conducted a field experiment to examine how fuel loads and native and invasive fuel types affected soil heating and seedling emergence or resprouting of native and invasive plant species. Average fuel loads in invaded communities were 152% greater than that in native communities. Soil heating, including heating duration >60 degrees C, maximum temperature and heat flux >60 degrees C, increased, and seedling emergence and resprouting decreased with greater fuel loads; these relationships were similar across the overlapping range of native and invasive fuel loads. However, longer durations of soil heating at the higher average fuel loads of invaded communities resulted in 23% lower predicted probability of seedling emergence compared to average fuel loads of native communities. Invasive cogongrass resprouting was not affected by fuel loads, indicating that cogongrass tolerates the intense fires it generates. In contrast, seedling emergence and resprouting of most other species was reduced by greater fuel loads. Synthesis and applications. By increasing fuel loading and soil heating, grass invasions may alter post-fire community assemblages and facilitate invasive grass dominance at the expense of native species via an invasion-fire cycle. Fuel loads can be used to predict soil heating duration and depth, and these data, combined with information on species tolerances to heating, can be used to forecast the impacts of invasions on post-fire community composition. To maintain fire regimes that promote native communities and resist invader dominance, it is critical to manage invasive species that increase fuel loads.

AB Interspecific facilitation is a widely recognized process structuring natural communities. Benthic invertebrates are known to facilitate other invertebrates but how the former affect macroalgae has been rarely investigated. In the present study we explore some of the mechanisms underpinning the facilitation of the kelp Undaria pinnatifida by the solitary ascidian Styela clava, two species introduced worldwide. First, we evaluated the relationship between habitat complexity and the recruitment of U. pinnatifida in natural assemblages using the height and density of S. clava as proxies of habitat complexity. Second, we experimentally assessed the effect of habitat complexity using two sizes of mimics of S. clava arranged at two density levels in a crossed-factor design. Finally, we tested whether the biologic effect of S. clava was more important than its physical effect, by comparing U. pinnatifida's recruitment on live S. clava and on the mimics. We observed a positive effect of height on U. pinnatifida's recruitment in natural assemblages as well as through the experimental approach using the mimics. In addition, an effect of density and the interaction between density and height was observed in natural assemblages exclusively. We also found a strong positive effect due to biological features, as U. pinnatifida recruited more than ten times more on live S. clava than on the mimics. Our results indicate that a biologic non-trophic effect plays a more important role in this facilitation process than the structure alone.

AB Assessing resilience of ecological communities, the ability of species assemblages to return to a previous state following disturbance, is an essential task when designing biodiversity friendly concepts for silvicultural management regimes. However, ecological communities may demonstrate resilience only after long time periods, and long-term data, collected on permanent study sites within standardized sampling frameworks, are scarce. We assessed the resilience of amphibian assemblages to disturbance via selective logging within the largest remaining rainforest in Ivory Coast, the Tai National Park. We analyzed extensive amphibian and habitat data obtained during two major assessment periods > 15 years apart (period P1 = in 2000, period P2 = in 2016-2017) and spanning 45 years post-logging recovery (period P1 = 30 years post-logging). We revisited identical sites and used identical, standardized methodology in both study periods. Forest structure in formerly selectively logged sites slowly recovered towards old growth forest structure over the course of 45 years, with most visible changes occurring between P1 and P2. While species richness and diversity in both old growth and secondary forests remained largely unchanged across the study periods, frog assemblage composition in formerly disturbed sites followed the forest recovery process. Yet, their composition was still distinctly different from old growth forest assemblages. The different levels of resilience over time indicate that the slowest organisms in our system (forest trees) set the pace for the recovery of associated taxa (frogs). Effective post-harvesting restoration schemes need to incorporate these delayed response times. Thus, significantly longer felling cycles than those commonly applied in regular harvesting schemes are needed if the goal is to conserve and restore original forest diversity in logged forest ecosystems.

AB Mobile intertidal gastropods can employ behavioural thermoregulation to mitigate thermal stress, which may include retreating under boulders when emersed. However, little is known about how gastropod occupancy of under-boulder habitats is associated with any variations in substrate temperature that exist under boulders. Thermal imagery was used to measure the temperature of boulder lower surfaces and investigate how three snail species were associated at low tide with the maximum and average temperatures underneath grey siltstone and quartzite. Lower boulder surfaces had heterogeneous temperatures, with grey siltstone having temperature gradients and quartzite temperature showing mosaics. Temperature differences between the hottest and coolest gradient or mosaic locations were >5 degrees C; thus there was a range of temperatures that snails could interact with. All three snail species occupied cooler parts of temperature mosaics or gradients, avoiding the hottest areas. Stronger associations were detected on the hotter grey siltstone and for the more thermally sensitive Nerita atramentosa and Diloma concameratum. Even though snails were associated with cooler areas, some individuals were still exposed to extreme substratum heat (>50 degrees C). These results suggest that gastropod thermoregulatory behaviour is far more complex than simply retreating underneath boulders at low tide, as there is also a range of under-boulder temperatures that they interact with. Untangling interactions between intertidal gastropods and heterogenous substrate temperatures is important given rocky seashores already represent a thermally-variable and potentially-stressful habitat, which may be exacerbated further given predictions of warming temperatures associated with climate change.

AB The current increase in deforestation rates of the Brazilian Amazon raises important questions about the resilience of trees in distinct vertical profiles in the world's largest tropical rainforest. Seeking to prove the existence of temporal differences in tree growth response after forest fragmentation and edge effects through a dendrochronological perspective, we revealed that Theobroma sylvestre Mart. (Malvaceae), a typically understory and midstory strata tree of the Amazon upland forest (terra firme), increased the basal area increment rates compared to the forest interior, mainly over the first 20 years after forest fragmentation and edge effects. This pattern could not be extrapolated to the entire vertical forest profile, considering previous dendrochronological evidences from trees located in the forest canopy that presented an opposite pattern, a negative increment rate after forest fragmentation and edge creation. These divergences suggest that trees under the canopy of Amazon terra firme forest can be more tolerant to environmental stress (i.e. more incidence of droughts) derived by microclimatic and structural changes in forest subjected to forest fragmentation and edge effects processes, however, future dendroclimatic studies may confirm these hypotheses. In this sense, we highlighted that the increase in basal area increment of trees in the understory and midstory exposed to edge effects may indicate an important component of above-ground biomass stock recovery after forest fragmentation. This fact should be considered in forest management and restoration practices, promoting a new perspective on forest resilience ability after forest fragmentation and its strong impact on plant productivity and capacities in long-term carbon storage.

AB Global biodiversity is threatened by land-use changes through human activities. This is mainly due to the conversion of continuous forests into forest fragments surrounded by anthropogenic matrices. In general, sensitive species are lost while species adapted to disturbances succeed in altered environments. However, whether the interactions performed by the persisting species are also modified, and how it scales up to the network level throughout the landscape are virtually unknown in most tropical hotspots of biodiversity. Here we evaluated how landscape predictors (forest cover, total core area, edge density, inter-patch isolation) and local characteristics (fruit availability, vegetation complexity) affected understory birds seed-dispersal networks in 19 forest fragments along the hyperdiverse but highly depauperate northeast distribution of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Also, our sampled sites were distributed in two regions with contrasting land cover changes. We used mist nets to obtain samples of understory bird food contents to identify the plant species consumed and dispersed by them. We estimated network complexity on the basis of the number of interactions, links per species, interaction evenness, and modularity. Our findings showed that the number of interactions increased with the amount of forest cover, and it was significantly lower in the more deforested region. None of the other evaluated parameters were affected by any other landscape or local predictors. We also observed a lack of significant network structure compared to null models, which we attribute to a pervasive impoverishment of bird and plant communities in these highly modified landscapes. Our results demonstrate the importance of forest cover not only to maintain species diversity but also their respective mutualistic relationships, which are the bases for ecosystem functionality, forest regeneration and the provision of ecological services.

AB Skate egg case nursery sites are specific locations on the ocean floor where some species of skates deposit egg cases to incubate for up to 5 yr until hatching. We examined genetic diversity within and among skate egg nursery sites of the Alaska skate Bathyraja parmifera and the Aleutian skate B. aleutica in the eastern Bering Sea to gain a better understanding of how skates utilize these areas. Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing libraries were used to obtain single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets for B. parmifera (5285 SNPs) and B. aleutica (3309 SNPs). We found evidence for significant genetic differentiation among all B. parmifera and B. aleutica nursery areas, with 1 exception. B. parmifera from the spatially proximate Pribilof and Bering Canyons were genetically similar, suggesting that this may represent a large contiguous nursery area. Genetic differences between embryos at distinct developmental stages within nursery areas were not significant. Adult B. parmifera taken from the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands were genetically distinct from embryo collections, implying that additional genetic types of B. parmifera may exist that were not represented by the nursery areas sampled in this study. Our data also showed evidence for low effective population sizes and low N-e/N ratios. Results indicate that nursery areas support genetically distinct components of each species, which underscores the importance of skate egg nursery areas for conservation of genetic diversity.

AB Mature neotropical lowland forests have relatively lower symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) rates compared with secondary forests. Canopy gap formation may create transient SNF hotspots in mature forests that increase overall SNF rates in these ecosystems, as canopy gaps are pervasive across the landscape and increasing in frequency. However, what environmental conditions are driving SNF upregulation in canopy gaps is unknown. In a field experiment to test these potential environmental controls on SNF, we grew 540 neotropical nitrogen-fixing legume seedlings (Pentaclethra macroloba, Zygia longifolia, and Stryphnodendron microstachyum) under manipulated light and soil nitrogen availability in canopy gaps and intact forests at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Seedling biomass, nodule biomass, and SNF (g N seedling(-1) h(-1)) were 4-, 17- and 42-fold higher, respectively, in canopy gaps than in the intact forest. Nitrogen additions decreased SNF, but light had a stronger positive effect. Upregulation of SNF in canopy gaps was driven by increased plant growth and not a disproportionate increased SNF allocation. These data provide evidence that canopy gap SNF hotspots are driven, in part, by light availability, demonstrating a potential driver of SNF spatial heterogeneity. This further suggests that canopy gap dynamics are important for understanding the biogeochemistry of neotropical forests.

AB Context Evidence for effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on the viability of temperate forest herb populations in agricultural landscapes is so far based on population genetic studies of single species in single landscapes. However, forest herbs differ in their life histories, and landscapes have different environments, structures and histories, making generalizations difficult. Objectives We compare the response of three slow-colonizing forest herbs to habitat loss and fragmentation and set this in relation to differences in life-history traits, in particular their mating system and associated pollinators. Methods We analysed the herbs' landscape-scale population genetic structure based on microsatellite markers from replicate forest fragments across seven European agricultural landscapes. Results All species responded to reductions in population size with a decrease in allelic richness and an increase in genetic differentiation among populations. Genetic differentiation also increased with enhanced spatial isolation. In addition, each species showed unique responses. Heterozygosity in the self-compatible Oxalis acetosella was reduced in smaller populations. The genetic diversity of Anemone nemorosa, whose main pollinators are less mobile, decreased with increasing spatial isolation, but not that of the bumblebee-pollinated Polygonatum multiflorum. Conclusions Our study indicates that habitat loss and fragmentation compromise the long-term viability of slow-colonizing forest herbs despite their ability to persist for many decades by clonal propagation. The distinct responses of the three species studied within the same landscapes confirm the need of multi-species approaches. The mobility of associated pollinators should be considered an important determinant of forest herbs' sensitivity to habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB The expansion of woody species into grasslands has altered community structure and ecosystem function of grasslands worldwide. In tallgrass prairie of the Central Great Plains, USA, decreased fire frequency and intensity have increased the cover and abundance of woody species. In particular, clonal shrub cover has increased at accelerated rates due to vegetative reproduction and resprouting after disturbance. We measured the intra-clonal stem demography and relative growth rates (estimated change in woody biomass) of the shrub Cornus drummondii in response to fire frequency (4 vs 20 year burn intervals) and simulated browsing during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons at Konza Prairie Biological Station (Manhattan, Kansas). Overall, infrequent fire (4 year burn interval) increased intra-clonal stem relative growth rates and shrub relative growth rates. Intra-clonal stem relative growth rates were reduced in unbrowsed clones in 2018 due to drought and simulated browsing reduced intra-clonal stem relative growth rates in 2019. Additionally, simulated browsing nearly eliminated flower production within clones but did not affect intra-clonal stem mortality or recruitment within a growing season. Fire in conjunction with simulated browsing reduced estimated relative growth rates for entire shrub clones. Browsed shrubs that experienced prescribed fire in 2017 had reduced intra-clonal stem densities compared to unbrowsed shrubs and stem densities of browsed shrubs did not recover in 2018 or 2019. These results illustrate that infrequent fire alone promotes the expansion of clonal shrubs in tallgrass prairie and multiple interacting disturbances (e.g., fire and browsing) are required to control the spread of clonal shrubs into grasslands.

AB A cladistic analysis based on 120 morphological characters and 72 OTUs was conducted for the flat wasp genus Anisepyris Kieffer. The genus is mainly Neotropical region with few Nearctic species. The analysis retrieved well-supported relationships among the Anisepyris species and exposed the distribution of synapomorphies among the lineages, particularly concerning the mandible shape, dorsal pronotal area sulcus, and mesopleural foveae. The main diagnostic characters, described by Barbosa and Azevedo (2018) for the 13 species-groups of Anisepyris, were scrutinized. Transformation series and evolutionary hypotheses were also discussed. This discussion elucidates the importance of each character in the evolution and diversification along the different lineages. A discussion on the species-groups distribution is proposed, in relation to their diagnostic features. A hypothesis about the original distribution and the subsequent diversifications was also discussed. In conclusion, due to a possible recent origin for Anisepyris species, the dispersion could be related primarily to dense forest areas; and the retrieved synapomorphies could be related to posterior distributions of the species in disparate areas from their original environment.

   EMISSIONS
AB African forests suffer from severe fragmentation that further causes forest degradation near forest edges. The impact of fires used for slash-and-burn on forest edge effects remains unclear. Here, using high-resolution satellite-based forest-cover and biomass datasets, we find that edge effects extend a median distance and an interquartile range of 0.11(-0.04)(+0.06) km and 0.15(-0.05)(+0.09) km into moist and dry forests, and biomass within the forest edge zones has a carbon deficit of 4.1 PgC. Fires occurred in 52% of the forest edges and increased the carbon deficit by 5.5(-2.9)(+4.3) MgC ha(-1), compared with non-fire edges, through both the direct impact of fires intruding into forests and the indirect impact of changes in the local atmospheric circulations increasing canopy dryness. If small-scale slash-and-burn practices continue, increased fragmentation during 2010-2100 will result in a carbon loss from edge effects of 0.54-4.6 PgC. Fragmentation-caused forest degradation could be avoided by implementing dedicated forest protection policies supported by satellite monitoring of forest edges.

AB Deep-water access is arguably the most effective, but under-studied, mechanism that plants employ to survive during drought. Vulnerability to embolism and hydraulic safety margins can predict mortality risk at given levels of dehydration, but deep-water access may delay plant dehydration. Here, we tested the role of deep-water access in enabling survival within a diverse tropical forest community in Panama using a novel data-model approach.
   We inversely estimated the effective rooting depth (ERD, as the average depth of water extraction), for 29 canopy species by linking diameter growth dynamics (1990-2015) to vapor pressure deficit, water potentials in the whole-soil column, and leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves. We validated ERD estimates against existing isotopic data of potential water-access depths.
   Across species, deeper ERD was associated with higher maximum stem hydraulic conductivity, greater vulnerability to xylem embolism, narrower safety margins, and lower mortality rates during extreme droughts over 35 years (1981-2015) among evergreen species. Species exposure to water stress declined with deeper ERD indicating that trees compensate for water stress-related mortality risk through deep-water access.
   The role of deep-water access in mitigating mortality of hydraulically-vulnerable trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of forest dynamics under current and future climates.

AB Oak species worldwide are experiencing declines, with negative consequences for hardwood forests and their associated biodiversity, but the causes of these declines vary across species and habitats. We examine changes in extent of banj oak-dominated (Quercus leucotrichophora) moist temperate hardwood forests in a Western Hi-malayan landscape between 1991 and 2017. Using classified satellite imagery from 1991, 2001 and 2017, we found that dense banj oak forests have undergone substantial degradation and loss of area, while chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) forests have expanded, largely by replacing degraded banj oak stands. This transition was most likely to occur at sites that had lower levels of winter precipitation and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) values and more pine forest in the surrounding landscape. Our findings are consistent with known requirements of shade and moisture for the recruitment of banj oak. Loss of banj oak forests is likely to reduce biodiversity and a number of ecosystem services linked to the well-being of local communities.

In this paper, we take China as the study area and link the ecological compensation of arable land with the production, circulation and consumption of three staple foods. The amount of food is converted into the area of arable land needed to produce that food. After calculating the value of ecosystem services that support food production on arable land, the ecological compensation standard is obtained, and the realization mode between regions is constructed. The results show that: (1) the flow of staple foods in China is mainly from north to south and the value of arable land support services provided by northern provinces is greater than that of southern provinces; (2) the province that needs to pay the most ecological compensation for cultivated land is Guangdong Province, with an amount of yen 16.082 billion RMB, and the province that receives the most compensation is Heilongjiang Province, with an amount of yen 21.547 billion RMB; (3) in order to coordinate the collection and distribution of ecological compensation in each province, it is necessary to establish an ecological compensation fund for arable land in the central government. Protecting the ecological status of arable land and ensuring sustainable food production is in the overall interest of the country.

AB This article explores the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic on the evolution of both physical and digital cadavers within the unique ecosystem of the anatomy laboratory. A physical cadaver is a traditional and established learning tool in anatomy education, whereas a digital cadaver is a relatively recent phenomenon. The Covid-19 pandemic presented a major disturbance and disruption to all levels and types of education, including anatomy education. This article constructs a conceptual metaphor between a typical anatomy laboratory and an ecosystem, and considers the affordances, constraints, and changing roles of physical and digital cadavers within anatomy education through an ecological lens. Adaptation of physical and digital cadavers during the disturbance is analyzed, and the resiliency of digital cadaver technology is recognized. The evolving role of the digital cadaver is considered in terms of increasing accessibility and inclusivity within the anatomy laboratory ecosystem of the future.

AB Using microsatellite markers, the genetic diversity, family ties, and genetic drift were studied in three breeds and seven populations of wool (fleece-bearing) goats of Central and Middle Asia. The parameters of allelic and genetic diversity of indigenous populations of Mongolian goats (Gurvan Egch, Darkhat, Burakh Zavkhan, Ulgiy Uulan, Altai Uulan), two populations of local Tuvan goats, Soviet and Tajik wool breeds of goat, and Orenburg fleece-bearing goat were obtained. Using a principal component analysis, two main groups of goats were detected, in one of which mainly Mongolian native populations are united, while in the other are Middle Asian breeds of goats. The populations of Tuvan local goat were divided between the appropriate groups. At the same time, Mongolian goats were characterized by a high intrapopulation diversity and a fairly low level of genetic differences between the populations. Data obtained indicate the existence of a correlation of genetic relations between the considered populations and breeds of fleece-bearing goats and their geographical distribution.

AB Among nectarivorous birds, the highest niche partitioning occurs between hummingbirds and plants. Although hummingbirds tend to visit morphologically well-matched resources, as ornithophilous species, they can also visit flowers with other traits. Here, we investigated whether the niche partitioning in hummingbird-plant interactions is also observed with ornithophilous species only. We also explored if hummingbird traits predicted resources use. We recorded a plant-ornithophilous species network in a semi-deciduous forest in Brazil. We quantified interaction partitioning through network connectance, complementary specialisation, and modularity. The influence of hummingbirds' traits into their visits was investigated through methods of functional ecology and ecological networks. We recorded 948 interactions between nine hummingbirds and seven ornithophilous plants. We detected similar patterns of niche partitioning between hummingbirds and ornithophilous plants in comparison to networks considering the entire plant community. However, hummingbird species with the most specialised interactions are different from those when the whole system is evaluated. Therefore, we cannot downscale the patterns from one scale to the other. The pattern of interaction with ornithophilous plants was not related to hummingbirds' traits. Therefore, the coexistence of species with shared traits might be occurring through facilitative and competitive processes, leading to trait mismatching and maintaining niche partitioning among ornithophilous plants.

AB Spiders have been increasingly used as environmental and ecological indicators in conservation and ecosystem management. In the Neotropics, there is a shortage of information regarding spiders' taxonomies and ecological responses to anthropogenic disturbances. To unravel these hitches, we tested the possibility of using high-level diversity and high-level functionality indicators to evaluate spider assemblages' sensitivity to landscape changes. This approach, if proven informative, might overcome the relevant limitations of taxonomic derived indexes, which are considered time-consuming, cost-demanding and dependent on the (few) expert taxonomists' availability. Our results highlight the pertinence of both indicators' responses to the structural changes induced by increasing anthropogenic disturbance, and are associated with reductions in ecosystem complexity, microclimates, and microhabitats. Overall, both indicators were sensitive to structural changes induced by anthropogenic disturbance and should be considered a useful resource for assessing the extent of ecosystems' disruptions in the Neotropics, and also to guide managers in landscapes' restoration.

ID POLITICAL POLARIZATION; EVOLUTION; PERSISTENCE; EUROPE
AB We study the evolution of cultural divides both theoretically and empirically. We propose a model of cultural change where intergenerational transmission and forces of social influence determine the distribution of cultural traits in society. We conduct an empirical investigation of the evolution of cultural heterogeneity in the USA between 1972 and 2018, using the General Social Survey. In recent decades, cultural heterogeneity between individuals has risen. Cultural divides between identity groups display contrasted patterns: increasing along lines of religion and political orientation, mildly U-shaped along income and racial lines, and flat or decreasing for gender and urbanicity. We interpret these empirical findings in light of our model, arguing that changes in modes of interaction within and across groups can explain the observed dynamics of cultural heterogeneity.

AB Zoantharians (Cnidaria: Hexacorallia: Zoantharia) of the genus Palythoa are ubiquitous species that occupy reef habitats in every tropical ocean. Disagreements among classifications based on morphology, reproductive traits, and molecular techniques have generated taxonomic challenges within this group. Molecular studies provide limited phylogenetic resolution between species, and discordance is frequently attributed to slow mitochondrial rates and lack of resolution among molecular markers. Here we conducted the first phylogenomic survey of Palythoa, using a reduced representation genomic approach (ezRAD) to resolve relationships among eight described and four putative Palythoa species (N = 22 plus two outgroups) across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. We constructed nearly complete mitochondrial genomes and assembled transcriptome loci datasets by reference mapping. A de novo assembly was performed for the holobiont dataset, and we compared a range of filtering strategies from unfiltered data down to 136 unlinked high-quality biallelic SNPs shared by all samples to resolve evolutionary lineages within Palythoa. Across all these datasets, the resulting Bayesian and ML trees revealed six highly concordant and well-supported clades, however, the phylogenomic data were inconclusive in resolving species relationships within the clades. We detected putative species complexes within two well sampled Palythoa clades (clades I and II), but species delimitation results were inconsistent in whether these clades contain multiple nominal species or represent a single variable species. Polyphyly in the broadly distributed species Palythoa tuberculosa and P. mutuki highlight the need for additional study. Consistency among nuclear and mitogenomic datasets points to a lack of biological understanding of species boundaries among these zoantharians rather than limitations of the molecular markers. More complete taxonomic sampling of nominal species across the geographic ranges of distribution is necessary to resolve species boundaries and evolutionary histories among members of this genus.

AB The role of private reserves is often underestimated due to their small size and discontinuous distribution. To examine the relevance of small reserves in mammal conservation, with this paper we addressed three objectives: 1) to identify patterns of size, altitude, and distribution of the Colombian private reserves belonging to the Protected Areas National System (SINAP), 2) to examine, as a case study, mammal richness and geographical patterns in twelve reserves, and 3) to identify the contribution of small reserves to Colombian mammal's conservation. To address the first objective, we analyzed size, altitude, and distribution of the SINAP reserves sorted by biogeographic provinces. For the other two objectives, we evaluated the relationship between mammal richness and area, altitude, and connectivity of the twelve small reserves. We found that most of the SINAP reserves are less than 100 ha in size, that they were distributed between 1500 and 2500 m, and that they were in the North Andean province. Together, the twelve reserves harbor 224 species of eleven mammalian orders, with a mean richness of 42.7 species (19 bats, and 23.7 non-volant mammals). We found a positive relationship between both total mammal richness and non-volant mammal richness with reserve area and between non-volant mammal richness and altitude. We also identify those small reserves conserve mainly small- sized species although they might serve as a refuge for medium and large species as well. We highlight those small reserves play a significant role in Colombian mammal's conservation.

TI The Role of Monk Parakeets as Nest-Site Facilitators in Their Native and

AB Simple Summary Invasive species can be harmful to native species, although this fact could be more complex when some natives eventually benefit from invaders. Faced with this paradox, we show how the invasive monk parakeet, the only parrot species that builds its nests with sticks, can host other species as tenants, increasing nest-site availability for native but also exotic species. This same pattern is observed in the native range of the species, and when parakeets occupy urban or rural habitats, although the richness of tenants was higher in invaded areas and rural habitats. Tenants participated in the cooperative defense against predators, benefiting parakeets with their presence. As tenants can be both native and invasive species, management plans should consider the complex network of interactions developed with the invader. While most of the knowledge on invasive species focuses on their impacts, little is known about their potential positive effects on other species. Invasive ecosystem engineers can disrupt recipient environments; however, they may also facilitate access to novel resources for native species. The monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is a worldwide invader and the only parrot that builds its own communal nests, which can be used by other species. However, the ecological effects of these interspecific interactions are barely known. We compared the role of the monk parakeet as a nest-site facilitator in different rural and urban areas, both invaded and native, across three continents and eight breeding seasons. A total of 2690 nests from 42 tenant species, mostly cavity-nesting birds, were recorded in 26% of 2595 monk parakeet nests. Rural and invaded areas showed the highest abundance and richness of tenant species. Multispecies communal nests triggered interspecific aggression between the monk parakeet host and its tenants, but also a cooperative defense against predators. Despite the positive effects for native species, monk parakeets also facilitate nesting opportunities to other non-native species and may also transmit diseases to tenants, highlighting the complexity of biotic interactions in biological invasions.

AB We found the euryhaline microalga, Tetraselmis jejuensis sp. nov., which was adapted to supralittoral tide pools with salinities varying from 0.3-3.1%. Fifteen strains of T. jejuensis were isolated from Daejeong (DJ) and Yongduam (YO), and clonal cultures were established in the laboratory. Morphological characterization revealed that the cells have a compressed shape, four flagella emerging from a depression near the apex in two opposite pairs, a cup-shaped chloroplast containing one pyrenoid surrounded by starch, and eyespot regions not located near the flagellar base. T. jejuensis cells showed distinct characteristics compared to other Tetraselmis species. First, a regular subunit pattern with honeycomb-like structures was predominantly displayed on the surface in the middle of the cell body. Second, the pyrenoid was invaded by both cytoplasmic channels comprising electron-dense material separated from the cytoplasm, and two branches of small cytoplasmic channels (canaliculi) in various directions, which characterize the subgenus Tetrathele. Eyespot regions containing a large number of osmiophilic globules, packed closely together and arranged in subcircular close packing of diverse sizes, were dispersed throughout the chloroplast. In the phylogenetic analysis of small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences, the 15 strains isolated from DJ and YO separated a newly branched clade in the Chlorodendrophyceae at the base of a clade comprising the T. carteriiformi/subcordiformis clade, T. chuii/suecica clade, and T. striata/convolutae clade. The strains in the diverging clade were considered to belong to the same species. The SSU rDNA sequences of the DJ and YO strains showed a maximum difference of 1.53% and 1.19% compared to Tetraselmis suecica (MK541745), the closest species of the family based on the phylogenetic analysis, respectively. Based on morphological, molecular, and physiological features, we suggest a new species in the genus Tetraselmis named Tetraselmis jejuensis, with the species name "jejuensis" referring to the collection site, Jeju Island, Korea.

AB Regional species diversity is explained ultimately by speciation, extinction and dispersal. Here, we estimate dispersal and speciation rates of Neotropical butterflies to propose an explanation for the distribution and diversity of extant species. We focused on the tribe Brassolini (owl butterflies and allies), a Neotropical group that comprises 17 genera and 108 species, most of them endemic to rainforest biomes. We inferred a robust species tree using the multispecies coalescent framework and a dataset including molecular and morphological characters. This formed the basis for three changes in Brassolini classification: (1) Naropina syn. nov. is subsumed within Brassolina; (2) Aponarope syn. nov. is subsumed within Narope; and (3) Selenophanes orgetorix comb. nov. is reassigned from Catoblepia to Selenophanes. By applying biogeographical stochastic mapping, we found contrasting species diversification and dispersal dynamics across rainforest biomes, which might be explained, in part, by the geological and environmental history of each bioregion. Our results revealed a mosaic of biome-specific evolutionary histories within the Neotropics, where butterfly species have diversified rapidly (cradles: Mesoamerica), have accumulated gradually (museums: Atlantic Forest) or have diversified and accumulated alternately (Amazonia). Our study contributes evidence from a major butterfly lineage that the Neotropics are a museum and a cradle of species diversity.

AB Species identification is fundamentally important within the fields of biology, biogeography, ecology and conservation. Erodium Aiton (Geraniaceae) with 75 species is distributed in all continents except Antarctic. Its main diversification center is Mediterranean region with 62 species. There are 15 annual and perennial Erodium species in Iran. In spite vast distribution of many Erodium species that grow in Iran, there are no available reports on their genetic diversity, mode of divergence and patterns of dispersal. Therefore, we performed molecular (SCoT markers) and morphological studies of 154 accessions from 10 species of Erodium that were collected from different habitats in Iran. AMOVA test provide important genetic variation among the examined populations and showed that, 65% of the overall genetic difference was due to within population diversity, while 35% is because genetic population variability. The aims of present study are: (1) can SCoT markers identify Erodium species, (2) what is the genetic structure of these taxa in Iran, and (3) to investigate the species inter-relationship? The present study revealed that combination of morphological and SCoT markers can identify the species.

AB The edge effect is one of the consequences of forest fragmentation and is one of the main drivers of alteration of ecological and ecosystem processes. Trophic guilds and species of bats have shown differential responses to this phenomenon. Our goal was to describe the change in bat species richness, abundance, evenness, and species composition of trophic guilds associated with a matrix-edge-forest interior gradient. Therefore, we conducted a bat sampling with 16 mist nets covering such gradient in four sub-andean forest fragments (10-50 ha). In total, we captured 566 individuals of 21 species of phyllostomid bats. Bat species richness and abundance were higher in the matrix and edge and were similar between fragments. Evenness showed the lowest values in the matrix and forest edge and was different between forest patches. Some shrub frugivorous bats were more abundant in the edge, and others were more abundant in two fragments. Species composition of canopy frugivorous bats was similar along the gradient but was significantly different between fragments. In contrast, the species composition of nectarivores was similar throughout the matrix-interior forest gradient and between patches. Our data suggest that bat responses at assemblage-level are affected by the disturbance gradient from the matrix to forest interior, even at short distances form fragment borders, and are dependent on the trophic guild.

AB One of the oldest and most persistent questions in ecology and evolution is whether natural communities tend to evolve toward saturation and maximal diversity. Robert MacArthur's classical theory of niche packing and the theory of adaptive radiations both imply that populations will diversify and fully partition any available niche space. However, the saturation of natural populations is still very much an open area of debate and investigation. Additionally, recent evolutionary theory suggests the existence of alternative evolutionary stable states (ESSs), which implies that some stable communities may not be fully saturated. Using models with classical Lotka-Volterra ecological dynamics and three formulations of evolutionary dynamics (a model using adaptive dynamics, an individual-based model, and a partial differential equation model), we show that following an adaptive radiation, communities can often get stuck in low diversity states when limited by mutations of small phenotypic effect. These low diversity metastable states can also be maintained by limited resources and finite population sizes. When small mutations and finite populations are considered together, it is clear that despite the presence of higher-diversity stable states, natural populations are likely not fully saturating their environment and leaving potential niche space unfilled. Additionally, within-species variation can further reduce community diversity from levels predicted by models that assume species-level homogeneity.
   Author summary Understanding if and when communities evolve to saturate their local environments is imperative to our understanding of natural populations. Using computer simulations of classical evolutionary models, we study whether adaptive radiations tend to lead toward saturated communities, in which no new species can invade or remain trapped in alternative, lower diversity stable states. We show that with asymmetric competition and small effect mutations, evolutionary Red Queen dynamics can trap communities in low diversity metastable states. Moreover, limited resources not only reduces community population sizes, but also reduces community diversity, denying the formation of saturated communities and stabilizing low diversity, non-stationary evolutionary dynamics. Our results are directly relevant to the longstanding questions important to both ecological empiricists and theoreticians on the species packing and saturation of natural environments. Also, by showing the ease evolution can trap communities in low diversity metastable states, we demonstrate the potential harm in relying solely on ESSs to answer questions of biodiversity.

AB Water quality and riparian communities are among the most affected stream components by agriculture. However, little is known about the effects of riparian management for both aquatic and terrestrial taxa at different spatial scales. Here, we surveyed aquatic (diatoms) and terrestrial taxa (bryophytes, vascular plants, litterdwelling snails, and ground and volant arthropods), to compare the abundance and richness of riparian taxa and chemical quality between reference and exposed sites in two stream reaches each of c. 3.5 km in northwestern Spain. Impacts in exposed sites were mainly due to traditional farming practices (TFPs), which included traditional meadow management, weirs built for now-unused water mills and sporadic timber harvesting. Therefore, we measured ten covariates and predictors related to the intensification of TFPs at local and withinstream scales and explored associations with riparian and water-quality measures to study the potential effects of TFPs in more detail. Reference and exposed sites did not differ significantly in water properties (diatom-biotic indices, conductivity, total organic carbon and nitrates), but exposed sites had less concentrations of soil metals Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn and less cover and richness of riparian trees, as inferred by the index QBR. Exposed sites had more volant insect decomposers and reference sites a greater abundance or richness of snails, ground predators and decomposers. Bryophyte richness was greater in reference sites. Our inferences may inform the joint cumulative downstream effects of weirs, meadow uses and riparian alterations but were generally consistent with most riparian taxa benefiting from having larger forested areas. Given the contrasting responses among taxa, we argue that land snails, terrestrial flies, and centipedes may be valuable additions to current riparian assessments mostly based on plants, beetles and spiders as indicator taxa. Our study also suggests caution when inferring farming impacts on streams from the surface area of pastoral land. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   DIET; AVAILABILITY; DETERMINANTS; DEPREDATION; VALUATION
AB Apex predators are threatened globally, and their local extinctions are often driven by failures in sustaining prey acquisition under contexts of severe prey scarcity. The harpy eagle Harpia harpyja is Earth's largest eagle and the apex aerial predator of Amazonian forests, but no previous study has examined the impact of forest loss on their feeding ecology. We monitored 16 active harpy eagle nests embedded within landscapes that had experienced 0 to 85% of forest loss, and identified 306 captured prey items. Harpy eagles could not switch to open-habitat prey in deforested habitats, and retained a diet based on canopy vertebrates even in deforested landscapes. Feeding rates decreased with forest loss, with three fledged individuals dying of starvation in landscapes that succumbed to 50-70% deforestation. Because landscapes deforested by>70% supported no nests, and eaglets could not be provisioned to independence within landscapes>50% forest loss, we established a 50% forest cover threshold for the reproductive viability of harpy eagle pairs. Our scaling-up estimate indicates that 35% of the entire 428,800-km(2) Amazonian 'Arc of Deforestation' study region cannot support breeding harpy eagle populations. Our results suggest that restoring harpy eagle population viability within highly fragmented forest landscapes critically depends on decisive forest conservation action.

AB Postcopulatory sexual selection has shaped the ornaments used during copulatory courtship. However, we know relatively little about whether these courtship ornaments are costly to produce or whether they provide indirect benefits to females. We used the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, to explore this. We challenged males using an entomopathogenic fungus and compared their courtship (frequency of leg and antennal contacts to the female), copulation duration, number of eggs laid, and hatching rate against control males. Infected males copulated for longer yet they reduced their leg and antennal contacts compared to control males. However, there was no obvious relation between infection, copulation duration, and courtship with egg production and hatching success. In general, our results indicate that the ornaments used during postcopulatory courtship are condition-dependent. Moreover, such condition dependence cannot be linked to male fitness.

AB The efficacy of translocation as a method for conserving species in peril has not been fully evaluated. Post-release monitoring rarely involves long-term assessments and initial success metrics may not translate to population viability. In particular, genetic factors may play a critical role in fitness following release as founder effect, genetic drift, inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression can influence extinction risk. As part of a multi-year recovery effort, we translocated populations of the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi; SKR), in order to restore population connectivity. Here we evaluate the success of the translocation efforts through long-term population estimation and genetic analyses. We conducted post-release assessments for 9 years, and used Bayesian clustering analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) of 24 microsatellite markers developed for this species to assess genetic admixture between source and translocated populations. Demographic results indicate long-term translocation success, as evidenced by founder survival and establishment, and population growth and regulation. Genetic results show admixture at the release site between genetically discrete source populations, provide definitive evidence that translocated individuals, not immigrants, produced offspring at the release site, that these offspring successfully reproduced and that even with moderate to great genetic differentiation of source populations, outbreeding depression was not detected. Despite the historical failure of heteromyid translocation efforts, our long-term study illustrates how the development of species-specific best practices led to an effective strategy for SKR recovery. More broadly, our results suggest efforts that use a systematic hypothesis-testing framework alongside long-term monitoring offer great promise in improving translocation outcomes.

AB Forests have expanded across Europe over the last centuries as a consequence of farmland (agricultural and pasture) abandonment. Agricultural practices usually increase soil fertility and reduce the diversity and abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, essential mutualists of many woody species in temperate and Mediterranean forests. The recovery of this biotic interaction after the cessation of human activities is, thus, crucial for the re-establishment of functional forest ecosystems. Here we addressed the legacies of past land use and the recovery of the mutualism between ECM fungi and Fagus sylvatica trees in recent beech forests (<50 years) in Northeast Spain. Soil and root samples were collected in six long-established and eight recent beech forests to analyse soil abiotic properties and the ECM fungi associated with beech roots (Illumina DNA metabarcoding of ECM tips). Up to 609 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of ECM fungi were identified, with 220 ASVs found in both forest types. Recent forests had a significantly lower soil organic matter and phosphorus content, which had a significant effect on the community structure of ECM fungi in beech roots. Moreover, beech trees in recent forests interacted with less fungal taxa but had a higher relative abundance of Ascomycota. Tarzetta spp. (Ascomycota, Pezizales) and Lactarius blennius (Basidiomycota, Russulales) emerge as the particular taxa associated with recent and long-established forests respectively. More specialized mutualistic networks with a lower species normalized degree were found in recent forests, which might result in a lower quality and resilience of the ECM mutualism. Synthesis. Land-use history modulated the mycorrhizal symbiosis in regenerating beech forests through changes in soil organic matter and nitrogen, which were the main drivers of the differences in fungal community composition and functional types associated with beech trees in recent forests.

AB The pink shrimp Penaeus notialis is one of the most important commercial species of the world. In the Caribbean Sea of Colombia, they represent 70 % of the catches in industrial fisheries, but since the 90's it has shown a significant decrease in its abundances because of overexploitation of the resource. Because there are no studies on the genetic status of their populations in the Colombian Caribbean, the current management strategies for the pink shrimp can be improved with genetic criteria. Hence, the objective of this study was to examine the genetic diversity (Ho, He and Fis), structure population (Fst, AMOVA, Bayesian analysis, DAPC, Mantel test) and the connectivity (assignment analysis) in five localities distributed in the Caribbean Sea of Colombia (Zapata, Arbolete, Isla Fuerte, Punta Canoa y Manaure). Additionally, we assessed the spatial distribution of size structure by geostatistical analysis to identify possible nursery areas and a relationship with the genetic structure observed. The genetic analyses using seven microsatellites loci, showed low genetic diversity (Ho < 0,35), high genetic potential (He < 0,93), high inbreeding (Fis> 0,6) and the presence of three populations (Phi ST2, 98 = 0,065; P < 0.001) showing significant adjustment to the isolation-by-distance model (r = 0,78, z = -27,92; p = 0,031). It is discussed how the life cycle of the species, geomorphological variations on the continental shelf and marine currents influence the spatial distribution of size structure and genetic lineages of the pink shrimp, as well as the implications of this type of studies in the sustainable management of this valuable fishing resource.

AB Plant-seed disperser interactions are critical for maintaining tropical plant diversity. However, these interactions are altered by habitat fragmentation, a pervasive threat to the tropics globally. We compared vegetation structure, richness and composition of plant-avian seed disperser interactions across two forest fragments (area: similar to 25 km(2)), and one contiguous forest site in the last remaining lowland tropical forests in north-east India. We used network-level indices (nestedness, generality, and vulnerability) and species-level indices (degree and species strength) to identify key plant and bird groups across the three sites. We found that the three sites varied in habitat structure and were more similar in the composition of avian seed dispersers than plants. The low similarity in plant-seed disperser interactions between the three sites was likely influenced by low similarity in fruiting plants. The fragmented sites exhibited fewer pairwise interactions and were characterized by a higher representation of small-seeded plants, climbers, and open-forest birds. Small-bodied birds (bulbuls and barbets) played a central role in all the seed dispersal networks, while large-bodied birds (hornbills) performed persistent interactions with large-seeded plants at all sites. This is one of the first studies from the Asian tropics to investigate the differences in the plant-avian seed disperser communities between forest fragments and contiguous forest. Our findings highlight the conservation value of fragments given their potential to hold a distinct set of plant-seed disperser interactions, thereby maintaining functional diversity in fragmented tropical landscapes. Abstract in Hindi is available with online material.

AB An increase in active fire data in the Amazon puts the entire international community on alert, as they may result in fires and deforestation. Thus, this study aims to present the dynamics of active fire data and their relationship with the fires in 16 Regularized Indigenous Lands (RILs) located entirely in the state of Rondonia, in the southern amazon. The entire historical series of active fire data (from 1998 to 2020) were obtained to achieve the objectives, and nine Landsat-OLI scenes from September 2020 were processed. The active fire data dynamics revealed that the correlation coefficient between the total number of active fire data in the immediate surroundings (10 km) and the number of active fire data within the analyzed indigenous land areas was higher than 0.7. This means that the variation in the number of fire outbreaks within indigenous lands can be explained by the number of outbreaks occurring outside them. Image processing revealed 11 classes of land use and land cover with an overall accuracy of 92%. Based on the mapping of land use and cover for the nine Landsat scenes, it is possible to verify that the burnt area totaled 3,943.50 km(2). Besides, 953.90 km(2) (24.19%) were located entirely within the indigenous lands, mainly on the Massaco and Urn Eu Wau Wau indigenous lands. By analyzing the density of active fire data, it is possible to verify that most of the outbreaks are located at the edges of the RILs. This shows that these areas work as a barrier to the spread of fire in the South of the Brazilian Amazon. Thus, despite the identification of regions burnt within indigenous lands, the study concluded that RILs are essential for protecting the Amazon's native vegetation.

AB Identifying generalisable processes that underpin population dynamics is crucial for understanding successional patterns. While longitudinal or chronosequence data are powerful tools for doing so, the traditional focus on community-level shifts in taxonomic and functional composition rather than species-level trait-demography relationships has made generalisation difficult. Using joint species distribution models, we demonstrate how three traits-photosynthetic rate, adult stature, and seed mass-moderate recruitment and sapling mortality rates of 46 woody species during secondary succession. We show that the pioneer syndrome emerges from higher photosynthetic rates, shorter adult statures and lighter seeds that facilitate exploitation of light in younger secondary forests, while 'long-lived pioneer' and 'late successional' syndromes are associated with trait values that enable species to persist in the understory or reach the upper canopy in older secondary forests. Our study highlights the context dependency of trait-demography relationships, which drive successional shifts in sapling's species composition in secondary forests.

AB Benthic species, though ecologically important, are vulnerable to genetic loss and population size reduction due to impacts from fishing trawls. An assessment of genetic diversity and population structure is therefore needed to assist in a resource management program. To address this issue, the two-spined yellowtail stargazer (Uranoscopus cognatus) was collected within selected locations in the Indo-West Pacific (IWP). The partial mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and the nuclear DNA recombination activating gene 1 were sequenced. Genetic diversity analyses revealed that the populations were moderately to highly diversified (haplotype diversity, H=0.490-0.900, nucleotide diversity, pi =0.0010-0.0034) except sampling station (ST) 1 and 14. The low diversity level, however was apparent only in the matrilineal marker (H=0.118-0.216; pi =0.0004-0.0008), possibly due to stochastic factors or anthropogenic stressors. Population structure analyses revealed a retention of ancestral polymorphism that was likely due to incomplete lineage sorting in U. cognatus, and prolonged vicariance by the Indo-Pacific Barrier has partitioned them into separate stock units. Population segregation was also shown by the phenotypic divergence in allopatric populations, regarding the premaxillary protrusion, which is possibly associated with the mechanism for upper jaw movement in biomechanical feeding approaches. The moderate genetic diversity estimated for each region, in addition to past population expansion events, indicated that U. cognatus within the IWP was still healthy and abundant (except in ST1 and 14), and two stock units were identified to be subjected to a specific resource management program.

AB The great heterogeneity of tropical systems challenges our understanding of how niche and neutral processes structure epiphyte communities. Dispersal, phorophyte identity and the environmental conditions created by phorophytes are the main determinants of vascular epiphyte structure and diversity. However, these forces comprise multiple causal factors that need to be decomposed to address the complex patterns of independent and confounded effects acting upon epiphyte communities. We tested the hypothesis that the environment created by phorophytes (size, bark characteristics, microenvironmental conditions, and substrate type) is more important than phorophyte species identity and space in determining the structure of epiphyte communities, with phorophyte size being a major determinant within the environmental component. We also expected larger phorophytes to exhibit greater epiphyte richness and diversity. The study was carried out on an inselberg within a semi-deciduous montane forest and a cloud forest in southeastern Brazil. Partial redundancy analysis was used to hierarchically decompose the relative abundances of vascular epiphytes into three components: association with particular phorophyte species, the environment created by phorophytes, and space (Moran's eigenvector maps). Linear models were used to analyze the relationship between epiphytic diversity and richness with size descriptors. We show that neutral and niche-based processes act simultaneously on the dynamics of vascular epiphyte species, but distinctly on the inselberg and cloud forest. The potential for an epiphyte to occupy all favorable phorophytes was larger in the cloud forest due to the higher connectivity offered by trees. Abundance, richness and diversity of epiphytes increased with phorophyte size, probably due to an increase in the area, time of colonization or increase in microhabitat heterogeneity within phorophytes. Larger phorophytes are a major determinant of local environmental conditions and the spatial organization of epiphytes, as they promote their abundance and maintain their diversity in tropical systems.

AB Didelphidae is the largest New World radiation of marsupials, and is mostly represented by arboreal, small- to medium-sized taxa that inhabit tropical and/or subtropical forests. The group originated and remained isolated in South America for millions of years, until the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. In this study, we present the first reconstruction of the biogeographic history of Didelphidae including all major clades, based on parametric models and stratified analyses over time. We also compiled all the pre-Quaternary fossil records of the group, and contrasted these data to our biogeographic inferences, as well as to major environmental events that occurred in the South American Cenozoic. Our results indicate the relevance of Amazonia in the early diversification of Didelphidae, including the divergence of the major clades traditionally ranked as subfamilies and tribes. Cladogeneses in other areas started in the late Miocene, an interval of intense shifts, especially in the northern portion of Andes and Amazon Basin. Occupation of other areas continued through the Pliocene, but few were only colonized in Quaternary times. The comparison between the biogeographic inference and the fossil records highlights some further steps towards better understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the clade. Finally, our results stress that the early history of didelphids is obscured by the lack of Paleogene fossils, which are still to be unearthed from low-latitude deposits of South America.

AB The western region of Cameroon is one of the leading agricultural production areas in sub-Saharan Africa, and this ongoing anthropogenic perturbation has led to the replacement of natural forests with agroecosystems. Such anthropogenic landscape transformations may have affected bat species composition and abundance in the area. Our study assessed the response of bat assemblages to these changes, by comparing species diversity and abundance across four distinct habitat types within the region: cultivated farms (transformed landscape), savannah and gallery forest (both representing degraded areas), and secondary forest. A total of 442 individuals assigned to 25 species were captured using ground-level mist nets. The cultivated farms recorded the highest bat species richness (13 species) and abundance (145 individuals), whereas the gallery forest had the lowest species richness (six species) and abundance (62 individuals). Myonycteris angolensis had the highest relative abundance in the region, with large numbers captured in cultivated farms. According to the rank-frequency diagram, bat assemblages in cultivated farms (Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) = 53.7), gallery forest (AIC = 27.7), and secondary forest (AIC = 48.5) are distributed according to the pre-emption model, whereas the distribution in the savannah (AIC = 40.0) follow the null model. Generalised linear models revealed significant differences in species and relative abundance across the four habitat types.

AB The genus Micromelo (family Aplustridae) occurs in almost all tropical and subtropical waters across the globe, with the exception of the Eastern Pacific. Most authors consider Micromelo undatus (Bruguiere, 1792) as the only valid species in this genus. This study examines populations of specimens identified as M. undatus across its geographic range, using morphological and genetic data from two mitochondrial genes (16S and CO1) and one nuclear gene (Histone H3). The results reveal that M. undatus is a complex of four species with consistent genetic and anatomical differences. A literature review and evaluation of type material indicates that available names exist for three of the four species. Micromelo guamensis, M. undatus and M. scriptus are resurrected for species found in the Western Pacific, the Atlantic Ocean, and widespread in the Indo-Pacific, respectively. A new name is introduced for another species found in the Western Pacific, namely Micromelo barbarae sp. nov. and a neotype is designated for the type species of the genus M. undatus.

AB Parkia R.Br. (Leguminosae, Caesalpinioideae, mimosoid clade) is a pantropical genus with approximately 35 recognized species in three taxonomic sections (Parkia, Platyparkia and Sphaeroparkia), distributed widely in tropical forests and savannas in South and Central America, Africa-Madagascar and the Indo-Pacific region. In this study, phylogenetic analyses (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference), ancestral area and habitat estimations were performed using chloroplast (matK, trnL, psbA-trnH and rps16-trnQ) and nuclear (ITS/18S/26S) DNA sequences for the purpose of testing the monophyly of Parkia and inferring the geographic origin of the genus and times of divergence of the various lineages. This enabled investigation of factors that may have influenced its diversification in both hemispheres. Our results support the monophyly of the genus. A fossil calibrated Bayesian analysis dated the Parkia crown node to the Miocene (at c. 18.85 Ma). Biogeographic analysis reconstructed an origin in the lowlands rainforests (terra firme) in Amazonia with subsequent radiation in the Neotropical region from the Miocene onwards, with dispersion events as far as Central America, and the Atlantic Forest and the cerrado of Brazil. A single dispersion from the Neotropics to the Paleotropics is hypothesised, with subsequent smaller radiations in Africa-Madagascar and the Indo-Pacific (crown ages 3.79 and 5.15 Ma respectively). Factors that may have influenced the radiation and speciation of Parkia include the elevation of the Andes (especially in the Miocene), and more recently the closing of the Panama gap in Neotropics, the climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene influenced the diversification of species on both continents. The elevation of the Sunda Shelf in Indo-Pacific region during the last glacial maximum (LGM) appears to be the main driving force for speciation in that region. In Africa, the low number of species may be related to extinction processes.

AB Edge effect is a strong driver of change in fragmented landscapes. In the last few decades, agricultural land-use intensity at field scale has increased and, consequently, the edges between crops and natural vegetation matrix have sharpened. Interspersed crops produce now negative effects not only by direct habitat destruction, but also by inputs of agrochemicals that may spread their effects on the surroundings. These processes are taking place worryingly in steppe habitats in Iberian Peninsula where the high diversity of bird communities and other taxa they hold is at risk. The aims of this study were to evaluate the edge effect of crops on i) the microhabitat quality of a natural landscape matrix and ii) the space use of a threatened habitat-specialist steppe bird, the Dupont's lark (Chersophilus duponti). We carried out microhabitat sampling and bird surveys within and around crops interspersed in a typical Iberian shrub-steppe matrix during spring and autumn 2016 and spring 2017. Microhabitat quality was measured by sampling vegetation structure and arthropod biomass (as proxy of food availability) within and at increasing distances (1, 10 and 50 m) to seven crops. The intensity of space use by the Dupont's lark was estimated applying a Kernel density function on the spatial point pattern of the males' territories. Vegetation structure variables were summarized by Principal Components Analysis. Linear Mixed Models and model averaging were used to test for effects of distance to crop on microhabitat quality and space use by the Dupont's lark. Distance to crop significantly affected microhabitat quality. A patchy structure of herbaceous and shrub was found outside crops in all sampling dates, with more shrub cover and less herbaceous cover as the distance to crops increased. Biomass of hypogeous arthropods significantly decreased when the distance to crops was lower than 50 m. The intensity of space use by Dupont's lark varied according to the sampling date, being higher in spring, and as the distance to crops and the biomass of hypogeous arthropods increased. Negative effects of crops on the space use of this bird species might be shaped both by the effect of the crop itself and by its edge effect on hypogeous arthropods. Our results point to an edge effect of crops of 10-50 m on natural vegetation structure, arthropod availability and use of space by the Dupont`s lark, which suggests that the effective area of optimal habitat available for true steppe species could be overestimated.

AB Previous studies of butterfly diversification in the Neotropics have focused on Amazonia and the tropical Andes, while southern regions of the continent have received little attention. To address the gap in knowledge about the Lepidoptera of temperate South America, we analysed over 3000 specimens representing nearly 500 species from Argentina for a segment of the mitochondria! cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Representing 42% of the country's butterfly fauna, collections targeted species from the Atlantic and Andean forests, and biodiversity hotspots that were previously connected but are now isolated. We assessed COI effectiveness for species discrimination and identification and how its performance was affected by geographic distances and taxon coverage. COI data also allowed to study patterns of genetic variation across Argentina, particularly between populations in the Atlantic and Andean forests. Our results show that COI discriminates species well, but that identification success is reduced on average by similar to 20% as spatial and taxonomic coverage rises. We also found that levels of genetic variation are associated with species' spatial distribution type, a pattern which might reflect differences in their dispersal and colonization abilities. In particular, intraspecific distance between populations in the Atlantic and Andean forests was significantly higher in species with disjunct distributions than in those with a continuous range. All splits between lineages in these forests dated to the Pleistocene, but divergence dates varied considerably, suggesting that historical connections between the Atlantic and Andean forests have differentially affected their shared butterfly fauna. Our study supports the fact that large-scale assessments of mitochondrial DNA variation are a powerful tool for evolutionary studies.

AB Granivorous rodents have been traditionally regarded as antagonistic seed predators. Agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.), however, have also been recognized as mutualistic dispersers of plants because of their role as scatter-hoarders of seeds, especially for large-seeded species. A closer look shows that such definitions are too simplistic for these Neotropical animals because agoutis can influence plant communities not only through seed dispersal of large seeds but also through predation of small seeds and seedlings, evidencing their dual role. Herein, we summarize the literature on plant-agouti interactions, decompose agouti seed dispersal into its quantitative and qualitative components, and discuss how environmental factors and plant traits determine whether these interactions result in mutualisms or antagonisms. We also look at the role of agoutis in a community context, assessing their effectiveness as substitutes for extinct megafaunal frugivores and comparing their ecological functions to those of other extant dispersers of large seeds. We also discuss how our conclusions can be extended to the single other genus in the Dasyproctidae family (Myoprocta). Finally, we examine agoutis' contribution to carbon stocks and summarize current conservation threats and efforts. We recorded 164 interactions between agoutis and plants, which were widespread across the plant phylogeny, confirming that agoutis are generalist frugivores. Seed mass was a main factor determining seed hoarding probability of plant species and agoutis were found to disperse larger seeds than other large-bodied frugivores. Agoutis positively contributed to carbon storage by preying upon seeds of plants with lower carbon biomass and by dispersing species with higher biomass. This synthesis of plant-agouti interactions shows that ecological services provided by agoutis to plant populations and communities go beyond seed dispersal and predation, and we identify still unanswered questions. We hope to emphasise the importance of agoutis in Neotropical forests.

AB PREMISE: A disjunct distribution, where a species' geographic range is discontinuous, can occur through vicariance or long-distance dispersal. Approximately 75 North American plant species exhibit a similar to 650 km disjunction between the Ozark and Appalachian regions. This disjunction is attributed to biogeographic forces including: (1) Eocene-Oligocene vicariance by the formation of the Mississippi embayment; (2) Pleistocene vicariance from interglacial flooding; (3) post-Pleistocene northward colonization from separate glacial refugia; (4) Hypsithermal vicariance due to climate fluctuations; and (5) recent long-distance dispersal. We investigated which of these pathways most likely gave rise to the Appalachian-Ozark disjunction in Delphinium exaltatum.
   METHODS We genotyped populations of D. exaltatum from five Ozark and seven Appalachian localities, analyzed genetic structure, tested the order and timing of divergences using DIYABC, and conducted niche reconstructions up to 21,000 years before present (YBP).
   RESULTS Populations fell into five main genetic clusters, i.e., a group in the central Appalachians, and four "lowland" groups. DIYABC analyses showed the central Appalachian and lowland lineages diverging 11,300 to17,000 YBP, and the lowland groups diverging 6800 to 10,900 YBP. Niche reconstructions showed that suitable climate for the central Appalachian lineage experienced large spatial discontinuity starting 14,000 YBP, such that divergence and persistence before this period is less plausible than divergence thereafter.
   CONCLUSIONS Our results did not fully support any of the original hypotheses. Rather, the oldest divergence likely occurred after 13,500 YBP through expansion into newly opened habitat in the Appalachians. The Appalachian-Ozark disjunction likely resulted from northward dispersal of the lowland lineage as climate warmed during the Holocene.

AB This work constitutes the first comprehensive study of the epifaunal response to biological invasions in coralligenous habitats, which are one of the main hotspots of biodiversity in the Mediterranean. The epifaunal community inhabiting the invasive macroalga Rugulopteryx okamurae and other dominant sessile hosts on coralligenous habitats (i.e. the sponge Spongia lamella, the gorgonian Paramuricea clavata, and the macroalga Sphaerococcus coronopifolius) was characterized. A total of 137 taxa were found. There was a lack of functional equivalence between macroalgal species (both native and invasive) and sessile invertebrates. Despite the absence of significant differences in mean density values and number of species per replicate among host species, epifaunal composition on gorgonians and sponges differed significantly from that on both macroalgae. Epifaunal assemblages, especially those inhabiting macroalgal species, were dominated by generalist detritivorous species that can inhabit different hosts, while specialized interactions between mobile epifauna and sessile hosts were observed almost exclusively on sessile invertebrates. Moreover, epifaunal community associated with invertebrate hosts showed higher spatial heterogeneity in comparison with native and invasive macroalgae. A competitive displacement of native hosts by the spreading of R. okamurae on coralligenous habitats would likely result in a biotic impoverishment in terms of overall number of species and a taxonomical and functional homogenization of the epifaunal community. Specialist species with a heterogeneous distribution could be gradually replaced by a spatially homogeneous assemblage dominated by generalist species.

AB Forest understories play a vital role in ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. However, the extent to which environmental conditions drive dominant ecological strategies in forest understories at the continental scale remains understudied. Here, we used similar to 29 500 forest vegetation plots sampled across Europe and classified into 25 forest types to explore the relative role of macroclimate, soil pH and tree canopy cover in driving abundance-weighted patterns in the leaf economic spectrum (LES) and plant size spectrum (PSS) of forest understories (shrub and herb layers). We calculated LES using specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and PSS using plant height and seed mass of vascular plant species found in the understories. We found that forest understories had more conservative leaf economics in areas with more extreme mean annual temperatures (mainly Fennoscandia and the Mediterranean Basin), more extreme soil pH and under more open canopies. Warm and summer-dry regions around the Mediterranean Basin and areas of Atlantic Europe also had taller understories with heavier seeds than continental temperate or boreal areas. Understories of broadleaved deciduous forests, such as Fagus forests on non-acid soils, or ravine forests, more commonly hosted species with acquisitive leaf economics. In contrast, some coniferous forests, such as Pinus, Larbc and Picea mire forests, or Pinus sylvestris light taiga and sclerophyllous forests, more commonly hosted species with conservative leaf economics. Our findings highlight the importance of macroclimate and soil factors in driving trait variation of understory communities at the continental scale and the mediator effect of canopy cover on these relationships. We also provide the first maps and analyses of LES and PSS of forest understories across Europe and give evidence that the understories of European forest types are differently positioned along major axes of trait variation.

AB Flood and fire act as ecological filters which can interact to shape forest structure and species composition. Our objective was to investigate how the interaction between fire and flood influences richness, abundance, basal area and species composition of the tree community and the monodominant belts of Attalea phalerata Mart. in forest islets of the Pantanal wetland. We used satellite images to find 12 forest islets without fire events from 1998 to 2014, and 12 forest islets burned only once in the same period in a fire event in 2009. In these forest islets, we set up a transect with 10 to 14 contiguous 5 x 10 m plots and sampled all trees with a diameter at breast height of >= 4.7 cm. We also measured the watermark height. Flooding influenced species richness and abundance, increased toward wetter areas of the forest islet flood gradient. In contrast, the interaction between fire and flood inverted that trend, with richness and abundance increasing in flood-free areas. Total basal area increases in the more flooded areas of the gradient. The fire or the interaction between fire and flooding did not influence the basal area. The relative abundance of A. phalerata increased with flood level and even more under the fire-flood interaction. We conclude that the interaction between fire and flood influences forest islet structure and species composition; moreover, it favors A. phalerata monodominance.

AB To understand genetic diversity in focal species, it is important to consider the possibility of speciation with gene flow, especially in species with porous genomes such as oaks. We studied genetic diversity and structure in three oaks, Quercus mongolica var. mongolicoides (QM), Q. mongolica var. crispula (QC) and Q. serrata (QS), growing in the Tokai region, central Japan. QM is semi-endemic to the region while the others are common taxa. We also conducted demographic modeling to infer their population size change and migration histories using an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach. The three taxa showed distinct genetic structures but there was genetic admixture among the taxa, especially between QM and QC. ABC analysis of population size change revealed that the population size of QM was stable during and after the last glacial period, while QC and QS showed population expansion after the last glacial maximum. ABC analysis of population divergence and migration revealed that continuous gene flow between QM and QC after their divergence was supported, while between QM and QS, and between QC and QS, secondary contact after sufficient isolation was supported. These historical migration patterns among the three taxa indicate that QM and QC are currently in the early stage or gray zone of speciation, whereas speciation of the other two taxon pairs is considered to have almost been established. Observed gene flow patterns and strength between QM and QC, and between QM and QS, were explained by both flowering patterns and historical distributions, but those between QC and QS were not.

AB Members of Forticulcitinae Blasco-Costa, Balbuena, Kostadinova & Olson, 2009 include endoparasites of mullet fishes distributed worldwide. Adult specimens were collected from the intestines of white mullet (Mugil curema) and flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) from five localities in the Gulf of Mexico and a single locality in Venezuela. Photogenophores were sequenced for two nuclear molecular markers, the large subunit (LSU) and second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of nuclear rDNA. The new sequences were aligned with other sequences downloaded from GenBank. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian inferences were deduced using the combined dataset (LSU + ITS2). The phylogenetic analyses revealed four new lineages belonging to Forticulcitinae. Three new species are described in the present study. Ekuarhuni mexicanusn. sp. can be differentiated from its congeneric species by presenting a longer hermaphroditic sac length (136-180 mu m) and a wider testis (91-123 mu m). Forticulcita macropharyngisn. sp. and Forticulcita venezuelensisn. sp. are the 8th and 9th species described in Forticulcita. Both species belong to the diminutive morphotype of Forticulcita. Forticulcita macropharyngisn. sp. can be morphologically distinguished from the other congeneric species by the presence of a massive and muscular pharynx (46-110 mu m long, 74-106 mu m wide). Forticulcita venezuelensisn. sp. is the second species of the studied genus recorded in South America and can be differentiated from congeneric species by possessing the largest testis (138-201 mu m long, 83-100 mu m wide). Finally, the fourth lineage corresponds to Overstreetoides Andrade-Gomez & Garcia-Varela, 2021; however, few specimens of this lineage were collected, precluding any description of the species. In addition, a key is proposed for differentiating the genera and species of Forticulcitinae.

AB Background Populations living in fragmented habitats may suffer from loss of genetic variation and reduced between-patch dispersal, which are processes that can result in genetic differentiation. This occurs frequently in species with reduced mobility, whereas genetic differentiation is less common among mobile species such as migratory birds. The high dispersal capacity in the latter species usually allows for gene flow even in fragmented landscapes. However, strongly philopatric behaviour can reinforce relative isolation and the degree of genetic differentiation. The Southern Dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii) is a philopatric, long-distance migratory shorebird and shows reduced dispersal between isolated breeding patches. The endangered population of the Southern Dunlin breeding at the Baltic Sea has suffered from habitat deterioration and fragmentation of coastal meadows. We sampled DNA across the entire population and used 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci to examine whether the environmental changes have resulted in genetic structuring and loss of variation. Results We found a pattern of isolation-by-distance across the whole Baltic population and genetic differentiation between local populations, even within the southern Baltic. Observed heterozygosity was lower than expected throughout the range and internal relatedness values were positive indicating inbreeding. Conclusions Our results provide long-term, empirical evidence for the theoretically expected links between habitat fragmentation, population subdivision, and gene flow. They also demonstrate a rare case of genetic differentiation between populations of a long-distance migratory species. The Baltic Southern Dunlin differs from many related shorebird species that show near panmixia, reflecting its philopatric life history and the reduced connectivity of its breeding patches. The results have important implications as they suggest that reduced connectivity of breeding habitats can threaten even long-distance migrants if they show strong philopatry during breeding. The Baltic Southern Dunlin warrants urgent conservation efforts that increase functional connectivity and gene flow between breeding areas.

AB Key Message Frost-sensitive and frost-resistant Cerrado tree species differ in their morphological and physiological traits, which are linked with their resprout strategies and can affect their persistence under recurrent frost events. Although fire is the most common disturbance affecting neotropical savannas, frost events are locally common and are sometimes severe enough to cause dieback of savanna trees at their southern limit of distribution. However, it is yet to be elucidated how physiology and morphology determine which species are frost sensitive. In this study, we evaluated morphological and physiological responses of trees to controlled low temperatures and to a severe frost event that occurred in 2016 at savanna sites of Southeastern Brazil. We determined the degree of bud protection, branch bark thickness, resprout strategies, and recovery of height and biomass 1 year after frost occurrence, and we performed an experiment to measure the photosynthetic capacity of leaves after exposure to low temperatures. We found that frost-sensitive species had unprotected buds, but were able to recover their lost biomass 1 year after frost. Frost-resistant species had buds with a greater degree of protection and maintained higher photosynthetic capacity under sub-zero temperatures. We did not find any differences in bark thickness between frost-resistant and frost-sensitive species. Frost-resistant and frost-sensitive species had different strategies to persist under frost events; however, if frost were more frequent, it could severely affect the height and carbon gain of sensitive species.

AB The incidence of several respiratory viral infections has been shown to be related to climate. Because humans spend most of their time indoors, measures of indoor climate, rather than outdoor climate, may be better predictors of disease incidence and transmission. Therefore, understanding the relationship between indoor and outdoor climate will help illuminate their influence on the seasonality of diseases caused by respiratory viruses. Indoor-outdoor relationships between temperature and humidity have been documented in temperate regions, but little information is available for tropical regions, where seasonal patterns of respiratory viral diseases differ. We have examined indoor-outdoor correlations of temperature, relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH) over a 1-year period in each of seven tropical cities. Across all cities, the average monthly indoor temperature was 25 +/- 3 degrees C (mean +/- standard deviation) with a range of 20-30 degrees C. The average monthly indoor RH was 66 +/- 9% with a range of 50-78%, and the average monthly indoor AH was 15 +/- 3 g/m(3) with a range of 10-23 g/m(3). Indoor AH and RH were linearly correlated with outdoor AH when the air conditioning (AC) was off, suggesting that outdoor AH may be a good proxy of indoor humidity in the absence of AC. All indoor measurements were more strongly correlated with outdoor measurements as distance from the equator increased. Such correlations were weaker during the wet season, especially when AC was in operation. These correlations will provide insight for assessing the seasonality of respiratory viral infections using outdoor climate data, which is more widely available than indoor data, even though transmission of these diseases mainly occurs indoors.

AB Trap-building predators, such as web-building spiders and pit-building antlions, construct traps to capture their prey. These predators compete over sites that either enable the construction of suitable traps, are prey rich, or simply satisfy their abiotic requirements. We examined the effect of intraspecific competition over suitable space in pit-building wormlions. As expected, the ability of wormlions to select their favorable microhabitats-shaded or deep sand over lit or shallow sand-decreased with increasing density. Favorable microhabitats were populated more frequently by large than by small individuals and the density of individuals in the favorable microhabitat decreased with their increase in body mass. The advantage of large individuals in populating favorable microhabitats is nevertheless not absolute: both size categories constructed smaller pits when competing over a limited space compared to those constructed in isolation. The outcome of competition also depends on the type of habitat: deep sand is more important for large wormlions than small ones, while shade is similarly important for both size classes. Finally, in contrast to previous reports, cannibalism is shown here to be possible in wormlions. Its prevalence however is much lower compared to that documented in other trap-building predators. Our findings show that the advantage of large individuals over small ones should not be taken for granted, as it can depend on the environmental context. We present suggestions for the relative lack of competitive advantage of large wormlion individuals compared to other trap-building predators, which may stem from the absence of obvious weaponry, such as sharp mandibles.

AB Few studies have examined geographical variation in traits involved in biotic interactions, although such variation is likely key in the evolution of interactions. The fit between hummingbird bills and the flowers they feed on suggests mutual selection pressures. We tested for geographical variation in the pollinator-flower fit in the Mexican hermit Phaethornis mexicanus and Heliconia spp. flowers by analyzing the morphospaces of the interacting species and the ways they vary. To analyze the geographical variation in the morphology of P. mexicanus and Heliconia spp. flowers, we grouped samples into three operational geographic units (OGUs). Within each OGU, we assessed pollinator-flower specificity by analyzing floral resource preference, and morphological data using correlations and principal component analysis. Our data on floral preferences and morphology indicate geographical variation in the P. mexicanus-Heliconia interaction in all of the OGUs. Heliconia was the preferred floral resource (83% of the samples), suggesting a preference for these flowers as a food source. We also detected morphological overlap between the bill of P. mexicanus and the corollas of both Heliconia species, at least in the two westernmost OGUs. That P. mexicanus morphology tracked variation in the different Heliconia spp. across the hummingbird's range suggests that the specificity of the hummingbird-plant interaction exerts a significant selection pressure on hummingbird morphology. The morphological overlap observed in the two northernmost OGUs is probably due to the evolution of a close biotic interaction, which is reflected in the high correlation values in the morphological characters involved.

AB Sri Lanka is a biodiversity hotspot within the Indo-Malayan Biogeographic region. The lowland and montane rainforest ecoregions contain high proportions of endemic species whose populations are experiencing increasing levels of isolation and fragmentation due to habitat destruction. One of these threatened species, the rough-nosed horned lizard (Ceratophora aspera), is distributed across the lowland rainforests of Southwestern Sri Lanka, making it a well-suited species to understand the consequences of rainforest fragmentation on population genetic structure. We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to characterize genetic diversity and population structure of C. aspera across the Southwestern rainforests of Sri Lanka. Population structure and phylogenetic analyses supported the separation of populations into four forest groups that show a pattern of isolation by distance. We propose recommendations for the conservation of C. aspera that consider genetic variation, biogeographic history, and natural history. This project underscores the necessity of using holistic approaches to make well-informed decisions for conservation of forest specialist species, especially during forest landscape restoration.

AB Although roads are widely seen as dispersal barriers, their genetic consequences for animals that experience large fluctuations in population density are poorly documented. We developed a spatially paired experimental design to assess the genetic impacts of roads on cyclic voles (Microtus arvalis) during a high-density phase in North-Western Spain. We compared genetic patterns from 15 paired plots bisected by three different barrier types, using linear mixed models and computing effect sizes to assess the importance of each type, and the influence of road features like width or the age of the infrastructure. Evidence of effects by roads on genetic diversity and differentiation were lacking. We speculate that the recurrent (each 3-5 generations) episodes of massive dispersal associated with population density peaks can homogenize populations and mitigate the possible genetic impact of landscape fragmentation by roads. This study highlights the importance of developing spatially replicated experimental designs that allow us to consider the large natural spatial variation in genetic parameters. More generally, these results contribute to our understanding of the not well explored effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal in species showing "boom-bust" dynamics.

AB The highly migratory Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT) is currently managed as two distinct stocks, in accordance with natal homing behavior and population structuring despite the absence of barriers to gene flow. Larval fish are valuable biological material for tuna molecular ecology. However, they have hardly been used to decipher the ABFT population structure, although providing the genetic signal from successful breeders. For the first time, cooperative field collection of tuna larvae during 2014 in the main spawning area for each stock, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and the Mediterranean Sea (MED), enabled us to assess the ABFT genetic structure in a precise temporal and spatial frame exclusively through larvae. Partitioning of genetic diversity at nuclear microsatellite loci and in the mitochondrial control region in larvae spawned contemporarily resulted in low significant fixation indices supporting connectivity between spawners in the main reproduction area for each population. No structuring was detected within the GOM after segregating nuclear diversity in larvae spawned in two hydrographically distinct regions, the eastern GOM (eGOM) and the western GOM (wGOM), with the larvae from eGOM being more similar to those collected in the MED than the larvae from wGOM. We performed clustering of genetically characterized ABFT larvae through Bayesian analysis and by Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) supportin g the existence of favorable areas for mixing of ABFT spawners from Western and Eastern stocks, leading to gene flow and apparent connectivity between weakly structured populations. Our findings suggest that the eastern GOM is more prone for the mixing of breeders from the two ABFT populations. Conservation of this valuable resource exploited for centuries calls for intensification of tuna ichthyoplankton research and standardization of genetic tools for monitoring population dynamics.

AB Systematic revisions of South American marsupials have contributed to our knowledge about genus and species diversity in the last decades, including studies of the most recently described genus Cryptonanus (Didelphidae), currently comprising four recognized species. Herein we provide the first phylogeny for these mouse opossums based on comprehensive sampling, including representatives from all nominal taxa, encompassing most of the geographic distribution of the genus while also extending its known range. The taxonomic status of Cryptonanus species was explored by analyses of multiple mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers to assess phylogenetic relationships and to provide divergence time estimates, species delimitations and biogeographical hypotheses. Cryptonanus monophyly remained highly supported despite the inclusion of abundant new data from more than a hundred specimens, comprising 10 independent evolutionary lineages. Species-complexes within valid nominal taxa reveal higher species richness in the genus. Based on divergence estimates from a dated phylogeny, we suggest that Cryptonanus diversified along the Quaternary, with speciation events occurring well into the Pleistocene. The best supported biogeographical hypothesis endorses speciation by vicariance and subset speciation across open formations in shaping the evolutionary history of this didelphid genus, strongly associated with dry tropical landscapes of South America.

AB Savanna woody species evolved with fire. However, the effect of changes in the fire regimes, which tend to increase in the next decades, is not yet fully understood. Here, we tested the effects of increased fire frequency on species richness and the composition of woody plant communities. Specifically, we tested if a high frequency fire management reduces local species richness of communities and homogenizes species composition. We sampled woody plants in 40 sites, distributed in 20 pairs, in Emas National Park (Brazil). Each pair included sites with high fire frequency (firebreaks that are burned annually since 1994) and with natural fire frequency (occurring every 3-5 years). We used a paired t-test to assess effects of the two fire frequency treatments on species richness and permutation tests to compare distance decay in similarity composition and relative abundances. We found that sites with high fire frequency had lower species richness compared to their paired sites subjected to natural fire frequency. However, similarities in species composition among sites with high fire frequency were only slightly higher than among sites subjected to natural fire frequency. The rate of distance decay in similarity was similar on the two treatments. At local scales, the high frequency of fire reduced species richness, an impact that in the long run may be irreversible. However, at broader spatial scales, effects were small as two treatments included similar sets of species. Prescribed fires have the potential to modify the natural dynamics of the woody communities in the savannas we studied. In our study, fire appears to act as a hierarchical filter, selecting species at broader spatial scales and nesting communities at local scales.

AB The Caatinga, the largest region of seasonally dry tropical forest in the Neotropics, suffers high rates of deforestation and habitat degradation, mostly due to wood extraction. As an alternative to illegal logging, governments have looked at more sustainable management schemes, allowing natural regeneration after logging through relatively long (similar to 25-year) harvest rotations. We investigated the impacts of forest management at a 1,700-ha privately owned area located at the Araripe Plateau, in the semiarid interior of northeastern Brazil, focusing on the population parameters of 8 avian species. The property was subdivided into 22 forest stands, where a different stand has been logged every year since 2004. By 2016, when we sampled the avifauna, 12 forest stands had already been logged and allowed to regrow, creating a landscape of logged and unlogged stands and a 12-year forest recovery chrono-sequence. We conducted distance-based sampling along transects to estimate the density and abundance of these species in logged and unlogged stands. We found that logging impacted 3 of the target species. Two of them (Megaxenops parnaguae and Synallaxis scutata) were less abundant, whereas another (Sclerurus cearensis) disappeared altogether from logged areas. We also found a positive correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the avian density of the affected species. However, we failed to observe any significant relationship between forest recovery or NDVI and species densities, suggesting that even after 12 years of forest recovery, species abundance remains lower in logged than in unlogged areas. We found that logging impacted birds in a species-specific manner, with 5 species unaffected and 3 species declining. Although our sampling occurred half-way through the regeneration cycle, we found no evidence of recovery for those species most affected. We suggest keeping unlogged areas intermingled with logged stands, allowing the survival and potential recovery of species in regenerating forests.

AB In seasonally dry tropical environments, natural archives of isotopes present in cellulose of tree rings can be used to study changes in the hydrological cycle. We investigated the stable oxygen isotope ratios in tree-ring cellulose (delta O-18(TRC)) of Cedrela odorata L. from Caatinga forest, northeastern Brazil, and tested if delta O-18(TRC) is correlated to climate parameters. We extracted the alpha-cellulose from the most recent 50 tree rings (1968-2017). The inter-annual variation of delta O-18(TRC) was strongly synchronized (r = 0.65) among all five studied individuals and closely related to changes in humidity during the growing season. The delta O-18(TRC) was significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with precipitation (r = - 0.59), relative humidity (r = - 0.37), air temperature (r = 0.55), soil water deficit (r = 0.62) and PDSI drought index (r = - 0.62), with most significant correlation during wet season and in the first month of the dry season. The relationship with local climate variables reflects the effect of evaporative enrichment of leaf water on delta O-18(TRC), whereby dry soil conditions, the low relative humidity and high air temperature reduce stomatal conductance and lead to increased evaporative enrichment of delta O-18(TRC). Spatial correlations revealed a strong impact of PDSI in delta O-18(TRC). Our results also show an increase in delta O-18(TRC) values from the 1990s onwards due to extreme and recurring droughts in northeastern Brazil. We conclude that delta O-18(TRC) variations are related to the climatic conditions, especially during the wet period due to the greater water availability for plant physiological processes.

AB Hummingbirds have two main foraging strategies: territoriality (defending a patch of flowers) and traplining (foraging over routine circuits of isolated patches). Species are often classified as employing one or the other. Not only have these strategies been inconsistently defined within the behavioral literature, but this simple framework also neglects the substantial evidence for flexible foraging behavior displayed by hummingbirds. Despite these limitations, research on hummingbird foraging has explored the distinct avenues of selection that proponents of either strategy presumably face: trapliners maximizing foraging efficiency, and territorialists favoring speed and maneuverability for resource defense. In earlier studies, these functions were primarily examined through wing disc loading (ratio of body weight to the circular area swept out by the wings, WDL) and predicted hovering costs, with trapliners expected to exhibit lower WDL than territorialists and thus lower hovering costs. While these pioneering models continue to play a role in current research, early studies were constrained by modest technology, and the original expectations regarding WDL have not held up when applied across complex hummingbird assemblages. Current technological advances have allowed for innovative research on the biomechanics/energetics of hummingbird flight, such as allometric scaling relationships (e.g., wing area-flight performance) and the link between high burst lifting performance and territoriality. Providing a predictive framework based on these relationships will allow us to reexamine previous hypotheses, and explore the biomechanical trade-offs to different foraging strategies, which may yield divergent routes of selection for quintessential territoriality and traplining. With a biomechanical and morphofunctional lens, here we examine the locomotor and energetic facets that dictate hummingbird foraging, and provide (a) predictions regarding the behavioral, biomechanical, and morphofunctional associations with territoriality and traplining; and (b) proposed methods of testing them. By pursuing these knowledge gaps, future research could use a variety of traits to help clarify the operational definitions of territoriality and traplining, to better apply them in the field.

AB Optimal size of social groups may vary between individuals, depending on their phenotypic traits, such as dominance status, age or personality. Larger social groups often enhance transmission rates of pathogens and should be avoided by individuals with poor immune defences. In contrast, more immunocompetent individuals are expected to take advantage of larger group sizes (e.g. better protection, information transfer) with smaller extra costs from pathogen or parasite pressure.
   Here, we hypothesized that immunocompetence may be a key determinant of group size choice and tested this hypothesis in a colonial waterbird, the common tern Sterna hirundo. We used a unique experimental framework, where formation of breeding colonies of different sizes was induced under uniform environmental conditions. For this purpose, different-size patches of attractive nesting substrate (artificial floating rafts) were provided at a single site with limited availability of natural nesting habitat.
   Colony size was identified as the only significant predictor of both innate (natural antibody-mediated complement activation) and adaptive (immunoglobulin concentrations) immunological traits in the common terns, as more immunocompetent birds settled in larger experimental colonies. In contrast, we found no significant associations between colony size and genetic diversity of key pathogen-recognition receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) or genome-wide heterozygosity.
   We conclude that settlement decisions may be flexible within individuals and, thus, are likely to be primarily determined by the current immunological status, rather than fixed immunogenetic traits. Our study sheds new light on the complex interface between immunity and sociality in animals.

AB Aim. The global increase in the cultivation of native wild plants has raised concerns regarding potential risks associated with translocating genetic lineages beyond their natural range. This study aimed to investigate whether agricultural cultivation of neo-crops (a) accounts for the levels of genetic diversity present in wild populations, and whether (b) cultivated populations are genetically divergent from wild populations and thus pose a potential threat to wild genetic diversity.
   Location. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR), located along the southern Cape of South Africa.
   Methods. High Resolution Melt analysis (HRM) coupled with Sanger sequencing was used to screen three non-coding chloroplast DNA loci in Cyclopia Vent. (Fabaceae), a CFR endemic neo-crop cultivated for the production of a herbal infusion referred to as Honeybush tea. Wild and cultivated populations for three of three widely cultivated Honeybush species (C. intermedia, C. longifolia, and C. subternata) were screened. Genetic diversity and differentiation were measured and compared between wild and cultivated groups.
   Results. Across all asseccions, a total of 17 haplotypes were detected, four of which were shared between wild and cultivated populations, while the remaining 13 were only detected in wild populations. Genetic diversity and differentiation was significantly higher in wild populations than in cultivated populations.
   Conclusions. If no guidelines exist to facilitate the introduction of native wild plant taxa to a cultivated setting, wild genetic diversity patterns are likely to be compromised by cultivated populations. In the case presented here, cultivation represents a genetic bottleneck, failing to account for rare haplotypes, and may have disrupted species boundaries by initiating interspecific hybridization. More empirical work is required to evaluate the extent to which neo-crop cultivation poses a risk to wild genetic resources in the CFR and globally.

AB Aviculturists are enthusiastic to be included in conservation efforts by providing expertise or genetic stock to support captive-breeding or reintroduction programmes, but little work has explored these possibilities. Bringing organisms into captivity can have rapid and profound effects on behaviour, physiology, and population genetic diversity, which can have important consequences for viability of reintroduction and the extrapolation of captive experiments to wild counterparts. The Gouldian Finch (Erythrura gouldiae) is a popular avicultural species that is endangered in the wild, and potential flagship for such reintroduction efforts. Here we used microsatellite and mitochondrial markers to characterise genetic diversity within and among avicultural populations in the broader population of domesticated Gouldian Finches in Australia, and with respect to natural head-colour morphs and artificially selected plumage variation. Domesticated Gouldian Finches have reduced the number of genetic variants by 32-48% compared to current wild populations, as well as high relatedness, and genetic structure among aviculturists. Indeed, regardless of collection size no aviculturist approached the total diversity held among all breeders. Head-colour genotype frequencies were substantially different from the wild, potentially due to selection or non-random mating in the domesticated populations. Given the previously established relationship between head-colour and functional traits, and possible adaptation to captivity, we suggest caution before introducing domesticated stock into the wild. Indeed, the status quo of relatively closed populations is potentially susceptible to inbreeding depression and further loss of genetic diversity, and we recommend a nationwide genetics-aware approach to any reintroduction programmes.

AB Concerns with distributional justice invariably arise in environmental governance, especially in the conservation and management of common-pool resources. These initiatives generate an array of costs and benefits that are typically heterogeneously distributed. Distribution of these impacts in a way that is considered fair by local stakeholders is not only a moral imperative, but instrumental to achieving social and ecological success given perceived unfairness fosters conflict and undermines cooperation. However, understandings of local stakeholders' conceptions of distributional fairness are rare because research often assesses distributional outcomes based on tacit assumptions about what constitutes fairness (e.g. equality). We examine what local stakeholders consider distributional fairness with respect to monetary benefits arising from a collective payment for ecosystem services scheme in a co-managed marine protected area in Fiji. In six villages associated with the co-managed marine protected area, we elicited individuals' fairness judgements of five distributional justice principles: equality, need, and three forms of proportionality based on customary rights, fisheries opportunity-costs, and involvement in co-management. We examine how fairness judgements are associated with socio-demographic characteristics indicative of key identities, thereby building on socially-aggregated approaches typical of the nascent literature on perceived fairness. We find the rights-based principle was considered the 'most fair' and the opportunity-costs principle the 'least fair'. Our findings challenge prevailing understandings of distributional justice in conservation and commons management, which favour the principles of equality or opportunity-cost. We also find that education was significantly positively related to fairness judgements of all principles, whilst wealth was significantly related to the equality and the opportunity-based principles. These results provide insights into how fairness judgements could be influenced by key elements of current social change in the Global South (e.g. increasing formal education, market engagement and wealth accumulation). Overall, our results suggest that fair environmental governance requires explicit identification of distributional fairness conceptions of those most affected by such initiatives, especially in a context of increasing globalisation of conservation knowledge and practice.

AB Understanding the interaction between canopy structure and the parameters of interception loss is essential in predicting the variations in partitioning rainfall and water resources as affected by changes in canopy structure and in implementing water-based management in semiarid forest plantations. In this study, seasonal variations in rainfall interception loss and canopy storage capacity as driven by canopy structure were predicted and the linkages were tested using seasonal filed measurements. The study was conducted in nine 50 m x 50 m Robinia pseudoacacia plots in the semiarid region of China's Loess Plateau. Gross rainfall, throughfall and stemflow were measured in seasons with and without leaves in 2015 and 2016. Results show that measured average interception loss for the nine plots were 17.9% and 9.4% of gross rainfall during periods with leaves (the growing season) and without leaves, respectively. Average canopy storage capacity estimated using an indirect method was 1.3 mm in the growing season and 0.2 mm in the leafless season. Correlations of relative interception loss and canopy storage capacity to canopy variables were highest for leaf/wood area index (LAI/WAI) and canopy cover, followed by bark area, basal area, tree height and stand density. Combined canopy cover, leaf/wood area index and bark area multiple regression models of interception loss and canopy storage capacity were established for the growing season and in the leafless season in 2015. It explained 97% and 96% of the variations in relative interception loss during seasons with and without leaves, respectively. It also explained 98% and 99% of the variations in canopy storage capacity during seasons with and without leaves, respectively. The empirical regression models were validated using field data collected in 2016. The models satisfactorily predicted relative interception loss and canopy storage capacity during seasons with and without leaves. This study provides greater understanding about the effects of changes in tree canopy structure (e.g., dieback or mortality) on hydrological processes.

AB Tree species composition and diversity were assessed in six forest communities at an altitudinal gradient (i.e. from 247 to 1478 m) by laying four plots of 0.1 ha in each site within sub-tropical forest belt in Mokokchung, Nagaland. A total of 777 individuals belonging to 118 species, 84 genera and 43 families were recorded. The most dominant families from these sites were: Fagaceae, Moraceae, Anacardiaceae and Malvaceae. The tree density (individuals ha(-1)) in the present study ranged from 313 in Dillenia-Duabanga-Macaranga community to 330 in Morus-Vernonia-Hovenia community. The total basal area (m(2 )ha(-1)) ranged between 22.95 and 38.03 in Morus-Vernonia-Hovenia and Bombax-Melia-Gmelina community, respectively. The dominance-diversity curve showed high equitability and low dominance in forest communities (i.e. Trema-Kydia-Callicarpa, Morus-Vernonia-Hovenia and Alnus-Duabanga-Morus) occupied higher altitudes (1145-1478 m) and followed a log-normal distribution pattern. Whereas, the dominance-diversity curve showed low equitability and high dominance in communities (i.e. Bombax-Melia-Gmelina, Dillenia-Duabang-Macaranga and Albizia-Sapium-Gmelina) occupied lower altitudes (247-674 m) and followed a short hooked curve pattern. The Shannon diversity index ranged from 2.95 to 3.88 indicating high tree species diversity in forest communities studied. The Simpson dominance index ranged from 0.03 to 0.09. Over all this study provides useful information on tree species composition and diversity of subtropical forest of Nagaland which can be used as baseline data by the forest department to develop plans for the conservation of forest in subtropical forest, Northeast India.

AB Aim The centre-periphery hypothesis (CPH) states that peripheral populations exhibit lower genetic diversity, abundance and size, and higher differentiation compared to central populations, due to a decline in environmental suitability towards range margins. Here, we tested if neutral genetic diversity and functional leaf trait diversity fit the predicted patterns of the CPH.
   Location Cerrado, Brazil.
   Taxon Qualea grandiflora (Vochysiaceae) and Annona crassiflora (Annonaceae).
   Methods Variation in eight functional leaf traits and nine or eight microsatellite loci were analysed in 37 populations (777 individuals) of Q. grandiflora and 21 populations (397 individuals) of A. crassiflora. We tested CPH using three distinct centres of species' range: geographical (centre of species' geographic occurrence), historical (centre of species' refugia) and ecological (centre of species' current suitability areas). Generalised linear regressions were performed between genetic diversity and differentiation, coefficients of variation and means of leaf metamer traits of populations and their distances from each centre.
   Results A decrease in allele richness was observed from central towards peripheral populations for ecological (both species) and geographical centres (Q. grandiflora). Overall, the results for both species pointed to a decrease in metamer vigour towards marginal populations, pattern consistent with a decrease in environmental suitability towards periphery as predicted by CPH. Besides geographical and ecological centres, leaf traits fitted CPH considering historical centre.
   Main Conclusions Results for leaf traits and genetic diversity of two phylogenetically distant species indicate the consistency of the CPH for Cerrado species. Our results highlight the importance of considering distinct centres and a great number of populations along species' range to better determinate the processes underlying the distribution of genetic diversity and functional traits. The low genetic diversity and metamer vigour in marginal populations can explain the Cerrado endemism of studied species and suggest that the ongoing climatic changes can be critical for their survival.

AB Ecosystem nutrient economies are commonly studied from the perspective of primary productivity in relation to nutrient availability, but a plant-specific view limits our ability to predict broader-scale patterns related to nutrient economics, such as ecosystem carbon turnover and storage controlled by soil microbial communities. Viewing nutrient economics from the heterotrophic decomposer community perspective can provide an additional perspective on ecosystem nutrient economics. We used microbial investment in extracellular enzyme production and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry theory as a conceptual framework to study nutrient economics in forest soils of the Northeast United States. Two years after experimentally increasing soil pH and phosphorus availability to offset the effects of chronic acid and nitrogen deposition, we found that belowground microbial communities were consistently investing more energy into phosphorus acquisition relative to nitrogen, in both space and time, suggesting that ecosystem demand for phosphorus might be high relative to nitrogen. Moreover, soil age and weathering, quantified by comparing glaciated vs non-glaciated regions, might not be useful predictors of nutrient economics in these forest systems. This study offers important insight into controls on ecosystem nutrient dynamics and soil microbial resource investment, information that can inform efforts to model soil microbial interactions and ecosystem carbon dynamics.

AB Background: Secondary forests have become the major forest type worldwide. Research on spatial patterns and associations of tree species at different developmental stages may be informative in understanding the structure and dynamic processes of secondary forests.
   Methods: In this study, we used point pattern analysis to analyze the spatial patterns and associations of tree species at seedling, sapling and adult stages in a 4ha plot in the montane secondary temperate forest of northeastern China.
   Results: We found that species showed similar patterns at seedling, sapling and adult stages, and aggregation was the dominant pattern. The spatial patterns of tree species were mainly affected by habitat heterogeneity. In addition, the strength of positive or negative associated pattern among tree species would decrease with developmental stages, which attributed to neighborhood competition and plant size increasing.
   Conclusions: Our results indicated that the spatial patterns and associations of tree species at seedling and sapling stages partly reflected that at adult stage; habitat heterogeneity and neighborhood competition jointly contributed to species coexistence in this secondary forest.

AB When and how multiple species can or cannot coexist is a fundamental question in ecology. Recent theory suggests that mechanisms other than trophic tradeoff could enhance the coexistence of ecologically similar species, with a strong emphasis on reproductive processes. Therefore, how resource competition and reproductive interactions jointly drive competitive dynamics is an empirical question of interest. In this context, interspecific competition between two congeneric seed beetles, Callosobruchus maculatus and C. chinensis, is a particularly interesting system; they are ecologically similar, their reproductive biology is well understood, and the two species interact with each other reproductively (through reproductive interference). Here, I review the literature for those who are interested in studying the interspecific interactions within this system, with a special emphasis on their reproductive biology and reproductive interference. I also reanalyze the results of a previous study to provide additional insight. At the end of the paper, I suggest several future directions to encourage future work that could provide further general ecological and evolutionary insights.

AB Mating has profound physiological and behavioural consequences for female insects. During copulation, female insects typically receive not only sperm, but a complex ejaculate containing hundreds of proteins and other molecules from male reproductive tissues, primarily the reproductive accessory glands. The post-mating phenotypes affected by male accessory gland (MAG) proteins include egg development, attraction to oviposition hosts, mating, attractiveness, sperm storage, feeding and lifespan. In the Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens, mating increases egg production and the latency to remating. However, previous studies have not found a clear relationship between injection of MAG products and oviposition or remating inhibition in this species. We used RNA-seq to study gene expression in mated, unmated and MAG-injected females to understand the potential mating- and MAG-regulated genes and pathways in A. ludens. Both mating and MAG-injection regulated transcripts and pathways related to egg development. Other transcripts regulated by mating included those with orthologs predicted to be involved in immune response, musculature and chemosensory perception, whereas those regulated by MAG-injection were predicted to be involved in translational control, sugar regulation, diet detoxification and lifespan determination. These results suggest new phenotypes that may be influenced by seminal fluid molecules in A. ludens. Understanding these influences is critical for developing novel tools to manage A. ludens.

AB Genetic diversity and population structure are key resources for breeding purposes and genetic studies of important agronomic traits in crops. In this study, we described SNP-based genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium and population structure in a panel of 179 bread wheat advanced cultivars and old accessions from Bulgaria, using an optimized wheat 25K Infinium iSelect array. Out of 19,019 polymorphic SNPs, 17,968 had a known chromosome position on the A (41%), B (42%) and D (11%) genome, and 6% were not assigned to any chromosome. Homoeologous group 4, in particular chromosome 4D, was the least polymorphic. In the total population, the Nei's gene diversity was within the range 0.1-0.5, and the polymorphism information content ranged from 0.1 to 0.4. Significant differences between the old and modern collections were revealed with respect to the linkage disequilibrium (LD): the average values for LD (r(2)), the percentage of the locus pairs in LD and the LD decay were 0.64, 16% and 3.3 for the old germplasm, and 0.43, 30% and 4.1 for the modern releases, respectively. Structure and k-means clustering algorithm divided the panel into three groups. The old accessions formed a distinct subpopulation. The cluster analysis further distinguished the modern releases according to the geographic region and genealogy. Gene exchange was evidenced mainly between the subpopulations of contemporary cultivars. The achieved understanding of the genetic diversity and structure of the Bulgarian wheat population and distinctiveness of the old germplasm could be of interest for breeders developing cultivars with improved characteristics. The obtained knowledge about SNP informativeness and the LD estimation are worthwhile for selecting markers and for considering the composition of a population in association mapping studies of traits of interest.

AB Baseline data on intrinsic-extrinsic determinants of spatial distribution of flagship species helps wildlife managers develop their management strategies. Globally, large herbivores are in range contraction due to the expansion of human habitation. Of late, alien invasion is raising management concerns due to its detrimental effect on native biota. This study evaluating the determinants of spatial detectability and density distribution of blackbuck Antilope cervicapra, an endemic species of the Indian subcontinent, demonstrates the negative influence of Prosopis juliflora, an alien invasive, on the native blackbuck at three reserves-Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary, Guindy National Park and Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, Tamil Nadu, India. Using distance sampling technique, the study has surveyed blackbuck from 26 grid-based, spatially replicated line-transects between January 2018 and July 2019. Furthermore, 27 covariates related to climate, habitat and anthropogenic pressure were evaluated to determine their effect on spatial detectability and density distribution. Regression by Empirical Variable Selection showed that blackbuck spatial detectability and density distribution increase significantly with the extent of grassland, habitat openness and grass biomass, but decreases with Prosopis cover, shrub cover, percentage of woodland and distance to water, thus revealing their negative effect on the blackbuck. Besides, the Prosopis cover also decreases significantly the key positive predictors of the density distribution of blackbuck, namely the extent of grassland, habitat openness and grass productivity. Thus, the study concludes that the alien invasive species has a negative effect on the native blackbuck population. This raises the need for controlling or eliminating the invasive species in order to conserve, in the long run, the endemic blackbuck at the three reserves.

AB Monitoring biodiversity on a global scale is a major challenge for biodiversity conservation. Field assessments commonly used to assess patterns of biodiversity and habitat condition are costly, challenging, and restricted to small spatial scales. As ecosystems face increasing anthropogenic pressures, it is important that we find ways to assess patterns of biodiversity more efficiently. Remote sensing has the potential to support understanding of landscape-level ecological processes. In this study, we considered cacao agroforests at different stages of secondary succession, and primary forest in the Northern Range of Trinidad, West Indies. We assessed changes in tree biodiversity over succession using both field data, and data derived from remote sensing. We then evaluated the strengths and limitations of each method, exploring the potential for expanding field data by using remote sensing techniques to investigate landscape-level patterns of forest condition and regeneration. Remote sensing and field data provided different insights into tree species compositional changes, and patterns of alpha- and beta-diversity. The results highlight the potential of remote sensing for detecting patterns of compositional change in forests, and for expanding on field data in order to better understand landscape-level patterns of forest diversity.

AB Patterns of structural change associated with monodominant tropical forest complexes have remained enigmatic for decades. Here, we extend previous efforts in presenting a longitudinal, local-scale analysis of forest dynamics in central Africa. Using four 10-ha census plots measured across three time periods (959,312 stems >= 1 cm DBH), we analyzed changes in a number of biometrical attributes for four distinct forest types capturing the developmental gradient from mixed species forest to Gilbertiodendron dewevrei-dominated forest. We modeled above-ground biomass (AGB), basal area (BA), and stem density across all species, and diameter at breast height (DBH), recruitment, and mortality for Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. We hypothesized that trends in these attributes are consistent with a slow spread of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei into adjacent mixed species forest. We identified statistically significant increases in AGB and BA across sites and positive, though nonsignificant, increases in AGB and BA for most forest types. DBH and relative recruitment increased significantly for Gilbertiodendron dewevrei stems, while relative mortality did not. When looking from mixed species to transitional to monodominant forest types, we found a statistically significant pattern of developmental aggradation and net expansion of monodominant forest. We do not attribute this to atmospheric forcing but to a combination of (a) landscape-scale recovery or response to widespread disturbance (primarily historical fires), (b) Gilbertiodendron dewevrei's ectomycorrhizal association, and (c) Gilbertiodendron dewevrei's exceptional stress tolerance traits.

AB The presence of unidentified cryptic species within a species complex can obscure demographic trends of vulnerable species, impacting potential species conservation and management decisions. Previous work identified a taxonomic split between Central and South American populations of the mealy amazon (Amazona farinosa) that subsequently resulted in the elevation of these two populations to full species status (Amazona guatemalae and A. farinosa, respectively). In that study, however, a third, geographically disjunct population from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest was insufficiently sampled, limiting the ability of researchers to fully evaluate its genetic distinctiveness. Given that significant levels of biodiversity and endemism are found in this region, we aimed to use genetic and behavioral data to determine if the Atlantic Forest population of A. f. farinosa represents a third cryptic species within the complex. We sequenced 6 genes (4 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear introns) from the Atlantic Forest population of A. f. farinosa to measure the genetic relationships between this population and all other recognized species and subspecies of the mealy amazon. In addition, we use spectrographic cross-correlation and an analysis of 29 acoustic parameters to determine whether the taxa diverge in their learned contact call structure and if the degree of vocal differentiation correlates to genetic structure. We found that the Atlantic Forest population of A. f. farinosa was genetically distinct from that of the greater Amazon basin, but the degree of differentiation was less than that separating the Central and South American taxa. Acoustic analysis revealed substantial variation in contact call structure within each clade. This variation created substantial overlap in acoustic space between the clades. In all, the degree of call divergence between clades did not correspond to the degree of genetic divergence between the same clades. The results suggest that in taxa with substantial geographic variation in learned calls, such as the mealy amazon, vocalizations may not be a useful tool in the identification of cryptic species that are lifelong vocal learners. While these results do not support the elevation of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest population of the mealy amazon to full species status, given current trends of habitat loss in the Atlantic Forest as well as the imperiled status of large parrot species globally, we argue that this population nonetheless warrants special conservation and management consideration as a pool of unique genetic diversity within the southern mealy amazon species.

AB Tropical owls are one of the most threatened groups of birds. Studying the association between landscape features and owl assemblages is challenging due to the logistical difficulties of nocturnal fieldwork. We analyzed the association of landscape composition and spatial configuration of forest cover with the composition of the owl assemblages in a tropical rainforest in southeastern Mexico. During the 2014 reproductive season (April to June), we estimated owl abundance through auditory detection and playbacks at 60 survey points distributed in 12 landscapes (625 ha each) within a gradient of forest cover. We found that the owl community comprised six out of the 10 expected resident species. The landscape unit with 41% forest cover contained the most diverse assemblage. The owl species most susceptible to local extinction were specialists of interior areas of old-growth forest. The abundances of the Middle American Screech-Owl (Megascops guatemalae), Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus), and Black-and-white Owl (Ciccaba nigrolineata) were positively associated with the proportion of forest cover as well as with the average size of the patches, but negatively associated with environmental temperature. The abundances of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) were positively related to the amount of urban area in the landscape. The only species recorded along the entire gradient was the Mottled Owl (Ciccaba virgata), a species that is a generalist in habitat and diet; its abundance was positively related to the proportion of forest cover and the amount of water surface (lakes and rivers) in the landscape. Four resident species were not recorded: Crested Owl (Lophostrix cristata), Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata), Striped Owl (Pseudoscops clamator), and Central American Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium griseiceps).

AB Reintroductions are an important tool in conservation for preserving and enhancing biodiversity and preventing extinction, and post-release monitoring is essential to evaluate and inform conservation management and maximize recovery success. By quantifying genetic diversity levels and effective population size (Ne) over time, managers can gauge to what degree additional efforts are needed to increase the likelihood of population persistence. The endangered Northern Aplomado Falcon (Falco femoralis septentrionalis) population in South Texas was reestablished and supplemented with captive-bred individuals originating from 27 founders collected in eastern Mexico (San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, Tabasco, and Chiapas). A total of 927 Aplomado Falcons were released at 23 locations along the southern coast of Texas between 1985 and 2004, and in 2012 and 2013. To assess the species' reintroduction and recovery, we applied a genetic monitoring approach using sampled nestlings (n = 267) from a total of 108 nests in 2004-2005 and 2012-2016. Based on ten microsatellite loci, levels of genetic diversity (i.e., allelic richness and heterozygosity) remained stable over the sampled time period, with no indication of inbreeding. Diversity levels were comparable to a subset of samples collected from the captive population founders (n = 11). Similarly, individuals from the South Texas population showed strong admixture with the founding population, and levels of both N-e and of effective breeding (N-b) showed no signs of decline over the sampled time period. To what degree overlapping generations and the release of additional Aplomado Falcons during the sampled time period limited our assessment of the South Texas population is not fully known. Continued monitoring across multiple generations is advisable to assess the population's ability to persist.

AB African forests are under increasing pressure to supply local, regional, and international demand for timber. Much of this trade is unregulated, such that there is increasing concern regarding the ecological sustainability of this resource use. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the ecological impact of informal timber harvesting in African forests. While forest species have adapted to natural canopy gap dynamics, harvesting may alter natural disturbance regimes, with adverse effects on biodiversity. Information regarding harvest gaps, and concomitant impacts on habitat and biodiversity is thus essential to inform sustainable management. This study compared the frequency and nature of harvest gaps and natural gaps in a coastal forest in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, where informal selective timber harvesting occurs. Habitat condition and bird species richness and composition were compared across intact forest, natural gaps, and harvest gaps. Harvest-created gaps increased the number of canopy gaps by 30%, but were comparable with natural gaps in size. Habitat conditions in harvest gaps represented an intermediate state between intact forest and natural gaps, thereby increasing forest-scale habitat heterogeneity. While bird species richness was not affected, species composition differed across intact forest, harvest gaps and natural gaps, driven by changes in habitat condition, and mediated by species' feeding and nesting traits. Specifically, insectivores, cavity- and ground-nesting species, and hawking and arboreal probing species were negatively affected by the habitat gradient from intact sites to canopy gap conditions, while nectarivores, omnivores and ball/cup nesting species were positively affected. Thus, while the single-tree selective harvesting method used by informal harvesters largely emulated natural canopy disturbances, the harvest-mediated increase in the frequency of canopy gaps may reduce the abundance of certain bird species sensitive to canopy gap conditions and reduce forest-scale beta-diversity.

AB Anthropogenically influenced habitats are becoming increasingly impacted by multiple invasive species that can regionally control main ecological processes and functions. Management requires predictions of invasive species' effects, but multiple invasions may cause unpredictable outcomes, for example, synergistic impacts or interactions among trophic levels causing trophic cascades. The Baltic Sea is prone to species invasions that increasingly occur at multiple trophic levels. We used a laboratory experiment to test whether multiple invasive predators may cause interactive effects in the Baltic Sea. In aquaria, we simulated a coastal community that has developed dominated by invasive species-the decapod predators Palaemon elegans and Rhithropanopeus harrisii, the amphipod grazer Gammarus tigrinus, and the filter-feeder Dreissena polymorpha. The orthogonal experiment determined separate and interactive effects from predators on the lower trophic level invasive species and native algae including the foundation species Fucus radicans. The main result was that while both predators significantly impacted the community, in no cases were their effects interactive. Another important result was that P. elegans appeared to cause a trophic cascade, as in its presence F. radicans and its epiphytes had the greatest biomass while G. tigrinus grazers were heavily reduced. G. tigrinus were negatively correlated with F. radicans biomass, so variable amphipod grazing may be the link allowing an indirect effect of P. elegans on F. radicans. R. harrisii also reduced G. tigrinus abundance but did not affect F. radicans biomass. Both predators significantly affected the lengths of F. radicans plant stems that were comprised of new vegetative growth-P. elegans reduced the lengths of new vegetative tissue while R. harrisii increased it. Thus, the presence of P. elegans induced shorter and denser F. radicans bushes compared to taller and thinner bushes observed in other treatments. Lastly, R. harrisii caused significant declines in D. polymorpha numbers. Overall, ecological management needs to consider positive effects from predator invasion which may reduce grazing pressure on low trophic level foundation species. A trophic cascade involving two invasive species highlights the importance of multi-species approaches to management of Baltic Sea invasive species and in other regions prone to biological invasions.

AB As a result of anthropogenic pressure, three drives are expected to affect Brazilian savannas: an increase in the dry season, more frequent fire events, and defaunation. These drivers are a trigger for biodiversity loss and undermine the ecosystems services like carbon storage. Here our goal was to analyze how these drivers can affect the structure and dynamics of the savanna's tree species and how they impact the savanna's total estimating aboveground biomass (AGB). We analysed eight sites that comprise a physiognomic gradient from open savanna to savanna woodland. The species were classified by three traits: phenological strategies (deciduous or evergreen), fire resistance (resprouting or non-resprouting), and dispersal syndrome (animal or non-animal). Then, we modelled AGB loss in a dry season in the austral winter, a 2 degrees C increase in daily temperature, five fire events by decadal-series, and a defaunation scenario. Although climate change, change in fire frequency, and defaunation effects impact AGB separately, they also have a synergistic effect. This effect was observed in functional strategies and also in the total AGB of the community. In some cases, the total AGB loss exceeded 70%. The negative effects on performance were highest in species which were decidual, non-resprouting, and which employed animal dispersal for their seed. If different types of disturbances are not controlled in the near future, savanna communities will be dominated by evergreen, resprouters, and non-animal dispersed species, representing a steeply decline in the diversity of species and ecosystem functions.

AB We evaluated the ecological significance of the boundary form between two patches with contrasting vegetation (mine grassland and adjacent forest) on woody colonization and forest expansion in open-cast coal mines in Northern Spain. Woody colonization and browsing traces were measured on three mine sites, along 24 transects that were laid out perpendicular to the forest-mine boundary and classified according to their shape (concave, convex, straight). Mine sites were colonized from the close forest by woody species, whose colonization intensity depends on the boundary form. The overall colonization intensity decreased with increasing distance to the forest and differed depending on the boundary form. The more intense colonization was found in concave boundaries and the strongest decrease in convex boundaries close to the forest, whereas straight boundaries showed an intermediate colonization pattern. Concave boundaries reached higher woody cover in the basal strata of the mines than convex (up to 2 m) or straight boundaries (up to 1 m) from 11 m to the forest edge, mainly by the presence of dense patches of Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link, with a scattered overstory of Genista florida L. These shrubs might reduce the browsing intensity and act as nurse plants facilitating the establishment of Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. in mine areas at greater distances from the forest edge. The forest-mine boundary form does not affect the forest vertical structure that is homogenous and does not help explain the woody colonization pattern in the mines. We conclude that edge characteristics have a strong potential to be used in the restoration of native forests based on natural processes. The implications of our results for sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) forest expansion along edges in fragmented Mediterranean forest landscapes were discussed.

AB Habitat islands can be defined as distinct patches of habitat surrounded by less contrasting matrix types. In contrast to true island biogeography (traditionally the study of islands surrounded by water), there have been less efforts to synthesize the myriad habitat island biogeography studies that have been published, particularly syntheses that cover the full range of habitat island types. By building on previous work, I aim to provide a review of habitat island biogeography in order to provide a blueprint for future research on habitat islands, including both naturally and anthropogenically fragmented systems. The review is organized into three main parts. First, the differences between habitat and true islands are summarized. Second, the main theoretical frameworks currently used to analyze habitat island systems are reviewed. Third, the findings of habitat island studies focused on various biological patterns are synthesized. Drawing on this synthesis, I put forward two main points regarding improving our understanding of habitat island biogeography: first, increasing the integration of matrix properties (including matrix variation across space and time) into habitat island biogeographic models and, second, testing for, and understanding the implications of, the potential prevalence of mass effects and source-sink dynamics in habitat island systems.

AB Studies on insular organisms provide an important framework for investigating patterns of genetic differentiation and reproductive isolation. By focusing on populations of the same species, we have the opportunity to study the mechanisms operating during the earliest stages of speciation, as reproductive barriers can be examined among divergent lineages in a geographic context. We investigated the genetic differentiation and the evolution of early stages of intrinsic postmating reproductive isolation between continental and insular populations of Epidendrum fulgens, a neotropical orchid distributed in southeastern Brazil. Genetic diversity and structure were estimated for both nuclear and plastid markers by using genetic differentiation measures and model-based assignment test. Furthermore, two components of reproductive isolation were examined by analyzing fruit set and seed viability in interpopulation crosses. Strong plastid genetic structure (F-ST = 0.679) was found between insular and remaining populations, indicating that E. fulgens reduced gene flow via seed dispersal, although significant nuclear genetic structure was lower (D-ST = 0.179), likely due to the smaller effective population size of the plastid genome. Significant differences in seed viability between self- and cross-pollinated plants were found, indicating the occurrence of inbreeding depression in all populations. Seed viability was significantly lower in crosses between insular and remaining populations, suggesting a late postzygotic reproductive barrier due to low migration associated with genetic drift (i.e., bottleneck) and its consequences. Our results confirm the importance of islands as drivers for populational differentiation and suggest a central role for outbreeding depression during the early stages of lineage diversification.

AB Pyrus calleryana Decne. (Callery pear) includes cultivars that in the United States are popular ornamentals in commercial and residential landscapes. Last few decades, this species has increasingly naturalized across portions of the eastern and southern US. However, the mechanisms behind this plant's spread are not well understood. The genetic relationship of present-day P. calleryana trees with their Asian P. calleryana forebears (native trees from China, Japan, and Korea) and the original specimens of US cultivars are unknown. We developed and used 18 microsatellite markers to analyze 147 Pyrus source samples and to articulate the status of genetic diversity within Asian P. calleryana and US cultivars. We hypothesized that Asian P. calleryana specimens and US cultivars would be genetically diverse and would show genetic relatedness. Our data revealed high genetic diversity, high gene flow, and presence of population structure in P. calleryana, potentially relating to the highly invasive capability of this species. Strong evidence for genetic relatedness between Asian P. calleryana specimens and US cultivars was also demonstrated. Our data suggest the source for P. calleryana that have become naturalized in US was China. These results will help understand the genetic complexity of invasive P. calleryana when developing management for escaped populations: In follow-up studies, we use the gSSRs developed here to analyze P. calleryana escape populations from across US.

AB 1. The size arid frequency of resource pulses can affect plant interactions and increase the abundance of invasive species relative to native species. We examined resource pulses generated during the desiccation and rehydration of communities of native biological soil crust (biocrust)-forming mosses, in the context of positive associations between biocrusts and the invasive forb, Centaurea stoebe.
   2. We surveyed Centaurea and biocrust cover and evaluated how interactions among Centaurea, biocrusts and water pulses influenced plant biomass and soil nitrogen in a field experiment. Centaurea seedling and biocrust interactions were also compared in a greenhouse experiment to evaluate differences related to life stage.
   3. In field surveys, Centaurea and biocrusts were positively associated. Across water pulse treatments, biocrust biomass decreased when Centaurea was removed, indicating that Centaurea facilitated biocrusts. Biocrusts did not affect adult Centaurea in the field, but Centaurea seedling biomass was greater when grown with biocrusts in the greenhouse. Water pulses did not affect plant biomass, but interactions between Centaurea and biocrusts corresponded with variation in the effect of water pulses on soil nitrogen which were not evident when Centaurea or biocrusts were grown alone. Twenty-four hours after large water pulses were added, soil NO3- was nine times higher in plots where biocrusts and Centaurea co-occurred compared with small water pulse plots. In these same plots, soil NH4+ tended to be lower at the end of the experiment.
   4. These results highlight positive interactions between an invasive exotic forb and native moss biocrust. Water pulses influenced soil nitrogen availability when both plants co-occurred, but did not affect plant biomass, suggesting that resource pulses and species interactions can interact to affect ecosystem processes.

AB Terrestrial species from the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) are under high threat due to deforestation and overhunting. Previous studies have even defined these forests as subjected to an "empty forest syndrome", a condition in which forests that are apparently well preserved are instead almost deprived of vertebrate faunas due to extreme exploitation by local communities. Forest specialists, including several primates, are among the most threatened species in the country. The Laotian langur (Trachypithecus laotum) is endemic to Lao PDR, is listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List, and it is one of the least studied species in the region. A survey on the local distribution, life history and conservation status of the Laotian langur was carried out in Phou Hin Poun National Protected Area, Khammouane Province of Lao PDR. The survey consisted of an initial phase with interviews to select key informants on the Laotian langur and the other primate species of the area. Then, a phase of field surveys along forest transects, totaling 64.1 km of 21 transects, yielded a record of 35 individuals in 9 groups. The highest encounter/detection rate of the Laotian langur was 1 group per km at one sector of the park. In contrast, it was much lower (0.18-0.34 groups/km) in the rest of the protected area. The group sizes were much lower than those observed in the same area between 1994 and 2010, thus suggesting a decline in the population size of langurs. This decline may be linked to habitat loss (timber extraction and mining). Still, also overhunting, as signs of poaching were observed during our field surveys. This was also supported by the reports of our interviewees. Laotian langurs were observed to be sympatric and interact while foraging with the Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis). In the cases of sympatric occurrence between the two species, we observed that subtle mechanisms of niche partitioning may occur to reduce interspecific competition for food. Further research on the population and ecology of this endangered langur should be conducted to understand the species and aid its conservation.

AB Biodiversity is being lost at an alarming rate, but the rate of this loss is likely to be underestimated as a result of a deficit in taxonomic knowledge (i.e. the Linnean shortfall). This knowledge gap is more extensive for morphologically indistinct taxa. The advancement of molecular techniques and delimitation methods has facilitated the identification of such cryptic species, but a majority of these taxa remain undescribed. To investigate the effects of taxonomic uncertainty on understanding of biodiversity, we applied the general lineage concept of species to an amphipod species complex, the Gammaruslacustris lineage that occupies springs of the northern Chihuahuan Desert, which is emerging in contemporary times. We investigated species boundaries using a validation-based approach and examined genetic structure of the lineage using a suite of microsatellite markers to identify independently evolving metapopulations. Our results show that each spring contains a genetically distinct population that is geographically isolated from other springs, suggesting evolutionary independence and status as separate species. Additionally, we observed subtle interspecific morphological variation among the putative species. We used multiple lines of evidence to formally describe four new species (Gammarus langi sp. nov., G. percalacustris sp. nov., G. colei sp. nov. and G. malpaisensis sp. nov.) endemic to the northern Chihuahuan Desert. Cryptic speciation is likely to be high in other aquatic taxa within these ecosystems, and across arid landscapes throughout North America and elsewhere, suggesting that the magnitude of the Linnean shortfall is currently underestimated in desert springs worldwide.

AB Plants growing in similar climates with extensively overlapping distributions may exhibit similar phylogeographic patterns, due to similarities in range shifts during past climatic oscillations. We tested and exploited this expectation in a comparison of the evolutionary and demographic histories of two related and co-distributed species endemic to Japan-Rhododendron pentaphyllum and R. quinquefolium. Genetic variation in sequences of noncoding chloroplast DNA regions and hundreds of nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to investigate 191 individuals from 13 populations of R. pentaphyllum and 142 individuals from 10 populations of R. quinquefolium. We found that the two species were not each other's closest relative, and we found different times to the most recent common ancestor of extant populations based on both chloroplast DNA and nuclear SNPs. Rhododendron pentaphyllum exhibited higher genetic variation between populations than R. quinquefolium, while the two species had similar patterns of genetic divergence between regions with slightly different divergence times. These lines of evidence suggest that the similar ranges of the two species are the result of repeated range shifts since speciation during climatic oscillations.

AB As vital components of freshwater ecosystems, river systems directly boost the dispersal and gene flow of aquatic species. However, various river systems might also increase the potential for isolation of these species and their genetic differentiation. In Africa, the roles of river systems in shaping the genetic diversity and structures of aquatic species are still poorly studied. In order to assess the influence of river systems in freshwater ecoregions on the genetic variation of Ottelia ulvifolia, we genotyped 307 individuals of 18 populations from Bangweulu-Mweru, Middle Zambezi-Luangwa, and Upper Zambezi Floodplain ecoregions in Zambia using ten microsatellite markers. Our results revealed an overall high genetic diversity (H-E = 0.475) and high gene flow (Nm > 1) among the three ecoregions. Notably, a relatively higher diversity (H-E = 0.485; I = 0.836) was detected in Bangweulu-Mweru compared to those other ecoregions, which could be contributed by frequent river capture events in the area. STRUCTURE, TESS, PCoA, and NJ analyses identified two distinct clusters that were further divided into five sub-clusters, three in bisexual populations and two in the unisexual populations, respectively. The lower genetic differentiation among 18 populations (Fst = 0.258) in the present study could be attributed to the frequent hybridization among populations via insect pollination and water-mediated seed dispersal. A significant positive correlation between Jost's D/(1-Jost's D) and geographic distance among populations (r = 0.142, P = 0.050) indicated deviation for mutation-drift equilibrium. The current findings, however, do not support the hypothesis that variations within ecoregions drive the genetic variation and population structure of O. ulvifolia in Zambia. Lastly, habitat specialization and floral characteristics are examples of behavioral factors that may promote a genetic difference in O. ulvifolia. Our study provides general knowledge of the genetic variation of O. ulvifolia in tropical Africa and indicates a possible regional alteration of various macrophyte dispersal mechanisms at a vast geographic scale, therefore encouraging the need for further research on the genus.

AB Nestling growth parameters are integral components of avian life-history strategies as they are crucial determinants of individual survival. Although many factors impact on nestling growth, the relative contribution of each one is still debated in the literature. Most studies rely on the assumption that each factor directly affects nestling growth, but indirect effects mediated by other factors are usually the rule in nature. In this study, we present a comprehensive view of both direct and indirect factors affecting nestling growth using the Red-crested Cardinal (Paroaria coronata) as model system. We evaluated the relative importance of different habitat (forest structure), biotic interactions (botfly larvae ectoparasitism, number of siblings, hatching order), and temporal factors (time of breeding) on nestling growth parameters in 278 nestlings of 128 nests by using piecewise structural equation models. We found that botfly ectoparasitism had the strongest direct effect on nestling growth and, in turn, forest structure increased the probability of botfly occurrence. Besides, the interaction between the number of siblings and hatching order influenced nestling growth, indicating that the first and second nestlings had disproportionately higher growth rates in large than in small clutches. Time of breeding also showed a strong positive indirect effect on botfly occurrence, as well as a weak direct positive effect on nestling growth. Our results demonstrate that, under natural conditions, nestling growth is driven by different factors acting not only directly, but also indirectly on this essential life history trait, and that these factors weave a complex web of interrelated variables.

AB Synopsis One of the reasons why flowering plants became the most diverse group of land plants is their association with animals to reproduce. The earliest examples of this mutualism involved insects foraging for food from plants and, in the process, pollinating them. Vertebrates are latecomers to these mutualisms, but birds, in particular, present a wide variety of nectar-feeding clades that have adapted to solve similar challenges. Such challenges include surviving on small caloric rewards widely scattered across the landscape, matching their foraging strategy to nectar replenishment rate, and efficiently collecting this liquid food from well-protected chambers deep inside flowers. One particular set of convergent traits among plants and their bird pollinators has been especially well studied: the match between the shape and size of bird bills and ornithophilous flowers. Focusing on a highly specialized group, hummingbirds, we examine the expected benefits from bill-flower matching, with a strong focus on the benefits to the hummingbird and how to quantify them. Explanations for the coevolution of bill-flower matching include (1) that the evolution of traits by bird-pollinated plants, such as long and thin corollas, prevents less efficient pollinators (e.g., insects) from accessing the nectar and (2) that increased matching, as a result of reciprocal adaptation, benefits both the bird (nectar extraction efficiency) and the plant (pollen transfer). In addition to nectar-feeding, we discuss how interference and exploitative competition also play a significant role in the evolution and maintenance of trait matching. We present hummingbird-plant interactions as a model system to understand how trait matching evolves and how pollinator behavior can modify expectations based solely on morphological matching, and discuss the implications of this behavioral modulation for the maintenance of specialization. While this perspective piece directly concerns hummingbird-plant interactions, the implications are much broader. Functional trait matching is likely common in coevolutionary interactions (e.g., in predator-prey interactions), yet the physical mechanisms underlying trait matching are understudied and rarely quantified. We summarize existing methods and present novel approaches that can be used to quantify key benefits to interacting partners in a variety of ecological systems.

AB Although many studies have focused on the effects of the environment and area on local patterns of species richness, few studies have demonstrated how to reconcile the availability of more niches with smaller habitat areas in heterogeneous localities. Here, the environmental range that a species prefers was defined as a niche; a space was defined as an available space if the environmental range of the space matches a niche; and the metric 'environmental range per unit space (ERUS)' was presented to describe the heterogeneity of localities. Because the spaces with stressful environmental ranges, outside the niche, increased with increasing heterogeneity, available spaces did not continue to indefinitely increase, but the proportion of available spaces in spaces was low at high heterogeneous localities. Consequently, the probability of species occurring in their respective available spaces was unimodal. Due to the presence of large spaces in homogenous localities and more spaces in heterogeneous localities, the interval distances between nonadjacent spaces were large in these localities. Together, the changes in the number and proportion of available spaces and distance between spaces determined the unimodal probability of species dispersing into their respective available spaces. Thus, the probability of species coexisting was unimodal because it is important for coexisting species to grow in their respective available spaces. The probability of population extinction increased with increasing heterogeneity because the available spaces became narrower. In this way, the ERUS strongly influence species richness: a unimodal richness along the heterogeneity gradient occurred in suitable, suboptimal and stressful environments and a unimodal algae richness occurred in a lake and river. These results challenge the viewpoint that richness increases with heterogeneity, providing information about the conservation of richness in very homogeneous and heterogeneous regions, and highlighting the importance of balancing the roles of environment and space in understanding and predicting richness.

AB In a scenario where escalating human activities lead to several environmental changes and, consequently, affect mammal abundance and distribution, beta-diversity may increase due to differences among sites. Using the ecological uniqueness approach, we analyzed beta-diversity patterns of ground-dwelling mammal communities recorded through comprehensive camera trap monitoring within eight tropical forests protected areas in Mesoamerica and South America under variable landscape contexts. We aimed to investigate whether the contribution of single sites (LCBD) and single species (SCBD) to overall beta-diversity could be explained by community metrics and environmental variables, and by species metrics and biological traits, respectively. Total beta-diversity was also partitioned into species replacement and richness difference. We related LCBD to species richness, total relative abundance, functional indices, and environmental variables (tree basal area, protected area size, NDVI, and precipitation seasonality), and SCBD to species naive occupancy, relative abundance, and morphoecological traits via beta regression. Our findings showed that LCBD was primarily explained by variation in species richness, rather than relative abundance and functional metrics. Protected area size and tree basal area were also important in explaining variation in LCBD. SCBD was strongly related to naive occupancy and relative abundance, but not to biological traits, such as body mass, trophic energy level, activity cycle, and taxonomic category. Local II diversity was a result of species replacements and to a lesser extent differences in species richness. Our approach was useful in examining and comparing the ecological uniqueness among different sites, revealing the regional scale current status of mammal diversity. High LCBD values comprised sites embedded within smaller habitat extents, hosting lower tree basal areas, and harboring low species richness. SCBD showed that relatively ubiquitous species that occur at variable abundances across sites contributed most to II-diversity. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background The formation of the Isthmus of Panama and final closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS) provides an independent calibration point for examining the rate of DNA substitutions. This vicariant event has been widely used to estimate the substitution rate across mitochondrial genomes and to date evolutionary events in other taxonomic groups. Nuclear sequence data is increasingly being used to complement mitochondrial datasets for phylogenetic and evolutionary investigations; these studies would benefit from information regarding the rate and pattern of DNA substitutions derived from the nuclear genome. Results To estimate the genome-wide neutral mutation rate (mu), genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) datasets were generated for three transisthmian species pairs in Alpheus snapping shrimp. A range of bioinformatic filtering parameters were evaluated in order to minimize potential bias in mutation rate estimates that may result from SNP filtering. Using a Bayesian coalescent approach (G-PhoCS) applied to 44,960 GBS loci, we estimated mu to be 2.64E-9 substitutions/site/year, when calibrated with the closure of the CAS at 3 Ma. Post-divergence gene flow was detected in one species pair. Failure to account for this post-split migration inflates our substitution rate estimates, emphasizing the importance of demographic methods that can accommodate gene flow. Conclusions Results from our study, both parameter estimates and bioinformatic explorations, have broad-ranging implications for phylogeographic studies in other non-model taxa using reduced representation datasets. Our best estimate of mu that accounts for coalescent and demographic processes is remarkably similar to experimentally derived mutation rates in model arthropod systems. These results contradicted recent suggestions that the closure of the Isthmus was completed much earlier (around 10 Ma), as mutation rates based on an early calibration resulted in uncharacteristically low genomic mutation rates. Also, stricter filtering parameters resulted in biased datasets that generated lower mutation rate estimates and influenced demographic parameters, serving as a cautionary tale for the adherence to conservative bioinformatic strategies when generating reduced-representation datasets at the species level. To our knowledge this is the first use of transisthmian species pairs to calibrate the rate of molecular evolution from GBS data.

AB Tropical forests are notable for their high species diversity, even on small spatial scales, and right-skewed species and size abundance distributions. The role of individual species as drivers of the spatial organization of diversity in these forests has been explained by several hypotheses and processes, for example, stochastic dilution, negative density dependence, or gap dynamics. These processes leave a signature in spatial distribution of small trees, particularly in the vicinity of large trees, likely having stronger effects on their neighbors. We are exploring species diversity patterns within the framework of various diversity-generating hypotheses using individual species-area relationships. We used the data from three tropical forest plots (Wanang-Papua New Guinea, Barro Colorado Island-Panama, and Sinharaja-Sri Lanka) and included also the saplings (DBH >= 1 cm). Resulting cross-size patterns of species richness and evenness reflect the dynamics of saplings affected by the distribution of large trees. When all individuals with DBH >= 1 cm are included, similar to 50% of all tree species from the 25- or 50-ha plot can be found within 35 m radius of an individual tree. For all trees, 72%-78% of species were identified as species richness accumulators, having more species present in their surroundings than expected by null models. This pattern was driven by small trees as the analysis of DBH >10 cm trees showed much lower proportion of accumulators, 14%-65% of species identified as richness repellers and had low richness of surrounding small trees. Only 11%-26% of species had lower species evenness than was expected by null models. High proportions of species richness accumulators were probably due to gap dynamics and support Janzen-Connell hypothesis driven by competition or top-down control by pathogens and herbivores. Observed species diversity patterns show the importance of including small tree size classes in analyses of the spatial organization of diversity.

AB Light is a key resource for tree performance and hence, tree species partition spatial and temporal gradients in light availability. Although light distribution drives tree performance and species replacement during secondary forest succession, we yet lack understanding how light distribution changes with tropical forest development.
   This study aims to evaluate how changes in forest structure lead to changes in vertical and horizontal light heterogeneity during tropical forest succession.
   We described successional patterns in light using a chronosequence approach in which we compared 14 Mexican secondary forest stands that differ in age (8-32 years) since agricultural abandonment. For each stand, we measured vertical light profiles in 16 grid cells, and structural parameters (diameter at breast height, height and crown dimensions) for each tree.
   During succession, we found a rapid increase in stand size (basal area, crown area and length) and stand differentiation (i.e. a gradual leaf distribution along the forest profile), which leads to fast changes in light conditions and more light heterogeneity. The inflection points of the vertical light gradient (i.e. the absolute height at which 50% relative light intensity is attained) rapidly moved towards higher heights in the first 20 years, indicating that larger amounts of light are intercepted by canopy trees. Light attenuation rate (i.e. the rate of light extinction) decreased during succession due to slower accumulation of the crown area with height. Understorey light intensity and heterogeneity slightly decreased during succession because of an increase in crown size and a decrease in lateral gap frequency. Understorey relative light intensity was 1.56% at 32 years after abandonment.
   Synthesis. During succession, light conditions changed linearly, which should lead to a continuous and constant replacement of species. Especially in later successional stages, stronger vertical light gradients can limit the regeneration of light-demanding pioneer species and increase the proportion of shade-tolerant late-successional species under the canopy. These changes in light conditions were largely driven by the successional changes in forest structure, as basal area strongly determined the height where most light is absorbed, whereas crown area, and to a lesser extent crown length, determined light distribution.

AB In the Neotropics, freshwater streams harbour high fish diversity and are constantly threatened by anthropogenic disturbance. However, there are few studies on the genetic diversity of fish populations inhabiting these streams. We aimed to assess, based on microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers, the population structure and genetic diversity of the suckermouth catfish, Hypostomus ancistroides, a Neotropical species widely distributed across the Upper Parana River Basin in South America. Twenty-five locations were sampled, distributed across 18 sites in six tributary streams and another seven sites in the main river channel. Our analyses revealed a spatial heterogeneity in genetic diversity within the basin, indicating fine-scale genetic structuring. Samples from all streams showed exclusive haplotypes and private alleles, reinforcing the importance of preserving the tributaries for the conservation of the genetic diversity of the studied populations. The fine-scale genetic structuring of H. ancistroides is probably related to the limited displacement capacity of this species.

AB Finding a partner to mate with may be only part of ensuring successful siring of offspring. Females often exhibit cryptic female choice (CFC) during or after copulation, which can influence whose sperm from her multiple partners is chosen for egg fertilization. Known behavioral mechanisms for CFC include assessment of males by their nuptial gifts, duration of copulation, and seminal fluid contents. In this study, the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), behaviors during the course of copulation were investigated. Glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) use vibrational communication before copulation occurs. However, little is known about behaviors that occur during and after copulation. Results from this study determined that vibrational signaling also occurs during copulation. Vibrational signals similar to those emitted during precopulatory communication were identified during copulation alongside a new, 'hum-like' signal that typically occurred within 10 s after the pair joined in copulation. In addition, results determined the duration of copulation was on average of 15 h, though with a 10-h range (8.5-18.5 h) among observed male-female pairs. Finally, both males and females mated more than once. Collectively, results identified key reproductive parameters required for CFC to occur in GWSS. The study expands on the known animals that use CFC and emphasizes the role that copulatory vibrational communication may play setting the foundations for future more in-depth studies. Understanding of insect behaviors necessary for successful production of offspring is important from an ecological perspective and for development of pest control methods.

AB In high-transmission endemic regions, local populations of Plasmodium falciparum exhibit vast diversity of the var genes encoding its major surface antigen, with each parasite comprising multiple copies from this diverse gene pool. This strategy to evade the immune system through large combinatorial antigenic diversity is common to other hyperdiverse pathogens. It underlies a series of fundamental epidemiological characteristics, including large reservoirs of transmission from high prevalence of asymptomatics and long-lasting infections. Previous theory has shown that negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) mediated by the acquisition of specific immunity by hosts structures the diversity of var gene repertoires, or strains, in a pattern of limiting similarity that is both non-random and non-neutral. A combination of stochastic agent-based models and network analyses has enabled the development and testing of theory in these complex adaptive systems, where assembly of local parasite diversity occurs under frequency-dependent selection and large pools of variation. We show here the application of these approaches to theory comparing the response of the malaria transmission system to intervention when strain diversity is assembled under (competition-based) selection vs. a form of neutrality, where immunity depends only on the number but not the genetic identity of previous infections. The transmission system is considerably more persistent under NFDS, exhibiting a lower extinction probability despite comparable prevalence during intervention. We explain this pattern on the basis of the structure of strain diversity, in particular the more pronounced fraction of highly dissimilar parasites. For simulations that survive intervention, prevalence under specific immunity is lower than under neutrality, because the recovery of diversity is considerably slower than that of prevalence and decreased var gene diversity reduces parasite transmission. A Principal Component Analysis of network features describing parasite similarity reveals that despite lower overall diversity, NFDS is quickly restored after intervention constraining strain structure and maintaining patterns of limiting similarity important to parasite persistence. Given the described enhanced persistence under perturbation, intervention efforts will likely require longer times than the usual practice to eliminate P. falciparum populations. We discuss implications of our findings and potential analogies for ecological communities with non-neutral assembly processes involving frequency-dependence.

AB Investigations of the response of wild populations to natural ecological disturbances can provide insights into the ability of animals to respond to ever-increasing and intensifying stressors. Seahorse Key is a continental island in the Gulf of Mexico that has been an important rookery site for several species of colonially nesting waterbirds. Resident cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, feed heavily on fish carrion provided by nesting waterbirds. Unexpectedly in 2015, the entire waterbird colony abandoned Seahorse Key and has not returned since. We used stable isotopes and radio-telemetry to test hypotheses related to the response of the trophic niche and size of home range of insular cottonmouths following the loss of bird-provided food resources. We found that stable isotope values of carbon (delta C-13) decreased while nitrogen (delta N-15) values increased between the pre- (n = 188) and post-abandonment (n = 48) periods. The observed changes in stable isotope values correspond to a reduction in feeding on marine fish to terrestrially derived food resources and were also affected by body size and age class. Home range calculated from snakes tracked using radio-telemetry showed no significant changes between pre- and post-abandonment periods. These data corroborate earlier studies to indicate that cottonmouths on Seahorse Key have not effectively compensated for sudden substantial loss of food resources. This insight has implications for the conservation and management of populations with episodic components of food webs, especially in relation to ecological disturbance.

AB Quantifying the abundance of species is essential to ecology, evolution, and conservation. The distribution of species abundances is fundamental to numerous longstanding questions in ecology, yet the empirical pattern at the global scale remains unresolved, with a few species' abundance well known but most poorly characterized. In large part because of heterogeneous data, few methods exist that can scale up to all species across the globe. Here, we integrate data from a suite of well-studied species with a global dataset of bird occurrences throughout the world-for 9,700 species (-92% of all extant species)-and use missing data theory to estimate speciesspecific abundances with associated uncertainty. We find strong evidence that the distribution of species abundances is log left skewed: there are many rare species and comparatively few common species. By aggregating the species-level estimates, we find that there are -50 billion individual birds in the world at present. The global-scale abundance estimates that we provide will allow for a line of inquiry into the structure of abundance across biogeographic realms and feeding guilds as well as the consequences of life history (e.g., body size, range size) on population dynamics. Importantly, our method is repeatable and scalable: as data quantity and quality increase, our accuracy in tracking temporal changes in global biodiversity will increase. Moreover, we provide the methodological blueprint for quantifying species-specific abundance, along with uncertainty, for any organism in the world.

AB Many sexual-asexual complexes show a distinct pattern where the asexuals have larger and more northerly ranges than closely related sexuals. A prime candidate to explain this so-called "geographical parthenogenesis" is ecological niche divergence between the sexuals and asexuals. Modern niche modelling techniques allow testing niche divergence by directly comparing the niches of sexuals and asexuals. In this study, I use such techniques to perform range-wide tests of whether nine bioclimatic variables, including annual mean temperature and annual precipitation, contribute to geographical parthenogenesis in two dandelion taxa: Taraxacum section Ruderalia and Taraxacum section Erythrosperma, which are both comprised of sexual diploids and asexual triploids. For both sections, I found evidence of niche divergence, though the exact nature of this divergence was different for the two sections. In section Ruderalia, the sexuals preferred warmer and wetter conditions, whereas in section Erythrosperma, the sexuals preferred dryer conditions. Using Species Distribution Modelling, consistent differences between the sexuals and asexuals were found when looking at the niche determinants: the variables that are most important for modelling the distribution. Furthermore, and in contrast with theoretical expectations that predict that the sexuals should have a wider niche, in section Erythrosperma the asexuals were found to have a wider niche than the sexuals. In conclusion, differences in niche optima, niche determinants, and niche width all contribute to the pattern of geographical parthenogenesis of these two dandelion taxa. However, the results also indicate that the exact causation of geographical parthenogenesis is not uniform across taxa.

AB Background Species interactions may affect spatial dynamics when the movement of one species is determined by the presence of another one. The most direct species-dependence of dispersal is vectored, usually cross-kingdom, movement of immobile parasites, diseases or seeds by mobile animals. Joint movements of species should, however, not be vectored by definition, as even mobile species are predicted to move together when they are tightly connected in symbiont communities. Methods We studied concerted movements in a diverse and heterogeneous community of arthropods (myrmecophiles) associated with red wood ants. We questioned whether joint-movement strategies eventually determine and speed-up community succession. Results We recorded an astonishingly high number of obligate myrmecophiles outside red wood ant nests. They preferentially co-moved with the host ants as the highest densities were found in locations with the highest density of foraging red wood ants, such as along the network of ant trails. These observations suggest that myrmecophiles resort to the host to move away from the nest, and this to a much higher extent than hitherto anticipated. Interestingly, functional groups of symbionts displayed different dispersal kernels, with predatory myrmecophiles moving more frequently and further from the nest than detritivorous myrmecophiles. We discovered that myrmecophile diversity was lower in newly founded nests than in mature red wood ant nests. Most myrmecophiles, however, were able to colonize new nests fast suggesting that the heterogeneity in mobility does not affect community assembly. Conclusions We show that co-movement is not restricted to tight parasitic, or cross-kingdom interactions. Movement in social insect symbiont communities may be heterogeneous and functional group-dependent, but clearly affected by host movement. Ultimately, this co-movement leads to directional movement and allows a fast colonisation of new patches, but not in a predictable way. This study highlights the importance of spatial dynamics of local and regional networks in symbiont metacommunities, of which those of symbionts of social insects are prime examples.

AB 1. Forest clearance is a pervasive disturbance worldwide, but many of its impacts are regarded as transient, diminishing in intensity as forest recovers. However, forests can take decades to centuries to recover after severe disturbances, and temporal lags in recovery of ecosystem properties for different forest habitats are mostly unknown. This includes forest streams, where most studies of the impacts of forest clearance are restricted to the first years of recovery, typically finding that temporary increases in light and nutrient run-off diminish as forest recovers. Implications of longer term changes remain little investigated.
   2. In a space-for-time substitution experiment, we assessed changes in organic matter processing and in the functional and taxonomic composition of litter-consuming detritivores along a riparian forest age gradient ranging from 1 to 120 years since last timber harvesting.
   3. Variation in organic matter processing and detritivore functional diversity along the forest succession gradient were both expressed as second-order polynomial relationships (peaking at similar to 50 years along the forest age gradient). Decomposition rates were lowest in both the more recently clear-cut and older riparian forest streams.
   4. Variation of litter decomposition rates among litter bags within streams, measured by the coefficient of variation, was lowest in recent clear-cuts and increased linearly along the succession gradient. This result indicates higher within-stream heterogeneity in decomposition rates in older forest streams.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We found that the decomposition of leaf litter, a component of carbon cycling in forests, was higher in streams flowing through intermediately aged forest, and that several key attributes of the organisms regulating litter decomposition also varied systematically with forest age. These findings highlight the longer term consequences of forest succession following forest clear-cutting for stream habitats. Our findings further illustrate complications arising from the use of forested sites as references for newly cleared sites without properly accounting for forest age, given conclusions regarding biotic responses will depend on the age of the reference forests. Finally, our results emphasise the potential of intensive forest management centred on vast, one-time clear-cutting events to drive long-term homogenisation not only in forest age structure but also in the functioning of associated forest stream habitats.

AB Understanding the geographic distributions of primates is necessary to ensure effective conservation strategies. Nonetheless, many gaps persist in information regarding the range limits of platyrrhines. Leontocebus lagonotus is no exception; it is one of the least studied primates in Ecuador and its geographic limits are poorly known. We obtained 296 records of its presence in Ecuador from field studies (between 1996 and 2020), museums, the literature, and databases. Of these, we validated 211 records and used 106 (excluding grouped points) to determine the potential distribution of this species using an ecological niche model (MaxEnt). The model suggested that the species' distribution in Ecuador covers 64,028 km(2). Based on confirmed data, the extent of occurrence was 38,226 km(2), but after updating it with layers of remaining vegetation (2018), we determined that the current distribution is 32,643 km(2) (a 15% reduction). Our findings reduce the range proposed for the species in Ecuador, suggesting that areas north of the Napo River, the north-central area of Yasuni National Park, and the far eastern part of Waorani Ethnic Reserve were never part of the species' range. We also identified the southern boundaries of its distribution, where the Paute-Upano and Cangaime-Morona rivers form a natural barrier. Its distribution in Peru possibly reaches the south of the Morona and Santiago rivers. We recommend a similar approach for other platyrrhines, particularly those under threat, for better implementation of conservation efforts.

AB Trophic interactions may strongly depend on body size and environmental variation, but this prediction has been seldom tested in nature. Many spiders are generalist predators that use webs to intercept flying prey. The size and mesh of orb webs increases with spider size, allowing a more efficient predation on larger prey. We studied to this extent the orb-weaving spider Araneus diadematus inhabiting forest fragments differing in edge distance, tree diversity, and tree species. These environmental variables are known to correlate with insect composition, richness, and abundance. We anticipated these forest characteristics to be a principle driver of prey consumption. We additionally hypothesized them to impact spider size at maturity and expect shifts toward larger prey size distributions in larger individuals independently from the environmental context. We quantified spider diet by means of metabarcoding of nearly 1,000 A. diadematus from a total of 53 forest plots. This approach allowed a massive screening of consumption dynamics in nature, though at the cost of identifying the exact prey identity, as well as their abundance and putative intraspecific variation. Our study confirmed A. diadematus as a generalist predator, with more than 300 prey ZOTUs detected in total. At the individual level, we found large spiders to consume fewer different species, but adding larger species to their diet. Tree species composition affected both prey species richness and size in the spider's diet, although tree diversity per se had no influence on the consumed prey. Edges had an indirect effect on the spider diet as spiders closer to the forest edge were larger and therefore consumed larger prey. We conclude that both intraspecific size variation and tree species composition shape the consumed prey of this generalist predator.

AB Experimental and observational studies on seedling dynamics posit mechanisms that can influence forest diversity, structure and function. However, high mortality and slow growth of seedlings make it difficult to evaluate the importance of this life-history filter to total tree life history. Quantifying the duration and transition of the seedling phase would help us understand this 'black box' in tree population biology.
   We used a 16-year dataset of comprehensive seedling-to-sapling demography from a subtropical rainforest to construct population models that capture temporal demographic fluctuations for eight major tree species. We used data-driven demographic models and simulations to estimate the transition ratios from newly recruited seedlings to saplings of 2-m height and the time taken to attain 2-m height for a newly recruited seedling conditional on its survival.
   Projections among species estimated that as few as 57 to more than 40,000 seedlings (with a median of 2,087) were required to make a single 2-m high sapling. Furthermore, it would take 22-200 years (with a median of 47) for a newly recruited seedling to become a 2-m high sapling. We found that temporal variation in demographic rates could greatly reduce the number of seedlings per established sapling, but not passage times (PTs). We also identified the importance of consistently fast growth rates for seedlings to escape the high mortality of early stages.
   Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that high mortality in the very early seedling stage severely limits the probability that a newly recruited seedling will transition to the sapling stage. Although the PTs vary, we found this to be true across species with a range of life-history strategies. Only seedlings with consistently fast growth rates are expected to pass through this life-history filter. Findings from seedling studies should consider how short-term studies of seedling demography might capture the rare exceptional individuals and exceptional conditions that might define the dynamics of this seedling bottleneck.

AB The Caatinga of northeastern Brazil is the largest nucleus of the seasonally dry tropical forest biome. Number of bird species in lists of the Caatinga often are quite different, mainly due to the existence of enclaves of other biomes embedded in this region, and whose species may or may not be included on those lists. While some consider such enclaves as disjunctions of other biomes, and therefore do not consider their species to be Caatinga-inhabitants, others consider the enclaves as part of the Caatinga and then include their species. In addition, the Caatinga has been widely used as a unit of analysis in biogeographical and macroecological studies, sometimes without a biologically meaningful delimitation. The need for a comprehensive review of these issues motivated me to propose a biologically meaningful checklist of the birds of the Caatinga and to explain why the enclaves of other biomes embedded within this region should not be considered part of the Caatinga. I argue that the previous checklists of birds, among other animals, of the Caatinga have been assembled in a biologically meaningless way, for which I provide a biologically meaningful alternative. This checklist comprises as many as 442 bird species for the Caatinga and is the first to comply with strict criteria as to its accessible, verifiable documentation.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic forest is largely covered by secondary forests, mostly regenerated after the abandonment of patches previously used for shifting cultivation. A characteristic of these secondary forests is the significant timber volume from fast-growing species at ages as young as 30-40 years. In this study, we investigated changes that occur in timber production of secondary forest during the first 50 years of succession. We inventoried 82 plots (10 x 20 m) in a chronosequence ranging from 2 to 50 years since agricultural abandonment in four municipalities located in Santa Catarina State, Southern Brazil. Our results showed that commercial tree species have rapid recovery of richness, basal area and stem volume in naturally regenerating forests. Commercial species represent about 51 percent of tree diversity, with 9 out of 12 dominant species being commercial timber species, with a stem volume up to 155 m(3) ha(-1). Trees of commercial species with >= 15 cm in diameter are first observed after 20 years of succession, while trees >= 30 cm are found at 30 years of succession, and produce 126 m(3) ha(-1) of stem volume. We highlight Hyeronima alchorneoides, Miconia cabucu and Miconia cinnamomifolia, as fast-growing dominant species that produce timber quality >20 cm in diameter after 20 years of succession, with volume reaching 200 m(3) ha(-1) before 40 years of succession. We found that secondary forests are dominated by fast-growing and wood-producing species, with a rapid increase in timber stocks in the early stages of succession. These secondary forests are important biodiversity reservoirs in human-pressured landscapes, in addition to providing forest products and other ecosystem services. The management of secondary forests may be an alternative restoration approach that can accelerate the recovery of timber stocks, provide landscape diversity, and add more value to private forests.

AB Population Biology of Palm Heart (Euterpe edulisMartius-Arecaceae) in Managed Landscape Units in Southern Brazil. The use of natural areas throughout history has created landscape mosaics. The landscape units assessed in this study on Euterpe edulis populations in southern Brazil consisted of secondary forests, rural homegardens, and sites inside a protected area (PA). Our goal was to compare the level of conservation of E. edulis populations in three landscape units in order to verify the influence of management practices. Twelve homegardens, four areas in secondary forests in rural properties, and several areas in a sustainable use PA were assessed. Population structure differed among the three groups of landscape units. The population density of E. edulis was higher in smaller size classes (seedling, young I) in the PA and in larger size classes (reproductive) in homegardens, whereas both situations occurred in secondary forests. Genetic divergence varied 0.001 and 0.0023 between landscape groups. The highest variation in genetic diversity indexes was recorded in homegardens, with the presence of alleles that were not found in the protected area. Genetic diversity indexes varied less in the protected area, while the average values were higher in secondary forests. We therefore concluded that the sites assessed outside protected areas also contribute to the conservation of this palm species.

AB Forest conservation on privately owned lands is a cornerstone of the Brazilian environmental policy framework. Brazilian legislation requires that all farms in the country maintain and protect forest areas known as Legal Reserves. Since Legal Reserves have major implications for forest conservation and agricultural production, it is key that we understand landholders' perceptions towards Legal Reserves. We applied Q methodology to identify different perspectives of medium and large landholders on Legal Reserves and their relation to agricultural intensification in the municipality of Paragominas, eastern Amazon. We conducted 31 interviews in which landholders sorted 36 statements in a quasi-normal distribution array. Three groups of landholders were identified: 1) Land use planning enthusiasts (n = 16) were interested in zoning initiatives to explore alternative landscape designs and legislation that may deliver better conservation and production outcomes; 2) Agrochemical-based agriculture supporters (n = 7) held the most critical views against Legal Reserves and perceived their costs as higher than the potential environmental and life quality benefits; 3) Policy complacentmarket responders (n = 4) showed no interest in Legal Reserves reforms and were the most market driven group.. While Paragominas has achieved notable successes in halting large-scale deforestation through a social "Green Municipality" pact, addressing persisting forest degradation and fragmentation in the region remains a key priority. Local governance initiatives that account for multi-stakeholder perceptions on forest conservation can foster dialogue and mutual understanding to effectively conserve and restore Legal Reserves. Insights on large landholders' perceptions on Legal Reserves can inform such governance processes to reconcile forest conservation and sustainable agricultural intensification in Paragominas.

AB Tropical forest regeneration after abandonment of former agricultural land depends critically on the input of tree seeds, yet seed dispersal is increasingly disrupted in contemporary human-modified landscapes. Here, we introduce the concept of seed-rain-successional feedbacks as a deterministic process in which seed rain is shaped by successional dynamics internal to a forest site and that acts to reinforce priority effects. We used a combination of time series and chronosequence approaches to investigate how the quantity and taxonomic and functional composition of seed rain change during succession and to evaluate the strength of seed-rain-successional feedbacks, relative to other deterministic and stochastic mechanisms, in secondary wet forests of Costa Rica. We found that both successional niches and seed-rain-successional feedbacks shaped successional trajectories in the seed rain. Determinism due to successional niche assembly was supported by the increasing convergence of community structure to that of a mature forest, in terms of both functional and taxonomic composition. With successional age, the proportions of large-seeded, shade-tolerant species in the seed rain increased, whereas the proportion of animal-dispersed species did not change significantly. Seed-rain-successional feedbacks increased in strength with successional age, as the proportion of immigrant seeds (species not locally represented in the site) decreased with successional age, and the composition of the seed rain became more similar to that of the adult trees at the forest site. The deterministic assembly generated by seed-rain-successional feedback likely contributed to the increasing divergence of secondary forest sites from each other during succession. To the extent that human modification of tropical forest landscapes reduces connectivity via factors such as forest cover loss, our results suggest that seed-rain-successional feedbacks are likely to increasingly shape regeneration trajectories in and amplify floristic heterogeneity among tropical secondary forests.

AB Poaching is a widespread activity that affects wildlife management goals and undermines conservation efforts worldwide. Despite its complexity, poaching is still commonly addressed by researchers as a one-dimensional phenomenon. To deepen the scientific understanding of poaching, we conducted a systematic literature review in the Web of Science and Scopus databases for the last 10 years, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. We found that most studies were carried out in Africa, although 43% of all articles on poaching were published by researchers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The most studied species are elephants (22%), rhinos (19%), wolves (9%), and bears (6%). Although this study identified a wide range of motives and drivers behind poaching activities, more than half of the analyzed articles do not attempt to provide a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. Its understanding of poaching usually does not go beyond the environmental impact of illegal hunting. Our study's potential limitations may relate to the focus on exclusively English-language articles and, among them, only those discussing mammal, bird, and reptile species. Our findings indicate that global scientific knowledge on poaching in the last 10 years is biased. There is an imbalance between the developed countries that mostly produce knowledge on poaching (usually from Northern America and Europe) and the developing countries commonly an object of interest. This bias is potentially challenging, as the global scientific knowledge on poaching comes from limited experience based on charismatic species and selective case studies. To overcome this gap and develop a deeper understanding of poaching, the scientific community needs to overcome this bias and address illegal hunting wherever it affects the environment and undermines conservation efforts.

AB Knowledge of the reproductive ecology of insect pests is important for the development of sustainable pest control strategies. Mating behavior studies can provide insights about relevant aspects of intra- or intersexual communication processes, which may lead to sustainable control strategies based on behavioral disruption. The bronze bug, Thaumastocoris peregrinus (Hemiptera: Thaumastocoridae), is an invasive eucalypt specialist that feeds and reproduces in aggregations on eucalypt leaves, causing defoliation and branch dieback in severe infestations. Scant information is available on its mating behavior, so we here report a systematic study of male-female and male-male interactions under controlled experimental conditions. Unmated, sexually mature naive males and females were paired and videotaped from two angles to describe and quantify their behavioral interactions and transitions. Intersexual interactions included mounting, rejection, copulation, antennation and a post-copulatory behavior that we termed smearing and consisted of a rapid backward and forward movement by the male while still on top female. Antennation occurred during copulation, and it may be interpreted as copulatory courtship. Smearing occurred after copulation and positively correlates with total mating time, likely involving mate guarding. Behavioral correlations with size and age showed that female rejection is not affected by male size or age. Intrasexual interactions included two agonistic behaviors that we called sparring and riding, both likely involved in male-male competition and the establishment of male dominance in natural aggregations. Male intrasexual aggressiveness was not related to male size or age either. The results are discussed in relation to the potential functions of these behaviors in the mating system of T. peregrinus.

AB Optimal sexual reproduction in relation to fire effects varies in Fabaceae species. Calliandra species have a large investment in reproduction. We investigated the consequences of fire during the fruiting period of Calliandra parviflora Benth., by checking fruit exposure to fire, pre-dispersal seed predator infestation, and the effect of fruit burning on germination. We conducted this study in a floodable savanna in central Brazil, where we collected burnt and unburnt fruits. We measured the fruit and seed mass, and counted the number of damaged and undamaged seeds and live larvae per fruit. We analyzed the seed germination percentage from burnt and unburnt fruits. The burnt fruits presented greater mass than the unburnt fruits, despite their seed mass being similar. The number of damaged seeds per fruit was only slightly higher in burnt compared to unburnt fruits (p = 0.047). The number of larvae on pre-dispersal seeds per fruit varied from 0 to 4 and did not differ between burnt and unburnt fruits. The germination percentage of unburnt fruit seeds (mean = 22 +/- 17%), was significantly higher than that of burnt fruit (mean = 3.0 +/- 2.0%, p < 0.001). Fire during fruiting or pre-dispersion decreases seed germination from 22 to 3%, but it does not hurt vegetative regeneration or resprout capacity of C. parviflora, which is a facultative seeder. Hence, we suggest that C. parviflora has potential for post-fire restoration in floodable open grassy savannas, in the ecotone between Cerrado and Pantanal, because this species may sprout quickly after first post-fire rains.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are important threats to carnivores worldwide and are especially intense for large predators. Jaguars have been extirpated from over half of their original distribution, and few regions still maintain large populations. The Pantanal is among the best examples of such regions and can be used to better understand several aspects of jaguar biology that are relevant for conservation planning throughout the species' range. Thus, in this study we used microsatellite markers and field data to: (i) assess the genetic structure and gene flow of jaguars (n = 110) from the northern and southern Pantanal; (ii) verify if females are more philopatric than males; (iii) produce a timeline pedigree to allow the identification of distances from offspring to their mothers; and (iv) estimate the generation time for jaguars. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Pantanal jaguars represent a panmictic population, although exhibiting some degree of local differentiation. The Paraguay River seems to be an important factor promoting gene flow among the studied populations, highlighting its relevance for regional conservation efforts. Our data provide the first genetic evidence of female philopatry and male-biased dispersal in jaguars. In addition, we report the first timeline pedigree for a wild jaguar population and the first direct estimate of the species' generation time. Our results contribute to the construction of more realistic assessments of jaguar population dynamics and long-term genetic viability, thus contributing to the design of improved conservation strategies on behalf of this species.

AB The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem.
   We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference.
   We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years.
   We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often.
   Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow.

AB The dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus is a large epinephelid species that occurs in the eastern and south-western Atlantic and western Indian Oceans. Late maturity, protogynous hermaphroditism, site fidelity, and overfishing have all contributed to its demographic decline.
   Connectivity and demography within a broad sampling of dusky grouper populations throughout its distribution were assessed. To do so, genetic variation at 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci and a partial sequence of the mitochondrial control region (mtCR) were evaluated.
   Two major mtCR lineages with a sequence divergence of 1.6% were found. The magnitude of genetic differentiation for mtCR among north and south Atlantic and Indian Ocean populations was high, with phi(ST) = 0.528.
   D-EST and results of discriminant analysis of principal component revealed significant microsatellite genetic differentiation between all collection areas. Significant pairwise D-EST showed moderate (0.084) to very great (0.603) differentiation. The effective population size was low for all localities, ranging between 25 (Azores Archipelago) and 311 (Rio Grande do Sul). The overall effective population size was estimated as 299 (confidence interval = 215-412), and there was no evidence of strong or recent bottleneck effects.
   Local and regional genetic structuring among dusky grouper populations is the consequence of the species' site fidelity, distribution across multiple oceanographic boundaries, and probably also of sequential hermaphroditism that contributes to the intensity of random genetic drift.
   The spatial pattern of genetic structuring of dusky groupers is such that fisheries management and conservation of population genetic integrity will have to be pursued at the local and regional scales.

AB Oaks (Quercus) are major components of temperate forest ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere where they form intermediate or climax communities. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) forests represent the climax vegetation in eastern Germany and western Poland. Here, sessile oak forms pure stands or occurs intermixed with Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris). A large body of research is available on gene flow, reproduction dynamics, and genetic structure in fragmented landscapes and mixed populations. At the same time, our knowledge regarding large, contiguous, and monospecific populations is considerably less well developed. Our study is an attempt to further develop our understanding of the reproduction ecology of sessile oak as an ecologically and economically important forest tree by analyzing mating patterns and genetic structure within adult trees and seedlings originating from one or two reproduction events in an extensive, naturally regenerating sessile oak forest. We detected positive spatial genetic structure up to 30 meters between adult trees and up to 40 meters between seedlings. Seed dispersal distances averaged 8.4 meters. Pollen dispersal distances averaged 22.6 meters. In both cases, the largest proportion of the dispersal occurred over short distances. Dispersal over longer distances was more common for pollen but also appeared regularly for seeds. The reproductive success of individual trees was highly skewed. Only 41 percent of all adult trees produced any offspring while the majority did not participate in reproduction. Among those trees that contributed to the analyzed seedling sample, 80 percent contributed 1-3 gametes. Only 20 percent of all parent trees contributed four or more gametes. However, these relatively few most fertile trees contributed 51 percent of all gametes within the seedling sample. Vitality and growth differed significantly between reproducing and nonreproducing adult trees with reproducing trees being more vital and vigorous than nonreproducing individuals. Our study demonstrates that extensive, apparently homogenous oak forests are far from uniform on the genetic level. On the contrary, they form highly complex mosaics of remarkably small local neighborhoods. This counterbalances the levelling effect of long-distance dispersal and may increase the species' adaptive potential. Incorporating these dynamics in the management, conservation, and restoration of oak forests can support the conservation of forest genetic diversity and assist those forests in coping with environmental change.

AB Harnessing nature-based climate solutions (NbCS) to help simultaneously achieve climate and conservation goals is an attractive win-win. The contribution of NbCS to climate action relies on both biogeochemical potential and the ability to overcome environmental, economic and governance constraints for implementation. As such, estimates of additional NbCS-related terrestrial biosphere storage potential range from less than 100 GtCO(2) to more than 800 GtCO(2). In this Review, we assess the negative emissions contributions of NbCS - including reforestation, improved forest management and soil carbon sequestration - alongside their environmental, social and governance constraints. Given near-term implementation challenges and long-term biogeochemical constraints, a reasonable value for the expected impact of NbCS is up to 100-200 GtCO(2) in negative emissions for the remainder of the twenty-first century. To sustainably reach this level, focus should be on projects with clear co-benefits, and must not come at the expense of a reduction in emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, rapid decarbonization and innovation from alternative negative emissions technologies.
   Nature-based climate solutions can help meet climate mitigation goals, but estimates of their carbon storage potential vary. This Review discusses the constraints and potential contributions of increasing carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere, suggesting a conservative estimate of 100-200 GtCO(2) in negative emissions to 2100.

AB East Pacific (EP) green turtles (Chelonia mydas) have undergone substantial population recovery over the last two decades owing to holistic protection at nesting beaches and foraging areas. At the northern end of their range in southern California United States, green turtles have been seen in more areas and in greater numbers since 2014 than before as a result. A resident population of green turtles has established near La Jolla Shores (LJS), a protected site with daily marine tourism (e.g., kayakers, snorkelers, divers). To study this local aggregation, innovative and non-invasive methods were required because the traditional capture-recapture methods were infeasible due to public relations sensitivities. Green turtle habituation to humans at this site has created a unique opportunity for citizen-based science using underwater photography to document turtles and their surroundings. We obtained 309 usable photographs of local green turtles from members of the dive/snorkel community in LJS. Photos were taken from April 2016 to June 2019. Images were processed in Hotspotter & mdash;a patterned species instance recognition software & mdash;to identify seven individuals, five of which were consistently photographed throughout that period. These images helped infer minimum residency duration (MRD), seasonal differences in algal coverage on the carapace, habitat association, behavioral patterns, and diet. Mean MRD was 424 days (SE = 131 days, calculated from entire population, n = 7), during which turtles were active in 82.8% of the photographs; the remainder of the photographs depicted foraging (14.9%) or resting behavior (2.3%). Green turtles were seen foraging in water temperatures as low as 15.8C, the lowest recorded temperature for foraging green turtles documented in literature. Additional opportunistic observational platforms were used to look at trends of increasing green turtle abundance in southern California since 2015 that supported the arrival of a new aggregation of green turtles in LJS. Our use of citizen-sourced photographs confirms the presence of a resident aggregation of green turtles in LJS. Existence of green turtles and other protected species in highly populated areas provide excellent opportunities to educate beachgoers and seafarers about conservation of these species. This study also highlights the value of citizen-based science in areas where traditional research techniques are ill-suited.

AB The jewel orchids (Goodyerinae), named after their often colourful leaves, have a pantropical distribution with a clear Asian centre of diversity. However, the Nearctic and Neotropical America together form a second centre of diversity, with one-third of known species of Goodyerinae. Previously, only a few American samples have been included in phylogenetic studies, and their putatively Asian origins and American divergence times were poorly known. To elucidate these topics, we inferred phylogenetic trees, performed molecular dating and reconstructed biogeographic history using nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid matK sequences for 34 species of Goodyerinae from the New World and 76 previously published accessions of Cranichideae. Our well-supported phylogenetic topology suggests two independent dispersal events to the New World from the Indomalesian region during the Miocene. The first inferred dispersal of a Neotropical clade diverged c. 11 Mya from their most recent common ancestor (MRCA), comprising three highly supported subclades that do not match the limits of Aspidogyne, Kreodanthus and Microchilus as previously circumscribed. The second dispersal involved a largely Nearctic clade of Goodyera s.l. diverging c. 8.4 Mya from the MRCA and exhibiting a complex biogeographic history with subsequent dispersals between the Nearctic and Indomalesia. The occurrence of these species in gallery forests putatively prevented vicariance events imposed by the expansion of the Chacoan region as previously detected for epiphytic Orchidaceae. Eighty-nine nomenclatural combinations and three new names in Microchilus are proposed.

TI Distinguishing effects of area per se and isolation from the sample-area
   effect for true islands and habitat fragments
SO ECOGRAPHY

DE functional traits; habitat amount hypothesis; habitat fragmentation;
   island biogeography; sampling effects; species&#8211; area relationship
AB The island species area relationship (ISAR) is an important tool for measuring variation in species diversity in variety of insular systems, from true-island archipelagoes to fragmented terrestrial landscapes. However, it suffers from several limitations. For example, due to the sample-area effect, positive relationships between species and area cannot be directly interpreted as evidence for deterministic effects of area per se. Additionally, richness-based analyses may obscure species-level responses to area and isolation that may better inform conservation practice. Here, we use random placement models to control for variation in abundance, occupancy and richness associated with the sample-area effect, allowing deterministic effects of area and isolation, and how they vary with species' functional traits, to be resolved using linear mixed effects models. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using a butterfly assemblage persisting on a naturally fragmented landscape of lake islands. The ISAR did not significantly deviate from random placement in relation to island area, isolation or habitat diversity, supporting stochastic assembly consistent with the sample-area effect. Such inferences support the habitat amount hypothesis, which prioritizes preserving the maximum amount of habitat irrespective of its degree of fragmentation. However, species-level analyses demonstrated that species' abundances were significantly lower on both smaller and more isolated islands than what is predicted by the sample-area effect. Moreover, effects of area per se were significantly greater for smaller, less mobile and rare species. Species' occurrences also significantly deviated from predictions of the sample-area effect in relation to island isolation. Thus, our approach illustrates that richness-based analyses not only result in incorrect inferences on mechanisms underlying ISARs, but also obscure important effects of area per se and isolation on individual species that vary with functional traits. We therefore suggest that these effects should not be solely inferred from richness-based analyses, but rather evaluated on a species-by-species basis.

AB Darwin argued that females' "taste for the beautiful" drives the evolution of male extravagance,(1) but sexual selection theory also predicts that extravagant ornaments can arise from sexual conflict and deception.(2,3) The sensory trap hypothesis posits that elaborate sexual signals can evolve via antagonistic coevolution whereby one sex uses deceptive mimicry to manipulate the opposite sex into mating.(3) Here, the success of deceptive mimicry depends on whether it matches the receiver's percept of the model,(4) and so has little in common with concepts of aesthetic judgement and 'beauty.'(1,5-9) We report that during their song and dance displays,(10) male superb lyrebirds (Menura novaehollandiae) create an elaborate acoustic illusion of a mixed-species mobbing flock. Acoustic analysis showed that males mimicked the mobbing alarm calls of multiple species calling together, enhancing the illusion by also vocally imitating the wingbeats of small birds. A playback experiment confirmed that this illusion was sufficient to fool avian receivers. Furthermore, males produced this mimicry only (1) when females attempted to exit male display arenas, and (2) during the lyrebirds' unusually long copulation, suggesting that the mimicry aims to prevent females from prematurely terminating these crucial sexual interactions. Such deceptive behavior by males should select for perceptual acuity in females, prompting an inter-sexual co-evolutionary arms race between male mimetic accuracy and discrimination by females. In this way the elaboration of the complex avian vocalizations we call 'song' could be driven by sexual conflict, rather than a female's preference for male extravagance.

TI Assessing the relative importance of human and spatial pressures on

SO NEOBIOTA

DE biological invasions; citizen science; city planning; non-native plants;
   urban forests
AB Since 2007, more people in the world live in urban than in rural areas. The development of urban areas has encroached into natural forest ecosystems, consequently increasing the ecological importance of parks and fragmented forest remnants. However, a major concern is that urban activities have rendered urban forests susceptible to non-native species incursions, making them central entry sites where non-native plant species can establish and spread. We have little understanding of what urban factors contribute to this process. Here we use data collected by citizen scientists to determine the differential impacts of spatial and urban factors on non-native plant introductions in urban forests. Using a model city, we mapped 18 urban forests within city limits, and identified all the native and non-native plants present at those sites. We then determined the relative contribution of spatial and socioeconomic variables on the richness and composition of native and non-native plant communities. We found that socioeconomic factors rather than spatial factors (e.g., urban forest area) were important modulators of overall or non-native species richness. Non-native species richness in urban forest fragments was primarily affected by residential layout, recent construction events, and nearby roads. This demonstrates that the proliferation of non-native species is inherent to urban activities and we propose that future studies replicate our approach in different cities to broaden our understanding of the spatial and social factors that modulate invasive species movement starting in urban areas.

AB The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the invasive European fire ant (Myrmica rubra) are both expanding throughout their sympatric range in coastal New England. Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is the causative agent of Lyme disease, and Mount Desert Island, Maine, home to Acadia National Park, currently is affected by a high Lyme disease burden. Ticks have many natural predators, including ants, although no previous studies have investigated interactions between these two species. To test the hypothesis that the presence of M. rubra alters I. scapularis abundance, we collected ticks by drag-sampling at eight ant-infested sites and eight uninfested control sites in Acadia National Park. We found that nymph density was significantly higher at ant-infested sites, while larval density was significantly higher at control sites. In addition, we conducted a laboratory bioassay to measure M. rubra aggression against I. scapularis larvae, nymphs, and adults and Dermacentor variabilis adults, and found that ant aggression was significantly higher against D. variabilis adults than I. scapularis adults. Our findings support the hypothesis that M. rubra has divergent effects across I. scapularis life stages, and we discuss possible ecological mechanisms, including optimal microclimate and predation, that could promote density of nymphs while inhibiting density of larvae.

AB Catastrophic population declines due to disease often lead to fragmented remnant populations and loss of gene flow. Managers are left to determine appropriate conservation actions to recover and maintain population persistence. The recent utilization of genomic data to assist in species recovery now allows us to combine genome-wide surveys of differentiation and diversity with the identification of potentially adaptive regions to develop conservation plans that incorporate ecological and evolutionary processes. The unprecedented global decline of amphibian populations due to the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has increased the need to apply genomic tools to amphibian conservation practices. We show here how understanding genetic characteristics of remnant frog populations affected by disease can be applied directly to restoration efforts. Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae) occur in the mountainous regions of the Pacific northwestern United States and have declined dramatically at the southern edge of their range in California. We conducted genome-wide surveys within this region to inform conservation and reintroduction efforts. We found strong north-south genetic differentiation between Oregon and California and novel spatial structure within California. Genetic diversity was lower in California than Oregon and genetic drift was the most important driver of genetic diversity and population structure in California, making conservation efforts aimed at boosting overall genetic diversity most urgent. Spatial genetic structure of populations within California suggests that reintroductions to Lassen Volcanic National Park, where they were recently extirpated, should use remaining source populations south of the park. Our findings support the treatment of California's R. cascadae populations separately from the rest of their range and highlight the importance of conservation genomics in applied species conservation.

AB Forest management increases the amount of edges or ecotones on the landscape. Ecotones are important transition zones, representing a rapid change in landscape physiognomy and can support greater biodiversity than the adjacent habitats. It is therefore essential to understand how species respond to such habitat transitions. The Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) provide numerous important ecosystem services in forests as herbivores, pollinators, and as food for many birds, bats, and other animals. It is therefore important to understand how this taxon responds to forest management in the boreal forest, and specifically how Lepidoptera assemblages change across anthropogenic forest edges. Via light trapping in clear-cut, forest, and edge habitats, we quantified the extent to which forestry-created ecotones influence nocturnal macromoth assemblages in the eastern boreal forest. We estimated species diversity as Hill numbers, calculated abundance, assessed composition with nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination, and used indicator species analysis to determine how assemblage structure differed between the three habitats. We collected a total of 3486 individuals, representing 187 species that belonged to six families over 108 trap-nights. We collected a higher abundance of nocturnal macromoths in edges than clear-cuts, but not than forest. The composition of edges was intermediate between clearcuts and forests, but differed significantly from adjacent habitats and included many unique species. Forest sites supported lower species richness, Simpson diversity and Shannon diversity than clear-cuts and edges, which overlapped with each other. Overall, our study indicates that the habitat created by forest edges supports unique macromoth assemblages. Moreover, the macromoth assemblage in this habitat is rich and abundant as compared to the adjacent habitats. This has important implications for the maintenance of biodiversity and the provisioning of ecosystem services in the boreal, as well as forestry in the context of natural disturbance emulation.

AB The spatial distribution of plants is constrained by demographic and ecogeographic factors that determine the range and abundance of the species. Wild grapevine (Vitis vinifera ssp. sylvestris) is distributed from Switzerland in the north to Israel in the south. However, little is known about the ecogeographic constraints of this species and its genetic and phenotypic characteristics, especially at the southern edge of its distribution range in the Levant region. In this study, we explore the population structure of southern Levantine wild grapevines and the correlation between demographic and ecogeographic characteristics. Based on our genetic analysis, the wild grapevine populations in this region can be divided into two major subgroups in accordance with a multivariate spatial and ecogeographical clustering model. The identified subpopulations also differ in morphological traits, mainly leaf hairiness which may imply adaptation to environmental stress. The findings suggest that the Upper Jordan River population was spread to the Sea of Galilee area and that a third smaller subpopulation at the south of the Golan Heights may represent a distinguished gene pool or a recent establishment of a new population. A spatial distribution model indicated that distance to water sources, Normalized difference vegetation index, and precipitation are the main environmental factors constraining V. v. sylvestris distribution at its southern distribution range. These factors in addition to limited gene flow between populations prevent further spread of wild grapevines southwards to semi-arid regions.

AB Insect diversity levels and change in remnant urban habitats have been poorly examined in Neotropical regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and composition of foliage/shrub dwelling beetles (Insecta: Coleoptera) regarding the influence of patch attributes (i.e., patch size, connectivity, and surrounding matrix) and within-patch habitat complexity, in an urban landscape at Chetumal, Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. Despite the potential species-specific responses to urban landscape pattern, our study reveals that there are effects of patch spatial features and habitat complexity on overall beetle diversity.These effects are as follows: 1) relatively larger urban patches contained higher overall beetle richness, 2) beetle species composition varied significantly regarding understory vegetation structure and tree richness, and 3) patches of intermediate vegetation age had highest beetle richness.This research provides a case study of patch and habitat features related to Neotropical insect assemblages in urban settlements, underlying the importance of using ecological information to offer management recommendations in ever-expanding urban tropical settlements.

AB Background and Aims Mammals and molluscs (MaM) are abundant herbivores of tree seeds and seedlings, but how the trees and their environment affect MaM herbivory has been little studied. MaM tend to move much larger distances during the feeding stage than the more frequently studied insect herbivores. We hypothesize that MaM (1) select and stay within the patches that promise to be relatively the richest in seeds and seedlings, i.e. patches around adult trees that are old and within a distantly related, less productive neighborhood; and (2) try to remain sheltered from predators while foraging, i.e. mammals remain close to adult trees or to cover by herbs while foraging, and might force their mollusc prey to show the opposite distribution.
   Methods We exposed oak acorns and seedlings in a temperate forest along transects from adult conspecifics in different neighbourhoods. We followed acorn removal and leaf herbivory. We used exclusion experiments to separate acorn removal by ungulates vs. rodents and leaf herbivory by insects vs. molluscs. We measured the size of the closest conspecific adult tree, its phylogenetic isolation from the neighbourhood and the herbaceous ground cover.
   Key Results Consistent with our hypothesis, rodents removed seeds around adult trees surrounded by phylogenetically distant trees and by a dense herb cover. Molluscs grazed seedlings surrounding large conspecific adults and where herb cover is scarce. Contrary to our hypothesis, the impact of MaM did not change from 1 to 5 m distance from adult trees.
   Conclusions We suggest that foraging decisions of MaM repulse seedlings from old adults, and mediate the negative effects of herbaceous vegetation on tree recruitment. Also, an increase in mammalian seed predation might prevent trees from establishing in the niches of phylogenetically distantly related species, contrary to what is known from insect enemies.

ID UN DECLARATION; DEFORESTATION; BRAZIL
AB The recognition of land title and demarcation of indigenous peoples' ancestral lands and the guarantee of the rights of consultation and free, prior and informed consent in the context of large infrastructure projects represent some of the major challenges for indigenous peoples and communities in the Amazon States. These challenges have been exacerbated by the election of the current Brazilian federal government in power since January 2019. Yet a significant development with the potential to strengthen participatory environmental governance in the region followed the adoption and entry into force in April 2021 of the 2018 Regional Agreement on Access to Environmental Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Latin America and the Caribbean. This article will argue that national environmental impact assessment and licensing procedures must integrate a human rights approach to project impact assessments to safeguard the protection of the environment and indigenous peoples' fundamental rights.

AB Natural regeneration is less expensive than tree planting, but determining what species will arrive and establish to serve as templates for tropical forest restoration remains poorly investigated in eastern Africa. This study summarises seedling recruitment under 29 isolated legacy trees (14 trees comprised of three exotic species and 15 trees comprised of seven native species) in tea plantations in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Among the findings were that pioneer recruits were very abundant whereas non-pioneers were disproportionately fewer. Importantly, 98% of all recruits were animal-dispersed. The size of legacy trees, driven mostly by the exotic Grevillea robusta, and to some extent, the native Milicia excelsa, explained abundance of recruits. The distribution of bird-dispersed recruits suggested that some bird species use all types of legacy trees equally in this fragmented landscape. In contrast, the distribution of bat-dispersed recruits provided strong evidence that seedling composition differed under native versus exotic legacy trees likely due to fruit bats showing more preference for native legacy trees. Native, as compared to exotic legacy trees, had almost two times more non-pioneer recruits, with Ficus and Milicia excelsa driving this trend. Implications of our findings regarding restoration in the tropics are numerous for the movement of native animal-dispersed tree species in fragmented and disturbed tropical forests surrounded by farmland. Isolated native trees that bear fleshy fruits can attract more frugivores, resulting not only in high recruitment under them, but depending on the dispersal mode of the legacy trees, also different suites of recruited species. When selecting tree species for plantings, to maximize visitation by different dispersal agents and to enhance seedling recruit diversity, bat-dispersed Milicia excelsa and Ficus species are recommended.

AB Marmosops is one of the most speciose genera of didelphid marsupials, is widely distributed in the Neotropical region, and has been the subject of several taxonomic and systematic revisions. Within the genus, the Pinheiroi complex is distributed in eastern Amazonia and recently has been split into three species, based only on morphology. We analysed both mitochondrial (CYTB) and nuclear (BRCA1) data of a large number of specimens of the Pinheiroi complex from the Tapajos region to test the three-species hypothesis. Our molecular data supported a conservative scenario of four lineages with high molecular divergence within the Pinheiroi complex: one from the Tapajos West bank (until now treated as M. marina), another from the Tapajos East bank (M. marina sensu stricto), a third from the Xingu East bank (M. woodalli), and a fourth from the Amazon North bank (M. pinheiroi). But a scenario of five species within the Pinheiroi complex was not excluded. We restrict M. marina to the Tapajos-Xingu interfluve. Speciation in the Pinheiroi complex was estimated to have taken place in the late Miocene. Both Amazon and Tapajos Rivers have important roles in the differentiation of this complex, either by forming a complete barrier to an existing taxon or by restricting the gene flow between populations on each side of the river. The divergence of major clades on opposite sides of the Amazon and Tapajos Rivers occurred almost simultaneously during the Late Pliocene.

AB The recovery of tree species composition after disturbance depends on dispersal either from nearby forests or from surviving individuals within the disturbed area. Understanding the influence of proximity to mature forests on species composition of regenerating secondary forests can help in predicting the trajectory of recovery from anthropogenic disturbances. Using forest inventory data from a chronosequence of regenerating secondary forests in the Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia, whereby transects were arranged from the edge of mature forest 100 m into the regenerating area, we calculated community weighted means (CWMs) for traits and the natural distribution ranges of species. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to investigate whether site characteristics such as forest age, distance from mature forest edge, soil chemical and physical properties, and canopy openness influence traits and natural distribution of regenerating secondary forest tree species. Results show that species traits were associated with regenerating forest age while the proportion of endemic and widespread species was associated with distance from mature forest and regenerating forest age. Irrespective of distance from mature forest, regenerating secondary forests recruit species with heavy and recalcitrant seeds, but this increased with regenerating forest age. Our results contribute to understanding the effects of forest fragmentation and in restoring forests after deforestation.

AB New records of the Indo-Pacific seastar Mithrodia clavigera (Lamarck, 1816) include the north-central Gulf of Mexico, southeastern Florida, and Ascension Island. Material includes in-situ photographs, specimens from our own field collections, and museum specimens. This species was previously reported in the Atlantic basin in the 1880s off Brazil and in the western Caribbean Sea in the late 1960s and early 1970s. More recent findings are attributable to the advent of SCUBA, seafloor photography, and genetic analysis. The presence of M. clavigera in the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent waters probably represents a former connection with populations in the eastern Pacific Ocean before the rise of the Isthmus of Panama. Our observations here of specimens collected off Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico add to our understanding of this species' behavior and ecology.

AB Understanding how transformed habitats act as reservoirs of biodiversity is a key challenge at a time when ecosystems are under unprecedented pressure. Here we compare tree and bird biodiversity in actively cultivated and abandoned cacao agroforests, and use a space for time approach to ask how this diversity has changed over 100 years of succession.
   Tree and bird communities were surveyed in cacao agroforests, secondary forests at different stages of succession and primary forests in the Northern Range of Trinidad, West Indies, to test the prediction that there are consistent temporal trends in alpha and beta-diversity across taxa.
   Temporal alpha-diversity was taxon dependent. We found that tree alpha-diversity increased with forest age. In contrast, there was no temporal trend in bird alpha-diversity. Tree and bird species richness were negatively correlated.
   Tree and bird composition varied with forest age and environmental distance. A greater proportion of native trees, and of highly forest-dependent and insectivorous birds were found in older forests.
   Our analyses show that actively cultivated and young abandoned cacao agroforests can sustain high bird alpha-diversity, despite lower levels of tree alpha-diversity. Old secondary and primary forests have unique species compositions including more sensitive and specialist species. Compositional shifts with successional stage for both trees and birds produce a patchwork of habitats that contribute to regional gamma-diversity.
   Synthesis and applications. Our research highlights the value of actively cultivated cacao agroforests and secondary forest alongside primary forests as reservoirs of biodiversity. By supporting both biodiversity and livelihoods, traditionally grown shade-cacao agroforests fall within a people and nature framework. Taken together, these results emphasise the contributions of secondary forests, which are often overlooked, to conservation.

AB The Central American Isthmus has had profound effects on the evolution and distribution of larger marine organisms, but the impacts on meiobenthic animals have received little attention. Tardigrades are microscopic metazoan lobopodians that are ubiquitous in benthic communities worldwide, but little is known about marine tardigrades in Central America. Only two marine tardigrades have been identified to species level in all of Central America, and these came from a single sample of barnacles from El Salvador collected in 1953. Additionally, multiple haplotypes of Echiniscoides were reported from Costa Rica and Panama, but species names were not assigned. Here we report an extensive survey of both intertidal and subtidal marine tardigrades from both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Costa Rica. We found 701 individuals in 65 samples. There was a total of 19 taxa, including seven species with a sufficient quality and quantity of specimens to describe here as new to science. The new species are Archechiniscus murilloi sp. nov., Batillipes homocercus sp. nov., Batillipes ichthyocercus sp. nov., Echiniscoides costaricensis sp. nov., Echiniscoides ritavargasae sp. nov., Styraconyx vargasi sp. nov. and Tanarctus breedyae sp. nov. Ten taxa were found only in the Caribbean, six were found only in the Pacific, and three were found on both coasts. We discuss the three species with trans-isthmus distributions and note two additional candidate geminate species pairs that warrant further investigation.

AB The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes code for key immune receptors responsible for recognition of intra- and extracellular pathogens (MHC class I and class II, respectively). It was hypothesized that MHC polymorphism can be maintained via fluctuating selection resulting from between-habitat variation in pathogen regimes. We examined associations between MHC class I and class II genes and habitat structure in an apex avian predator, the white-tailed eagle, Haliaeetus albicilla. We genotyped MHC class I and class II genes in ca. 150 white-tailed eagle chicks from nearly 100 nesting territories distributed across 3 distinct populations in Poland. Habitat structure was quantified at the level of foraging territories and directly at the nest sites. We found strong support for associations of habitat traits with diversity and allelic composition at the MHC class II. Forest area within territory and forest productivity were identified as the major habitat predictors of MHC class II polymorphism, whereas other habitat traits (distance to nearest open water, grassland, and water area within territory or understory presence) showed fewer associations with class II alleles. In contrast, there was little support for associations between MHC class I genes and habitat structure. All significant associations were apparent at the withinpopulation level rather than between populations. Our results suggest that extracellular (rather than intracellular) pathogens may exert much stronger selective pressure on the white-tailed eagle. Associations of habitat structure with MHC class II may reflect fluctuating (balancing) selection, which maintains MHC diversity within populations.

AB This research investigates the extent and causal mechanisms of genetic population divergence in a poorly flighted passerine, the North Island Rifleman or Titipounamu (Acanthisitta chloris granti). While this species has a historically widespread distribution, anthropogenic forest clearance has resulted in a highly fragmented current distribution. We conducted analyses of mitochondrial DNA (COI and Control Region) and 12 nuclear DNA microsatellites to test for population divergence and estimate times of divergence. DiyAbc and BioGeoBears were then used to assess likely past dispersal scenarios based on both mtDNA and nDNA. The results reveal several significantly divergent lineages across the North Island of New Zealand and indicate that some populations have been isolated for extensive periods of time (0.7-4.9 mya). Modeling indicated a dynamic history of population connectivity, with a drastic restriction in gene flow between three geographic regions, followed by a more recent re-establishment of connectivity. Our analyses indicate the dynamic influence of key geological and climatological events on the distribution of genetic diversity in this species, including support for the genetic impact of old biogeographic boundaries such as the Taupo Line and Cockayne's Line, rather than recent anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. These findings present a rare example of an avian species with a genetic history more like that of flightless taxa and so provide new general insights into vicariant processes affecting populations of passerines with limited dispersal.

AB Increasing the connectivity of protected areas is an urgent need to ensure the conservation of forest species and help them to shift their ranges due to anthropogenic drivers. However, efforts to do so considering the joint effects of habitat fragmentation and climate change are still scant. Here, we aimed to outline a framework that incorporates spatial, temporal and multi-taxa criteria to pinpoint locations that connect protected areas in the eastern Amazon. We analyzed three mosaics of protected areas, and data on 603 species (bees, birds, bats) and developed two models using species movement flow (MF; through circuit theory) and habitat suitability (HS; through species distribution models). Considering only the MF, northward areas are the main candidates for corridors, most of which presenting forest cover (68% of the 928,379 ha). This result changes when we analyze the HS, since the corridors are mostly positioned in a different direction (westward) and less than half have forest cover (45% of the 925,058 ha). Candidate areas for both approaches totaled 135,171 ha, with 86% still covered by forest. Our results rely on methodological and taxonomic redundancy (to depict a range of movement and/or habitat requirements) for an efficient strategy to prioritize areas for connectivity. Dynamic restoration simulations showed that the location and order of restoration are important to ensure increased availability of habitat. Our approach can help address two important biodiversity threats (habitat loss and climate change) and maximize the selection of the best corridors to protect species in a rapidly changing world.

AB This paper assesses the effects of a bail out on deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon following a revision in the Forest Code. By providing a bail out to landowners with illegal deforestation, the New Forest Code has created incentives for law-abiding landowners to engage in deforestation activities as well, in the expectation of receiving future amnesties. To identify causal effects, we explore a rich dataset at the property level and use a difference-in-differences strategy, where former law-abiders are our treatment group. In our preferred econometric specification, the private rural properties in the treated group are associated with a rate of forest loss 0.457 p.p. higher than would prevail in the absence of the law revision. This amounts to an accumulated loss of nearly 1 million hectares of forest between 2012 and 2017. This is equivalent to a US$ 2.4 billion loss when no more than carbon emissions are considered.

AB Ecology cannot yet fully explain why so many tree species coexist in natural communities such as tropical forests. A major difficulty is linking individual-level processes to community dynamics. We propose a combination of tree spatial data, spatial statistics and dynamical theory to reveal the relationship between spatial patterns and population-level interaction coefficients and their consequences for multispecies dynamics and coexistence. Here we show that the emerging population-level interaction coefficients have, for a broad range of circumstances, a simpler structure than their individual-level counterparts, which allows for an analytical treatment of equilibrium and stability conditions. Mechanisms such as animal seed dispersal, which result in clustering of recruits that is decoupled from parent locations, lead to a rare-species advantage and coexistence of otherwise neutral competitors. Linking spatial statistics with theories of community dynamics offers new avenues for explaining species coexistence and calls for rethinking community ecology through a spatial lens.
   Tree spatial data, spatial statistics and dynamical theory reveal the relationship between spatial patterns and population-level interaction coefficients and their consequences for multispecies dynamics and coexistence.

AB Species that inhabit high-shore environments on rocky shores survive prolonged periods of emersion and thermal stress. Using two Hong Kong high-shore littorinids (Echinolittorina malaccana and E. radiata) as models, we examined their behavioral repertoire to survive these variable and extreme conditions. Environmental temperatures ranged from 4 degrees C in the cool season to 55.5 degrees C in the hot season, with strong seasonal and daily fluctuations. In the hot season, both species allocated >35% of their activity budgets to stress-mitigating thermoregulatory behaviors (e.g. standing, towering) and relatively small proportions to foraging (<20%) and reproduction (<10%). In the assumedly benign cool season, greater proportions (>70%) of activity budgets were allocated to stress mitigation behaviors (crevice occupation, aggregation formation). Both species exhibited multifunctional behaviors that optimized time use during their tidally-constrained activity window in the hot season. Females mated while foraging when awash by the rising tide, and some males crawled on top of females prior to ceasing movement to form 'towers', which have both thermoregulatory benefits and reduce searching time for mates during subsequent activity. The function of such behaviors varies in a state-dependent manner, for example, the function of trail following changes over an activity cycle from mate searching on rising tides, to stress mitigation on falling tides (aiding aggregation formation), and to both functions through tower formation just before movement stops. Many of these behavioral responses are, therefore, multifunctional and can vary according to local conditions, allowing snails in this family to successfully colonize the extreme high-shore environment.

AB In human-dominated landscapes, connectivity is crucial for maintaining demographically stable mammalian populations. Here, we provide a comprehensive noninvasive genetic study for the brown bear population in the Hellenic Peninsula. We analyze its population structuring and connectivity, estimate its population size throughout its distribution, and describe its phylogeography in detail for the first time. Our results, based on 150 multilocus genotypes and on 244-bp sequences of the mtDNA control region, show the population is comprised by three highly differentiated genetic clusters, consistent with geographical populations of Pindos, Peristeri, and Rhodope. By detecting two male bears with Rhodopean ancestry in the western demes, we provide strong evidence for the ongoing genetic connectivity of the geographically fragmented eastern and western distributions, which suggests connectivity of the larger East Balkan and Pindos-Dinara populations. Total effective population size (N-e) was estimated to be 199 individuals, and total combined population size (N-C) was 499, with each cluster showing a relatively high level of genetic variability, suggesting that migration has been sufficient to counteract genetic erosion. The mtNDA results were congruent with the microsatellite data, and the three genetic clusters were matched predominantly with an equal number of mtDNA haplotypes that belong to the brown bear Western mitochondrial lineage (Clade 1), with two haplotypes being globally new and endemic. The detection of a fourth haplotype that belongs to the Eastern lineage (Clade 3a1) in three bears from the western distribution places the southernmost secondary contact zone between the Eastern and Western lineages in Greece and generates new hypotheses about postglacial maxima migration routes. This work indicates that the genetic composition and diversity of Europe's low-latitude fringe population are the outcome of ancient and historical events and highlight its importance for the connectivity and long-term persistence of the species in the Balkans.

AB Tropical Secondary Forests (SFs) are vulnerable forest systems growing in areas that have been subject to unsustainable human activities leading to deforestation. SFs account for swathes of tropical forest landscapes that have lost their capacity to provide a high level of goods and services. They are also located in highly dynamic and human-pressured landscapes and are vulnerable to natural and human-induced catastrophic events, such as hurricanes or fires. Without appropriate silvicultural management to increase their economic value and restore their ecological functions, they often become degraded and are sometimes cleared for more short-term economically productive activities. Given the increasing demand for tropical timber in recent decades that will continue in the near future, we suggest that active restoration geared towards wood production is an opportunity for SF conservation. Promoting sustainable wood production -i.e. associated with other environmental services- in these disturbed forest ecosystems is also a way to reduce logging pressure on the remaining intact primary tropical forests, indeed, this may be the most important reason to enhance active restoration aimed at wood production in tropical SFs worldwide. Future research in forest ecology and management should produce experimental evidence of enhanced production of wood and ecosystem services in SFs through appropriate silvicultural experimentations.

AB Human straight-legged bipedalism represents one of the earliest events in the evolutionary split between humans (Homo spp.) and chimpanzees (Pan spp.), although its selective basis is a mystery. A carrying-related hypothesis has recently been proposed in which hair loss within the hominin lineage resulted in the inability of babies to cling to their mothers, requiring mothers to walk upright to carry their babies. However, a question remains for this model: what drove the hair loss that resulted in upright walking? Observers since Darwin have suggested that hair loss in humans may represent an evolutionary strategy for defence against ticks. The aim of this review is to propose and evaluate a novel tick-based evolutionary hypothesis wherein forest fragmentation in hominin paleoenvironments created conditions that were favourable for tick proliferation, selecting for hair loss in hominins and grooming behaviour in chimpanzees as divergent anti-tick strategies. It is argued that these divergent anti-tick strategies resulted in different methods for carrying babies, driving the locomotor divergence of humans and chimpanzees.

AB The number of Brazilian municipalities and states engaging in payment for environmental services (PES) has been increasing over the last few years. Through a documentary and scientific research, we sought to understand the evolution of almost 20 years of Brazilian experiences in hydrological PES. The research was based on an inventory of the initiatives (already finished or under development), their location, legal basis, and valuation methods. Considering the sampling universe of 68 Brazilian hydrological PES initiatives, we observed: higher concentration of programs in the South and Southeast, with a tendency to expand them to other Brazilian regions, especially the Midwest; the first initiatives of hydrological PES in Brazil adopted the payment of a fixed value, without considering the biotic quality of the rural properties, a pattern which was gradually replaced by the calculation of the opportunity cost of land and the inclusion of physical-environmental indicators and socioeconomic factors in the valuation methodologies. The study allows to conclude that, in the last decade, there has been a tendency for hydrological PES programs to adopt methodologies with an interdisciplinary and systemic approach to assess the provision of environmental services.

AB Tilia cordata Mill. is a valuable tree species enriching the ecological values of the coniferous-dominated boreal forests in Europe. Following the historical decline, spreading of Tilia sp. is challenged by the elevated inbreeding and habitat fragmentation. We studied the geographical distribution of genetic diversity of Tilia cordata populations in Lithuania. We used 14 genomic microsatellite markers to genotype 543 individuals from 23 wild-growing populations. We found that Tilia cordata retained high levels of genetic diversity (population F (IS) = 0-0.15, H (o) = 0.53-0.69, H (e) = 0.56-0.75). AMOVA, Bayesian clustering, and Monmonier's barrier detection indicate weak but significant differentiation among the populations (F (ST) = 0.037***) into geographically interpretable clusters of (a) western Lithuania with high genetic heterogeneity but low genetic diversity, bottleneck effects, (b) relatively higher genetic diversity of Tilia cordata on rich and most soils of midland lowland, and (c) the most differentiated populations on poor soils of the coolest northeastern highland possessing the highest rare allele frequency but elevated inbreeding and bottleneck effects. Weak genetic differentiation among the Tilia cordata populations in Lithuania implies common ancestry, absence of strong adaptive gradients, and effective genetic exchange possible mediated via the riparian networks. A hypothesis on riparian networks as gene flow mediators in Tilia cordata was raised based on results of this study.

AB Understanding spatial patterns of diversity in tropical forests is indispensable for their sustainable use and conservation. Recent studies have reported relationships between forest structure and alpha-diversity. While tree alpha-diversity is difficult to map via remote sensing, large-scale forest structure models are becoming more common, which would facilitate mapping the relationship between tree alpha-diversity and forest structure, contributing to our understanding of biogeographic patterns in the tropics. We developed a methodology to map tree alpha-diversity in tropical forest regions at 50 m spatial resolution using alpha-diversity estimates from forest inventories as response variables and forest structural metrics and environmental variables as predictors. To include forest structural metrics in our modelling, we first developed a method to map seven of these metrics integrating discrete light detection and ranging (LiDAR), multispectral, and synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR). We evaluated this methodology in the Choco region of Colombia, a tropical forest with high tree diversity and complex forest structure. The relative errors (REs) of the random forest models used to map the seven forest structural variables ranged from low (6%) to moderate (35%). The alpha-diversity maps had moderate RE; the maps of Simpson and Shannon diversity indices had the lowest RE (9% and 13%), followed by richness (17%), while Shannon and Simpson effective number of species indices had the highest RE, 27% and 47%, respectively. The highest concentrations of tree alpha-diversity are located along the Pacific Coast from the centre to the northwest of the Choco Region and in non-flooded forest along the boundary between the Choco region and the Andes. Our results reveal strong relationships between canopy structure and tree alpha-diversity, providing support for ecological theories that link structure to diversity via niche partitioning and environmental conditions. With modification, our methods could be applied to assess tree alpha-diversity of any tropical forest where tree alpha-diversity field observations coincident with LiDAR data.

AB Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) indicators consider the main ecological and socioeconomic functions of forests but do not currently include some key groups widely adopted to assess the effects of forest management, such as herbaceous vascular plants, epiphytic lichens, and wood-decay fungi. Moreover, they are shaped into high forests while in the Mediterranean area the oldest type of forest management is coppice. We investigated the diversity and the relationships of the above-mentioned groups of taxa in three European Forest Types (EFTs) to contribute to the selection of indicator species suitable for monitoring Mediterranean coppice forests. We find only a weak cross-taxon congruence between vascular plants and lichens on considering the whole dataset, while no significant correlations are evident within the three EFTs. Species richness was significantly different among EFTs, being Thermophilous deciduous forests the richest, both considering the groups of taxa separately and the total species richness. As for species composition, significant differences were found both for the whole dataset and also for pairwise comparisons among EFTs. We provided a dwelling-species list of the three key groups of taxa, which could be suitable for monitoring the sustainability characteristics of fragmented and low continuity forests such as coppice stands.

AB Deforestation has carved tropical forest landscapes into millions of different-sized patches worldwide. Research has focused on the effect of patch size on biodiversity, while neglecting patch quality effects and leaving geographic and interspecific variance to patch attributes largely unexamined. Here, we asses show patch size and quality affect the encounter rate (ER) and immature-to-female ratio (IFR) of three endangered primates - Mexican mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana), black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra), and spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) - in three rainforest regions with different forest cover. ER of spider monkeys in the best preserved region (50% forest cover) was positively related to both patch size and quality (i.e., species richness of top food species). ER of mantled howlers in the 17% forest cover region was also positively related to patch size. Yet, both ER and IFR of black howlers in the 50% forest cover region and mantled howlers in the 5% forest cover region were mainly related to patch quality. Our results demonstrate that conservation actions in human-modified landscapes must go beyond considering the effect of patch size, as animal populations can be better predicted by patch quality in some regions.

AB As landscapes become increasingly fragmented, research into impacts from disturbance and how edges affect vegetation and community structure has become more important. Descriptive studies on how microclimate changes across sharp transition zones have long existed in the literature and recently more attention has been focused on understanding the dynamic patterns of microclimate associated with forest edges. Increasing concern about forest fragmentation has led to new technologies for modeling forest microclimates. However, forest boundaries pose important challenges to not only microclimate modeling but also sampling regimes in order to capture the diurnal and seasonal dynamic aspects of microclimate along forest edges. We measured microclimatic variables across a sharp boundary from a clearing into primary lowland tropical rainforest at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Dynamic changes in diurnal microclimate were measured along three replicated transects, approximately 30 m in length with data collected every 1 m continuously at 30 min intervals for 24 h with a mobile sensor platform supported by a cable infrastructure. We found that a first-order polynomial fit using piece-wise regression provided the most consistent estimation of the forest edge, relative to the visual edge, although we found no "best" sensing parameter as all measurements varied. Edge location estimates based on daytime net shortwave radiation had less difference from the visual edge than other shortwave measurements, but estimates made throughout the day with downward-facing or net infrared radiation sensors were more consistent and closer to the visual edge than any other measurement. This research contributes to the relatively small number of studies that have directly measured diurnal temporal and spatial patterns of microclimate variation across forest edges and demonstrates the use of a flexible mobile platform that enables repeated, high-resolution measurements of gradients of microclimate.

AB Hurricane Hugo was a category five storm in September of 1989 that significantly impacted natural areas along the Carolina coastal plain through wind damage and storm surge flooding. Francis Beidler Forest, an Audubon wildlife sanctuary in Four Holes Swamp, suffered severe damage to its forest canopy. In response to concerns that the rare spring ephemeral Trillium pusillum vat pusilium may be negatively impacted by the loss of the mixed hardwood canopy, we established permanent plots in the spring of 1990 with single leaf, triple leaf, and flowering individuals recorded by Ecology faculty and students at The Citadel. Disruption to the forest canopy would significantly alter forest floor microhabitat conditions negatively affecting T. pusilitem var. pusillum population demography. There was no expected negative effect of Hurricane Hugo, and the loss of canopy cover on the population. Evidence suggests that the decrease in canopy cover and increased light was associated with increased flowering. The coefficient of variation, as a measure of cohort variability among years, increased from flowering, to triple lull, to single leaf across the 29 years of population monitoring. There was a significant positive association between the number of named storms in the previous two and three years and the number of single leaf plants. There was no evidence that the population is decreasing, even though the number of flowering individuals has decreased. The results of this long-term demography suggest that even severe natural disturbances, like hurricanes and tropical storms, may have a positive effect on Trillium population dynamics.

TI Seabird bycatch risk correlates with body size, and relatively larger
   skulls, bills, wings and sensory structures
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Many animals have sensory biases towards signals or cues that typically provide some fitness benefit. Sensory traps occur when other species or anthropogenic sources produce similar signals or cues but responding is no longer adaptive and can impose significant costs or even death. Bycatch of seabirds by fishing boats has devastating impacts, causing hundreds of thousands of seabird deaths per annum. Here, we explore whether fishing vessels are acting as a sensory trap, inadvertently targeting seabirds with certain life-history traits or larger skeletal or sensory structures. We surveyed the literature to compare seabird order, diet, wingspan, body size, and nesting preference (surface or burrow) of 70 seabirds with varying numbers of reported bycatch in one of the world's most important regions for seabird breeding, in northern Aotearoa New Zealand. We also examined the skeletal and sensory measurements of six seabirds that co-occur spatially in this region, but have different numbers of reported bycatch and indices of bycatch risk. The literature survey revealed that the Charadriiformes and the Sphenisciformes were the most vulnerable groups (p = 0.01), especially to surface longline fisheries. There were no correlations with diet and foraging behaviour, but surface nesting seabirds and those with larger bodies and wingspans were at a greater risk of becoming bycatch. Skeletal measurements show that species with higher bycatch also have relatively larger skulls, bills and wings, eye sockets and nostrils (relative to body size) (p < 0.05). This suggests that having a larger overall body size and longer protruding body parts is a primary risk factor, but that species with relatively more sensitive sensory systems likely have even more acute bycatch risk. Considering fishing vessels as sensory traps provides a context to explore the multiple interconnecting factors of sensory sensitivity, sensory bias, behaviour and morphology.

AB Behavioural time budgets of organisms reflect their reaction norms to environmental conditions and, as such, indicate their behavioural plasticity. In environments which limit the activity time of organisms, efficient organization of behaviours is critical to enhancing performance to achieve necessary functions and minimize time and/or energetic costs. We investigated variations in behavioural time budgets of a common deposit-feeding crab, Scopimera intermedia, to the spatio-temporal scales of environmental changes experienced on sandy shores in the monsoonal tropics, where activity times are restricted by the tides. Activity levels of the crabs varied strongly with air temperature, with crabs emerging from the sediments only when air temperature exceeded similar to 20 degrees C. Behavioural water uptake increased in frequency with both feeding rate and environmental temperature, and was often followed by waving displays. Water uptake and waving, therefore, appear to be multifunctional behaviours, as not only do the crabs replenish water for feeding and wave their chelipeds to court females, but these behaviours can also contribute to thermoregulation, enhancing cooling when taking up water from the sediment surface. Such plastic and multifunctional behavioural traits are likely a widespread solution for survival and reproductive success in harsh and dynamic environments, where specialized traits are energetically costly and time-inefficient to optimize performance.
   Significance statement
   Surviving in extreme and variable environments is challenging due to the potentially substantial energetic cost animals need to undertake in order to maximize performances under contrasting conditions. This study reveals a multitasking strategy adopted by the sand-bubbler crab to survive hot and variable temperatures within a limited activity time on tropical sandy shores. Behaviours of the crabs are strongly temperature dependent; and when active whilst the tide is out the crabs flexibly adjust their activity times to feed, stay cool and attract mates using a limited set of multifunctional behaviours. Specialized traits are therefore not necessary to achieve these critical functions and, as such, this study highlights the importance of this plastic, multitasking strategy as a common solution for animals to endure highly variable environments with minimal cost.

AB Light and nitrogen availability are among the most important environmental factors influencing leaf and root morphological traits and forest ecosystems. Understanding the variation in leaf and root traits is pivotal to the adaptive plasticity and leaf-root-specific traits in response to low light and N availability. The effects of light and N availability on leaf and root traits and their interrelations are still not clear. We aimed to measure the response of leaf and root traits and their interrelations to light and N availability in a temperate region. Thus, a factorial experiment was conducted with two angiosperm tree species under two light (L+, L-) and two nitrogen (N-, N+) levels. Results showed that the leaf density (LD) and leaf mass per area (LMA) increased, while leaf thickness (LT) decreased under low light availability. Under N availability, the LD and LMA decreased, while LT increased in sun-exposed plots and remained stable under low light availability across two species. The root diameter, root length, specific root length (SRL), and specific root area (SRA) decreased, while the root tissue density (TD) increased under low light availability. Root diameter, root length, SRA, and SRL increased, while the TD decreased under N+ in L+ plots and remained stable under L- plots. LMA and LT were significantly positively correlated to root length and SRL while significantly negatively correlated to TD. However, LD was significantly positively correlated to TD. We observed that low light availability has significantly decreased the plant biomass and root mass fraction (RMF) and increased the leaf mass fraction (LMF), while the stem mass fraction (SMF) remained stable?indicating the shade in-tolerances in both species. Correlation analyses revealed that LMF is generally, and particularly under L- conditions, less related to leaf and root morphological traits, while RMF was frequently positively correlated to both leave and root traits under all environmental conditions. This illustrates a divergent regulation of morphological traits above and below ground under varying biomass allocation patterns.

AB Deleterious effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity have been demonstrated in numerous taxa. Although parasites represent a large part of worldwide biodiversity, they are mostly neglected in this context. We investigated the effects of various anthropogenic environmental changes on gastrointestinal parasite infections in four small mammal hosts inhabiting two landscapes of fragmented dry forest in northwestern Madagascar. Coproscopical examinations were performed on 1,418 fecal samples from 903 individuals of two mouse lemur species, Microcebus murinus (n = 199) and M. ravelobensis (n = 421), and two rodent species, the native Eliurus myoxinus (n = 102) and the invasive Rattus rattus (n = 181). Overall, sixteen parasite morphotypes were detected and significant prevalence differences between host species regarding the most common five parasites may be explained by parasite-host specificity or host behavior, diet, and socioecology. Ten host- and habitat-related ecological variables were evaluated by generalized linear mixed modeling for significant impacts on the prevalence of the most abundant gastrointestinal parasites and on gastrointestinal parasite species richness (GPSR). Forest maturation affected homoxenous parasites (direct life cycle) by increasing Lemuricola, but decreasing Enterobiinae gen. sp. prevalence, while habitat fragmentation and vegetation clearance negatively affected the prevalence of parasites with heterogenic environment (i.e., Strongyloides spp.) or heteroxenous (indirect cycle with intermediate host) cycles, and consequently reduced GPSR. Forest edges and forest degradation likely change abiotic conditions which may reduce habitat suitability for soil-transmitted helminths or required intermediate hosts. The fragility of complex parasite life cycles suggests understudied and potentially severe effects of decreasing habitat quality by fragmentation and degradation on hidden ecological networks that involve parasites. Since parasites can provide indispensable ecological services and ensure stability of ecosystems by modulating animal population dynamics and nutrient pathways, our study underlines the importance of habitat quality and integrity as key aspects of conservation.

AB Neotropical montane forests are considered biodiversity hotspots, where epiphytic bryophytes are an important component of the diversity, biomass and functioning of these ecosystems. We evaluated the richness and composition of bryophytes in secondary successional forests and mixed plantations of Juglans neotropica. In each forest type, the presence and cover of epiphytic bryophytes was registered in 400 quadrats of 20 cm x 30 cm. We analyzed the effects of canopy openness, diameter at breast height (DBH) and forest type on bryophyte richness, using a generalized linear model (GLM), as well as the changes in species composition using multivariate analysis. Fifty-five bryophyte species were recorded, of which 42 species were in secondary forests and 40 were in mixed plantations. Bryophyte richness did not change at forest level; however, at tree level, richness was higher in the mixed plantation of J. neotropica compared to the secondary forests, due to the presence of species adapted to high light conditions. On the other hand, bryophyte communities were negatively affected by the more open canopy in the mixed plantation of J. neotropica, species adapted to more humid conditions being less abundant. We conclude that species with narrow microclimatic niches are threatened by deforestation, and J. neotropica plantations do not act as refuge for drought-sensitive forest species present in secondary forests.

AB Comparative studies of genetic diversity and population structure can shed light on the ecological and evolutionary factors governing host-parasite interactions. Even though invasive parasites are considered of major biological importance, little is known about their adaptative potential when infesting the new hosts. Here, the genetic diversification of Varroa destructor, a novel parasite of Apis mellifera originating from Asia, was investigated using population genetics to determine how the genetic structure of the parasite changed in distinct European populations of its new host. To do so, mites infesting two categories of hosts in four European regions were compared: (a) adapted hosts surviving through means of natural selection, thereby expected to impose strong selective pressure on the mites, and (b) treated host populations, surviving mite infestations because acaricides are applied, therefore characterized by a relaxed selection imposed by the host on the mites. Significant genetic divergence was found across regions, partially reflecting the invasion pattern of V. destructor throughout Europe and indicating local adaptation of the mite to the host populations. Additionally, varying degrees of genotypic changes were found between mites from adapted and treated colonies. Altogether, these results indicate that V. destructor managed to overcome the genetic bottlenecks following its introduction in Europe and that host-mediated selection fostered changes in the genetic structure of this mite at diverse geographic scales. These findings highlight the potential of parasites to adapt to their local host populations and confirm that adaptations developed within coevolutionary dynamics are a major determinant of population genetic changes.

AB The brown-banded bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum is one of the most common shark species caught in coastal fisheries throughout the Indo-Malay region and the most abundant shark caught in trawl fisheries in Malaysia and Thailand. Differences in fisheries regulations related to trawling among jurisdictions, and an absence of either stock assessments or population estimates in the region, raise questions about the sustainability of fisheries that take this species. As a small-bodied, benthic shark that predominantly inhabits shallow, soft substrate habitats, the population may be particularly vulnerable to trawling throughout the region. We investigated the population structure of Chiloscyllium punctatum using genome-wide nuclear markers. Comprehensive DNA sampling was undertaken in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, and population structure analysis using SNP datasets revealed at least four genetically distinct regional groups of C. punctatum. We identified a potentially shared stock between Malaysia and Indonesia, and separate populations in the Andaman Sea off Thailand, the South China Sea, and a localized population in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Each of these stocks may likely require different management approaches tailored to the scale and types of fishing pressure in the different regions.

AB Riparian buffers are the primary tool in forest management for protecting the habitat structure and function of streams. They help protect against biogeochemical perturbation, filter sediments and nutrients, prevent erosion, contribute food to aquatic organisms, regulate light and hence water temperature, contribute deadwood, and preserve biodiversity. However, in production forests of Sweden and Finland, many headwater streams have been straightened, ditched, and/or channelized, resulting in altered hydrology and reduced natural disturbance by floods, which in turn affects important riparian functions. Furthermore, in even-aged management systems as practiced in much of Fennoscandia, understory trees have usually been cleared right up to the stream's edge during thinning operations, especially around small, headwater streams. Fire suppression has further favored succession towards shade tolerant species. In the regions within Fennoscandia that have experienced this combination of intensive management and lack of natural disturbance, riparian zones are now dominated by single-storied, native Norway spruce. When the adjacent forest is cut, thin (5 - 15m) conifer-dominated riparian buffers are typically left. These buffers do not provide the protection and subsidies, in terms of leaf litter quality, needed to maintain water quality or support riparian or aquatic biodiversity. Based on a literature review, we found compelling evidence that the ecological benefits of multi-layered, mixed-species riparian forest with a large component of broadleaved species are higher than what is now commonly found in the managed stands of Fennoscandia. To improve the functionality of riparian zones, and hence the protection of streams in managed forest landscapes, we present some basic principles that could be used to enhance the ecological function of these interfaces. These management actions should be prioritized on streams and streamside stands that have been affected by simplification either through forest management or hydrological modification. Key to these principles is the planning and managing of buffer zones as early as possible in the rotation to ensure improved function throughout the rotation cycle and not only at final felling. This is well in line with EU and national legislation which can be interpreted as requiring landscape planning at all forest ages to meet biodiversity and other environmental goals. However, it is still rare that planning for conservation is done other than at the final felling stage. Implementing this new strategy is likely to have long-term positive effects and improve the protection of surface waters from negative forestry effects and a history of fire suppression. By following these suggested management principles, there will be a longer time period with high function and greater future management flexibility in addition to the benefits provided by leaving riparian buffers at the final felling stage.

AB Environmental DNA metabarcoding is a powerful tool for studying biodiversity. However, bioinformatic approaches need to adjust to the diversity of taxonomic compartments targeted as well as to each barcode gene specificities. We built and tested a pipeline based on read correction with DADA2 allowing analysing metabarcoding data from prokaryotic (16S) and eukaryotic (18S, COI) life compartments. We implemented the option to cluster amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with swarm, a network-based clustering algorithm, and the option to curate ASVs/OTUs using LULU. Finally, taxonomic assignment was implemented via the Ribosomal Database Project Bayesian classifier (RDP) and BLAST. We validated this pipeline with ribosomal and mitochondrial markers using metazoan mock communities and 42 deep-sea sediment samples. The results show that ASVs and OTUs describe different levels of biotic diversity, the choice of which depends on the research questions. They underline the advantages and complementarity of clustering and LULU-curation for producing metazoan biodiversity inventories at a level approaching the one obtained using morphological criteria. While clustering removes intraspecific variation, LULU effectively removes spurious clusters, originating from errors or intragenomic variability. Swarm clustering affected alpha and beta diversity differently depending on genetic marker. Specifically, d-values > 1 appeared to be less appropriate with 18S for metazoans. Similarly, increasing LULU's minimum ratio level proved essential to avoid losing species in sample-poor data sets. Comparing BLAST and RDP underlined that accurate assignments of deep-sea species can be obtained with RDP, but highlighted the need for a concerted effort to build comprehensive, ecosystem-specific databases.

AB Wind disperses the pollen and seeds of many plants, but little is known about whether and how it shapes large-scale landscape genetic patterns. We address this question by a synthesis and re-analysis of genetic data from more than 1,900 populations of 97 tree and shrub species around the world, using a newly developed framework for modeling long-term landscape connectivity by wind currents. We show that wind shapes three independent aspects of landscape genetics in plants with wind pollination or seed dispersal: populations linked by stronger winds are more genetically similar, populations linked by directionally imbalanced winds exhibit asymmetric gene flow ratios, and downwind populations have higher genetic diversity. For each of these distinct hypotheses, partial correlations between the respective wind and genetic metrics (controlling for distance and climate) are positive for a significant majority of wind-dispersed or wind-pollinated genetic data sets and increase significantly across functional groups expected to be increasingly influenced by wind. Together, these results indicate that the geography of both wind strength and wind direction play important roles in shaping large-scale genetic patterns across the world's forests. These findings have implications for various aspects of basic plant ecology and evolution, as well as the response of biodiversity to future global change.

AB Aims While reported short-term microbial responses to nutrient enrichment experiments are common, we provide results from a six-year data set in response to field manipulations of soil phosphorus (P) availability. We hypothesized that long-term shifts in P economics should result in the persistent suppression of P-acquiring extracellular enzymes when compared with ambient soils, as opposed to acclimation by the microbial community. Methods P availability was experimentally increased, either directly by addition of phosphate fertilizer or indirectly by raising soil pH with lime in relatively P rich (i.e., glaciated) and P poor (i.e., unglaciated) forest soils. Soil chemistry, phosphatase enzymes (phosphomonoesterase, PM and phosphodiesterase, PD), and microbial structure (PLFA analysis) were measured annually for six years. Results Since the start of the experiment, the microbial communities have become more distinct across treatments. PD enzyme activity was more responsive to the treatments than PM, especially in the glaciated elevated P treatment where ambient P availability was greatest. The treatments dramatically suppressed P-acquiring enzyme activity with no indication of acclimation. Conclusions These results suggest that the initial conditions and ambient nutrient supply of an ecosystem will have a strong influence on its response sensitivity to continuous nutrient enrichment.

AB 1. In forest fragments, microclimatic conditions differ between interior and forest edges and also vary with geographical orientation. These microclimatic variations could affect plant-insect food webs and the ecological processes in which they are involved.
   2. We evaluated the effects of microclimatic conditions, and the direct and indirect effects caused by changes in plant resources and leafminer abundance on leafminer herbivory and parasitism in the interior, and north and south-facing edges of Chaco Serrano forest fragments in central Argentina.
   3. In the interior, and north and south-facing edges of six forest fragments, we recorded: microclimatic variables, plant resource characteristics, leaf-mining larvae availability, and leafminer herbivory and parasitism at plant community level and in three species (Croton lachnostachyus, Cestrum parqui, and Solanum argentinum).
   4. Herbivory was higher in north-facing edges compared to south-facing edges, while parasitism was generally greater in edges than in the interior. Temperature fluctuations positively affected plant community herbivory (through changes in leafminer abundance) but negatively affected S. argentinum herbivory via changes in foliar area and leaf-mining larvae availability. Lower humidity levels directly favoured parasitism at plant community level, whereas higher thermal variations enhanced the parasitism of S. argentinum leafminers. Greater solar radiation favoured parasitism of C. lachnostachyus leafminers.
   5. Our results highlighted idiosyncrasy of each studied system (plant community and focal plant species), which responded differently to microclimate, and showed that mechanisms triggering herbivory and parasitism were different. The interior, and north and south-facing edges of these forest fragments may function as differential micro-refuges for herbivores and parasitoids under global warming context.

AB Although fires have occurred in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado) without human influence, current human activities are changing the fire regimes and negatively affects the vegetation resilience and recovery rates. Contrasting effects of fire on biodiversity and structure of vegetation in the Cerrado are dependent on fire frequency. Some anthropogenic fire regimes have increased fire frequency with shorter intervals between fires. However, the dynamics post-fire and the time needed for vegetation recovery are still poorly understood for the woody plants of Cerrado. We aimed to respond to two questions: Do the structure, floristic, and functional composition of woody species recover eight years post-fire? Do two consecutive fire events with seven years interval affect the floristic and structure of woody plants over time? We evaluated the woody dynamics in Cerrado savannas under three different fire regimes in central Brazil. We measured all trees and shrubs in 10 plots (totaling 1 ha) from 1997 to 2019 (22 years) and in 10 additional plots from 2008 to 2019 (11 years) in three areas: unburned area (fire exclusion for 30 years - fire regime 0), burned area 1 (one fire event in 2011 - fire regime 1), and burned area 2 (burned in 1998 and 2005 - fire regime 2). We analyzed the vegetation structure, floristic, and functional composition through multiple inventories to evaluate the vegetation recovery status. Density, basal area, and biomass increased similarly over time in the burned area 1 and the unburned area, showing that the woody vegetation parameters has recovered eight years after one fire event. Our results also showed that vegetation structure (i.e., density, basal area, and aboveground biomass) remained relatively constant between 2006 and 2013 (8 years after the occurrence of two fires). The data indicate growth only in the inventory after 14 years without fire.

AB Identification and conservation of genetic diversity within and among freshwater fish populations are important to better manage and conserve imperiled species. The Carolina Madtom Noturus furiosus is a small, nongame catfish that is endemic to the Tar and Neuse River basins of North Carolina. Genetic structure has not been studied in the species, and given recent population declines in both basins, identification of remaining genetic diversity within the species is vital for informing conservation efforts. To assess the status and trends of Carolina Madtom genetic structure, we analyzed genetic markers from 173 individuals to (1) define population genetic structure, (2) assess intra- and interbasin genetic differentiation in the Tar and Neuse River basins, and (3) present management implications to guide conservation efforts. Using 10 microsatellite primers developed for the related Yellowfin Madtom N. flavipinnis, we observed low genetic diversity in Carolina Madtoms. Genotype frequencies within samples were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with a deficit of heterozygotes that could be due to family structure, inbreeding, or segregation of null alleles. Mean (+/- SD) M-ratios for the Tar River (0.414 +/- 0.117) and Neuse River (0.117 +/- 0.102) basin collections indicated that both populations have experienced recent demographic bottlenecks, with that in the Neuse River basin population being more severe. Effective population size estimates for the respective populations were small, on the order of tens of individuals, driving low genetic diversity within populations. However, the multilocus population differentiation metrics GST ' (mean +/- SE = 0.135 +/- 0.031) and D-EST (0.125 +/- 0.029) were significantly different from zero (P < 0.001), indicating significant genetic differentiation between the Tar and Neuse River basin populations. Our findings will inform managers on the status of genetic variation in the Carolina Madtom and will guide conservation toward protective listing and management decisions to maintain the viability of this important endemic species.

TI P-31 NMR spectroscopy and structural models of soil organic phosphorus

DT Article
DE Soil organic phosphorus; DNA; Phosphate diesters; Phosphate monoesters;
   Tropical soils
AB Organic phosphorus (P-o) plays an important role in tropical forest nutrition on strongly-weathered soils. However, of its role in Eucalyptus nutrition little is known. For this purpose, soil P forms were determined by NaOH-Na(2)EDTA extraction and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) at 10 sites of Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. The objectives were (1) to determine the amounts and forms of soil P-o; (2) to build a structural model of the soil P cycle to provide quantitative estimates of the transformation processes of soil P. Soil P was found to consist of large amounts of Monoesters-P (on average 43.7 mg kg(-1)) followed by Diesters-P in the form of DNA (on average 4.2 mg kg(-1)), as well as containing high reserves of P-i species (on average 101.6 mg kg(-1) of the ortho-P; 2.7 mg kg(-1) of the pyrophosphate). Thestructural model indicated that the P cycle is regulated by clay, soil organic carbon, total P and pH. High total P-o concentrations (on average 48 mg kg(-1)) reveal a high potential of P supply to Eucalyptus trees, in which Diester-P (DNA) would be the main source P for the available P pool. The close interconnection between ortho-P, pyrophosphate, DNA and Monoester-P compounds provides evidence of a strong influence of soil biological activity on the distribution and accumulation of these P compounds and therefore on the availability of P. Thus, these results are relevant to establish soil fertility management strategies for low-fertilizer input Eucalyptus systems in soils with low fertility.

AB The charismatic trumpetfishes, goatfishes, dragonets, flying gurnards, seahorses, and pipefishes encompass a recently defined yet extraordinarily diverse Glade of percomorph fishes-the series Syngnatharia. This group is widely distributed in tropical and warm-temperate regions, with a great proportion of its extant diversity occurring in the Indo-Pacific. Because most syngnatharians feature long-range dispersal capabilities, tracing their biogeographic origins is challenging. Here, we applied an integrative phylogenomic approach to elucidate the evolutionary biogeography of syngnatharians. We built upon a recently published phylogenomic study that examined ultraconserved elements by adding 62 species (total 169 species) and one family (Draconettidae), to cover ca. 25% of the species diversity and all 10 families in the group. We inferred a set of time-calibrated trees and conducted ancestral range estimations. We also examined the sensitivity of these analyses to phylogenetic uncertainty (estimated from multiple genomic subsets), area delimitation, and biogeographic models that include or exclude the jump-dispersal parameter (j). Of the three factors examined, we found that the j parameter has the strongest effect in ancestral range estimates, followed by number of areas defined, and tree topology and divergence times. After accounting for these uncertainties, our results reveal that syngnatharians originated in the ancient Tethys Sea ca. 87 Ma (84-94 Ma; Late Cretaceous) and subsequently occupied the Indo-Pacific. Throughout syngnatharian history, multiple independent lineages colonized the eastern Pacific (6-8 times) and the Atlantic (6-14 times) from their center of origin, with most events taking place following an east-to-west route prior to the closure of the Tethys Seaway ca. 12-18 Ma. Ultimately, our study highlights the importance of accounting for different factors generating uncertainty in macroevolutionary and biogeographic inferences.

AB Fire-suppression is of concern in fire-prone ecosystems because it can result in the loss of endemic species. Suppressing fires also causes a build-up of flammable biomass, increasing the risk of severe fires. Using a Before-After, Control-Impacted design, we assessed the consequences of high-severity fires on Neotropical savanna arboreal ant communities. Over a 9-year period, we sampled the ant fauna of the same trees before and after two severe fires that hit a savanna reserve in Brazil and the trees from an unburned savanna site that served as a temporal control. The ant community associated with the unburned trees was relatively stable, with no significant temporal variation in species richness and only a few species changing in abundance over time. In contrast, we found a strong decline in species richness and marked changes in species composition in the burned trees, with some species becoming more prevalent and many becoming rare or locally extinct. The dissimilarity in species richness and composition was significantly smaller between the two pre-fire surveys than between the pre- and post-fire surveys. Fire-induced changes were much more marked among species with strictly arboreal nesting habits, and therefore more susceptible to the direct effects of fire. The decline of some of the ecologically dominant arboreal ant species may be particularly important, as it opens substantial ecological space for cascading community-wide changes. In particular, severe fires appear to disrupt the typical vertical stratification between the arboreal and ground-dwelling faunas, which might lead to homogenization of the overall ant community.

They play a key role in carbon sequestration capacity, mitigation against coastal erosion and as nursery grounds for many marine fish and invertebrates. However, despite these ecosystem functions and services, seagrass meadows are a threatened ecosystem worldwide. In the Baltic Sea, seagrass meadows have declined rapidly, mainly because of eutrophication, anthropogenic activities and climate change. This decline has the potential to erode the genetic variation and genetic structure of the species. In this study, we assessed how genetic variation and genetic differentiation vary among Zostera marina meadows and with a number of environmental characteristics in the county of Scania in southern Sweden. A total of 205 individuals sampled at 12 locations were analysed with 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Results showed that in spite of anthropogenic impacts and climate change pressures, locations of Z. marina possessed high genetic variation and weak genetic differentiation, with 3 major genetic clusters. Long-distance dispersal and/or stepping-stone dispersal was found among locations, with higher migration rates within the west coast. Organic matter, salinity and maximum depth appeared to be factors most strongly associated with the genetic structure and morphological variation of Z. marina. These findings contribute significantly in the identification of potential donor sites and the viability of impacted areas to recover from natural recruitment, for the development of effective transplantation measures of Z. marina in the southern Baltic Sea and temperate regions elsewhere.

AB The formation of annual growth rings is an imperative requirement for studying the dendroecological potential of plant species. Little is known about the distinctness of growth rings in the wood of desert plants in Africa, particularly in southern Mediterranean regions. To fill this knowledge gap, we collected and anatomically analyzed about 300 perennial desert plants from different areas in Egypt. Out of the 300 studied plant species, 94 species were identified as growth-ring forming plants. They belong to 78 genera and 33 families. Trees, shrubs/ subshrubs, and perennial or short-lived herbs are represented by 7, 55, and 32 species, respectively. Trees and shrubs represent 7.4% and 58.5% of the total, respectively. The distinctness of growth rings in these species was indicated either by the type of wood porosity, fibers, marginal parenchyma layers or by a mixture of these characteristics. Ring porosity, fiber layer, and parenchyma were the main indicators for growth-ring distinctness in 77.7%, 60.6%, and 33.0% of growth-ring forming plants, respectively. We conclude that some of the desert plants form distinct growth rings depending on site conditions, while precipitation is the main driver for its formation. Further studies on the annual rhythm of xylem formation are required to confirm the annual nature of growth rings and potential dendroecological use of these plants.

AB Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are amongst the major drivers of biodiversity loss globally. Although habitat fragmentation poses additional threats to biodiversity beyond habitat loss alone, the IUCN's Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) does not provide guidance on how to assess these threats. This study develops an approach for incorporating habitat fragmentation into the RLE threat assessment and investigates additional insights such an analysis could provide beyond the analysis of distribution trends. This is achieved by quantifying RLE criteria A and B (distribution reduction, restricted distribution and decline) and comparing outcomes with indices of habitat fragmentation (core area, Largest Patch Index, Patch Cohesion Index and Aggregation Index) in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Results revealed that much of the Cape Floristic Region is severely threatened by both landscape transformation and habitat fragmentation, but that treating the habitat fragmentation indices as additional RLE criteria did not alter the ecosystem threat assessment outcomes. Whilst this suggests that the existing RLE criteria implicitly account for habitat fragmentation, the relationship between fragmentation indices and RLE criteria were weak and highly variable in some cases, indicating that the RLE criteria alone do not sufficiently account for the threat of habitat fragmentation. Supplementing the RLE with habitat fragmentation measures highlights additional, unique information on threats to ecosystems. This simple approach has the potential to assist in setting conservation priorities and management goals, particularly in fragmented ecosystems.

TI Genetics of wild and mass-reared populations of a generalist aphid
   parasitoid and improvement of biological control
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HYMENOPTERA; BRACONIDAE; VIRULENCE; GENUS
AB Due to their ability to parasitize various insect species, generalist parasitoids are widely used as biological control agents. They can be mass-reared and released in agroecosystems to control several pest species in various crops. However, the existence of genetic differentiation among populations of generalist parasitoid species is increasingly recognized and this can be associated with an adaptation to local conditions or to a reduced range of host species. Moreover, constraints of mass-rearing conditions can alter genetic variation within parasitoid populations released. These features could be associated with a reduced efficiency of the control of targeted pest species. Here, we focused on strawberry greenhouses where the control of aphids with the generalist parasitoid Aphidius ervi appears to be inefficient. We investigated whether this inefficiency may have both genetic and ecological bases comparing wild and commercial populations of A. ervi. We used two complementary genetic approaches: one based on the mitochondrial marker COI and one based on microsatellite markers. COI analysis showed a genetic differentiation within the A. ervi species, but the structure was neither associated with the commercial/wild status nor with host species factors. On the other hand, using microsatellite markers, we showed a genetic differentiation between commercial and wild A. ervi populations associated with a loss of genetic diversity within the mass-reared populations. Our ecological genetics study may potentially explain the weak efficiency of biological control of aphids in protected strawberry crops and enable to provide some insights to improve biological control.

AB Endemic and relict species are often confined to ecological refugia or over fragmented distributions, representing priority conservation subjects. Within these sites, the individual population may realize distinct niches to a varying degree of specialization. An emblematic example is provided by freshwater species segregated in thermal-mineral springs, where individuals may face highly diverse microclimates in limited geographic areas. Downscaling the characterization of physiological traits to microclimatic niches becomes pivotal to adopt effective conservation measures in these heterogeneous habitats. Melanopsis etrusca (Brot, 1862) is an endangered relict snail endemic to a small number of thermal-mineral streams in central Italy. Here we describe the thermal tolerance of two populations of M. etrusca inhabiting streams with distinctly different thermal regimes, investigating the extent of physiological and behavioural specialization to such diverse microclimatic niches. The comparison of oxygen consumption rates of a population dwelling in temperate streams, characterized by seasonal temperature fluctuations (12-27 degrees C), with a population experiencing constantly hot water (35-38 degrees C) revealed the absence of any seasonal or geographic effect on metabolic compensation. Conversely, mobility performances were maximized in the population inhabiting the hot stream. Interestingly, here, the snails exhibited emersion behaviour outside the water, triggered by temperatures above 37 degrees C. In the field, individuals of this population are observed inactive on stream banks, conceivably to minimize the metabolic cost that otherwise would be induced by remaining in the hot water. Only a few individuals from the temperate stream exhibited the same behaviour when exposed to elevated temperatures, suggesting the exaptation of a preexisting trait during the evolutionary process of adaptation to hot waters. The present results provide elements for the best practice in future programmes aimed at reintroducing stocks of threatened species across heterogeneous habitats. Our study further underlines the relevance of downscaling data collection for endangered species conservation in order to recognize microclimatic specializations.

AB Fire is one of the main causes of environmental and ecosystem change. Geospatial data, derived from satellite images and surveying observations, are a useful tool in managing land use and land cover changes. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria-based geographical information system (GIS) for fire risk assessment and fire potential mapping in a peat swamp forest at Hua Sai district, Thailand. Fifty-five fire points in peat swamp areas were reported from 2012 to 2016. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and GIS methods were used synergistically to analyze the following contributing factors: elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, distance from river, distance from settlement and land use. The results of the present study indicate that the predicted fire risk areas from the methodology proposed are found to be in agreement with recorded past fire events. The fire risk map produced can be used for planning and management of wildland fire events in the future. GIS multi-criteria-based models have been developed in the context of fire prognosis; however, most of them attribute weights from simple pair-wise comparisons; we showcase that the integration of AHP provides accurate results for this study area in Thailand.

AB Biological sources of carbon sequestration such as revegetation have been highlighted as important avenues to combat climate change and meet global targets by the global community including the Paris Climate Agreement. However, current and projected carbon prices present a considerable barrier to broad-scale adoption of tree planting as a key mitigation strategy. One avenue to provide additional economic and environmental incentives to encourage wider adoption of revegetation is the bundling or stacking of additional co-beneficial ecosystem services that can be realized from tree planting. Using the World's largest land-based carbon credit trading scheme, the Australian Emissions Reduction Scheme (ERF), we examine the potential for three pairs of ecosystem services, where the carbon sequestration value of land use change is paired with an additional co-benefit with strong prospects for local tangible benefits to land owners/providers. Two cases consider agricultural provisioning values that can be realized by the landowners in higher returns: increased pollination services and reduced lamb mortality. The third case examined payments for tree plantings along riparian buffers, with payments to farmers by a water utility who realizes the benefit from reduced treatment cost due to water quality improvements. Economic incentives from these co-benefit case studies were found to be mixed, with avoided treatment costs from water quality paired with carbon payments the most promising, while pollination and reduced lamb mortality paired with carbon payments were unable to bridge the economic gap except under the most optimistic assumptions. We conclude that the economics case for significant land use change are likely to be geographically dispersed and only viable in relatively niche landscape positions in high establishment, high opportunity cost areas even when carbon payments are augmented with the value of co-benefits classified as providing direct and local benefits.

AB In southeast Australia, fire regimes are changing. Conserving species into the future under these changing fire regimes will require understanding their recruitment and growth dynamics following historical fires. Where monitoring is absent, dendroecology provides a tool for reconstructing and quantifying these dynamics. The use of dendroecology in southeast Australia has been limited due to presumptions that many of the species do not produce annual growth rings. In this study, we determined the dendroecological potential of a fire-sensitive understorey tree species, Pomaderris aspera, as a case study species, to explore the potential to use of understorey species to provide insights into past fire history. We used growth patterns of this species to understand the role of resource limitation on growth and senescence. We found that P. aspera had distinct growth rings and high within tree correlation when cross-dated. Recruitment events of this species aligned with three known fire events. We found that the impacts of historical fire on tree canopy cover could be estimated. P. aspera grew rapidly post fire and then become suppressed within 9-15 years. Cycles of growth release and suppression were found with increasing incidence of suppression occurring over time. Increased suppression and reduced growth rates aligned with patterns of recorded senescence over time in the understories of a maturing. Eucalyptus canopy. Our results highlight the potential to use dendroecology to confirm past fire extents and amount of canopy disturbances and the impacts that these events have on the recruitment and growth dynamics of understorey species in southeast Australia.

AB Ecological impacts of linear anthropogenic disturbances may be underestimated due to edge effects extending into adjacent forests. Seismic lines are the most pervasive linear disturbance associated with oil and gas development in the boreal forests of western North America. The width and orientation of seismic lines may influence microclimatic edge effects that could alter biotic responses, including tree recruitment. We examined light intensity, air temperature, relative humidity, and tree regeneration within seismic lines and adjacent forests to: (1) compare abiotic conditions between wide (6?8 m) and narrow (3?4 m) seismic lines; (2) quantify microclimatic edge effects of seismic lines of different widths and orientations; and (3) relate patterns in tree regeneration density to local patterns in the abiotic environment. We sampled interior forests and 24 seismic lines that were wide or narrow and orientated east-west or north-south in poor mesic ecosites of northeast Alberta, Canada. Microclimatic conditions in seismic line centres were generally intermediate between interior forest and well pads, with narrow seismic lines more similar to interior forest and wide seismic lines more similar to well pads. Light intensity on wide seismic line centres was at least 1.5 times higher than on narrow seismic line centres and up to 3.8 times higher than interior forest. Edge effects on light intensity extended up to 10 m into the forest adjacent to wide lines, but were restricted to the forest edge (at the interface) of narrow lines. Compared to interior forest, day temperature was up to 2.8 ?C and 0.8 ?C higher at edges of wide and narrow seismic lines, respectively. Relative humidity during the day was up to 7.3% and 3% lower at the edges of wide and narrow seismic lines, respectively, as compared to interior forest. At night, wide seismic line centres were up to 1.7 ?C cooler and up to 8.2% more humid than narrow seismic line centres. Tree regeneration was highest where light intensity was highest (the centre of wide north-south seismic lines) and a 10-fold increase in light intensity resulted in 5.8 times more regenerating trees. This study reveals that seismic line width and orientation affect abiotic factors within the linear disturbance and up to 10 m into the adjacent forest. Edge effects on the microclimate of seismic lines were most pronounced in wider seismic lines and along north (south-facing) forest edges. These findings provide a better understanding of the abiotic factors influencing biotic responses to linear anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Tree planting is a common strategy for forest restoration. The use of mid- and late-successional species is less common, but could accelerate succession, enhance diversity and secure their presence. In this study, we determined the survival and growth of 559 saplings from nine native mid- and late-successional species after three years of growth under a range of habitat conditions to evaluate their potential utility in restoration plantings. Since mid- and late-successional tree species have shade-tolerant attributes and the light environment is a determinant factor for their growth and survival, we expected sapling performance to vary among species depending on the percentage of canopy cover and on factors associated with this variable. For this, we identified habitat conditions that influenced sapling performance in a degraded tropical cloud forest: the conditions ranged from closed-canopy secondary forest to open pastures dominated by exotic grasses. Overall, the studied species presented a high performance: sapling survival (40 to 90%) and relative growth rates in height (0.14 to 0.50 cm cm-1 year-1) and in diameter (0.04 to 0.50 mm mm-1 year-1) were within or above the ranges previously reported for cloud forest species. The final sizes and growth rates in height and diameter were mostly explained by the canopy and grass cover (71.5% of the variation). Integrated Response Index (IRI) values showed wide variation among species (from 6.44 to 41.41 with inclusion of height, and from 2.13 to 44.77 with inclusion of diameter). In general, there was a negative correlation between canopy cover and final sapling size and growth rates in height and diameter, but there were important variations among species. Based on their IRI values, species such as Ulmus mexicana and Oreomunnea mexicana are suggested for restoration plantings. Given their low performance, however, Fraxinu uhdei and Juglans pyriformis are recommended for use only in advanced forest successional stages or in conjunction with other restoration techniques to increase their survival. Our results show that these threatened mid- and late-successional native species can be successfully matched to microsite conditions and established in degraded areas as a strategy by which to secure their presence and accelerate forest recovery.

AB Planting eucalypt stands in the Iberian Peninsula is controversial. In Galicia (NW Spain) the area covered by eucalypts and the intensity of eucalypt timber harvesting are among the highest in Europe. In this region, management plans for forest resources are intended for relatively homogeneous territorial units, smaller than the province, called forest districts (ForDis). The status of eucalypt plantations in ForDis is usually assumed to be highly variable, although this has not yet been quantified. Within this framework, the present study aimed to integrate an existing Eucalyptus globulus distribution model for current conditions and two different climate change scenarios with current forest cover (including eucalypt plantations) to provide quantitative and spatiallyexplicit information for identifying ForDis where eucalypt plantations may become problematic. Four parameters (suitability, importance, potential expansion and fragmentation) comprising 13 related indicators were calculated for eucalypt plantations in each of the 19 ForDis in the region. The findings show that more than 44% of the afforested area is covered by eucalypts in the province of A Corun?a and in forest districts VI and XVIII (in Lugo and Pontevedra, respectively). A huge continuous patch of eucalypt, of more than 35,000 ha, was detected across two ForDis (I and VI). The potentially high ecological and financial risks associated with this vast area of monoculture would negatively affect the sustainability and multifunctionality of these forest ecosystems. Analysis of the expected suitability of areas for E. globulus in forthcoming climate change scenarios identified four inland ForDis (IX, X in Lugo, XVI in Pontevedra and XI in Ourense) where an important increase in cover by this species may occur if no action is taken. Moreover, these areas overlap with the large ongoing expansion already observed for the more productive and frost-resistant E. nitens. The findings also revealed edge-dominated native broadleaved forest patches in the habitat suitable for E. globulus in the provinces of A Corun?a and Lugo. Although the current level of occupancy of eucalypt within natural protected areas (NPAs) is moderate, the suitability of these areas for eucalypt plantations will increase in the predicted climate change scenario, possibly leading to aggravation of potential conflicts in these biodiversity hotspots. Regional forest agencies should therefore increase monitoring efforts to prevent further impacts on native forest and natural protected areas.
   The proposed quantitative indicators and methodology used are intended to be useful for forest planners and policy decision-makers in other regions where current and future conflicts related to exotic tree plantations are expected.

AB Much evidence suggests that Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest were connected through at least three dispersion routes in the past: the Eastern route, the central route, and the Western route. However, few studies have assessed the use of these routes based on multiple species. Here we present a compilation of mammal species that potentially have dispersed between the two forest regions and which may serve to investigate these connections. We evaluate the present-day geographic distributions of mammals occurring in both Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest and the likely connective routes between these forests. We classified the species per habitat occupancy (strict forest specialists, species that prefer forest habitat, or generalists) and compiled the genetic data available for each species. We found 127 mammalian species presently occurring in both Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest for which, substantial genetic data was available. Hence, highlighting their potential for phylogeographic studies investigating the past connections between the two forests. Differently from what was previously proposed, the present-day geographic distribution of mammal species found in both Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest points to more species in the eastern portion of the dry diagonal (and adjoining forested habitats). The Central route was associated with the second most species. Although it remains to be seen how this present-day geography reflects the paleo dispersal routes, our results show the potential of using mammal species to investigate and bring new insights about the past connections between Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest.

AB Background and Aims Aridity is increasing in many regions of the world, but microclimatic conditions may buffer plant communities from the direct effects of decreased precipitation, creating habitat islands. However, reduced precipitation can also impact these communities indirectly by decreasing the suitability of the surrounding habitat, thus limiting incoming propagules and increasing the chances of population decline and species loss. We test whether decreased precipitation results in loss of species and functional diversity within habitat islands, evaluating in particular whether declines in species diversity and abundance are less likely to result in loss of functional diversity if species/individual loss is stochastic (i.e. independent of species/individual traits) and communities/populations are functionally redundant.
   Methods Lomas communities are discrete plant communities embedded in the Atacama Desert, maintained by the microclimatic conditions created by fog. We recorded species and functional diversity in six Lomas communities along a 500 km long precipitation gradient in northern Chile. Functional traits were measured in 20 individuals per species, in those species that accounted for approx. 75 % of the abundance at each site. We calculated functional diversity and functional redundancy of the community, and intraspecific functional variation.
   Key Results Decreased precipitation was associated with lower species diversity and lower species abundances. However, no traits or functional strategies increased or decreased consistently with precipitation, suggesting stochastic species/individual loss. Species with stress-tolerant strategies were predominant in all sites. Although species diversity decreased with decreasing precipitation, functional diversity remained unchanged. Lower functional redundancy in the drier sites suggests that mainly functionally redundant species were lost. Likewise, intraspecific functional variation was similar among communities, despite the lower species abundance in drier sites.
   Conclusions Decreased precipitation can impact habitat island communities indirectly by decreasing the suitability of the surrounding habitat. Our results support the idea that a stochastic loss of species/individuals from functionally redundant communities and populations does not result in loss of functional diversity.

Though habitat edges frequently are implicated in reduced faunal survival and biodiversity, results of experiments on edge effects have been inconsistent, calling for a mechanistic approach to the study of edges that explicitly includes indirect and interactive effects of habitat alteration at multiple scales across biogeographic gradients. We used an experimental network spanning 17 eelgrass (Zostera marina) sites across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and the Mediterranean Sea to determine (1) if eelgrass edges consistently increase faunal predation risk, (2) whether edge effects on predation risk are altered by habitat degradation (shoot thinning), and (3) whether variation in the strength of edge effects among sites can be explained by biogeographical variability in covarying eelgrass habitat features. Contrary to expectations, at most sites, predation risk for tethered crustaceans (crabs or shrimps) was lower along patch edges than in patch interiors, regardless of the extent of habitat degradation. However, the extent to which edges reduced predation risk, compared to the patch interior, was correlated with the extent to which edges supported higher eelgrass structural complexity and prey biomass compared to patch interiors. This suggests an indirect component to edge effects in which the impact of edge proximity on predation risk is mediated by the effect of edges on other key biotic factors. Our results suggest that studies on edge effects should consider structural characteristics of patch edges, which may vary geographically, and multiple ways that humans degrade habitats.

AB Indirect approaches such as Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDP) aspire to combat biodiversity loss. Unfortunately, with increasing cases of failure, the link between poverty alleviation and conservation is now controversial. We revisited the earliest ICDP project in China after 12 years. The project area experienced increasing free-ranging livestock after 2004, which degraded the panda habitat. We collected livestock and socio-economic data using constructed household surveys and applied logit and zero-truncated Poisson models to understand the effect of ICDP. About 76% of livestock activities were in the panda habitat. Receipt of ICDP funds increased the chance of a household to become a livestock owner. The participation in ICDP also increased the numbers of both the traditional livestock - cattle by 83% - as well as the emerging type horses by 203%. Horses were encouraged for tourism and later raised for meat production. The income from alternative livelihoods such as tourism and off-farm jobs reduced the reliance on cattle but encouraged having more horses. Our results show that with the ban on logging and reduced cropland, assistance from ICDP facilitated the participants to accumulate wealth much quicker than others and to increase their livestock holdings. The immediate success in reducing reliance on certain natural resources and the community development of the short-duration projects could fail the long-term goals of conserving the endangered species habitat. Future conservation projects should either establish long-term mechanisms such as conditionality for incentives or create self-interests in conservation among the communities to cope with unexpected threats in the future.

TI Green Care as Alternative Therapy: The Situation in Ghana
SO EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID BIODIVERSITY; BENEFITS
AB Green care, an alternative healthcare system that involves the use of nature, is proven to be useful in the management of organic and psychological disorders worldwide. There are various forms of Green care including Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT), a type where animals play pivotal roles in the healing process and is widely used in many developed countries. We assessed the level of awareness and attitude towards Green care among medical students of Ghana. Using a cross-sectional study design and a semistructured questionnaire designed on Google Forms, data were collected from randomly selected 4(th)-, 5(th)-, and 6(th)-year medical students of the University for Development Studies, Tamale, Ghana. The data submitted by 206 of the students were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Version 25, and the results were presented as frequencies, percentages, and charts. The association between sociodemographic characteristics of respondents and awareness about Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) was considered significant at p<0.05. The study found that only 7 (3.4%) of the medical students had ever heard of Green care while a higher number of 36 (17.5%) were aware of AAT mostly through movies and television. However, the majority, 122 (59.3%), had a positive attitude towards the introduction of AAT, into their medical training curriculum. Up to 146 (70.9%) of the respondents suggested lectures and practical sessions as their preferred way of acquiring knowledge and skills on AAT. Only the sex of the respondents was significantly associated with awareness of AAT, with females having a better awareness of AAT (28.6% vs. 11.0%, p=0.003). We conclude that awareness of Green care practices among medical students in Ghana was highly inadequate, but the desire of the majority of them to acquire knowledge and skills in this proven alternative therapy makes its future use in Ghana promising.

AB Ecosystem service (ES) flow reveals the transregional benefits transferred from service supply areas (SSAs) to service benefiting areas (SBAs), which correspond to the sellers and buyers of interregional ecological compensation, respectively. However, current ecological compensation policies usually ignore this close connection. This study took the water supply services (WSSs) with the most obvious flow characteristics as an example and established a universal framework for interregional ecological compensation by combining WSSs flow simulation and regional disparity. The simulation process was programmed with Interactive Data Language (IDL) and analyzed with ArcGIS. Most regions serve as a dual role in the WSSs flow process, the water suppliers and users are relative and scale-dependent. Taking Ningxia as an example, As water benefiting areas (WBAs)/buyers, the total material inflow to Ningxia was 135.86 x 10(8) similar to 294.22 x 10(8) m(3) from 2000 to 2015 and the value inflow ranged from 1077.39 x 10(8) similar to 2333.16 x 10(8) CNY, requiring 101.64 x 10(8) similar to 293.51 x 10(8) CNY ecological compensation paid by Ningxia. As water supply areas (WSAs)/sellers, the total material outflow from Ningxia was 72.83 x 10(8) similar to 200.46 x 10(8) m(3) from 2000 to 2015, and the value outflow was between 577.54 x 10(8) CNY and 1589.65 x 10(8) CNY, requiring 63.80 x 10(8) similar to 112.34 x 10(8) CNY of ecological compensation to be paid by the downstream basins, especially the Shizuishan - Hekou Town subbasin. Overall, Ningxia was a beneficiary area of WSSs flow and the payers of interregional ecological compensation, with a net payment amount of 37.84 x 10(8) similar to 181.16 x 10(8) CNY. This study provides a direct spatial-visualized reference to water resource management for policy-makers and promotes the integration of ES flow and interregional ecological compensation. Furthermore, it can improve the public recognition of interregional ecological compensation with the spatial mapping of the levy and allocation and conducive to the sustainable provisioning of ESs ultimately.

AB The riverine barrier hypothesis (RBH) posits that rivers comprise geographical barriers to gene flow for terrestrial organisms, thus promoting genetic differentiation between populations. Here, we explored the RBH on larviparous and pueriparous populations of the live-bearing fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). While larviparous fire salamanders exhibit a semi-aquatic life cycle (females deposit pre-metamorphic larvae on water), pueriparous salamanders present a fully terrestrial life cycle (females deliver terrestrial juveniles) and, therefore, a greater independence from water for survival and reproduction. We performed a fine-scale sampling of opposite transects in 11 rivers (six and five for larviparous and pueriparous populations, respectively) to test the hypothesis that rivers are more effective barriers for pueriparous salamanders due to their terrestrial life cycle. We carried out individual- and population-based genetic analyses using 14 microsatellites and a mitochondrial marker to examine the extent to which rivers hinder short- and long-term gene flow. We found that rivers are semi-permeable obstacles for both larviparous and pueriparous salamanders, although they appear to be more effective barriers for the latter when rivers with similar attributes are compared. We also found that river width and possibly the presence of crossing structures may influence the genetic barrier effects of rivers in fire salamanders. This is one of the very few studies in amphibians showing how different reproductive strategies influence the barrier effects imposed by rivers.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance and fragmentation have changed the structure and composition of northern Ethiopian forests. This study was conducted to determine disturbance levels of patches, and examine the effect of anthropogenic disturbance and fragment size on diversity and structural attributes of woody species. A systematic sampling method was used to collect data and 61 nested plots of each 400 m(2) were used. The disturbance index was used to assess disturbance intensities. To examine the effects of fragment size and anthropogenic disturbances on woody species diversity and structure, regression analysis was performed. ANOVA was used to examine differences in woody species diversity and structural attributes among fragments. Similarities among patches were assessed by Sorensen's similarity index. A total of 80 woody species, representing 68 genera and 43 families were recorded. Diversity, evenness, stem density ha(-1), and basal area were 2.8 +/- 0.47, 0.73 +/- 1.10, 1171.21 +/- 220.10, and 39.89 +/- 17.47 m(2) ha(-1) respectively. The mean number of species, evenness, and diversity were significantly different among fragments. Diversity, evenness, the mean number of species, and stem density per hectare significantly increased with increasing fragment size. Disturbance intensities varied among fragments. However, the mean basal area, mean seedling, and sapling density per hectare were not significantly affected by patch size and disturbance intensities. Generally, forest fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbance resulted in the reduction of diversity, affect woody species structure, and increased the level of disturbance. Therefore, recognizing the role of small fragments for forest conservation, minimizing further disturbance, and undertaking restoration activities in disturbed patches are strongly needed.

SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY

AB Geographical distribution and diversity of current plant species have been strongly shaped by climatic oscillations during the Quaternary. Analysing the resulting divergence among species and differentiation within species is crucial to understand the evolution of taxa like the Vitis genus, which provides very useful genetic resources for grapevine improvement and might reveal original recolonization patterns due to growth habit and dispersal mode. Here, we studied the genetic structure in natural populations of three species from eastern North America: Vitis aestivalis, V. cinerea and V. riparia using different marker types. Vitis aestivalis and V. cinerea showed higher diversity than V. riparia. The two former species are less differentiated, confirming an earlier divergence of V. riparia. V. aestivalis and V. riparia exhibited different genetic groups on both sides of the Appalachian Mountains that could mirror different recolonization routes from southern refugia. Genetic structure was stronger in V. cinerea, for which two varieties (var. berlandieri and var. cinerea) are morphologically recognized. Our results confirm this distinction and suggest the existence of three other lineages within var. cinerea. These discontinuities appear linked to adaptation of var. berlandieri to dry and limy areas of Texas and partially to the Mississippi River Valley. Rapid range expansions from refugia upon climate warming are also suggested by the low linkage disequilibrium values observed. Furthermore, large variation for downy mildew resistance was observed in the three species. Our findings appeared consistent with the vegetation history of eastern North America.

TI Testing for functional significance of traits: Effect of the light
   environment in tropical tree saplings
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Central Amazon; functional traits; growth; intraspecific variation;
   irradiance; photosynthesis; plant strategies
AB Functional traits have been examined to explain the growth rates of forest communities in different sites. However, weak or nonexistent relations are often found, especially due to the following methodological aspects: 1) lack of an environmental context (e.g., light, water, or nutrient supply), 2) use of nonfunctional traits, 3) an approach that does not contemplate phenotypic integration, and 4) neglect of intraspecific variation.
   Here we measured relative growth rates, crown, and leaf traits in saplings of six tropical tree species growing in two light environments (Gap and Understory) to test whether contrasting light environments modulates trait-trait and trait-growth relationships. Moreover, we tested whether models that integrate traits of different dimensions of the plant (crown and leaf) improve the strength of trait-growth relations.
   Light availability changed both trait-trait and trait-growth relationships. Overall, in Understory, crown traits (crown length and total leaf area) have a stronger effect on growth rates, while physiological traits related to nutrient acquisition (nitrogen concentration), photochemical efficiency (chlorophyll pigments and chlorophyll a fluorescence), and biochemical efficiency (potassium use efficiency) are strong in Gap. Models including multiple traits explained growth rates better in Gap (up to 62%) and Understory (up to 47%), but just in Gap the best model comprises traits that are representative of different dimensions of the plant.
   Synthesis. We advanced the knowledge behind the light effects on tree sapling by posit that trait-trait and trait-growth relationships vary across light environments. Therefore, light availability is a key environmental factor to be considered when choosing the set of traits to be measured in functional approach studies using tropical tree saplings. In compliance with the phenotype integration hypothesis, functional traits are better predictors of growth rates when grouped in a set of traits of different dimensions of the plant that represent different functional mechanisms.

AB Aim Convergence, stasis and plasticity can frequently confound our understanding of species distributions in the seas. Yet delimiting species and understanding population connectivity across marine environments is mandatory for establishing appropriate management of coral reefs, which are experiencing critical declines. We test whether morphospecies from Pocillopora corals found on outer reef slopes are unique species or species complexes, in order to correctly define their respective distributions and consequently to accurately assess their population connectivity.
   Location Archipelagos and islands of the Western Indian Ocean and the Southern Pacific (New Caledonia, Tonga, French Polynesia).
   Taxon Pocillopora eydouxi/meandrina and Pocillopora verrucosa morphospecies (Scleractinia).
   Methods We analysed the 13-microsatellite genotypes of 4837 colonies from six understudied ecoregions in the southern part of the genus distribution, to first explore the genetic partitioning within morphospecies. We then characterized the spatial distribution of each delimited species and analysed patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity for each species separately.
   Results Both morphospecies are complexes of species, each found almost exclusively in the Indian or the Pacific Oceans. Moreover, some of these cryptic species are found in sympatry over their whole distribution, which sometimes was very restricted. However, within each species, genetic diversity and connectivity were relatively high, although some populations were found differentiated for some species, while not for others.
   Main conclusions A weak connectivity was found between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but high connectivity within both oceans, supporting the existence of a barrier impeding gene flow between both ocean basins in Pocillopora. Although constrained by the same geography and current patterns, some sympatric species present different connectivity patterns, demonstrating the importance of multi-species connectivity models to set up appropriate management plans.

AB The Mexican state of Veracruz has suffered very high deforestation rates in the last few decades, and despite the establishment of protected areas and conservation projects, primary forest is now mainly persisting in mostly small, scattered, fragmented remnants. New species of Magnolia section Talauma in this state have been described with little to no reference to the already existing ones, potentially resulting in over-splitting, obscuring their taxonomic delineation and conservation status, and consequently conservation programs. To study the conservation units and their genetic diversity, we here employ 15 microsatellite markers on a highly representative sampling of 254 individuals of what are presumed to be five Magnolia species. The results support at least three species and maximum five main conservation units. We propose downgrading the latter to four, given morphological, ecological, demographical, and geographical considerations. Two out of the three sympatrically occurring species in the rainforest in the Los Tuxtlas volcanic area have weak genetic evidence to be considered separate species. Similarly, the individuals in the Sierra de Zongolica in central Veracruz, who bear a very high morphological and genetic similarity to Magnolia mexicana, have weak genetic evidence to be recognised as a separate species. Nonetheless, the individuals could be identified as Magnolia decastroi based on morphology, and further research including the full range of this species is recommended.

AB The impact of the broad disjunction between Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest on biodiversity has been the theme of several discussions in recent decades. Here, we evaluate the effects of dependence on humid environments and the role of historical factors on the level, distribution and structuring of genetic variation in widely distributed Neotropical insects. For such, we test whether climatically stable zones (i.e. refuges) in both Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest concentrate higher genetic diversity in the social paper wasps Angiopolybia pallens and Synoeca surinama. We found that historical events have avoided the interchange of A. pallens between both rainforests at least since the Early Pliocene and that ancient colonization in north-western Amazonia and the Bahia refuge significantly predicts genetic diversity in populations of this species. Conversely, the split between the Atlantic Forest and remaining western populations of S. surinama is more recent (Plio-Pleistocene); this species has considerably lower genetic diversity than A. pallens and such diversity is mostly concentrated in Amazonia and in the cerrado biome (savanna) than in the Atlantic Forest. Finally, we propose that the occurrence of species that exhibit such distribution patterns should be taken into consideration when establishing areas for conservation.

AB Prosopis chilensis (Molina) Stuntz (Leguminosae) is a valuable native species in Argentina included in the Prosopis Management Programme. Natural provenances show important height and shape differentiation throughout their distribution in the Monte Desert. The availability of progenytrials provides an opportunityto quantify genetic differentiation among provenances and test the relative importance of demographic vs adaptive processes on morphological variation. We quantified both genetic and quantitative differentiation of neutral markers and five economically important traits, respectively, among four provenances in a provenance-progeny trial. We aimed to quantify the genetic basis of variations in height, basal diameter, tree shape, spine Length and biomass. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) economically important traits have significant heritability, and (2) the phenotypic variation among provenances is the result of Local adaptation to particular environmental conditions. Our results indicate that most morphological variation was found among individuals within families (similar to 95 per cent). The h(2) estimates were heterogeneous among traits and ranged from Low (0 for number of stems) to moderate (0.22 and 0.28 for spine Length and biomass, respectively). Variance among families (similar to 5 per cent) was evenly distributed within and among provenances. Morphological differentiation among provenances was Low, but significant, and could be attributed mainly to individuals from Villa UniOn. Based on molecular markers, genetic differentiation among provenances was Low and significant (F-ST = 0.03; P = 5 x 10(-4)) but was able to differentiate the groups from Villa UniOn, Fiambala and Mogna-Chilecito. Neutrality tests were conducted using the FST-QST test and D-JSOST and delta(GREGORIUS) alternative coefficients of differentiation. Neutrality tests yielded no evidence of Local adaptation and were rather consistent in showing a trend toward stabilizing selection, particularly for spine Length. The selection strategy for breeding programmes should depend on the trait to be improved and should consider both provenance and familiar information. Considering an intra-familiar ranking is encouraged in order to maximize the genetic gain. Additionally, in order to recover germplasm provenance diversity, based on morphological and microsatellite results, our recommendation would be to include seeds from individuals from at Least the Villa UniOn, Fiambala and Mogna-Chilecito areas.

AB Forests are already and will continue to experience a rapid and extreme change in climatic conditions in the future. The distributions of forests are expected to shift northward and to higher altitudes based on the results of species distribution modelling (SDM). Although SDM is criticized for lack of biotic interactions and natural migration mechanisms, it is still an important tool for understanding the influence of climate change on forest distributions at a landscape scale. We hypothesize that based on extant forest cover, distribution of protected areas and understanding on seed dispersal mechanisms, the suitable range of forest tree species will decline, and certain species might be driven to extinction in the absence of suitable space for migrations in a rapidly changing climate. To assess this scenario, we modelled the current and future potential distribution of 18 Castanopsis species in Asia using MaxENT. Mild (RCP-4.5) and severe (RCP-8.5) climate change sce-narios from 17 climate change models were assessed. Three groups of current Castanopsis distribution were identified and they responded differently under climate change. One-third of the species will experience potential range reductions while two-third will have potential range expansions. However, when we overlaid the results with forest cover and protected area coverage, range expansions are unlikely to happen due to fragmented forest cover and lack of efficient seed dispersal mechanisms. Natural species migrations and local adaptation are not likely to happen for Castanopsis and therefore immediate adaptive strategies should be considered in forest management. This situation was particularly severe in the marginal tropical zones across coastal South China and the Northern Indo-China region.

AB Aims Screening tree species in tropical rainforest according to their shade tolerance is important to efficiently manage the native trees of economic significance in secondary forest enrichment regimes. The objective of this study was to determine the whole-plant light compensation point (WPLCP) and compare the phenotypic plasticity in relation to growth and carbon allocation of Cariniana legalis and Gallesia integrifolia seedlings under low light availability.
   Methods Seedlings were cultivated for 77 days under conditions of five photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (0.02, 1.1, 2.3, 4.5 and 5.9 mol photons m(-2) day(-1)) in three replicates. Growth and carbon allocation variables were determined.
   Important Findings Growth rates of C. legalis were higher and lower than those of G. integrifolia under 1.1 and 5.9 mol photons m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The WPLCP differed significantly between the two species. In accordance with the criteria of the shade tolerance classification for these two tropical tree species, our results showed that C. legalis had lower WPLCP and phenotypic plasticity in terms of higher growth rates and greater shade tolerance than G. integrifolia. From a practical point of view, we demonstrated that the differential linkage between growth and changing PAR between the two species can become a useful tool for comparing and selecting tree species in forest enrichment projects.

AB Introduction: Multiple studies have been carried out in forests affected by hurricanes, but the information obtained for Costa Rica is scarce or null, in the case of direct impacts such as Otto, so it is necessary to expand the existing knowledge about the effects of these phenomena on tropical forests and the recovery mechanisms of these biomes. Consequently, it is necessary to identify the vulnerability of ecosystems in long term and quantify the losses that are generated at different scales, as a result of the intense events of rain and strong winds. Objective: Determining behavior and recovery status in a secondary forest directly affected by Hurricane Otto in Boca Tapada, Pital, San Carlos, Costa Rica. Methods: Ten 20 x 50 m sampling units were systematically distributed within a secondary forest affected by Hurricane Otto in Boca Tapada, San Carlos. The current condition of the forest was evaluated, the species that received the most damage due to high winds were identified, as well as those that have the capacity to recover through regrowths. An overflight was carried out with an unmanned aerial vehicle and an orthomosaic was constructed, subsequently digitized, and classified according to the state of the forest cover presented in three evaluated moments, initial condition, after logging and the condition at the time of sampling. Population density, diversity, and basal area, were compared to data obtained in an adjacent primary forest also affected by the passage of Hurricane Otto. Results: It was obtained that 69.5 % of individuals with d >= 5 cm are in good condition, 20.3 % were broken in the tree canopy and 12.7% inclined without exposure of the roots. The family that provided the greatest species richness is Fabaceae, which is the same with the greatest abundance of damaged individuals and the one with the highest number of species with the ability to resprouting. The species that suffered the most damage was Couma macrocarpa (Euphorbiaceae). The initial area of forest cover was reduced by 7.63 % due to logging and 44.25 % due to Hurricane Otto. It was determined that there are significant differences in species diversity (P = 0.0004; alpha = 0.05) and in the density of individuals (P = 0.0011; alpha = 0.05). The secondary forest has the highest average in both cases. There are no significant differences in the values of the basal area (P = 0.6951; alpha = 0.05). Conclusions: 30.5 % of the forest mass was affected by the passage of Hurricane Otto and the Fabaceae family plays an important role in forest recovery. In addition, forest harvesting in a forest can increase the risk of being affected by the passage of hurricanes and the secondary forest has a greater diversity of species and a higher density of individuals than the primary forest.

AB Planting tree monocultures in Brazilian savannas is a common practice for wood production. However, afforestation and fire suppression have caused significant ecological changes and biodiversity loss in the Cerrado region. Restoring these modified systems to their pre-plantation states remains a considerable challenge. In this study, we compared the recovery of savanna vegetation after afforestation in areas managed with three restoration strategies: (i) old pine plantation stands that are not managed anymore (control), (ii) passive restoration (natural regeneration after pine clearcutting), and (iii) native tree planting (native tree seedlings planted at high density after pine clearcutting). To compare the outcome of each strategy to native ecosystems that were never plantations, we sampled a cerrado sensu stricto (the desired restoration target), and a cerradao (the local alternative state when savannas are fire-suppressed). Fifteen years after applying the restoration approaches, we assessed the structure, richness, and composition of the plant communities. For the analyses, we separated the upper layer (woody native species, diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm) and ground layer (woody species with height >= 50 cm and DBH < 5 cm, and subshrubs and herbs), and distinguished savanna species from forest and generalist species. The results showed that both passive restoration and native tree planting restored the structure, richness, and composition of the upper layer, reaching the values of the cerrado sensu stricto. In contrast, in all treatments, the ground layer lacked the subshrubs and herbs typical of undisturbed savannas, with communities appearing similar to cerradao. Generalist species dominated all layers, and tree canopy cover in the treatments (mean values from 64.7% to 83.0%) ranged from 2.4 to 3 times the cover value recorded in the cerrado sensu stricto (mean of 28%). Pine clearcutting, independent of whether it was followed by native tree planting, improved the recovery of savanna woody vegetation. Therefore, we suggest that pine clearcutting, but not tree planting, is necessary to restore the woody community. Despite these apparently positive restoration outcomes for the woody plant community, it is important to note that after 15 years of passive restoration, communities are turning into low-diversity forests composed of generalist species and lacking savanna species in the ground-layer community. We therefore suggest that restoration of cerrado sensu stricto after pine clearcutting will require controlling woody encroachment, via prescribed fire or mechanical tree thinning, and planting of savanna subshrubs and herbs, rather than trees.

AB Considering the globalization of forest land use and the influence of China?s socio-economic process on forest resources, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of China?s forest land use change in the globalized world economy during 2000?2011, by means of embodiment accounting based on EXIOBASE3 database. External demand, primarily from USA, EU, Japan and rest of Asia-Pacific, accounts for 20-45% of China?s direct forest land use, meanwhile, increasing forest land use (50-60%) is displaced abroad, mainly to Russia (20-30%), America, Africa and rest of Asia-Pacific. Overall, China is a net importer of virtual forest land use due to large imports through forest products (e.g., wood, paper and pulp), while highly-processed non-forest products also contribute a dominant and increasing share in total exports. Consequently, in the trade with USA, Japan and many European countries, China is the net exporter of virtual forest land use, though it is the net importer of forest products as revealed by conventional monetary trade accounting, highlighting the necessity of the in-clusive embodiment accounting to trace land use to actual final products. Regarding final consumption, virtual forest land use of rural households only reaches 65?75% that of urban households, due to large disparities in the consumption of non-forest products. Per capita virtual forest land use of the rural and urban poorest groups are only 1/5 and 1/6 of the nation?s richest group, respectively. Therefore, transnational cooperation is required to promote sustainable forest management worldwide. China should also prepare for growing demand for forest land and reduce associated environmental inequality in the process of urbanization and poverty alleviation.

AB During a taxonomic and phylogenetic study of Xylopia from the Amazon River basin, South America, we examined collections from the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Para, Rondonia, and Tocantins that resembled Xylopia nitida by some characteristics of the leaves, but differed consistently from the latter in a number of floral and fruit characters. On the basis of these specimens we describe here a new species, Xylopia maasiana. The new species is a small to medium-sized tree encountered mostly in riparian habitats across the southern Brazilian Amazon and in some transition areas between the Amazon forest and cerrado biomes in Central Brazil.

AB Rainforest revegetation projects often deliver suboptimal outcomes due to the recolonization of invasive pasture grasses, but little is known about the effects of grass reinvasion on the survival and growth of established saplings. Even less is known about the costs and benefits of controlling pasture grasses once they have reinvaded. To address these knowledge gaps, we implemented a split-plot grass control experiment in a 2-year old subtropical rainforest restoration planting in South East Queensland, Australia, that was reinvaded by the exotic pasture grass Chloris gayana. Grass removal involved brush cutting around saplings, spraying herbicide and then laying 1 m(2) jute matting. The costs of implementing the treatment were recorded, and the survival, growth and physiological stress of treated and control saplings were monitored for 1 year. Non-target herbicide application reduced survival by 6.5% in treated saplings, affecting mainly smaller plants that were below the grass canopy at the onset of the experiment. Beyond this direct herbicide effect, smaller treated saplings were also more stressed (lower chlorophyll fluorescence) and had substantially lower survival after 1 year than untreated saplings of the same size. There was limited evidence that removing grass increased growth rates, even for saplings that were already taller than the grass canopy at the start of the experiment. While the growth benefits of controlling grass may become more apparent with time, our results suggest that grass removal is not an effective management strategy in untended plantings due to the heightened risk of sapling mortality, coupled with the considerable labour and material costs.

AB Nineteen red deer areas in a densely populated region with a huge network of fenced motorways and the division into administrative management units (AMUs) with restricted ecological connectivity were investigated. In the season 2018/2019, a total of 1291 red deer samples (on average 68 per area) were collected and genotyped using 16 microsatellite markers. The results show a clear genetic differentiation between most of the AMUs. Fourteen AMUs may be combined into four regions with a considerable internal genetic exchange. Five areas were largely isolated or showed only a limited gene flow with neighbouring areas. Ten of the 19 AMUs had an effective population size below 100. Effective population sizes greater than 500-1000, required to maintain the evolutionary potential and a long-term adaptation potential, were not achieved by any of the studied AMUs, even when AMUs with an appreciable genetic exchange were aggregated. Substantial genetic differentiation between areas can be associated with the presence of landscape barriers hindering gene flow, but also with the maintenance of 'red deer-free' areas. Efforts to sustainably preserve the genetic diversity of the entire region should therefore focus on measures ensuring genetic connectivity. Opportunities for this goal arise from the establishment of game bridges over motorways and from the protection of young male stags migrating through the statutory 'red deer-free' areas.

AB Understanding the distribution of genetic variation is central for both population biology and conservation genetics. Genetic population structure can be primarily affected by the species' dispersal ability, which is assumed to be limited in many amphibians. In this study, we estimated allelic differentiation metrics and F-ST indices to investigate genetic variation among natural breeding ponds of smooth newts (Lissotriton vulgaris) over a small spatial scale. Based on six microsatellite loci, we found a small, but significant allelic differentiation among clusters of natural breeding ponds (i.e. 'local regions'), which result was in line with the calculation of corresponding hierarchical F-ST values. Analysis of molecular variance also indicated significant between-region variation in the study area. Pairwise estimations showed that only the furthermost regions differed from each other in both differentiation measures, but this difference was not attributable to geographic distances between ponds. Our results provide evidence that hierarchical genetic structure can be characteristic to breeding ponds of smooth newts on a small spatial scale in their natural breeding habitat, but dispersal distance may be less limited than previously thought in these philopatric caudates.

AB Author summary
   Worldwide, ecosystems are collapsing or in danger of collapse, but the precise causes of these collapses are often unknown. Observational and experimental evidence shows that all ecosystems are characterized by strong interactions between and among species, and that these webs of interactions can be important contributors to the preservation of ecosystem diversity. But many of the interactions-such as those involving pathogenic microorganisms and the chemical defenses that are mounted by their prey-are not easily identified and analyzed in ecosystems that may have hundreds or thousands of species. Here we use our equal-area-annulus analytical method to examine census data from over three million trees in forest plots from around the world. We show how the method can be used to flag pairs and groups of species that exhibit unusual levels of interaction and that are likely on further investigation to yield information about their causative mechanisms. We give a detailed example showing how some of these interactions can be traced to defense mechanisms that are possessed by one of the tree species. We explore how our method can be used to identify the between-species interactions that play the largest roles in the maintenance of ecosystems and their diversity.
   When Darwin visited the Galapagos archipelago, he observed that, in spite of the islands' physical similarity, members of species that had dispersed to them recently were beginning to diverge from each other. He postulated that these divergences must have resulted primarily from interactions with sets of other species that had also diverged across these otherwise similar islands. By extrapolation, if Darwin is correct, such complex interactions must be driving species divergences across all ecosystems. However, many current general ecological theories that predict observed distributions of species in ecosystems do not take the details of between-species interactions into account. Here we quantify, in sixteen forest diversity plots (FDPs) worldwide, highly significant negative density-dependent (NDD) components of both conspecific and heterospecific between-tree interactions that affect the trees' distributions, growth, recruitment, and mortality. These interactions decline smoothly in significance with increasing physical distance between trees. They also tend to decline in significance with increasing phylogenetic distance between the trees, but each FDP exhibits its own unique pattern of exceptions to this overall decline. Unique patterns of between-species interactions in ecosystems, of the general type that Darwin postulated, are likely to have contributed to the exceptions. We test the power of our null-model method by using a deliberately modified data set, and show that the method easily identifies the modifications. We examine how some of the exceptions, at the Wind River (USA) FDP, reveal new details of a known allelopathic effect of one of the Wind River gymnosperm species. Finally, we explore how similar analyses can be used to investigate details of many types of interactions in these complex ecosystems, and can provide clues to the evolution of these interactions.

AB From supporting wood production to mitigating climate change, forest ecosystem services are crucial to the well-being of humans. Understanding the mechanisms that drive forest dynamics can help us infer how to maintain forest ecosystem services and how to improve predictions of forest dynamics under climate change. Despite the growing number of studies exploring above ground biomass (AGB) dynamics, questions of dynamics in biodiversity and in number of individuals still remain unclear. Here, we first explored the patterns of community dynamics in different aspects (i.e., AGB, density and biodiversity) based on short-term (five years) data from a 25-ha permanent plot in a subtropical forest in central China. Second, we examined the relationships between community dynamics and biodiversity and functional traits. Third, we identified the key factors affecting different aspects of community dynamics and quantified their relative contributions. We found that in the short term (five years), net above ground biomass change (Delta AGB) and biodiversity increased, while the number of individuals decreased. Resource-conservation traits enhanced the Delta AGB and reduced the loss in individuals, while the resource-acquisition traits had the opposite effect. Furthermore, the community structure contributed the most to Delta AGB; topographic variables and soil nutrients contributed the most to the number of individuals; demographic process contributed the most to biodiversity. Our results indicate that biotic factors mostly affected the community dynamics of Delta AGB and biodiversity, while the number of individuals was mainly shaped by abiotic factors. Our work highlighted that the factors influencing different aspects of community dynamics vary. Therefore, forest management practices should be formulated according to a specific protective purpose.

AB Deforestation remains a major concern with regard to climate change and the maintenance of biodiversity. Meanwhile, the development of new image processing techniques and the broad availability of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery provide an unprecedented setup for the development of effective and scalable forest cover change monitoring systems. This is especially relevant in regions with large forested areas with high rates of deforestation, such as in the region of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. In this context, existing forest cover change monitoring methods are based on a combination of visual inspection, spectral profiles, statistics, and machine learning techniques, which offer alternative backbones to deal with deforestation monitoring. Given the recent advances in the field of image processing by Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs), the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the U-Net architecture for the mapping of forest cover aimed at identifying deforestation polygons in multi-temporal satellite imagery. To this end, 10-m resolution imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite covering portions of the Legal Amazon region were employed. The U-Net could identify and draw polygons of forest areas and forest fragments with high accuracy (0.9470), precision (0.9356), recall (0.9676), and F1-score (0.9513), thus outperforming largely applied and well-know supervised and unsupervised image classification methods. The results indicate and we further discuss that UNets have the potential to run as the backbone for efficient forest cover change monitoring initiatives and support the deployment of near real-time deforestation warning systems.

AB We evaluated the vulnerability of nesting sites (sandbanks) available to Podocnemis expansa, P. unifilis and P. sextuberculata to human threats and the coverage of these areas by a public policy created to conserve turtles. Species distribution models were used to identify potential nesting areas in the Brazilian Amazon, where sandbanks were mapped through satellite imagery. Values of threats (deforestation, mining, dams and density of human communities) were normalized from 0 to 1 and summed in each 100 km2 pixel. We calculated the mean value of threats and sandbanks area for each basin. Basins with the greatest values for those variables were considered as the most vulnerable. We calculated the coverage of turtle nesting sites that have conservation actions in relation to the sandbanks available and if they are located in the most vulnerable basins. The areas of greatest gaps in conservation actions and vulnerability are located in the Tocantins-Araguaia basins and in rivers such as: Branco, Guapore ', Amazonas, Solimo similar to es, Madeira, Tapaj ' os and Xingu. Nesting sites included by the public policy covered 15.17 % of the number of basins and about 21 % of total sandbank areas, encompassing 11 % of the most vulnerable basins and 43 % of their sandbanks. We suggest the prioritization of conservation actions in areas of greatest gaps in conservation activities and vulnerability. In addition, we propose the articulation among institutions and the increase of initiatives of community-based conservation management to increase the geographical coverage of the greatest impacted regions.

AB Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important link between carbon and water cycles, which is critical for the forests under future global climatic changes. WUENDVI was calculated by accumulated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and actual evapotranspiration (ET) and could reflect the impacts of climatic changes and human activities on WUE. The three forestry regions of China are the northeast, southwest, and southeast areas. Among them, the northeast forest region is a natural forest region with forest stock accounting for more than 1/4 of China, and the southwest mountainous forest region is another natural forest region in China, with forest stock accounting for more than 1/3 of China, while the southeast forest area is mainly plantations. In 2018, the forest areas over three forestry regions of China were around 1,725,988 km(2). This paper evaluated the changes in forest WUE and their relationships with climatic change and human activities over three forestry regions of China during 1961-2019. The main findings of this study were summarized as follows: (1) the spatial changes of WUE were gentle in the artificial forest region but fluctuant sharply in the natural forest regions. In the southwest forest region, the WUE increased with elevation, while it showed the opposite trends in the artificial forest region. Overall, the annual mean forest WUE increased in almost all regions of the study areas during 1961-2019; (2) in the northeast and southeast forest regions, the WUE presented a negative relationship with the temperature. In the southwest forest region, the WUE was positively correlated with the temperature and its increase rate slowed down significantly when the temperature increases by more than 1 degrees C. The WUE was negatively correlated with precipitation in the three regions and was more sensitive to the decrease of precipitation. The sensitivity of WUE to precipitation reduction was highest in the artificial forest region and lowest in the northeast forest region; (3) the forest WUE and WUENDVI were lowest in the artificial forest region but highest in the northeast forest region, while the net increase in forests area during 1980-2018 was largest in the artificial forest region (155,975 km(2)) but lowest in the northeast forest region (78,766 km(2)). In general, human activities had the greatest impact on the forest WUE in the northeast forest region. Human activities and climatic change had quite complex and interactive effects on forest WUE. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the joint influences of climate change and human activities on WUE.

AB Changes in savanna's fire regimes, either through fire suppression or through an increase in fire frequency, can negatively affect their resilience. We evaluated the extent to which the aboveground biomass, diversity (taxonomic and functional) and resilience (functional redundancy and functional response indices) of savanna tree communities differ between burned and unburned plots. Burned plots experienced two fire events over the tenyears prior to sampling, while unburned plots experienced fire suppression over the same time period. We found that aboveground biomass was 40% smaller in burned plots, indicating that fire regimes must be included as a source of variation in models estimating the potential of savannas to store carbon. Burned plots had a higher functional diversity of vegetative traits but a smaller functional diversity of reproductive traits, indicating that generalizations about the effect of fire on tree functional diversity should be viewed with caution. Periodic fires can benefit savanna tree biodiversity by maintaining the balance between light-demanding and shade-tolerant species but can also increase the dominance of species with less specialized reproductive traits that do not rely on animal interactions. Burned plots had slightly lower functional redundancy but similar functional response diversity compared to unburned plots, suggesting that both communities harbor tree species that might respond positively or negatively to fire and, therefore, will be able to maintain the ecosystem functions considered under a future scenario of fire-suppression or increased fire frequency. Therefore, a longer-term fire suppression (>10 years) or a return fire interval of less than 4 years may be necessary to reduce the resilience of the savanna tree component, considering the ecosystem functions analyzed in this study.

AB Two new species of the palaemonid shrimp genus Typton Costa, 1844 are described based on material from Panama and Mexico. Both species are closely related to T. tortugae McClendon, 1911, a species originally described from the Dry Tortugas, off southern Florida, USA, and later scarcely recorded from other western Atlantic localities, from Bermuda to Mexico and Brazil. Some clarification and additional illustrations are provided for the type material of T. tortugae. Typton jonkayei sp. nov., is described based on material from fouling-encrusting communities dominated by sponges, growing on submerged roots of the red mangrove, Rhizhophora mangle L., in Bocas del Toro, Caribbean coast of Panama. This new species differs from T. tortugae in several morphological details, for instance, on the minor and major chelipeds (second pereiopods), telson, uropod, frontal margin and ambulatory pereiopods. Typton cousteaui sp. nov. is described based on a single ovigerous female dredged in the southern Gulf of California off Baja California Sur, Mexico, previously reported as T. tortugae. This new taxon seems to represent a true cryptic species with no significant morphological divergence from the allopatrically isolated T. tortugae, except for slight morphometric differences. In addition, T. granulosus Ayon-Parente, Hendrickx & Galvan-Villa, 2015 is recorded from the Pacific coast of Panama, based on material collected in the Coiba Archipelago. Some taxonomic, distributional and ecological remarks are provided for T. granulosus and the closely related T. serratus Holthuis, 1951.

   BRAZIL
AB Changes in the vegetation of Brazilian Cerrado may occur over time. However, long-term dynamics are not fully understood yet, especially woody plant encroachment (WPE). The objective of this study was to examine changes in vegetation structure in a preserved area in Triangulo Mineiro region, within the southern Brazilian Cerrado domain, over 32 years (1987, 2005, and 2019). We based the study on field and literature surveys, as well as satellite imagery, and hypothesized that, due to the absence of periodic fires or grazing, Cerrado open formations (i.e., grassland or savanna) tend to become denser due to WPE. Shrubby grassland cover assessed in 1987 disappeared in the following periods (from 30.0% to 0.0% in 2019) while forest formations increased (from 7.0% in 1987 to 11.0% in 2019). Changes between 2005 and 2019 occurred within the stricto sensu cerrado subdivisions, with reduction of sparse cerrado (from 34.2% to 7.7 %) and an increase in dense cerrado (from 6.9% to 39.8 %). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied for similar periods indicates a progressive increase of values over time (from 1986 (0.61 +/- 0.10) to 2004 (0.65 +/- 0.06) and 2018 (0.78 +/- 0.05)) and corroborates the WPE process. These patterns imply the loss of biodiversity in open plant formation. Another major consequence was the reduction of wetlands and possible impact on water supply. Such patterns are important to support plant management plans for the threatened Cerrado open plant formations.

AB The phytochemical study on ten populations of Salvia multicaulis Vahl. revealed that their essential oil qualitative profiles contained a significant amount of monoterpene hydrocarbons, which were the most abundant compounds. Besides, alpha-Pinene was the major constituent in all studied populations' essential oils. Significant correlations were observed between edaphic parameters and some major essential oil compounds. According to clustering analyses of the chemical data, the S. multicaulis populations were divided into three chemotypes: beta-caryophyllene, camphene and camphor, and limonene. The population genetics study showed significant molecular differences among the populations. The Mantel test indicated a significant positive correlation between the geographical distances and genetic diversity, exhibiting a low amount of gene flow and a considerable genetic differentiation value. We also detected four genotypes based on the Nei's genetic distance and structure analysis. The identified chemical and genetic similarities/differences among these populations were correlated with edaphic parameters and geographic distances, suggesting that environmental factors are the primary drivers of the chemical polymorphism of essential oils in S. multicaulis populations.

AB Globally, seabird populations have been in decline due to multiple threats throughout their range. Separating simultaneous pressures is challenging and can require significant amounts of data over long periods of time. We use spatial contrasts to investigate the relative importance of several drivers for the purported decline in a species listed as in decline as an example species, the Flesh-footed shearwater (Ardenna carneipes). On Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea, Australia, this seabird suffers from habitat loss due to housing development, intensive mortality in fisheries, plastic ingestion, and roadkill due to vehicular traffic on its breeding island. We repeated a quantitative survey of the population to ascertain whether the decline previously reported had continued and to evaluate the purported mortality sources (Reid et al. in PLoS ONE 8(4):e58230, 2013, Lavers et al. in Global Ecol Conserv 17:e00579, 2019). We measured burrow density, area of occurrence, occupancy and breeding success, integrating them with previous surveys using a Bayesian statistical model to generate longer term estimates of demographic rates. We used spatial patterns to test whether mortality on roads or proximity to human habitation was influencing population demographics. In contrast to predictions, we found the population had stabilised or increased. Characteristics such as burrow occupancy and breeding success showed little pattern, with weak evidence for impacts from road mortality and housing development. Such a data-rich approach is substantially more informative and can better support seabird conservation and management efforts does require more field-time and additional equipment than most contemporary surveys, the data is substantially more informative and can better clarify the results of efforts in seabird conservation and management.

AB Understanding the genetic responses of different species to the landscape attributes is essential to improve conservation actions and decision-making. However, making generalizations about such responses is not trivial, since they can be influenced by several factors. Aspects related to landscape matrix quality, for example, such as contrast and heterogeneity, may play a relevant role in the spatial-genetic structuring of populations since functional connectivity is influenced by the degree of matrix permeability. Intending to identify trends of genetic responses to habitat fragmentation and the aspects influencing these responses, we employed a meta-analytical approach to investigate the degree of genetic structuring of small mammal populations, measured through the fixation index (FST), in anthropogenic landscapes. For this, we obtained data of 28 species from 38 studies worldwide. We investigated the heterogeneity among species' responses by focusing on the influence of matrix quality (contrast and heterogeneity), and species' life-history traits (mean dispersal distance, generation time, and locomotor mode), controlling the influence of the marker type used in the study and the isolation by distance (IBD) among the patches habitat. We found a consistent pattern of genetic structuring of small mammal populations in anthropogenic landscapes, which present a significant genetic differentiation. Genetic structure is mostly influenced by matrix quality characteristics so that populations established in landscapes with high contrast and more heterogeneous matrices tend to be more structured. Also, populations of species with long generation time and high dispersal capacity exhibit a greater degree of genetic structure. Besides, accounting for IBD as a fixed effect was crucial to understand the variation among studies' findings. Thus, the degree of genetic structuring of small mammal populations reflects the functional connectivity of the landscape, resulting from a balance between landscape attributes (matrix contrast and heterogeneity) and species' life-history traits. Overall, our findings suggest that small mammals may be more susceptible to fragmentation than previously recognized, calling for special attention to this group considering their importance to maintain community structure and ecosystem functioning.

AB Phenotypic diversity in poultry has been mainly driven by artificial selection and genetic drift. These led to the adaptation to the environment and the development of specific phenotypic traits of chickens in response to their economic use. This study evaluated genetic diversity within and between Russian breeds and populations using Illumina Chicken 60 K SNP iSelect BeadChip by analysing genetic differences between populations with Hudson's fixation index (F-ST statistic) and heterozygosity. We estimated the effect of rare alleles and linkage disequilibrium (LD) on these measurements. To assess the effect of LD on the genetic diversity population, we carried out the LD-based pruning (LD < 0.5 and LD < 0.1) for seven chicken populations combined (I) or separately (II). LD pruning was specific for different dataset groups. Because of the noticeably large sample size in the Russian White RG population, pruning was substantial for Dataset I, and F-ST values were only positive when LD < 0.1 pruning was applied. For Dataset II, the LD pruning results were confirmed by examining heterozygosity and alleles' frequency distribution. LD between single nucleotide polymorphisms was consistent across the seven chicken populations, except the Russian White RG population with the smallest r(2) values and the largest effective population size. Our findings suggest to study variability in each population LD pruning has to be carried separately not after merging to avoid bias in estimates. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB Trees partition biomass in response to resource limitation and physiological activity. It is presumed that these strategies evolved to optimize some measure of fitness. If the optimization criterion can be specified, then allometry can be modeled from first principles without prescribed parameterization.
   We present the Tree Hydraulics and Optimal Resource Partitioning (THORP) model, which optimizes allometry by estimating allocation fractions to organs as proportional to their ratio of marginal gain to marginal cost, where gain is net canopy photosynthesis rate, and costs are senescence rates. Root total biomass and profile shape are predicted simultaneously by a unified optimization. Optimal partitioning is solved by a numerically efficient analytical solution.
   THORP's predictions agree with reported tree biomass partitioning in response to size, water limitations, elevated CO2 and pruning. Roots were sensitive to soil moisture profiles and grew down to the groundwater table when present. Groundwater buffered against water stress regardless of meteorology, stabilizing allometry and root profiles as deep as c. 30 m.
   Much of plant allometry can be explained by hydraulic considerations. However, nutrient limitations cannot be fully ignored. Rooting mass and profiles were synchronized with hydrological conditions and groundwater even at considerable depths, illustrating that the below ground shapes whole-tree allometry.

AB Revealing patterns of genetic diversity and barriers for gene flow are key points for successful conservation in endangered species. Methods based on molecular markers are also often used to delineate conservation units such as evolutionary significant units and management units. Here we combine phylo-geographic analyses (based on mtDNA) with population and landscape genetic analyses (based on microsatellites) for the endangered yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata over a wide distribution range in Germany. Our analyses show that two genetic clusters are present in the study area, a northern and a southern/central one, but that these clusters are not deeply divergent. The genetic data suggest high fragmentation among toad occurrences and consequently low genetic diversity. Genetic diversity and genetic connectivity showed a negative relationship with road densities and urban areas surrounding toad occurrences, indicating that these landscape features act as barriers to gene flow. To preserve a maximum of genetic diversity, we recommend considering both genetic clusters as management units, and to increase gene flow among toad occurrences with the aim of restoring and protecting functional meta-populations within each of the clusters. Several isolated populations with especially low genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding need particular short-term conservation attention to avoid extinction. We also recommend to allow natural gene flow between both clusters but not to use individuals from one cluster for translocation or reintroduction into the other. Our results underscore the utility of molecular tools for species conservation, highlight outcomes of habitat fragmentation onto the genetic structure of an endangered amphibian and reveal particularly threatened populations in need for urgent conservation efforts.

AB Fusarium wilt of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon), has become an increasing concern of farmers in the southeastern USA, especially in Florida. Management of this disease, most often through the use of resistant cultivars and crop rotation, requires an accurate understanding of an area's pathogen population structure and phenotypic characteristics. This study improved the understanding of the state's pathogen population by completing multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of two housekeeping genes (BT and TEF) and two loci (ITS and IGS), aggressiveness and race-determining bioassays on 72 isolates collected between 2011 and 2015 from major watermelon production areas in North, Central, and South Florida. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) failed to group race 3 isolates into a single large clade; moreover, clade membership was not apparently correlated with aggressiveness (which varied both within and between clades), and only slightly with sampling location. The failure of multilocus sequence analysis using four highly conserved housekeeping genes and loci to clearly group and delineate known Fon races provides justification for future whole genome sequencing efforts whose more robust genomic comparisons will provide higher resolution of intra-species genetic distinctions. Consequently, these results suggest that identification of Fon isolates by race determination alone may fail to detect economically important phenotypic characteristics such as aggressiveness leading to inaccurate risk assessment.

AB 1. The establishment of new botanic gardens in tropical regions highlights a need for weed risk assessment tools suitable for tropical ecosystems. The relevance of plant traits for invasion into tropical rainforests has not been well studied.
   2. Working in and around four botanic gardens in Indonesia where 590 alien species have been planted, we estimated the effect of four plant traits, plus time since species introduction, on: (a) the naturalization probability and (b) abundance (density) of naturalized species in adjacent native tropical rainforests; and (c) the distance that naturalized alien plants have spread from the botanic gardens.
   3. We found that specific leaf area (SLA) strongly differentiated 23 naturalized from 78 non-naturalized alien species (randomly selected from 577 non-naturalized species) in our study. These trends may indicate that aliens with high SLA, which had a higher probability of naturalization, benefit from at least two factors when establishing in tropical forests: high growth rates and occupation of forest gaps. Naturalized aliens had high SLA and tended to be short. However, plant height was not significantly related to species' naturalization probability when considered alongside other traits.
   4. Alien species that were present in the gardens for over 30 years and those with small seeds also had higher probabilities of becoming naturalized, indicating that garden plants can invade the understorey of closed canopy tropical rainforests, especially when invading species are shade tolerant and have sufficient time to establish.
   5. On average, alien species that were not animal dispersed spread 78 m further into the forests and were more likely to naturalize than animal-dispersed species. We did not detect relationships between the measured traits and estimated density of naturalized aliens in the adjacent forests.
   6. Synthesis: Traits were able to differentiate alien species from botanic gardens that naturalized in native forest from those that did not; this is promising for developing trait-based risk assessment in the tropics. To limit the risk of invasion and spread into adjacent native forests, we suggest tropical botanic gardens avoid planting alien species with fast carbon capture strategies and those that are shade tolerant.

DT Review
DE boreal; browsing; density; hierarchical; landscape ecology; plant&#8211;
   herbivore interactions; temperate; temporal; spatial
AB Deer are regarded to be a keystone species as they play a crucial role in the way an ecosystem functions. Most deer-forest interaction studies apply a single scale - process of analyzing ecological interactions by only taking into account one dependent variable - to understand how deer browsing behavior shapes different forest components, but they overlook the fact that forests respond to multiple scales simultaneously. This research evaluates the effect of browsing by wild deer on temperate and boreal forests at different scales by synthesizing seminal papers, specifically (a) what are the effects of deer population density in forest regeneration? (b) What are the effects of deer when forests present diverging spatial characteristics? (c) What are the effects on vegetation at different temporal scales? and (d) What are the hierarchical effects of deer when considering other trophic levels? Additionally, a framework based on modern technology is proposed to answer the multiscale research questions previously identified. When analyzing deer-forest interactions at different scales, the strongest relationships occur at the extremes. For example: when deer assemblage occurs in low or high density and is composed of a mix of small and large species. As forests on poor soils remain restrained in size, isolated and chronically browsed. When forests harbor incomplete trophic levels, the effects spill over to lower trophic levels. To better understand the complexities in deer-forest interactions, researchers should combine technology-based instruments like fixed sensors and drones with field-tested methods such observational studies and experiments to tackle multiscale research questions.

AB We present rare, empirical evidence on the permanence of land use changes induced by a payments for ecosystem services (PES) program. A follow-up study was conducted a decade after the end of the Regional Integrated Silvo-pastoral Ecosystem Management Project (RISEMP) in Costa Rica. Econometric analysis found that silvopastoral practices persisted in the long term and are not reverted. On average there is also no meaningful intensification of practices after payments ceased. However, there is some heterogeneity on the individual level. We find that farms that increase adoption after the end of the project are farms with slower adoption during the project while some farms that decrease adoption are intense adopters. This indicates a pattern of convergence in the long run. Additionally, we challenge the assumption that payments are mono-causally inducing land use change by investigating non-monetary factors associated practice adoption. We find that not only PES explains adoption of silvo-pastoral practices. While it is challenging to establish clear casual linkages, we find that adoption is associated with the number of social ties to other farmers as well as negatively correlated to the exposure to traditional production paradigms measured as membership, as well as peer membership, in producer organisations.

AB Amazon, Atlantic forest, Brejos de Altitude, Caatinga, Carrasco, Cerradao and Restinga are major vegetation units in North and Northeast Brazil. Little is known about lichen metacommunity structure in these habitats. While species richness and composition generally depend on climatic factors, in azonal vegetation edaphic factors may have a filtering effect on tree bark structure and hence the composition of epiphytic lichen communities. We hypothesized that climatic stress and a tree bark filtering effect would result in reduced richness and phylogenetic clustering in Caatinga, Carrasco, Cerradao and Restinga, whereas high richness and phylogenetic overdispersion were predicted for Amazon and Atlantic Forest. To test this, we analyzed 2,090 lichenized species in the study area, with a supertree to assess phylogenetic metacommunity structure. Amazon and Atlantic forest exhibited high richness and phylogenetic diversity, with phylogenetic overdispersion only in the Amazon. The zonal Caatinga with drought stress and the extrazonal Brejos both exhibited phylogenetic clustering. Among the azonal, edaphic vegetation units, Cerradao exhibited phylogenetic overdispersion, whereas Restinga showed phylogenetic clustering. Nearest taxon phylogenetic distance indicated a close relationship between Amazon and Atlantic forest, Atlantic forest and Brejos and Atlantic forest and Caatinga. Carrasco was mostly closely related to Cerradao, and Restinga was distantly related to any other unit. These findings indicate more complex patterns in the phylogenetic structure of lichen metacommunities, partly reflecting those of plant metacommunities, as a result of concurrent macroecological evolutionary histories. Our data supported floristic evidence that Carrasco is part of the Cerrado complex and not related to Caatinga.

AB Aims An essential task of agricultural systems is to improve internal phosphorus (P) recycling. Cover crops and tillage reduction can increase sustainability, but it is not known whether stimulation of the soil microbial community can increase the availability of soil organic P pools. Methods In a field experiment in southwest Germany, the effects of a winter cover crop mixture (vs. bare fallow) and no-till (vs. non-inversion tillage) on microbial P-cycling were assessed with soybean as the main crop. Microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), P cycling enzymes, and carbon-substrate use capacity were linked for the first time with the lability of organic P pools measured by enzyme addition assays (using phosphodiesterase, non-phytase-phosphomonoesterase and fungal phytase). Results Microbial phosphorus, phosphatase, and fatty acids increased under cover crops, indicating an enhanced potential for organic P cycling. Enzyme-stable organic P shifted towards enzyme-labile organic P pools. Effects of no-till were weaker, and a synergy with cover crops was not evident. Conclusions In this experiment, cover crops were able to increase the microbially mediated internal P cycling in a non-P-limited, temperate agroecosystems.

AB Maintaining genetic diversity and genetic structure in threatened species is recognised as important, but genetic data are frequently missing from management plans. We use a panel of 11 highly polymorphic microsatellites to describe genetic diversity and genetic structure in the Great Spotted Kiwi/Roroa (Apteryx haastii) (GSK). This flightless bird still occupies the majority of its historical range, but its population has become increasingly fragmented due to human activities. Using the most spatially continuous sample set yet collected for this species, we show that extant GSK exhibit high genetic diversity and clear signals of isolation by distance, where there is a strong correlation between genetic similarity and geographic distance between individuals. This suggests that most GSK do not disperse particularly far (15-20 km) and are most likely to settle and mate with close neighbours, promoting fine-scale genetic structuring and high genetic diversity overall. These findings are important for the management of GSK, as current efforts seek to rebuild depleted populations and restore the species back to its full range prior to human arrival in New Zealand. Our data have already been integrated into the GSK recovery plan, informing policy on translocations and other restoration opportunities.

AB Urban green space provides refuges for species that are unintentionally introduced by humans and which do not belong to the remnants of natural habitats in urban areas. However, the quantitative relationships between urban green space properties and these spontaneous species are unclear. To address this, we surveyed plant species occurring in urban green patches in Kunming city, which is located in a biodiversity hotspot in southwest China. We classified spontaneous plants into native, non-native and invasive plant species. A total of 386 spontaneous species belonging to 278 genera and 92 families were recorded in 190 patches. Most of the recorded species were herbaceous plants (76.2 %). While invasive species constituted a relatively small proportion of the total species pool (17.9 %), six out of ten of the most frequently occurring species were invasive. Regression models inspired by the theory of Island Biogeography show that total, native, non-native and invasive spontaneous species richness in urban green patches were best explained by the size of the ?island? (patch area), dispersal limitations (as expressed by ?distance to city boundary?) and edge effects (as shown by the landscape shape index). While the set of drivers of spontaneous plants is similar for the different groups of species, the relative importance of each driver varies among them. Our study provides quantification of drivers of biodiversity patterns in urban green space. Based on this understanding, planning and management of urban green space can be adapted to maximize spontaneous plant conservation in rapidly urbanizing biodiversity hotspot regions.

   Morphological and physiological traits; Enrichment planting
AB Forest gaps play an important role in tree regeneration and forest restoration in modern silviculture. Many previous studies examined gap effects on seedling survival, growth, or both but lacked a systemic assessment incorporating morphological and physiological responses to varying environmental gradients along gap size and within-gap position, which limits foresters to understand the general gap impacts on the early stage of regeneration. Here, we systemically evaluated gap impacts on over 20 regeneration-related variables from two dominant tree species (Manchurian walnut [Juglans mandshurica Maxim.] and Korean spruce [Picea koraiensis Nakai]) planted along the gap-understory gradients based on our previous studies of survival and growth of these two species. The factor analysis of mixed data indicated that seedling specific leaf area, biomass allocation, chlorophyll content, and NSC content in gaps were largely determined by interspecific differences, but seedling survival, growth, and biomass accumulation were mainly related to gap size and within-gap position. Specifically, the net photosynthetic rates of Manchurian walnut were higher in large and medium gaps (or gap centers and transitions) than those in small gaps and forest understory (or gap edges). The root starch content of seedlings in gaps was almost twice as much as that in the forest understory, which also reflected species divergence in gaps. By contrast, Korean spruce exhibited less variation in net photosynthesis and root starch content and fewer differences for most other examined variables, which indicated that it had broad ecological niches and a relatively small gap would promote its regeneration during the seedling stage. Our findings provide evidence of gap partitioning on explaining regeneration patterns of light-demanding species. Therefore, gap size and within-gap position can compensate for each other during gap-based silviculture practices. Timely selective logging can extend an existing gap in a specific direction to change the relative position of target tree species for better light conditions. Appropriate selection and match of tree species to gap size and within-gap position during enrichment planting can improve gap space utilization.

AB Complementarity in phosphorus (P) acquisition from different sources and facilitation of P uptake have been implicated in yield advantages of intercropping. These beneficial interactions between crop species are expected to be particularly relevant on low-P soils.
   Millet and chickpea have previously been found to differ in their ability to access different chemically bound forms of P. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment on a low-P soil with or without P fertilization to determine whether the resulting potential for complementarity and facilitation with respect to P acquisition is associated with increased P uptake and yield of an intercrop as compared to sole crops.
   Alkaline phosphatase activity and carboxylate concentration differed between millet and chickpea, indicating potential complementarity in access to different P sources. Comparison of aboveground P content in the intercrop and the pure stands showed a positive net effect for P uptake (NEP > 0) when no P fertilizer was applied, but this positive net effect for P acquisition was not associated with a yield increase (NEY = 0). When P fertilizer was applied, there was no significant net increase in P uptake by the intercrop compared to sole crops (NEP = 0), but there was a significant yield gain (NEY > 0).
   Species trait dissimilarities for P acquisition from different sources supported complementarity in, and facilitation of P uptake by millet and chickpea in the field on a low-P soil, but this did not result in yield increase. The finding does not support the notion that complementarity in P acquisition from different sources and facilitation of P uptake are key drivers for overyielding by intercropping on low-P soil.

AB Herein, we investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of Euglossa cordata L., an orchid bee species widely distributed at the heterogeneous set of vegetal physiognomies encompassed in a transition zone (TZ) of different Brazilian biomes. We then tested whether phytogeographic regions would play some rule for the genetic diversity. Results revealed that only 12 and 28 out 78 pairs of samples showed some degree of genetic structure for microsatellites (F (ST)<= 0.029; D-est <= 0.091; p < 0.05) and mtDNA(0.138 <= mt-phi(ST)<= 0.495; p < 0.05) markers, respectively. We found evidence of two and three genetic clusters in nuclear and mtDNA markers, but no significant structure based on phytogeographic regions or geographic distances. These findings point out that local idiosyncrasies and historic factors, but not different types of vegetation or geographic distances drive the patterns of the observed genetic structure. Drops in the diversity index and other estimators highlight that E. cordata may have experienced some local bottlenecks despite its resilience to anthropic interferences. These are the first records of relatively high genetic structure in E. cordata populations and have important implications for orchid bees' conservation.

   composition; Landscape configuration; Trophic guilds
AB Context Habitat loss is widely recognized as the main driver of biodiversity loss around the globe, yet the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity have been extensively debated in recent years. Objectives We used a robust dataset of medium and large-sized mammals to test (a) the Habitat Amount Hypothesis, which postulates that species richness can be mainly predicted by the total amount of habitat surrounding the sampling site, and (b) the effects of habitat fragmentation per se, which may be expected to be weak or mainly positive on species richness. Methods We compiled information on the occurrence of mammal species in 166 forest fragments across the Atlantic Forest. For each forest fragment, we extracted information on patch size, percentage of forest cover (a proxy for habitat amount), and edge density and number of fragments (fragmentation metrics). We related these metrics to mammalian richness considering separately for all species, forest-dependent species, disturbance-tolerant species, and different trophic guilds. Results All richness measures strongly declined with decreasing forest cover, yet were unaffected by patch size, number of patches and edge density. The only exception occurred with herbivore richness, which was affected by number of patches. However, we found fragmentation per se effects only for herbivore richness. Conclusions Our results show that mammal richness increased with habitat amount at the landscape, whereas habitat fragmentation per se had significant negative impacts on herbivores only. We therefore recommend maintaining highly forested landscapes and restoring severely deforested areas, being essential for ensuring high richness of mammals.

AB PREMISE: Gypsum soils in the Mediterranean Basin house large numbers of edaphic specialists that are adapted to stressful environments. The evolutionary history and standing genetic variation of these taxa have been influenced by the geological and paleoclimatic complexity of this area and the long-standing effect of human activities. However, little is known about the origin of Mediterranean gypsophiles and the factors affecting their genetic diversity and population structure.
   METHODS: Using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches based on microsatellites and sequence data from nuclear and chloroplast regions, we evaluated the divergence time, genetic diversity, and population structure of 27 different populations of the widespread Iberian gypsophile Lepidium subulatum throughout its entire geographic range.
   RESULTS: Lepidium subulatum diverged from its nearest relatives similar to 3 million years ago, and ITS and psbA/matK trees supported the monophyly of the species.These results suggest that both geological and climatic changes in the region around the Plio-Pleistocene promoted its origin, compared to other evolutionary processes. We found high genetic diversity in both nuclear and chloroplast markers, but a greater population structure in the chloroplast data. These results suggest that while seed dispersal is limited, pollen flow may be favored by the presence of numerous habitat patches that enhance the movement of pollinators.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite being an edaphic endemic, L. subulatum possesses high genetic diversity probably related to its relatively old age and high population sizes across its range. Our study highlights the value of using different markers to fully understand the phylogeographic history of plant species.

AB Ecological hypotheses of 'limiting similarity' and 'limiting dissimilarity' formulate the alleged conditions for implementing the competitive exclusion. The limiting similarity hypothesis assumes that exceeding a threshold of interspecific similarity leads to competitive exclusion. The hypothesis of limiting dissimilarity states the opposite -a condition of implementing competitive exclusion is exceeding of a threshold of interspecific dissimilarity. These hypotheses clearly contradict each other and we tested them on the model of competition at different values of relative competitiveness of the species. The model of competition under study we implemented as automatic deductive inference by a method of a completely transparent and completely explainable artificial intelligence. In order to strictly verify the hypotheses, we have excluded different possible factors promoting competitive coexistence. We have achieved that by ensuring that all conditions for the studied complete competitors were equal, with the exception of competitiveness of the species. Using our individual-based cellular automata model we demonstrate that two trophically identical species aggressively competing for a single limiting resource, all other things being equal, may coexist in one limited habitat until the threshold of differences in competitiveness exceeds 31%. The obtained results reject the hypothesis of limiting similarity and confirm the hypothesis about the limiting dissimilarity. The results are of importance for evolution theory and for finding pathways to ecological sustainability. Our individual-based modelling approach, based on the transparent and explainable artificial intelligence, opens up great prospects for a variety of theoretical and applied fields.

AB Shifts from ornamental fish tanks to functional reef ecosystem aquaria has led to unprecedented pressure on marine invertebrate fisheries. The Caribbean blue-legged hermit crab (Clibanarius tricolor) is among the species targeted for functional reef tanks, valued for its role as an aquarium cleaner. Little is known about the biology of the species or the genetic landscape in which the increased collecting is happening. Here, we investigate the phylogeographic history and genetic diversity of C. tricolor through analysis of mitochondrial (CO1, 16S) and nuclear (H3) DNA. We test whether phylogeographic breaks for other invertebrates structure the genetic diversity of C. tricolor and explore additional factors that may govern structure, such as reproductive strategy, life history, habitat preference, adult mobility, demographic history, and vicariance events. Based on these three markers, we find high genetic diversity and connectivity and find no evidence to support the tested barriers as relevant to gene flow for C. tricolor. Rather, mitochondrial and nuclear markers infer high genetic diversity, panmixia, and demographic expansion during the Pleistocene. Our finding of panmixia makes it difficult to identify source or sink populations, but the absence of hierarchical structure inferred from mtDNA and nuDNA markers we use, high levels of genetic diversity and homogeneity for these same markers, and advantageous life history traits suggest C. tricolor is not currently at special risk; however, geographically restricted haplotypes and limitations within our study prevent us from making a strong conclusion about the sustainability of the fishery. Our work on the Caribbean blue-legged hermit crab highlights the importance of acquiring basic information on exploited species and reiterates that common regional forces may not equally impact connectivity among co-distributed species.

AB Ecosystem services (ESs) are a diverse range of environmental properties that have significant effects on both landscape characteristics and human well-being, an understanding of the spatial variation of which is required for effective ecosystem management and conservation. In this study, we aimed to identify the geographical variation in ESs and examine the factors impacting ESs in Punjab Province, Pakistan. We evaluated ecosystem service intensity (ESI) by using the benefit transfer method and investigated the spatial heterogeneity of ESIs at the tehsil level by using an exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) model and semivariance analysis. This analysis indicated that spatial distribution of ESI shows significant and optimal spatial heterogeneity of ESs, revealing several hot and cold spots for ESI transformation in the study area. The ESI decreased from east to west and north to south, with a trough in the metropolitan zones, including Lahore, Sheikhupura, Faisalabad, and Multan, which was in accordance with the land use/cover pattern. Furthermore, using geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis, we also identified geographical clusters within which land use/cover pressure and population growth were significantly positively associated with ESI across the province, based on a lag distance scale. The findings of this study have functional economic implications with respect to highlighting areas worthy of conservation and designing ecological corridors to enhance the delivery of ESs for regional benefits.

AB Croton is one of the largest angiosperm genera, with > 1200 species in the tropics worldwide. The arborescent Croton section Cleodora stands out for its disjunct geographical distribution with two main centres of diversity in the Amazonian and Atlantic Forest regions, separated by the Caatinga, Cerrado and Chaco biomes (the 'Dry Diagonal'). This disjunction is found in other Neotropical lineages and attributed to Neogene geological and climatic events. We inferred a nearly complete phylogenetic reconstruction of Croton section Cleodora based on DNA sequences of nuclear ITS and five plastid regions (rps16, trnH-psbA, trnL-F, trnT-L and ycf1). We further estimated divergence times and reconstructed ancestral ranges using Bayesian methods. Our results show that Croton section Cleodora is monophyletic with two main clades; we also confirm the phylogenetic adscription of eight Croton spp. recently described or assigned to section Cleodora based on morphology. Divergence of section Cleodora from its sister clade occurred c. 25 Mya, and diversification within this group started 20 Mya. Biogeographic analyses suggest the section originated in the Amazonian region, from where it dispersed to other forested Neotropical regions, including the Atlantic Forest. Divergence between Amazonian and Atlantic Forest taxa appears to have been triggered by the formation of the South American Dry Diagonal.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT

DE Saltmarsh; Spartian alterniflora; Patch size; Plant density; Wetlands
ID IMPACTS; DYNAMICS
AB Habitat fragmentaion into small patches is regarded as a vital cause of biodiversity loss. Fragmentation of habitat-forming species is especially harmful, as patchiness of such species often controls ecosystem stability and resilience by density and patch size-dependent self-reinforcing feedbacks. Although fragmentation are expected to weaken or even break such feedbacks, it remains unclear how the resulting patchiness of habitat-forming species affect ecosystem resilience to environmental stresses. Here, using Spartian alterniflora, the habitat-forming species in saltmarshes as a model, we investigate how patch size, plant density, and shell aggregation interactively control the persistence of a degrading salt marsh that suffered from erosion induced by hydrodynamics. Our results demonstrate that large patches can trap more shells along the patch edge than the smaller ones, therefore significantly facilitating plant re-growth within the patch. Shell removal experiments further reveal that large patches trapping more shells along patch edges reinforce their own persistence by decreasing erosion and thus facilitating plant recovery. By contrast, small patches with lesser plants cannot persist as they trap less shells along patch edges but are able to accumulate more shells at interior locations where they hinder plant re-growth, indicating a critical threshold of patch size similar to 20 m(2) below which ecosystem collapses. The current study highlights the importance to identify critical threshold of stress-resistant patch sizes in transition-prone ecosystems as early-warning to alert undesired ecosystem collapse and restoration practice.

AB Secondary forests are increasingly important components of human-modified landscapes in the tropics. Successional pathways, however, can vary enormously across and within landscapes, with divergent regrowth rates, vegetation structure and species composition. While climatic and edaphic conditions drive variations across regions, land-use history plays a central role in driving alternative successional pathways within human-modified landscapes. How land use affects succession depends on its intensity, spatial extent, frequency, duration and management practices, and is mediated by a complex combination of mechanisms acting on different ecosystem components and at different spatial and temporal scales. We review the literature aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the long-lasting effects of land use on tropical forest succession and to discuss its implications for forest restoration. We organize it following a framework based on the hierarchical model of succession and ecological filtering theory. This review shows that our knowledge is mostly derived from studies in Neotropical forests regenerating after abandonment of shifting cultivation or pasture systems. Vegetation is the ecological component assessed most often. Little is known regarding how the recovery of belowground processes and microbiota communities is affected by previous land-use history. In published studies, land-use history has been mostly characterized by type, without discrimination of intensity, extent, duration or frequency. We compile and discuss the metrics used to describe land-use history, aiming to facilitate future studies. The literature shows that (i) species availability to succession is affected by transformations in the landscape that affect dispersal, and by management practices and seed predation, which affect the composition and diversity of propagules on site. Once a species successfully reaches an abandoned field, its establishment and performance are dependent on resistance to management practices, tolerance to (modified) soil conditions, herbivory, competition with weeds and invasive species, and facilitation by remnant trees. (ii) Structural and compositional divergences at early stages of succession remain for decades, suggesting that early communities play an important role in governing further ecosystem functioning and processes during succession. Management interventions at early stages could help enhance recovery rates and manipulate successional pathways. (iii) The combination of local and landscape conditions defines the limitations to succession and therefore the potential for natural regeneration to restore ecosystem properties effectively. The knowledge summarized here could enable the identification of conditions in which natural regeneration could efficiently promote forest restoration, and where specific management practices are required to foster succession. Finally, characterization of the landscape context and previous land-use history is essential to understand the limitations to succession and therefore to define cost-effective restoration strategies. Advancing knowledge on these two aspects is key for finding generalizable relations that will increase the predictability of succession and the efficiency of forest restoration under different landscape contexts.

AB We investigated long-term changes, from 1979 to 2015, in the abundance of Protea roupelliae subsp. roupelliae trees growing in a montane grassland of the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg mountains. The study involved counting the numbers of adults and juveniles (saplings and seedlings) in six groves on three occasions over 36 years, documenting the fire-return intervals and the seasons when fires occurred in each grove, and measuring the fuel loads of the grass swards in five of the groves. Only in one grove did adults persist in their original numbers, but not the juveniles. Adults and juveniles declined in three groves, and in two groves both adults and juveniles died. Neither mean fire-return interval nor its variation, or seasonal distributions of fire could account for the transition from tree persistence to extirpation among the six groves after 36 years. Instead, the only plausible explanation for the persistence of Protea trees in one grove was that its grass sward produced a significantly lower mean, but higher variation in fuel load (biomass), compared with groves where Protea tree abundances either declined or were extirpated. As such, the recruitment bottleneck imposed on seedling establishment by the grass sward is an obvious avenue for future research.

TI Microsatellite analysis reveals low genetic diversity in managed
   populations of the critically endangered gharial (Gavialis gangeticus)
   in India
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is a critically endangered crocodylian, endemic to the Indian subcontinent. The species has experienced severe population decline during the twentieth century owing to habitat loss, poaching, and mortalities in passive fishing. Its extant populations have largely recovered through translocation programmes initiated in 1975. Understanding the genetic status of these populations is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the ongoing conservation efforts. This study assessed the genetic diversity, population structure, and evidence of genetic bottlenecks of the two managed populations inhabiting the Chambal and Girwa Rivers, which hold nearly 80% of the global gharial populations. We used seven polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci and a 520 bp partial fragment of the mitochondrial control region (CR). The overall mean allelic richness (Ar) was 2.80 +/- 0.40, and the observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosities were 0.40 +/- 0.05 and 0.39 +/- 0.05, respectively. We observed low levels of genetic differentiation between populations (F-ST = 0.039, P < 0.05; G'(ST) = 0.058, P < 0.05 Jost's D = 0.016, P < 0.05). The bottleneck analysis using the M ratio (Chambal = 0.31 +/- 0.06; Girwa = 0.41 +/- 0.12) suggested the presence of a genetic bottleneck in both populations. The mitochondrial CR also showed a low level of variation, with two haplotypes observed in the Girwa population. This study highlights the low level of genetic diversity in the two largest managed gharial populations in the wild. Hence, it is recommended to assess the genetic status of extant wild and captive gharial populations for planning future translocation programmes to ensure long-term survival in the wild.

AB This study aimed to understand post-agricultural natural forest regeneration in the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest and its possible role as a cost-effective, passive approach to forest restoration. The study characterized vegetation structure, floristic composition, and the dynamics of secondary forest chronosequences. Data were collected from 159 plots (10 x 10 m each) across forest remnants in Santa Catarina State, covering forest ages that ranged from 2 to 60 years of regeneration after swidden agriculture. Only areas with no signs of degradation were sampled in order to provide a description of vegetation characteristics that could be used to identify and monitor natural regeneration. A total of 11,455 woody plants were identified and classified into 334 species representing 71 families. As the succession process unfolds, the continuous turnover of species makes forests more diverse and structurally complex. Floristic similarity among forest types is observed during the early stages of succession, but decreases over time. Pioneer species dominate young secondary forests, representing about 40% of the basal area up to 10 years of regeneration. Shade-tolerant species start colonizing the sites at early ages; however, they become more important structural elements only after 30 years of succession. The observed patterns of forest structure and species diversity largely conform to the post-agricultural succession seen in many tropical forests. The high species diversity found in this study highlights the importance of natural regeneration as a strategy to restore ecosystems. Floristic data can be used as a reference for choosing suitable species for active restoration, as well as contributing to the design of integrated restoration strategies. We herein reinforce the potential of natural regeneration as part of large-scale restoration programs, which would be particularly attractive to family farmers by the low cost of supplies and labor.

AB Background: Quantifying variation of genetic traits over the geographical range of species is crucial for understanding the factors driving their range dynamics. The center-periphery hypothesis postulates, and many studies support, the idea that genetic diversity decreases and genetic differentiation increases toward the geographical periphery due to population isolation. The effects of environmental marginality on genetic variation has however received much less attention.
   Methods: We tested the concordance between geographical and environmental gradients and the genetic predictions of center-periphery hypothesis for endemic Lilium pomponium in the southern Alps.
   Results: We found little evidence for concordance between genetic variation and both geographical and environmental gradients. Although the prediction of increased differentiation at range limits is met, genetic diversity does not decrease towards the geographical periphery. Increased differentiation among peripheral populations, that are not ecologically marginal, may be explained by a decrease in habitat availability that reduces population connectivity. In contrast, a decrease of genetic diversity along environmental but not geographical gradients may be due to the presence of low quality habitats in the different parts of the range of a species that reduce effective population size or increase environmental constraints. As a result, environmental factors may affect population dynamics irrespective of distance from the geographical center of the range. In such situations of discordance between geographical and environmental gradients, the predictions of decreasing genetic diversity and increasing differentiation toward the geographical periphery may not be respected.

AB Loss of tropical forests leads both to the loss of aboveground biodiversity and to the changes in belowground biological activity. Planted secondary forests return canopy cover, but the reversibility of belowground changes may depend on soil properties, forest age and tree species composition. We studied microbial communities in an array of soils in southern Vietnam under different vegetation: natural tropical forests, grasslands on deforested area and 20 and 30 years-old forest plantations. Conversion of natural forests into grasslands led to the loss of half of soil organic matter and microbial abundance, soil moisture decreased, bacterial community structure changed and beta-diversity increased. Bacterial alpha-diversity and pH were not affected by deforestation. Reforestation for 30 years restored bacterial and archaeal abundance, partially restored bacterial community structure, but did not restore fungal abundance and organic matter content. Thus, forest planting in southern Vietnam restores soil microbiome properties partially, but the complete restoration apparently requires much more than 30 years of secondary forest succession.

AB Background: Plant-pollinator mutualistic networks show non-random structural properties that promote species coexistence. However, these networks show high variability in the interacting species and their connections. Mismatch between plant and pollinator attributes can prevent interactions, while trait matching can enable exclusive access, promoting pollinators' niche partitioning and, ultimately, modularity. Thus, plants belonging to specialized modules should integrate their floral traits to optimize the pollination function. Herein, we aimed to analyze the biological processes involved in the structuring of plant-hummingbird networks by linking network morphological constraints, specialization, modularity and phenotypic floral integration.
   Methods: We investigated the understory plant-hummingbird network of two adjacent habitats in the Lacandona rainforest of Mexico, one characterized by lowland rainforest and the other by savanna-like vegetation. We performed monthly censuses to record plant-hummingbird interactions for 2 years (2018-2020). We also took hummingbird bill measurements and floral and nectar measurements. We summarized the interactions in a bipartite matrix and estimated three network descriptors: connectance, complementary specialization (H-2'), and nestedness. We also analyzed the modularity and average phenotypic floral integration index of each module.
   Results: Both habitats showed strong differences in the plant assemblage and network dynamics but were interconnected by the same four hummingbird species, two Hermits and two Emeralds, forming a single network of interaction. The whole network showed low levels of connectance (0.35) and high specialization (H-2' = 0.87). Flower morphologies ranged from generalized to specialized, but trait matching was an important network structurer. Modularity was associated with morphological specialization. The Hermits Phaethornis longirostris and P. striigularis each formed a module by themselves, and a third module was formed by the less-specialized Emeralds: Chlorestes candida and Amazilia tzacatl. The floral integration values were higher in specialized modules but not significantly higher than that formed by generalist species.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that biological processes derived from both trait matching and "forbidden" links, or nonmatched morphological attributes, might be important network drivers in tropical plant-hummingbird systems while morphological specialization plays a minor role in the phenotypic floral integration. The broad variety of corolla and bill shapes promoted niche partitioning, resulting in the modular organization of the assemblage according to morphological specialization. However, more research adding larger datasets of both the number of modules and pollination networks for a wider region is needed to conclude whether phenotypic floral integration increases with morphological specialization in plant-hummingbird systems.

AB Some types of plant accumulate liquid in their inflorescences creating phytotelmata. These environments protect the flowers against florivory, although they may be colonized by aquatic or semi-aquatic florivorous insect larvae, whose effects on the fitness of the plants remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis of floral antagonism by the occupants of phytotelmata, which predicts that florivory by the occupants of the phytotelmata represents a cost to the female fitness of the plant, reducing its fecundity. We manipulated experimentally the infestation by 3 florivores larvae species occupants of phytotelmata in inflorescences of Heliconia spathocircinata (Heliconiaceae) to test for negative direct trophic effects on the fecundity of the flowering and fruiting bracts. We found that the foraging of the hoverfly (Syrphidae) and moth (Lepidoptera) larvae in the inflorescences contributed to a decline in the fecundity of the plant. While the lepidopteran impacted fecundity when foraging in both flowering and fruiting bracts, the syrphid only affected the fruiting bracts, which indicates that the nectar and floral tissue are the principal resource exploited by the hoverfly. By contrast, soldier fly (Stratiomyidae) had a neutral effect on fecundity, while foraging in flowering or fruiting bracts. These findings corroborate our hypothesis, that herbivory by the larval occupants represents cost to the host plant having phytotelmata. The negative influence of this foraging on plant fecundity will nevertheless depend on the consequences of the exploitation of resources, which vary considerably in ephemeral habitats such as the phytotalmanta of flower parts.

AB The past 40 years in Southeast Asia have seen about 50% of lowland rainforests converted to oil palm and other plantations, and much of the remaining forest heavily logged. Little is known about how fragmentation influences recovery and whether climate change will hamper restoration. Here, we use repeat airborne LiDAR surveys spanning the hot and dry 2015-16 El Nino Southern Oscillation event to measure canopy height growth across 3,300ha of regenerating tropical forests spanning a logging intensity gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We show that the drought led to increased leaf shedding and branch fall. Short forest, regenerating after heavy logging, continued to grow despite higher evaporative demand, except when it was located close to oil palm plantations. Edge effects from the plantations extended over 300 metres into the forests. Forest growth on hilltops and slopes was particularly impacted by the combination of fragmentation and drought, but even riparian forests located within 40m of oil palm plantations lost canopy height during the drought. Our results suggest that small patches of logged forest within plantation landscapes will be slow to recover, particularly as ENSO events are becoming more frequent. It is unclear whether tropical forest fragments within plantation landscapes are resilient to drought. Here the authors analyse LiDAR and ground-based data from the 2015-16 El Nino event across a logging intensity gradient in Borneo. Although regenerating forests continued to grow, canopy height near oil palm plantations decreased, and a strong edge effect extended up to at least 300m away.

AB Invasive predators are known to have negative consumptive and non-consumptive effects on native species, but few examples show how the abundance of native prey may influence an established invasive predator. We compared invasive brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis; BTS) found in caves occupied by endangered Mariana swiftlets (Aerodramus bartschi) to snakes found in nearby forests and caves without birds to quantify how the abundance of native avian prey impacts BTS abundance and behavior on Guam. From 2011 to 2017 we removed 151 BTS in caves occupied by swiftlets and never observed BTS in caves without birds. Notable locations included snakes foraging near swiftlets and in holes that allowed cave access and escape from capture. Of 43 BTS with gut contents, 27 (63%) contained swiftlets. BTS in swiftlet-occupied caves had greater fat mass compared to forests, indicating access to swiftlets may increase body condition and promote reproduction. Number of ovarian follicles was significantly greater in female snakes from swiftlet-occupied caves compared to those from ravine, but not limestone forests; evidence of male BTS being more capable of reproduction was limited (i.e., fewer non-discernible but not significantly larger testes in snakes from caves). Assuming other limiting factors are considered, altering the functional response of predators through the modification of caves or interdiction lures to exclude or hinder the largest BTS could bolster swiftlet populations by increasing nesting refugia in currently-occupied caves and facilitate recolonization of historical caves.

AB Based on microsatellite markers and non-lethal sampling of orchid bee males, we assessed the genetic diversity and population structure of three species, Euglossa pleosticta, Euglossa imperialis, and Eulaema nigrita, collected from forest remnants in the Brazilian savanna biome. Among these species, El. nigrita has being acknowledged as more tolerant to savanic areas, since it is more frequently found in these habitats than the other two species. Thus, we hypothesized that species more associated with forest areas would show lower levels of genetic diversity and higher levels of population structure, since open areas could represent a barrier to the movement of these species. We observed lower levels of genetic diversity (H-E ) in the species highly associated with forest areas (Eg. pleosticta, H-E = 0.66; Eg. imperialis, H-E = 0.44) compared to El. nigrita (H-E = 0.81). Concerning the genetic structure, it was only remarkable among samples of Eg. pleosticta, a species strongly associated with the forest remnants. Despite the documented dispersal capacity of euglossine bees, maintenance of the connections among forest areas in this biome seems to be critical for their conservation in the Brazilian savanna.

AB The black-throated trogon, Trogon rufus, is a widespread, polytypic species-complex with a convoluted taxonomic history. Here, we integrated morphological, vocal and genetic datasets, including spectral data and digital quantification of barred plumage, to assess and redefine its species limits according to the foremost species concepts. We suggest the recognition of four named and one new species. Trogon tenellus and T. cupreicauda are divergent across Central and South America without geographic overlap or intermediates. Trogon chrysochloros in the Atlantic Forests of Brazil is phenotypically, genetically and ecologically distinct. In Amazonia, Trogon rufus consists of three phenotypically distinct subspecies intergrading with each other in a ring-like formation around central Amazonian rivers. Trogon rufus rufus in the Guiana Shield, Trogon rufus amazonicus in south-eastern Amazonia and Trogon rufus sulphureus in western Amazonia, with contact across the Lower Amazon and Madeira rivers, likely due to secondary contact between incompletely diverged lineages. The unique combination of song, morphology and mtDNA features of an unnamed, isolated population in the Atlantic Forest of north-eastern Brazil resulted in its description as a new species, known only from the type locality and considered here as Critically Endangered, requiring urgent conservation actions.

AB Fire is one of the most powerful modifiers of the Amazonian landscape and knowledge about its drivers is needed for planning control and suppression. A plethora of factors may play a role in the annual dynamics of fire frequency, spanning the biophysical, climatic, socioeconomic and institutional dimensions. To uncover the main forces currently at play, we investigated the area burned in both forested and deforested areas in the outstanding case of Brazil?s state of Acre, in southwestern Amazonia. We mapped burn scars in already-deforested areas and intact forest based on satellite images from the Landsat series analyzed between 2016 and 2019. The mapped burnings in already-deforested areas totalled 550,251 ha. In addition, we mapped three forest fires totaling 34,084 ha. Fire and deforestation were highly correlated, and the latter occurred mainly in federal government lands, with protected areas showing unprecedented forest fire levels in 2019. These results indicate that Acre state is under increased fire risk even during average rainfall years. The record fires of 2019 may continue if Brazil?s ongoing softening of environmental regulations and enforcement is maintained. Acre and other Amazonian states must act quickly to avoid an upsurge of social and economic losses in the coming years.

TI Forest remnants in private lands are critical to the persistence of

ID SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; TROPICAL FORESTS; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION;

AB Deforestation is considered the main human-induced and short-term threat to the persistence of forest species in the Amazon. Long-lasting and high-intensity deforestation, low coverage of protected areas, and high level of species endemism make the Bele ' m Endemism Area (BEA) particularly more vulnerable than the rest of the Amazon area. However, this occurrence remains strongly neglected in global and regional conservation analyses. In this study, we used species distribution modeling and remote sensing data to map the richness pattern of endangered birds from the Amazon and assessed the species' conservation status based on landscape patterns of forest remnants. Our results revealed that the BEA's imperiled avifauna presents the most significant state of vulnerability to extinction compared with other areas of endemism in the Amazon. Almost 80 % of the total area of the BEA presents a strong anthropization of natural ecosystems. Of the 20 % of the area with high conservation value remnants, only 25 % is within protected areas, whereas the other 75 % is under private property domains. Moreover, forest remnants on private properties have a higher biodiversity conservation value as they are home to more threatened bird species than remnants within protected areas. Therefore, we argue that effective implementation of conservation of threatened bird species in the BEA depends directly on the maintenance of forest remnants on private properties from practical conservation actions.

AB Introduced species often disrupt established food webs, but some native predators can come to rely on introduced prey. Understanding the net effects of the non-natives on imperiled predators is crucial for planning conservation measures. The invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) can be prey, predator, and competitor for the critically endangered San Francisco garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia). We examined the seasonal prey use of a San Francisco garter snake population that co-occurs with American bullfrogs to examine intraguild predation between these species. Juvenile and adult snakes mainly consumed native anurans instead of American bullfrogs, and this diet pattern peaked in spring, a critical foraging period for the snakes. In spring, large adult American bullfrogs also foraged heavily on native anurans and displayed a high degree of diet overlap with San Francisco garter snakes. Invasive American bullfrogs are detrimental to San Francisco garter snakes mainly through seasonal competition rather than reciprocal predation. Removal of invasive species provided further evidence that eliminating American bullfrogs can benefit San Francisco garter snakes by reducing predation pressure on their shared amphibian prey. Better understanding the interactions of invasive species with native species of conservation concern informs management practices and improves conservation outcomes.

AB Premise of research. Conservation of imperiled plant species can benefit from ex situ collections, including the living collections of botanic gardens and arboreta. Such living collections should strive to capture and maintain the genetic diversity found in the remaining wild populations. Ex situ collections may also harbor genetic variability that has been lost from wild populations. Quercus hinckleyi is an extremely rare (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources [IUCN] Critically Endangered) oak known from a few sites in Presidio County, Texas. It is the only native US oak protected under the Endangered Species Act. Here we evaluate the genetic variation of the Q. hinckleyi ex situ metacollection relative to that of the remnant in situ population.
   Methodology. We apply microsatellite genotyping to Q. hinckleyi sampled from plants growing in ex situ collections (N=22, from nine gardens) and compare the results with genetic studies of the in situ population. We compare allelic diversity, genotypic diversity, and population structure.
   Pivotal results. The ex situ metacollection is small but has high allelic diversity and captures about 57% of the allelic diversity of the wild population. Ex situ plants contain 22 new alleles that contribute 13% of the species' total allelic diversity. All ex situ individuals have unique genotypes, none of which were found in situ, and thus they comprise 15% of the species' genotypic variation. The ex situ plants align with only one of three genetic clusters identified in situ, demonstrating an important gap in the ex situ metacollection.
   Conclusions. The ex situ collection of Q. hinckleyi, while small, is genetically diverse and provides additional allelic and genotypic diversity not currently existing in situ. However, a significant portion of genetic diversity is lacking from ex situ plants, with the metacollection likely derived from only one of the in situ clusters. Collecting seed from the other clusters is a high priority.

AB Polylepis forests are endemic to the high-Andes, with trees characterized by multi-layered, exfoliating bark-providing protection against harsh, high-elevation conditions, both for individual trees and the wide array of organisms dependent on them. However, Polylepis habitat has suffered severe human-induced land conversion and currently mainly occurs as fragmented remnants only. Here, we studied the effects of fragment size on local ambient temperature and on biomass of bark and its bark-dwelling arthropods. We did so by comparing multiple samples at the edge and interior of both large and small fragments, while also accounting for branch size, tree width, and tree structure. Because arthropod biomass is likely to impact higher trophic levels, we also studied abundance and foraging behavior of two bird species specialized on Polylepis forest. We show that arthropod biomass was relatively higher in wider, larger trees, which were preferred for foraging by both bird species. Moreover, we show that small forest fragments are not only environmentally less buffered but are also characterized by lower amounts of bark and lower densities of bark-dwelling arthropods than larger fragments. Our study highlights the conservation value of large trees. Also, we advise it is now timely to test to what degree restoration efforts to increase fragment size could mitigate the negative effects of reduced arthropod biomass for higher trophic levels of endemic specialist insectivores.

AB This article examines the structure and performance of conservation agreements, which are relational contracts used across the world to protect natural resources. Key elements of these agreements are (1) they are ongoing arrangements between a local community and an outside party, typically a non-governmental organization (NGO); (2) they feature payments in exchange for conservation services; (3) the prospects for success depend on the NGO engaging in costly monitoring to detect whether the community is foregoing short-term gains to protect the resource; (4) lacking a strong external enforcement system, they rely on self-enforcement; and (5) the parties have the opportunity to renegotiate at any time. A repeated-game model is developed and utilized to organize an evaluation of real conservation agreements, using three case studies as representative examples.

AB Although there are several nuisance species of serpulids reported worldwide, the present study shows that some of them have been overlooked even in geographic areas that are considered well studied. We report for the first time in Majorca the invasive species Ficopomatus enigmaticus and the first records for the Balearic Islands of the also non-native species Hydroides dianthus, H. dirampha, H. elegans and H. nigra. The most abundant species were F. enigmaticus, found at higher densities in Portixol (with up to 280 ind. m(-2)), and H. elegans, found at highest densities in the port of Palma (with up to 270 ind. m(-2)). Species have been identified after morphological examination and corroborated by mitochondrial DNA sequence data: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb). Molecular data show that the same haplotypes have been found in distant and disjoint biogeographic areas worldwide, which is only explicable by unintentional translocation of specimens through vectors (i.e. ship hulls or ballast water). Species delimitation analyses support previous findings that species complexes are common in both Ficopomatus and Hydroides. In fact, only among the Majorcan samples were we able to detect three species of the F. enigmaticus species complex, two of the H. elegans species complex and two of the H. dianthus species complex. The genetic distances between members of the F. enigmaticus species complex are 8.7% to 16.7% in COI sequences. The species of Hydroides hold 5.4% to 47.6 % genetic divergence between species of the same complex.

AB Adult animals across many taxa use appeasement signaling to minimize or avoid costly conflict in social settings by jointly communicating their consent to defer and an interest to remain. When foraging, however, appeasement may not be enough to gain access to a resource controlled by a dominant conspecific. in this case, conspecific recruitment can shift the social dynamic, so the resource becomes accessible to all. Striated Caracara (Phalcoboenus australis) are Near Threatened scavenging falconids that breed in high densities on the extreme southern coasts of South America and the Falkland Islands. While juvenile caracaras recruit other caracaras to concentrated food resources, neither recruitment nor appeasement has been reported in adults. Here we describe a female adult caracara that appeared to use both appeasement signaling and recruitment to access food in another pair's defended territory on New Island, Falkland Islands. Appeasement and recruitment calls are one of several behavioral parallels that researchers have noted among Striated Caracara, Common Raven (Corvus corax), and Kea (Nestor notabilis). Although lalconids are not typically considered in comparative studies of avian cognition and social behavior, we suggest that camcaras merit further attention, especially given their relationship to parrots in the Glade Eufalconimorphae.

AB This study investigates the potential effects of historical deforestation in South America using a regional climate model driven with reanalysis data. Two different sources of data were used to quantify deforestation during the 1980s to 2010s, leading to two scenarios of forest loss: smaller but spatially continuous in scenario 1 and larger but spatially scattered in scenario 2. The model simulates a generally warmer and drier local climate following deforestation. Vegetation canopy becomes warmer due to reduced canopy evapotranspiration, and ground becomes warmer due to more radiation reaching the ground. The warming signal for surface air is weaker than for ground and vegetation, likely due to reduced surface roughness suppressing the sensible heat flux. For surface air over deforested areas, the warming signal is stronger for the nighttime minimum temperature and weaker or even becomes a cooling signal for the daytime maximum temperature, due to the strong radiative effects of albedo at midday, which reduces the diurnal amplitude of temperature. The drying signals over deforested areas include lower atmospheric humidity, less precipitation, and drier soil. The model identifies the La Plata basin as a region remotely influenced by deforestation, where a simulated increase of precipitation leads to wetter soil, higher ET, and a strong surface cooling. Over both deforested and remote areas, the deforestation-induced surface climate changes are much stronger in scenario 2 than scenario 1; coarse-resolution data and models (such as in scenario 1) cannot represent the detailed spatial structure of deforestation and underestimate its impact on local and regional climates.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) provide incentives to landowners to manage resources in ways that deliver ecosystem services, such as through restoration activities. Under a proliferation of initiatives to restore degraded lands, innovative institutional arrangements that promote ecological restoration are emerging. However, exclusion of the human factor is considered a limitation of restoration theory and practice, and recognition of men's and women's roles in restoring landscapes is largely neglected. As the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration commences, this study uses PES as an entry point to explore gender equity in restoration projects. Focused on the Mara North Conservancy in Kenya, the study presents a framework for which qualitative approaches including Process Net-map and intra-household interviews are applied to uncover drivers and constraints associated with processes of gender exclusion and inclusion. The results reveal that 1) power imbalances condition socio-economic outcomes of PES schemes by reinforcing historical inequities in land tenure, and that 2) governance structures exclude women from decision-making processes and from receiving direct PES benefits despite their labor contributions to restoration activities; while men incur financial costs that are not adequately accounted for under direct payments. The study demonstrates the potential to apply new methodologies and define indicators that enable the identification of complex social dimensions in ecological restoration. Critical reflection on whether the neglect of social aspects restrict the potential for ecological restoration to address the very same inequities that contribute to degradation of threatened landscapes is encouraged.

AB Short mackerel, Rastrelliger brachysoma, is one of commercially important marine species in the Gulf of Thailand. The mackerel resource has been faced with overfishing and sharply declined. Here, genetic mixed-stock analysis was performed using eleven microsatellite loci on 1675 short mackerel individuals caught, in 2014, from its four major fishing grounds of Thai waters in the Gulf of Thailand. Short mackerel populations from Thai, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Malaysian waters in the Gulf of Thailand were used as baselines. The mixed-stock analysis revealed that these populations significantly contributed to catches of the four fishing grounds in Thai water. The Samut Songkhram population, representing sedentary behavior, was the major contributor (52.71 %) to the total catch from the Inner Gulf of Thailand. The Surat Thani population dominantly contributed 46.23 % to the total catch from lower part of the Central Gulf of Thailand, where the fishing ground surrounds its spawning ground. The populations from Cambodia and Malaysia corporately contributed of 70.95 % and 87.88 % to the total catches from the Eastern Gulf of Thailand and upper part of the Central Gulf of Thailand, respectively. According to these analysis results, the populations from neighboring countries to Thailand displayed transboundary migration and significantly contributed to fishery catches in the Thai water. Therefore, profound sub-regional cooperation from Gulf of Thailand countries is required for effective fishery management of the short mackerel resource to be sustainable.

AB Currently, landscape connectivity studies are key in spatial planning for ecosystems conservation. Nevertheless, there are only a few studies that give empiric data about the positive effects of connectivity on terrestrial conservation ecosystems. In this piece of the research, we present a review of the literature of connectivity on four recently identified research topics carried out from 2000 to 2018 in Latin America. We identify the current stage, recent advance and challenges about connectivity knowledge. The scientific review used several databases on the web, from wich we selected 217 articles. The selected publications were included in a database considering: a) publication year, b) research type, c) country studied, d) ecosystem studied and f) and research aims. Our results depicted that connectivity studies focus on the topics: a) in restoration planning, b) land cover/land use change modeling and planning and c) ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the publications about connectivity and climate change have been limited. We also identified some publications tackling two or three topics simultaneously: a) land cover/land use change modeling and planning with restoration planning, b) ecosystem services with climate change, and c) restoration planning with climate change. However, there is a necessity to increase the connectivity research on Latin America.

AB Since the 1950s, nine alien crayfish species have been introduced in the Rhine-Meuse river delta. Seven species originate from North America, one from Southeast Europe and one from East Europe/Asia. Currently, at least seven species have well-established populations. Five species are listed as invasive alien species (IAS) of European Union (EU) concern (i.e. Faxonius limosus, Faxonius virilis, Pacifastacus leniusculus, Procambarus clarkii and Procambarus virginalis). All crayfish species of EU concern are subject to restrictions on keeping, transportation, importing, selling and breeding. Member States are required to take action on pathways of unintentional introduction, to perform measures for early detection and rapid eradication of these species, and to manage species that are already widely spread. The impact of these IAS on biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems mainly results from transmission of the crayfish plague pathogen Aphanomyces astaci, predation on native fauna, and fragmentation and consumption of aquatic plants. Moreover, burrowing activities of some IAS cause bank instability, increase risk of dike breaches in peatland areas and enhance sedimentation rates in ditches and canals. First-line risk assessments for the Rhine-Meuse river district with the Harmonia(+) scheme shows that seven crayfish species have a high risk of impact on biodiversity, water safety and ecological status of water bodies. Four species have already established populations in this area of concern. The risk of spread via interconnected rivers, canals and small watercourses is high for all species of North American origin. Eradication of alien crayfish populations in an extensive and open network of interconnected watercourses is not feasible. Six management strategies for control of alien crayfish species were formulated. These strategies were assessed using various criteria for cost-effectivity and subsequently prioritized using an unweighted Multi Criteria Analysis. Feasible strategies for population control of invasive crayfish species combine a) measures for enhancing robustness and resilience of ecosystems, and b) crayfish trapping by commercial fishermen, water authorities and well-informed citizens.

TI High gene flow in polar cod (Boreogadus saida) from West-Svalbard and
   the Eurasian Basin
SO JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY

DT Article
DE central Arctic Ocean; connectivity; DNA microsatellites; population
   differentiation; population structure
AB The current and projected environmental change of the Arctic Ocean contrasts sharply with the limited knowledge of its genetic biodiversity. Polar cod Boreogadus saida (Lepechin, 1774) is an abundant circumpolar marine fish and ecological key species. The central role of polar cod in the Arctic marine food web warrants a better understanding of its population structure and connectivity. In this study, the genetic population structure of 171 juveniles, collected from several fjords off West-Svalbard (Billefjorden, Hornsund and Kongsfjorden), the northern Sophia Basin and the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, was analysed using nine DNA microsatellite loci. Genetic analyses indicated moderate to high genetic diversity, but absence of spatial population structure and isolation-by-distance, suggesting ongoing gene flow between the studied sampling regions. High levels of connectivity may be key for polar cod to maintain populations across wide spatial scales. The adaptive capacity of the species will be increasingly important to face challenges such as habitat fragmentation, ocean warming and changes in prey composition. In view of a limited understanding of the population dynamics and evolution of polar cod, a valuable next step to predict future developments should be an integrated biological evaluation, including population genomics, a life-history approach, and habitat and biophysical dispersal modelling.

TI Ineffective nuptial gifts suggest female emancipation from sensory
   exploitation
SO BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Female preferences; Male silk effort; Nuptial gifts; Secondary sexual
   traits; Sexual selection
AB Male sensory exploitation of female gustatory pre-existing bias has been proposed for the origin of nuptial gifts in insects and spiders. This sexual trait may have been beneficial to both sexes, giving mating and survival advantages to males and providing nutritional resources for females. However, the evolution of deceptive worthless gifts is against females' interests and may trigger a co-evolutionary change in females' preferences. We evaluated females' preferences for nuptial gifts and the adaptive function of the gift in the spider Trechaleoides keyserlingi. The genus belongs to the understudied Neotropical family Trechaleidae in which nuptial gifts are widespread. The family is composed of only two species, and the gift seems to be absent in the sister species, creating a relevant scenario for understanding co-evolutionary processes. In the laboratory, we found that although males invested more in nuptial gifts when encountering mated females compared to unmated, they had similar mating access and duration than males lacking a gift. We also found an absence of female choice between males offering nutritive and worthless gifts. Few females were aggressive and cannibalized males, and we did not find evidence that the gift protected males from cannibalism. In the field, 50% of the gifts were worthless items. This is congruent with the laboratory findings where males offering worthless gifts seem to better attract females, which we discuss in the context of exploitation of female gustatory bias. We therefore propose that females may have evolved indifference for the gift and that gift-giving in this species represents a currently non-functional remnant of a behaviour. Significance statement Nutritive nuptial gifts can exploit female gustatory preferences, with mutual benefits for both sexes: males can increase mating success and survival, while females increase their fecundity. But males can offer worthless gifts leading females to suboptimal matings, and in turn females can evolve indifference for the trait. The spider genus Trechaleoides is ideal to examine this process because gift-giving behaviour is present in one species and absent in the other. We examined females' preferences for nuptial gifts and its function for males in the gift-giving species T. keyserlingi. We found that males invest in a gift but gain no reproductive advantage, as females were equally likely to mate with them regardless of whether they offered a gift or whether the gift was nutritive or worthless. We propose that females may have changed their preferences and that the gift is a remnant non-functional trait.

AB Following timber harvests in bottomland mixed- oak (Quercus L.) stands, desirable oak advance regeneration can be overgrown by shade-intolerant pioneer species. We investigated the effects of group selection opening size on composition of tree regeneration 19 years postharvest in an oak-dominated bottomland forest and compared results with earlier findings to evaluate development trends. In response to six opening sizes (7-40 m radii), we evaluated regeneration density and dominance of four tree species groups: conifers, hard mast, shade-intolerant hardwoods, and shade-tolerant hardwoods. Our objectives were to determine the optimum gap size for regenerating oaks and test the delayed oak dominance hypothesis, in which oaks slowly gain dominance as pioneer species undergo self-thinning. Opening size influenced conifer regeneration but minimally affected hardwoods. Hard mast species density was less than that of either intolerant or tolerant species regardless of opening size. Future stem density trends suggest increasing intolerant species and constant mast and tolerant species. Modeled future height trends suggest increasing mast species dominance over intolerant pioneers after 30 years. Our results suggest that gap-based silviculture can be used to regenerate bottomland hardwood stands with desirable species including oaks; larger gaps favor conifers but there was no optimum size to enhance oak regeneration.

   species; mutualism; myrmecochory; seed dispersal
AB Seed dispersal by ants is an important interaction in North American eastern deciduous forests, where 30-40% of understory plants are myrmecochores, with seeds that possess lipid-rich appendages (elaiosomes) that attract seed-dispersing ants. Contemporary forests are fragmented and have regenerated from being previously cleared (secondary forests). In secondary forests, and especially along edges, myrmecochores are a depauperate component of forests. Here, we assess if seed dispersal of myrmecochores by ants, particularly the keystone disperser, Aphaenogaster sp., is intact in forest interiors compared to edges. In three North American northeastern deciduous forests, we compared myrmecochore cover and richness, seed dispersal by ants, and the abundance and richness of ants and other forest floor invertebrates between interiors and edges. We also conducted a seed removal experiment, excluding either ants, rodents (seed predators), or ants and rodents, to test their effects on seed dispersal between interiors and edges. We found differences in the composition of understory plants between interiors and edges, with edges lacking myrmecochores. We also found that seed dispersal by ants was lower in two of the three edges and corresponded to Aphaenogaster sp. abundance. Antagonistic interactions with an invasive slug that is an elaiosome robber, Arion subfuscus, was more apparent than damage by rodents in the experiment, negatively affected dispersal by ants more at edges than in interiors. Here we show that changes in mutualistic and antagonistic interactions affect seed dispersal at forest edges and that not all forest edges are the same, with some more intact than others. Understanding how seed dispersal is impacted in contemporary forests is important towards the goal of conserving and restoring depauperate forest understory communities.

AB Identification of priority areas for conservation is crucial for the maintenance and protection of biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where biodiversity continues to be lost at alarming rates. Surveys and research on umbrella species can provide efficient and effective approaches to identify potential areas for conservation at small geographical scales. Army ants of the genus Eciton are keystone species in neotropical forests due to their major role as top predators and due to the numerous vertebrate- and invertebrate associated species that depend upon their colonies for survival. These associates range from the iconic army ant-following birds to a wide range of arthropod groups, some of which have evolved intricate morphological, behavioural and/or chemical strategies to conceal their presence and integrate into the colony life. Furthermore, Eciton colonies require large forested areas that support a diverse leaf litter prey community and several field-based and genetic studies have demonstrated the negative consequences of forest fragmentation for the long-term maintenance of these colonies. Therefore, Eciton species will not only act as umbrella for their associates but also for many other species in neotropical forests, in particular for those that require a large extent of forest. This review summarises past and recent accounts of the main taxonomic groups found associated with Eciton colonies, as well research assessing the impact of forest fragmentation on this army ant, to encourage the adoption of Eciton army ants as umbrella species for the identification of priority areas for conservation and assessments of the effect of disturbance in neotropical forests.

AB The multiple-use approach to forestry applied in Germany aims to combine timber production and habitat management by preserving specific stand structures. We selected four forest stand types comprising (i) pure oak, (ii) equal oak-pine mixtures, (iii) single tree admixtures of oak in pine forest and (iv) pure pine. We analysed the effects of stand composition parameters on species representative of the larger carabid beetles (Carabus arvensis, C. coriaceus, C. hortensis, C. violaceus, Calosoma inquisitor). The main statistical methods used were correlation analyses and generalised linear mixed models. Cal. inquisitor was observed in pure oak forests exclusively. C. coriaceus and C. hortensis were absent from pure pine stands. High activity densities of C. arvensis and C. violaceus were observed in all four forest types. When assessed at the smaller scales of species crown cover proportions and spatial tree species effect zones, C. hortensis was found to be positively related to oak trees with a regular spatial distribution, whereas C. coriaceus preferred lower and more aggregated oak tree proportions. C. violaceus showed strong sex-specific tree species affinities. Information about preferences of carabid beetles is necessary for management activities targeting the adaptation of forest structures to habitat requirements.

AB Questions In fire-prone ecosystems, fire can enhance the flowering and fruiting of many species, a strategy assumed to be well represented in savanna. Despite this, there are surprisingly few studies assessing how prevalent fire-stimulated flowering is. Thus, we asked: (a) are there differences in the reproductive phenology of Cerrado plants between recently burned and unburned areas; (b) how does fire affect the speed of flowering and how does this differ between growth forms; and (c) what are the post-fire flowering (PFF) strategies of Cerrado species and is there evidence for high proportions of obligate PFF?
   Location Open savannas (campo sujo in the Cerrado) in Central Brazil (Reserva Natural Serra do Tombador - RNST, 13 degrees 35-13 degrees 38' S and 47 degrees 45'-47 degrees 51' W).
   Methods We established six plots, three recently and frequently burned (FB) and three excluded from fire for six years (E). In all treatments, the number of species flowering and fruiting was counted every 15 days for three months, and then at six, nine and 12 months after fire. We also counted the number of reproductive and vegetative shoots in 10 subplots (1 m x 1 m) per plot.
   Results Approximately 66% of species studied were fire-stimulated, with half of these only flowering after fire (obligate PFF). Fire-enhanced flowering was rapid, with the clearest differences between burned and unburned plots seen in the first 30 days, and up to three months after fire, where there were up to two times more species flowering in the FB than E areas.
   Conclusions The extremely high proportion of PFF species, at least five times that reported for heathlands and other shrub communities, highlights the role that short-interval fire regimes have in savanna ecosystems, selecting for resprouting life forms and PFF dominance, particularly in herbaceous species. Rapid post-fire reproduction may be a strategy to disperse large quantities of seed into an environment with a small recruitment window.

AB The role of the human-made structures in coastal ecosystems can determine the spatial distribution or patterns of spatial abundances of marine organisms. To contribute to the understanding of linkages between different components of habitats (i.e. natural and artificial structures), we explored the role of type of larval development (planktotrophic vs. non-planktotrophic) on patterns of spatial variation of gastropods on rocky shores, elucidating the possible responsibility of habitat fragmentation on their distribution. Obtained results suggest that habitat fragmentation affects differently the patterns of variability of species with different types of larval development. Namely, fragmentation caused by artificial structures mostly influence variability of species with non-planktotrophic development. Moreover, although abundance of the species with non-planktotrophic development varied at small spatial scales, suggesting that processes operating at this scale are likely the main drivers of their distribution, changes in species variability were not associated with differences in species abundance among habitats.

AB Different types of matrices can perform different disturbance regimes over remnant forests, which can ultimately affect plant diversity. To address these issues, we studied 60 plots in forest remnants embedded within sugarcane plantations and pasturelands in the Atlantic Forest of Southeastern Brazil. Our objectives were to evaluate general patterns of plant diversity and to assess the influence of landscape structure and dynamics on plant richness and diversity. We recorded 297 species in two strata. (DBH superior stratum >= 4.8 cm > inferior stratum). Overall, diversity of the inferior stratum was higher in pastureland forest remnants than in sugarcane matrices. In the superior stratum, time since abandonment represented a greater influence. Considering the partition of diversity, more than 40% of total diversity was due to the alpha component alone in all cases, but it was significantly lower than expected. Beta components among forest remnants, landscapes and matrices were higher than expected for both strata, whether together or separately. Habitat heterogeneity showed a higher contribution to the total floristic diversity, but among remnants this contribution was even more significant. Forest remnants in pasturelands had a more dynamic land use history and parameters of landscape dynamics were more related to plant diversity. For remnants in the sugarcane matrices, species richness and composition were explained by landscape structure. Our results highlight that there is an important plant community diffused in the forest remnants of human-modified landscapes. Therefore, conserving the majority of remnants and restoring degraded ones must be a key conservation strategy. (C) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecol ogica e Conservacao.

AB The tribe Oryzomyini is an impressive group of rodents, comprising 30 extant genera and an estimated 147 species. Recent remarkable advances in the understanding of the diversity, taxonomy and systematics of the tribe have mostly derived from analyses of single or few genetic markers. However, the evolutionary history and biogeography of Oryzomyini, its origin and diversification across the Neotropics, remain unrevealed. Here we use a multi-locus dataset (over 400 loci) obtained through anchored phylogenomics to provide a genome-wide phylogenetic hypothesis for Oryzomyini and to investigate the tempo and mode of its evolution. Species tree and supermatrix analyses produced topologies with strong support for most branches, with all genera confirmed as monophyletic, a result that previous studies failed to obtain. Our analyses also corroborated the monophyly and phylogenetic relationship of three main clades of Oryzomyini (B, C and D). The origin of the tribe is estimated to be in the Miocene (8.93-5.38 million years ago). The cladogenetic events leading to the four main clades occurred during the late Miocene and early Pliocene and most speciation events in the Pleistocene. Geographic range estimates suggested an east of Andes origin for the ancestor of oryzomyines, most likely in the Boreal Brazilian region, which includes the north bank of Rio Amazonas and the Guiana Shield. Oryzomyini rodents are an autochthonous South America radiation, that colonized areas and dominions of this continent mainly by dispersal events. The evolutionary history of the tribe is deeply associated with the Andean cordillera and the landscape history of Amazon basin.

AB The objective of this present study was to understand the distribution patterns of various forms of soil phosphorus (P) and the biotic and abiotic factors affecting the soil P fractions under long-term cover crops. Here, we investigated the characteristics of soil P forms, community structure of P-solubilizing bacteria (using 16S rRNA) and the related enzyme activity under clean tillage (CT), 14 years of white clover (WC, Trifolium repens L.) and orchard grass (OG, Dactylis glomerata L.) cover crops in a rain-fed apple orchard on the Weibei Loess Plateau, China. Relative to CT treatment, long-term cover crops enhanced the bioavailability of soil P by increasing the contents of total phosphorus (TP), microbial phosphorus (MBP), organic phosphorus (Po) and certain forms of inorganic phosphorus (e.g. Al-P, Ca-2-P, Ca-8-P and Fe-P) in the surface soil, in addition, WC treatment also increase the available P (AP) contents in the topsoil. A redundant analysis (RDA) showed that soil organic matter (SOM), NH4+-N and pH were the key environmental factors affecting the morphological changes of soil P. In addition, the effects of long-term cover crops on soil P forms were mainly concentrated in the topsoil, and the WC treatment had a greater impact on soil P composition than the OG treatment. Interestingly, long-term cover crops effectively increased the abundances of P-solubilizing bacteria, such as Streptomyces, Sphingomonas, Nocardioides and Haliangium, and enhanced the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Overall, long-term cover crops were an effective strategy to activate soil P as they improve the soil environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic differentiation plays an essential role in the assessment of metapopulation systems of conservation concern. Migration rates affect the degree of genetic differentiation between subpopulations, with increasing genetic differentiation leading to increasing extinction risk. Analyses of genetic differentiation repeated over time together with projections into the future are therefore important to inform conservation. We investigated genetic differentiation in a closed metapopulation system of an obligate forest grouse, the Western capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, by comparing microsatellite population structure between a historic and a recent time period. We found an increase in genetic differentiation over a period of approximately 15 years. Making use of forward simulations accounting for population dynamics and genetics from both time periods, we explored future genetic differentiation by implementing scenarios of differing migration rates. Using migration rates derived from the recent dataset, simulations predicted further increase of genetic differentiation by 2050. We then examined effects of two realistic yet hypothetical migration scenarios on genetic differentiation. While isolation of a subpopulation led to overall increased genetic differentiation, the re-establishment of connectivity between two subpopulations maintained genetic differentiation at recent levels. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining connectivity between subpopulations in order to prevent further genetic differentiation and loss of genetic variation. The simulation set-up we developed is highly adaptable and will aid researchers and conservationists alike in anticipating consequences of conservation strategies for metapopulation systems.

AB The success of species depends on their ability to exploit ecological resources in order to optimize their reproduction. However, species are not usually found within single-species ecosystems but in complex communities. Because of their genetic relatedness, closely related lineages tend to cluster within the same ecosystem, rely on the same resources, and be phenotypically similar. In sympatry, they will therefore compete for the same resources and, in the case of flowering plants, exchange their genes through heterospecific pollen transfer. These interactions, nevertheless, pose significant challenges to species co-existence because they can lead to resource limitation and reproductive interference. In such cases, divergent selective pressures on floral traits will favour genotypes that isolate or desynchronize the reproduction of sympatric lineages. The resulting displacement of reproductive characters will, in turn, lead to pre-mating isolation and promote intraspecific divergence, thus initiating or reinforcing the speciation process. In this review, we discuss the current theoretical and empirical knowledge on the influence of heterospecific pollen transfer on flower evolution, highlighting its potential to uncover the ecological and genomic constraints shaping the speciation process.

AB Agricultural expansion has contributed to the loss and fragmentation of natural habitats and, as a consequence, the edge effect in these habitats has increased, leading to nest predation rates higher at the edge of fragments than in the interior. Living fences in abandoned croplands, however, add a structural component to the landscape which can help to mitigate the effects of disturbance. We used artificial nests to assess whether a living fence at the edge of a fragment of tropical dry forest, immersed in an agricultural landscape, can assuage the edge effect by decreasing predation rates. We identified the predators that attacked nests at several distances from the living fence and related the frequency of predator attacks with plant height, leaf height diversity, and tree and herb coverage. Vegetation structure of the living fence was vertically more complex than that found inside the fragment. 52% of nests were predated and we did not find a significant relationship between predation rates and the proximity of nests to the living fence, suggesting a null edge effect on predation. Birds were the most frequent predators, followed by rodents and carnivorous mammals, with the composition of predators varying among transects. The composition of predators and vegetation structure of the living fence were the factors that explained the null edge effect on nests predation. Our results indicate that the presence of a living fence at the edge of a fragment in agroforestry systems could mitigate the edge effects on nest predation.

AB Habitat use is a dynamic process that varies spatially and temporally. Such variations can be associated with environmental heterogeneity and seasonal fluctuations in food availability. We investigated the habitat use of three sympatric Amazonian primates (Humboldt's cuxiu-Chiropotes sagulatus, pied tamarin-Saguinus bicolor, and tufted capuchin monkey-Sapajus apella) along a topographic gradient and across two seasons with contrasting food resource availability. Through sampling conducted along linear transects, in an area covering 25 km(2) of continuous dense rainforest in central Amazonian Brazil, we obtained 137 primate records with 420 km of sampling effort. Although the slope of the terrain used did not differ between seasons, the distribution of two primate species with contrasting food habits (Humboldt's cuxiu and tufted capuchin monkey) was mediated by terrain elevation during the period of lower fruit availability (dry season). Tufted capuchins monkey and Humboldt's cuxiu appeared to segregate by elevation when resources were scarcer, with the capuchins using areas between lowland valley and intermediate elevations, and cuxius using high plateaus. Our study suggests that sympatric primate species from a central Amazonian rainforest use the topographic gradient differently, and their habitat use is, at least in part, influenced by seasonality.

AB As the number of non-native species introductions continues to increase, the need for tools to predict potential invaders is a central focus in invasion ecology. Trait-based models are a popular method used to predict non-native species success; however, they have many challenges to overcome and often fail to address the role of propagule pressure in failed invasions. Due to a lack of data, many studies cannot incorporate failed invasions into their models examining the success of invaders. Here, we analyzed the relationship between the functional traits of non-native species, both successful and failed, and native species in the Laurentian Great Lakes over three time periods between 1870 and 2010. We only examined failed invasions where there was an environmental match and sufficient propagule pressure for establishment as determined through records of authorized stocking, allowing us to directly test the contribution of traits to invasion success. We evaluated whether nearest neighbor functional distance (NNFD), mean functional distance (MFD), lake, time, and functional traits predicted invasion success and impact using logistic regression models. Our results indicate that species with functional traits associated with r-selected life-history strategies were more likely to establish and predators were more likely to have high impact. While smaller NNFD and MFD values predicted establishment success, higher MFD values predicted high impact. This study examined the role of functional traits in invasion success and demonstrated the importance that a change in community context contributes to regulating invasion success.

TI Riparian buffer length is more influential than width on river water
   quality: A case study in southern Costa Rica
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Riparian buffer; Water quality; Watershed management; River
   conservation; Land use planning; Neotropics
AB Riparian zones are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, but are at risk due to agricultural expansion and climate change. To maximize return on conservation investment in mixed-use landscapes, it is important to identify the minimum intact riparian forest buffer sizes to conserve riparian ecosystem services. The minimum riparian forest buffer width necessary to maintain tropical river water quality remains unclear, and there is little analysis of effective riparian buffer lengths. Also, in studies on the effect of land use on river water quality globally, there is little standardization in the area where land use is analyzed. Here, these challenges were addressed in the Osa Peninsula in southwestern Costa Rica. Water quality parameters and social variables were sampled at 194 locations across the region. For each sample, land use was calculated in nine different riparian buffer sizes and at the sampling location. Riparian forest cover had a positive effect on water quality parameters, while agricultural cover had a negative effect. The longer the length of the buffer considered, the greater the relative support for influencing water quality (1000 m > 500 m > 100 m). All buffer widths yielded similar support within each length class. These results indicate that length of riparian forest buffers, not width, drives their ability to conserve water quality. While wide and long riparian forests are ideal to maximize the protection of river water quality and other ecosystem services, in landscapes where that is impractical, the 15-m-wide riparian forest buffers that are supported by Costa Rican legislation could improve water quality, providing that they are at least 500 m long. The results also indicate the importance of methodological standardization in studies that monitor land use effects on water quality. The authors propose that studies in similar regions analyze land use in riparian zones 15-m-wide by 1000 m upstream. Conserving and restoring narrow, long riparian forest buffers could provide a rapid, economical management approach to balance agricultural production and water quality protection.

AB We present the first annually resolved and statistically reliable tree-ring delta O-18 (delta O-18(T)) chronologies for the three South Asian tropical moist forest tree species (Chukrasia tabularis A. Juss., Toona ciliata M. Roem., and Lagerstroemia speciosa Roxb.) which differ in their shade tolerance and resistance to water stress. We found significantly higher mean delta(18)O(T )values in light-demanding T. ciliata than in intermediate shade tolerant C. tabularis and shade tolerant L. speciosa (p < 0.001). delta O-18 in C. tabularis was mainly influenced by pre-monsoon vapor pressure deficit (VPD; r =-0.54, p < 0.01) and post monsoon maximum temperature (T-max) (r = 0.52, p < 0.01). delta O-18(T) in T. ciliata was strongly negatively correlated with a dry season drought index PDSI (r =0.65, p < 0.001) and VPD (r = 0.58, p < 0.001). Pre-monsoon T-max was strongly positively linked with delta O-18. in L. speciosa (r = 0.65, p < 0.001), indicating that climatic influences on delta O-18(T). are species-specific and vary among tree functional types. Although there was a week correlation between local precipitation and delta O-18(T) in our studied species, we found a strong correlation between delta O-18. and precipitation at a larger spatial scale. Linear mixed effect models revealed that multiple factors improved model performance only in C tabularis, yielding the best model, which combined VPD and T-max. The top models in T. ciliata and L. speciosa induded only the single factors PDSI and T-max, highlighting that the way C. tabularis interacts with climate is more complex when compared with other two species. Our analyses suggest that stable oxygen isotope composition in tree rings of South Asian tropical moist forest trees are a suitable proxy of local and regional climate variability and are an important tool for understanding the physiological mechanisms associated with the global hydrological cycle.

AB Glacial relict plants are often endangered because extant populations can be small, geographically isolated and persist in suboptimal environments, leading to increased clonality and reduced genetic diversity putting their survival at further risk. This study examines how restriction to interglacial refugia has impacted the genetic diversity and structure of the threatened Tasmanian palaeoendemic, Pherosphaera hookeriana W. Archer bis. This species is a poorly dispersed, dioecious conifer that, having once been a major component of Last Glacial vegetation, is now limited to 30 known populations. Genetic diversity and structure were assessed using fifteen nuclear and nine chloroplast SSRs in 23 populations representing the species' entire range. Changes in distribution and abundance from the Last Glacial to present were investigated by examining the fossil record, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and species distribution modelling. Despite fossil and ABC based evidence for a postglacial bottleneck, species-level genetic diversity (He = 0.56 and Ne = 2.86) exceeded that of some conifers with far wider distributions. Significant genetic structure (Fst = 0.127, Jost's D = 0.203) was present, with most populations dominated by distinct nuclear SSR genetic clusters and having unique chloroplast haplotypes. Unexpectedly, clonality plays only a small role in population level regeneration. Genetic diversity has likely been maintained due to dioecy, persistence in multiple parts of its range and extant populations being directly descended from proximate glacial populations. Protecting populations from the mounting threat of fire will remain crucial for the in situ conservation of P. hookeriana.

TI Tropical deforestation reduces plant mating quality by shifting the
   functional composition of pollinator communities
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English

   Heliconia tortuosa; hummingbirds; outcrossing; pollinator functional
   groups; tropical forest
AB Deforestation can impact the quality of pollen received by target plants (i.e. delivery of incompatible pollen, self-pollen or pollen from closely related individuals). Such reductions in plant mating quality may be direct, when deforestation reduces plant population size and the availability of pollen donors, or indirect, when decreased mating quality results, for example, from shifts in the composition of the pollinator community. As most flowering plants depend on animal pollinators for reproduction, there is a need to understand the direct and indirect links between deforestation, pollinator community composition and plant mating quality.
   We quantified the direct, pollen donor-mediated and indirect, pollinator-mediated effects of deforestation on mating quality in Heliconia tortuosa, a tropical herb pollinated by low- and high-mobility hummingbirds. We used a confirmatory path analysis to test the hypothesis that deforestation (amount of forest cover and forest patch size) influenced mating quality (haplotype diversity of pollen pools, outcrossing and biparental inbreeding) directly and indirectly through functional shifts in the composition of pollinator communities (proportion of high-mobility hummingbirds).
   We found that deforestation triggered functional shifts in the composition of pollinator communities, as the proportion of high-mobility hummingbirds increased significantly with the amount of forest cover and forest patch size. The composition of the pollinator community affected mating quality, as the haplotype diversity of pollen pools increased significantly with the proportion of high-mobility hummingbirds, while biparental inbreeding decreased significantly. Although we did not detect any significant direct, pollen donor-mediated effects of deforestation on mating quality, reductions in the amount of forest cover and forest patch size resulted in functional shifts that filtered out high-mobility hummingbirds from the pollinator community, thereby reducing mating quality indirectly.
   Synthesis. Deforestation primarily influenced plant mating quality through a cascading effect mediated by functional shifts in the composition of the pollinator community. Our results indicate that plant mating quality strongly depends on the composition of local pollinator communities. Functional shifts that filter out highly mobile and effective pollinators may reduce the transfer of genetically diverse pollen loads from unrelated plants. Such shifts may have pronounced effects on plant population dynamics and disrupt genetic connectivity.

AB Temporal instability and spatial inconsistency in tree growth sensitivity to climate have been reported, but little attention has been given to tropical species. Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze. (Araucariaceae) is a critically endangered South American subtropical and tropical conifer. It offers the potential to evaluate alterations in tree growth responses as it is climate-sensitive and presents a core zone of distribution in the Brazilian meridional highlands (with small disjunct patches occurring in its most southern and northern ranges). Previous dendrochronological studies in the central and most southern distribution range of A. angustifolia showed different climate-related growth responses, which raises the question of whether the growth responses of A. angustifolia to climate are consistent over space and stable over time at the species? northern distribution limit? We developed well-replicated tree-ring chronologies for A. angustifolia at the species? northern distribution limit, examined its growth dynamics, and evaluated climate-growth relationships. The growth patterns of A. angustifolia allowed the synchronization of its tree ring time-series and the construction of two tree-ring width chronologies (at Brejo da Lapa ? BL and Vale das Arauc?arias ? VA) of 55 years and 171 years respectively. The chronologies demonstrated stable and robust signal strengths. Climate-growth response analyses indicated significant positive correlations of the VA chronology with precipitation variables, and with temperature variables in the BL chronology. Different diametric growth patterns were detected between BL and VA. We observed consistent reductions of growth responses to the climate in recent decades. Forest structure and dynamics, disturbance regime, local environmental factors, and climate change could generate physiological alterations and explain variations in A. angustifolia?s growth responses and increments. The species showed different sensitivities to climatic factors both spatially and temporally, and different growth patterns at its northern distribution limit.

AB Light is a vital factor affecting tree growth, survival and reproduction. In forests, natural and anthropogenic disturbances are the main drivers of abrupt changes in environmental conditions, including solar irradiance. We examined interspecific differences in the responses of European beech and silver fir to canopy gap characteristics and positions within gaps across various life stages (small seedlings, tall seedlings and saplings) in old-growth stands in Swietokrzyski National Park, Central Poland. Additionally, we analyzed sapling architectural responses to light. Regeneration densities were strongly affected by gap characteristics. The largest interspecific differences in responses to gap characteristics were found for small seedlings, which indicated their different preferences not only for light conditions created within gaps, but also toward various microsites distributed on a fine-scale after gap creation. Small beech seedlings responded only to the position within the gap, but small fir seedlings reacted in a more complex way, including such variables as gap size, shape and distance from a gap border. Gap size and the distance from its border had the most noticeable positive effect on tall seedlings and saplings, indicating that successful transition of regeneration to taller life stages may be possible only in larger gaps and in places further from a canopy border. Light conditions did not affect sapling length to diameter ratio. However, both direct and diffuse light had a negative effect on beech and fir crown area and length. Fir had wider but shorter crowns compared with beech in the whole light spectrum. This result indicates that these two species might have contrasting strategies regarding light interception, with fir being better adapted to increase a crown laterally, and with beech either being more tolerant to self-shading than fir or able to keep a favorable spatial leaf arrangement to avoid self-shading. Beech had the highest height growth increments in low levels of direct light, but its height growth was positively affected by diffuse light. Fir height growth rates showed no response to direct light, but were highest in medium levels of diffuse light. No effect of light on beech height to lateral growth rate ratio was found. The effect of direct light on this parameter for fir was negative, and nonlinear in the case of diffuse light, with the highest ratios observed in medium light levels. Our results stress the need of using both direct and diffuse light when analyzing light effects on sapling architecture.

AB Our knowledge of biodiversity responses to fragmentation comes from human-driven fragmentation processes. However, evaluating forest patches with natural edge can produce useful models to understand how the micro environmental gradient between forest edge and interior shapes the plant communities, regardless habitat loss. Here, we tested how forest edges and interiors differ in soil characteristics, communities' structure and diversity metrics, and the extent to which these differences are related to forest size and shape of patches. We present data of ten tropical montane cloud forest patches surrounded by native non-forest vegetation (highland grasslands) of southeast Brazil. In each forest, we established five plots right on the edge and five randomly distributed over the forest interior. Our dataset covers a total of 5495 trees, and the main findings showed that patches with natural edges are also influenced by the edge effect, affecting the structure, species composition and soil variables. We found that with the increase in distance from the forest edge, the soils became more acid, with greater accumulation of organic matter, phosphorus, silt and sand, in contrast, the content of total exchangeable bases and clay decreased. When accounting for the effect of patch size and shape in the relationships between forest habitat and the structural community metrics, tree density and upper 95-percentile stem diameter tended to be higher in larger patches. In contrast, aboveground biomass and median stem diameter were positively related to patch shape in forest interiors. In addition, species composition showed marked differences between habitats, but rarefied species richness and Fisher's diversity index were higher, in the interior, only in large patches. These results indicate that besides differences between forest habitats, with increasing patch size and circularity, the differences become more pronounced. We would like to highlight that in conservation and management decisions, peculiarities of each habitat must be taken into account, with techniques that assess the surrounding matrix (man-made or natural) and that consider the edge and the interior as distinct habitats.

AB Open space areas protected by local communities may augment larger scale preservation efforts and may offer overlooked benefits to biodiversity conservation provided they are in suitable ecological condition. We examine protected areas established by local communities through ballot initiatives, a form of direct democracy, in California, USA. We compare ecological conditions of wooded habitats on local ballot protected sites and on sites protected by a state-level conservation agency. Collectively, we found few differences in ecological conditions on each protected area type. Ballot sites had greater invasive understory cover and larger trees. Community dissimilarity patterns suggested ballot sites protect a complementary set of tree species to those on state lands. Overall, geographic characteristics influenced onsite conditions more than details of how sites were protected. Thus, community-driven conservation efforts contribute to protected area networks by augmenting protection of some species while providing at least some protection to others that might otherwise be missed.

AB Characterising species-landscape associations is relevant for conservation planning and management in response to environmental transformation. The occurrence of reptiles is linked to landscape structure that allows for thermoregulation, shelter and feeding, but the relative importance of these factors is unknown for many tropical and subtropical species. We used community-level occupancy modelling and remote sensing to investigate the effects of vegetation structure and anthropogenic development on reptile occurrence in a Malagasy dry forest during the dry season (June and July). The occupancy estimates for some species revealed that species occupancy increased for more densely vegetated sites situated closer to the forest edge. The proximity of anthropogenic transformation did not significantly affect the occurrence of species except for Uroplatus guentheri which showed preference for sites away from settlements. Because most species and those most sensitive to habitat transformation were associated with edges of intact forest patches with denser green vegetation, these areas should form the focus of efforts to conserve reptiles in tropical dry forests. We also demonstrate how setting and scale can affect how habitat-use patterns are interpreted and the importance of local, species-specific studies.

AB 1. Different habitat types are generally associated with shifts in ant species and traits, and even along a micro-scale woodland-grassland gradient, ant biodiversity may change at the edge proximities as a result of abiotic alterations. However, to the best of authors' knowledge, the changes in ant diversity along this type of gradient are understudied, especially from a functional perspective.
   2. The authors sampled ant species in eight micro-scale woodland-grassland gradients in a Mediterranean ecosystem, each comprising 16 m, to assess how ant species diversity, community composition, functional structure, and single- and multi-trait functional diversity change at the edge and in the two adjacent habitats (woodland and grassland) as the distance from the edge increases.
   3. No differences in species richness, species diversity, and community composition were found within the woodland and grassland habitats. Distance from the edge into the adjacent habitats explained changes in functional structure and diversity, which mainly increased in the grassland habitat; body length, leg length, sugar-based diet, dominant behaviour, and multi-trait diversity increased in the grassland. Along the micro-scale gradient, edges showed the highest species diversity and community composition that resulted from the overlap of the communities from the adjacent habitats.
   4. This study shed light on changes in ant species and traits along a micro-scale woodland-grassland gradient, and it highlights the importance of integrating different diversity approaches (functional and taxonomic) at a micro-spatial scale.

AB While taxonomic and biogeographical biases are often acknowledged, those for certain biological responses and species traits are routinely overlooked, generating major gaps in knowledge and conservation of biodiversity. Biases in research on birds - an over-sampled, diverse vertebrate class - may be readily detectable, and wetlands are important species-rich ecosystems in which to identify biases and research gaps for birds. The Pantanal, one of the world's largest wetlands, is globally relevant for bird conservation. In this wetland, we determined spatial, temporal, taxonomic and biological response-related biases in ornithological studies to guide future research in this ecosystem and, ultimately, in major global wetlands. Avian research was geographically biased, with 61 studies conducted in the Brazilian Pantanal and only one in Bolivia. Most studies were concentrated near urban centres, with poorly explored areas in the central Pantanal. Research was also over-represented during the dry season when field conditions are more favourable, but such temporal bias may hamper migration studies. Considering their richness, some families were studied disproportionately more (e.g. Jacanidae) or less (e.g. Tyrannidae). Some species (e.g. Wood Stork Mycteria americana and Yellow-billed Cardinal Paroaria capitata) were included in > 25% of studies, whereas a relatively low number of threatened bird species were studied. Behaviour was the most studied response, followed by abundance and reproduction, which were considered for > 65% of species studied. We conclude that further research needs to be focused on unexplored areas and periods, less detectable species, and ecological processes (e.g. interspecific interactions). Additionally, our results can provide useful information to better address future work and bird conservation actions in other large wetlands. For example, major gaps detected here constitute a primary roadmap to guide research in under-sampled regions, such as the Canadian peatlands and Tonle Sap Lake. Specifically, more studies on waterbirds in highly diverse wetlands from low-income countries (e.g. Okavango and Sundarban Delta) may help to disentangle the essential functional role provided for these species and to prioritize conservation actions in regions with limited research capacity.

AB Mixed-species forest plantation is a sound option to facilitate ecological restoration, plant diversity and ecosystem functions. Compatible species combinations are conducive to reconstruct plant communities that can persist at a low cost without further management and even develop into natural forest communities. However, our understanding of how the compatibility of mycorrhizal types mediates species coexistence is still limited, especially in a novel agroforestry system. Here, we assessed the effects of mycorrhizal association type on the survival and growth of native woody species in mixed-species Eucalyptus plantations. To uncover how mycorrhizal type regulates plant-soil feedbacks, we first conducted a pot experiments by treating distinct mycorrhizal plants with soil microbes from their own or other mycorrhizal types. We then compared the growth response of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants and ectomycorrhizal plants to different soil microbial compositions associated with Eucalyptus plants. We found that the type of mycorrhizal association had a significant impact on the survival and growth of native tree species in the Eucalyptus plantations. The strength and direction of the plant-soil feedbacks of focal tree species depended on mycorrhizal type. Non-mycorrhizal plants had consistent negative feedbacks with the highest survival in the Eucalyptus plantations, whereas nitrogen-fixing plants had consistent positive feedbacks and the lowest survival. Arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants performed varied feedback responses to soil microbes from distinct mycorrhizal plant species. Non-mycorrhizal plants grew better with Eucalyptus soil microbes while nitrogen-fixing plants grew worse with their own conspecific soil microbes. Different soil microbial compositions of Eucalyptus consistently increased the aboveground growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants, but the non-mycorrhizal microbial composition of the Eucalyptus soil resulted in greater belowground growth of ectomycorrhizal plants. Overall, Eucalyptus plants induced an unfavorable soil community, impeding coexistence with other mycorrhizal plants. Our study provides consistent observational and experimental evidence that mycorrhizal-mediated plant-microbial feedback on species coexistence among woody species. These findings are with important implications to optimize the species combinations for better design of mixed forest plantations.

AB Phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits in response to heterogeneous environments has been observed in a number of fishes. Conversely, genetic structure has recently been detected in even the most wide ranging pelagic teleost fish and shark species with massive dispersal potential, putting into question previous expectations of panmixia. Shallow oceanic seamounts are known aggregation sites for pelagic species, but their role in genetic structuring of widely distributed species remains poorly understood. The yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), a commercially valuable, circumglobal, epipelagic fish species occurs in two genetically distinct Southern Hemisphere populations (South Pacific and southern Africa) with low levels of gene-flow between the regions. Two shallow oceanic seamounts exist in the ocean basins around southern Africa; Vema and Walters Shoal in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, respectively. We analysed rare samples from these remote locations and from the South African continental shelf to assess genetic structure and population connectivity in S. lalandi and investigated life-history traits by comparing diet, age, growth and maturation among the three sites. The results suggest that yellowtail from South Africa and the two seamounts are genetically and phenotypically distinct. Rather than mere feeding oases, we postulate that these seamounts represent islands of breeding populations with site-specific adaptations.

AB Introduction Male genitalia are thought to ensure transfer of sperm through direct physical contact with female during copulation. However, little attention has been given to their pre-copulatory role with respect to sexual selection and sexual conflict. Males of the fruitfly Drosophila pachea have a pair of asymmetric external genital lobes, which are primary sexual structures and stabilize the copulatory complex of female and male genitalia. We wondered if genital lobes in D. pachea may have a role before or at the onset of copulation, before genitalia contacts are made. Results We tested this hypothesis with a D. pachea stock where males have variable lobe lengths. In 92 mate competition trials with a single female and two males, females preferentially engaged into a first copulation with males that had a longer left lobe and that displayed increased courtship vigor. In 53 additional trials with both males having partially amputated left lobes of different lengths, we observed a weaker and non-significant effect of left lobe length on copulation success. Courtship durations significantly increased with female age and when two males courted the female simultaneously, compared to trials with only one courting male. In addition, lobe length did not affect sperm transfer once copulation was established. Conclusion Left lobe length affects the chance of a male to engage into copulation. The morphology of this primary sexual trait may affect reproductive success by mediating courtship signals or by facilitating the establishment of genital contacts at the onset of copulation.

AB The causes of population genetic divergence within the Atlantic Forest of South America are diverse. For example, studies have pointed to the importance of regions of stable suitable habitat throughout the Pleistocene, large rivers acting as biogeographic barriers, as well as changes in elevation. Here, we generate a phylogeographic dataset for the Rio Doce Snouted Treefrog (Ololygon carnevallii), a species that is endemic to a narrow portion of the Atlantic Forest. Gene-tree analyses demonstrate that this species is composed of three distinct lineages that diverged from one another during the Pliocene. Ecological niche models projected to climate during the Pleistocene and mid-Holocene suggest that regions of suitable habitat would have shifted through time since the last glacial maximum, and regions of stable habitat were identified. Using generalized dissimilarity modeling, we find no association between genetic divergence and ecological niche models, riverine barriers, elevation, slope, or current climate suggesting that none of these variables have been responsible for lineage formation in the Rio Doce Snouted Treefrog. We suggest that additional phylogeographic studies of narrowly endemic species within the Atlantic Forest are needed to better understand the drivers of diversification and accumulation of biodiversity.

AB In the Atacama Desert from northern Chile (19-24 degrees S), Prosopis (Leguminosae) individuals are restricted to oases that are unevenly distributed and isolated from each other by large stretches of barren landscape constituting an interesting study model as the degree of connectivity between natural populations depends on their dispersal capacity and the barriers imposed by the landscape. Our goal was to assess the genetic diversity and the degree of differentiation among groups of Prosopis individuals of different species from Section Algarobia and putative hybrids (hereafter populations) co-occurring in these isolated oases from the Atacama Desert and determine whether genetic patterns are associated with dispersal barriers. Thirteen populations were sampled from oases located on three hydrographic basins (Pampa del Tamarugal, Rio Loa, and Salar de Atacama; northern, central, and southern basins, respectively). Individuals genotyped by eight SSRs show high levels of genetic diversity (H-O = 0.61, A(r) = 3.5) and low but significant genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST = 0.128, FST-ENA = 0.129, D-JOST = 0.238). The AMOVA indicates that most of the variation occurs within individuals (79%) and from the variance among individuals (21%); almost, the same variation can be found between basins and between populations within basins. Differentiation and structure results were not associated with the basins, retrieving up to four genetic clusters and certain admixture in the central populations. Pairwise differentiation comparisons among populations showed inconsistencies considering their distribution throughout the basins. Genetic and geographic distances were significantly correlated at global and within the basins considered (p < .02), but low correlation indices were obtained (r < .37). These results are discussed in relation to the fragmented landscape, considering both natural and non-natural (humans) dispersal agents that may be moving Prosopis in the Atacama Desert.

AB The aim of the present study was to validate new simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers and use them to assess genetic variability among 24 isolates of Puccinia triticina collected from wheat (Pt-wheat) and triticale (Pt-triticale), and 15 isolates of P. recondita f. sp. secalis (Prs) collected from rye. The Pt and Prs isolates were tested for virulence on a set of 35 Thatcher wheat near-isogenic lines, eight rye lines with known resistance genes, and 53 triticale cultivars with uncharacterized leaf rust resistance. Molecular genotypes were determined using a newly developed set of 34 SSR microsatellite primer pairs. All SSR markers tested on Pt isolates successfully amplified fragments of appropriate size. When tested on the Prs isolates, 21 out of the 34 Pt SSRs amplified expected fragments. Sixteen of these 21 SSRs were polymorphic, providing for the first time microsatellite markers to study genetic variation in Prs. Based on virulence data, variation among Prs isolates was low, probably due to the small number of rye differential lines available. Much higher variation for virulence was observed within the collection of Pt isolates from wheat and triticale, and two separate groups were established with mixed host origin. Substantial genetic variation was detected among the isolates studied with the SSR markers, assuming two different models of SSR evolution (infinite alleles model and stepwise mutation model). The newly developed set of SSR markers proved their effectiveness in detecting genetic variation and should be useful in further population genetics investigations of the two pathogens.

AB Trait matching-a correlation between the morphology of plants and their pollinators-has been frequently observed in pollination interactions. Different intensities of natural selection in individual regions should cause such correlations to be observable across different local assemblages. In this study, we focused on matching between spur lengths of the genus Impatiens and bill lengths of sunbirds in tropical Africa. For 25 mountain and island locations, we compiled information about the composition and traits of local Impatiens and sunbird assemblages. We found that assemblage mean and maximum values of bill lengths were positively correlated with mean and maximum spur lengths across locations. Moreover, our results suggest that the positive correlations hold only for forest sunbird assemblages sharing the same habitat with Impatiens species. We further show that long-billed sunbirds seem to locally match the morphology of multiple Impatiens plant species, not vice versa. Our observation implies that trait matching significantly contributes to structuring of Impatiens-sunbird pollination systems. We suggest that special habitat preferences together with spatial isolation of mountain environment might play a role in this case.

AB Phosphorus (P) can leach fromtopsoil in inorganic and organic forms. While some evidence has shown inorganic P (orthophosphate) can leach to depth in some soils, less is known of dissolved organic P (DOP). This is not helped by a paucity DOP data for groundwater. We hypothesized that DOP species would leach in greater amounts to depth and at a faster rate through aquifer gravels than orthophosphate. We applied superphosphate with or without dung to a low P-sorption soil under pasture and irrigation. Between 0.7 (control) and 2.4 (dung +superphosphate) kg P ha(-1) was leached through 30 cm with a mean ratio of DRP to DOP of 1.5. At 50 cm, 0.7 and 1.3 kg P ha(-1) was leached with the DRP to DOP ratio decreasing to 1.1 due to greater DOP leaching (or DRP sorption). Therewas little difference in DRP lossesmeasured at 50 and 150 cmdepth. All DOP compounds except the monoester - inositol hexakisphosphate were leached at a faster rate than orthophosphate through aquifer gravels. These data suggest that where low P-sorption soils overlay similarly low P-sorption aquifers, DOP may reach groundwater at a faster rate than orthophosphate. Furthermore, as many DOP species are bioavailable to periphyton, our data suggest that DOP should be included in the assessment of the risk of P contamination of groundwater where connection to baseflow could be a long-term stimulant of periphyton growth.

AB The positive effects of habitat heterogeneity on biodiversity are well established, but it is unclear how the diversity of less frequently studied but ecologically important taxa such as harvestmen (Opiliones) may vary across habitat boundaries generated by fine-scale traditional land-use. We investigated how harvestmen community metrics (composition, abundance, and diversity) varied across forest-meadow ecotones in a protected and naturally highly biodiverse karst region where biodiversity conservation plays an important role. We sampled harvestmen across forest edges adjacent to hay meadows in the Vel'ka Fatra Mts. (Central Slovakia) during two vegetation seasons using pitfall traps. In total, 13 species from 4 families were collected. The total number of captured harvestmen was greatest in forests and lowest in meadows and species composition varied between these two habitats (with forest edges forming a transitional community). Species diversity (exponential of Shannon's H ') was marginally greater within forest edges compared to forest and meadow habitats. Harvestmen epigeic activity-density (an abundance proxy) was correlated positively with tree canopy cover, and negatively with the cover of herbaceous layer. Our findings have implications for biodiversity conservation as they highlight the importance of forest habitats for the conservation of understudied taxa such as harvestmen in heterogenous landscapes modified by humans.

AB Drought-induced tree decline and accelerated mortality under global change threaten forests worldwide. Identifying environmental and structural factors driving tree mortality of species with different ecology is essential to understand forest dynamics. We compared three coniferous species and trees with different health status (i.e. healthy, declining and dead) on a xeric Mediterranean ecotone where Pinus pinaster shows widespread decline (defoliation, mistletoe, high mortality) while more drought-tolerant Pinus pinea and Juniperus oxycedrus do not. We analysed individual tree and stand characteristics and regeneration of all species to understand how different abiotic factors at different time scales affected stand species dynamics in relation to tree decline and mortality. Only dead and declining pine trees showed recent multiannual negative radial growth trends. The growth decline started after two extreme droughts, being 10 years longer in the declining species, P. pinaster, than in non-declining P. pinea. We observed no signs of decline or mortality in the most drought-tolerant species, J. oxycedrus. Variables related to moisture availability, like stand dominant height and the tree response to precipitation, increased survival probability in P. pinaster but not in P. pinea. Despite P. pinaster dominating the canopy, its regeneration was very scarce and less abundant than that of co-occurring more drought-tolerant species. Our results suggest that drought-induced mortality was related to species-specific sensitivity to water stress and may be inducing compositional changes towards dominance of more drought-tolerant species. Consequently, at its lower elevation limit P. pinaster might be able to persist only in microsites with higher moisture availability.

AB Degraded Amazonian forests can take decades to recover and the ecological results of natural regeneration are still uncertain. Here we use field data collected across 15 lowland Amazon smallholder properties to examine the relationships between forest structure, mammal diversity, regrowth type, regrowth age, topography and hydrology. Forest structure was quantified together with mammal diversity in 30 paired regrowth-control plots. Forest regrowth stage was classified into three groups: late second-regrowth, early second-regrowth and abandoned pasture. Basal area in regrowth plots remained less than half that recorded in control plots even after 20-25 years. Although basal area did increase in sequence from pasture, early to late-regrowth plots, there was a significant decline in basal area of late-regrowth control plots associated with a decline in the proportion of large trees. Variation in different forest structure responses was explained by contrasting variables, with the proportion of small trees (DBH<20 cm) most strongly explained by topography (altitude and slope) whereas the proportion of large trees (DBH>60 cm) was explained by plot type (control vs. regrowth) and regrowth class. These findings support calls for increased efforts to actively conserve large trees to avoid retrogressive succession around edges of degraded Amazon forests.

AB Hyperdiverse animal groups raise intriguing questions regarding the factors that generate and maintain their diversity. The snapping shrimp genus Alpheus (with >300 described species) is a spectacularly diversified group of decapod crustaceans that serves as an exemplary system for addressing evolutionary questions regarding morphological adaptations, symbiosis, cryptic diversity and molecular divergence. A lack of information regarding evolutionary relationships among species has limited investigations into the mechanisms that drive the diversification of Alpheus. Previous phylogenetic studies of Alpheus have been restricted in scope, while molecular datasets used for phylogenetic reconstructions have been based solely on mitochondrial and a handful of nuclear markers. Here we use an anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) approach to resolve phylogenetic relationships among species of Alpheus. The AHE method generated sequence data for 240 loci (>72,000 bp) for 65 terminal species that span the geographic, ecological and taxonomic diversity of Alpheus. Our resulting, well supported phylogeny demonstrates a lack of monophyly for five out of seven morphologically defined species groups that have traditionally been used as a framework in Alpheus taxonomy. Our results also suggest that symbiotic associations with a variety of other animals have evolved independently in at least seven lineages in this genus. Our AHE phylogeny represents the most comprehensive phylogenetic treatment of Alpheus to date and will provide a useful evolutionary framework to further investigate questions, such as various modifications of the snapping claw and the role of habitat specialization and symbiosis in promoting speciation.

AB For much of the past two decades, the scientific and policy community has sought to reduce forest loss through well-targeted public policy and enforcement measures and private sector engagement. Unfortunately, recent increases in forest loss in the Amazon have raised new concerns over the drivers of deforestation in the region, and the durability of the policies designed to mitigate it. Here we argue that recent deforestation trends are a partial reflection of Brazil's economic trajectories. In this article we show that poor economic conditions, nationally, will increase micro-level incentives for forest clearing. Conversely, economic growth, nationally, will suppress prices and land clearing incentives. Ultimately, we argue that, at the national-scale, economic growth may be closely aligned with, and possibly a pre-condition to, the attainment of international or national-level environmental goals.

   RICHNESS; NUMBER; FRAMEWORK; ABUNDANCE; COVERAGE
AB Three metrics of species diversity - species richness, the Shannon index and the Simpson index - are still widely used in ecology, despite decades of valid critiques leveled against them. Developing a robust diversity metric has been challenging because, unlike many variables ecologists measure, the diversity of a community often cannot be estimated in an unbiased way based on a random sample from that community. Over the past decade, ecologists have begun to incorporate two important tools for estimating diversity: coverage and Hill diversity. Coverage is a method for equalizing samples that is, on theoretical grounds, preferable to other commonly used methods such as equal-effort sampling, or rarefying datasets to equal sample size. Hill diversity comprises a spectrum of diversity metrics and is based on three key insights. First, species richness and variants of the Shannon and Simpson indices are all special cases of one general equation. Second, richness, Shannon and Simpson can be expressed on the same scale and in units of species. Third, there is no way to eliminate the effect of relative abundance from estimates of any of these diversity metrics, including species richness. Rather, a researcher must choose the relative sensitivity of the metric towards rare and common species, a concept which we describe as 'leverage.' In this paper we explain coverage and Hill diversity, provide guidelines for how to use them together to measure species diversity, and demonstrate their use with examples from our own data. We show why researchers will obtain more robust results when they estimate the Hill diversity of equal-coverage samples, rather than using other methods such as equal-effort sampling or traditional sample rarefaction.

   forests: Perspectives from complementary biodiversity dimensions
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Ecological succession; Taxonomic diversity; Functional diversity;
   Phylogenetic diversity
AB Secondary forests occupy extensive areas in tropical regions, providing an opportunity to investigate their relevance to biodiversity restoration. However, determining the conservation value of secondary forests and evaluating their successional trajectories depends on how biodiversity is measured. Here, we explore different biodiversity dimensions to understand how bird assemblages recover from forest disturbance caused by small scale farmers in the Amazon. We sampled bird species through standard visual and auditory censuses in 24 small plots of 1-hectare distributed in a paired design of old growth forests and secondary forests from different age categories (early, middle and late succession). We used 12 biodiversity metrics to explore the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic dimensions of bird diversity. Total species richness and evenness was similar between secondary and old growth forests. In contrast, the number of passerine species and disturbance-vulnerable species were higher in the controls of old growth forests compared to secondary forests. The relative abundance of birds with distinct functional traits consistently differed between the secondary forests of different age categories and their old growth forest counterparts. Functional evenness and divergence increased with canopy height and basal area through forest regeneration. In contrast, bird phylogenetic diversity in secondary forests was higher compared to those found in old growth forests while accounting for forest types and age categories of secondary forests. Bird species tolerant to disturbances partially compensate the loss of avian taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity during the conversion of undisturbed forests to agricultural fields. Changes in functional evenness and functional divergence suggest that resources used by birds are altered along the secondary succession and that the niche complementarity among species is reduced in more intensively managed sites. Ecological succession can be highly complex in terms of taxa identity, their functional roles and evolutionary history. Therefore, measurements that explore distinct biodiversity dimensions are fundamental to understanding how species are organized in assemblages across time and space.

AB Retention forestry is a silvicultural approach used to retain structural and compositional components of the harvested area, maintain some connectivity throughout the landscape and provide a "lifeboat" area for species as part of a conservation effort. However, no manipulative field experiment has assessed the lifeboat functioning of retention forestry more than a decade post-harvest. In this study, we documented the effects of retention plots 20 years after their establishment on flying Coleoptera assemblages using flight intercept traps. 3414 beetles from 160 different species or genera were recovered during the study. Results demonstrated that beetle abundance and species richness were comparable between retention patches and continuous forests in the vicinity. However, beetle assemblages differed between the treatments because closed-habitat species and fungivorous beetles declined in retention patches and open-habitat species considered as tourists were associated with retention patches. Yet, beetle assemblages varied more in response to interannual effects than treatment effects. With respect to the lifeboat effect of retention forestry, we conclude that retention patches do not host the same species assemblage than continuous stands but are nevertheless effective for the conservation of species abundance and richness within a harvested area.

AB Woodland nature reserves must be scientifically assessed so that subsequent management leads to optimal conservation of biodiversity. This entails knowledge of the species composition, the genetics of the local populations and their ecology. Here we assess Tilia species in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), a large mixed coniferous and deciduous forest in South-Eastern Germany. Tilia occurs here at low density, as in many other mixed forests in Central and Northern Europe. Therefore, results are not only relevant to BFNP but also to other areas.
   Exhaustive sampling resulted in the collection of 113 mature trees that were genotyped using 20 microsatellite markers, derived from both T. cordata and T. platyphyllos. For the first time, size and aspect of trees, and their community association were contrasted between the species. Genotyping confirmed that T. platyphyllos, T. cordata and their hybrid (T. x europaea) were present in the BFNP and both species deserve conservation. T. platyphyllos has a higher genetic diversity for both sets of markers than T. cordata, confirming earlier work. Both species showed genetic diversity comparable to other populations in Central Europe, which is likely to be sufficient for the maintenance of the species in the short term. However, increasing the number of trees, ensuring local sources are used, and gene flow from surrounding forests over the next decennia may be crucial for longterm survival.
   Further, within the T. platyphyllos group there was a set of 11 trees that were distinct from the others: they had a lower genetic diversity and were shorter. We hypothesise that these were planted and should not be used for propagation and augmentation. Most saplings analysed appeared to derive from asexual propagation (36 out of 41), although a few (five out of 41) were novel genotypes. This means that, currently, there is some, but rather limited, regeneration.
   T. cordata was found at a lower altitude and less steep terrain than T. platyphyllos and the hybrid. The hybrid was taller than the two species, while the diameter at breast height was smallest in T. cordata. T. cordata shows a preference for mixed and coniferous forests, while T. platyphyllos occurs mostly in deciduous forests.
   Our results indicate that biodiversity at the species and genetic level as well as species' ecology have to be considered in order to guide informed conservation management. These results form the basis to recommend conservation management improving the long-term viability of Tilia in the BFNP and other mixed forests.

DE Claw model; Dotillid crab; Eavesdropping; Ilyoplax pusilla; Reproductive

AB During the breeding season, courting males of many ocypodoids (famously, fiddler crabs) perform claw-waving displays, in which they rhythmically raise, often extend, and lower their chelipeds when they are near their burrows. This conspicuous display sometimes attracts wandering (burrow-less) sexually receptive females to males' burrows where the crabs mate. However, since most of the claw waving is not directed to a particular receiver, the display may also attract males and unreceptive females that are searching for new burrows, not mates. We conducted two types of choice experiment using claw models to examine the preferences of wandering males and females in the dotillid crab Ilyoplax pusilla: (1) between burrows with and without static claw models, (2) between waving and static claw models set up 10 cm apart (for only males). More crabs of both sexes ran to the burrows with claw models, and more males preferred the waving claw model. Like the structures some courting male fiddler crabs build, male claws and the claw waving of I. pusilla may reveal to unintended receivers the locations of burrows that these crabs can use temporarily as refuges.

AB Plants are one of the most vulnerable groups to fragmentation and habitat loss, that may affect community richness, abundance, functional traits, and genetic diversity. Here, we address the effects of landscape features on adaptive quantitative traits and evolutionary potential, and on neutral genetic diversity in populations of the Neotropical savanna tree Caryocar brasiliense. We sampled adults and juveniles in 10 savanna remnants within five landscapes. To obtain neutral genetic variation, we genotyped all individuals from each site using nine microsatellite loci. For adaptive traits we measured seed size and mass and grown seeds in nursery in completely randomized experimental design. We obtained mean, additive genetic variance (V-a) and coefficient of variation (CVa%), which measures evolvability, for 17 traits in seedlings. We found that landscapes with higher compositional heterogeneity (SHDI) had lower evolutionary potential (CVa%) in leaf length (LL) and lower aboveground dry mass (ADM) genetic differentiation (Q(ST)). We also found that landscapes with higher SHDI had higher genetic diversity (He) and allelic richness (AR) in adults, and lower genetic differentiation (F-ST). In juveniles, SHDI was also positively related to AR. These results are most likely due to longer dispersal distance of pollen in landscapes with lower density of flowering individuals. Agricultural landscapes with low quality mosaic may be more stressful for plant species, due to the lower habitat cover (%), higher cover of monocropping (%) and other land covers, and edge effects. However, in landscapes with higher SHDI with high quality mosaic, forest nearby savanna habitat and the other environments may facilitate the movement or provide additional habitat and resources for seed disperses and pollinators, increasing gene flow and genetic diversity. Finally, despite the very recent agriculture expansion in Central Brazil, we found no time lag in response to habitat loss, because both adults and juveniles were affected by landscape changes.

AB The climate is changing and these changes may affect tree growth. Diameter growth models are one of the essential inputs for many growth and yield projection systems. Therefore, diameter growth models that can be used to estimate inside bark diameter at breast height (DBH) for red pine plantations in a changing climate were developed. One hundred and fifty red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) trees were sampled from 30 even-aged monospecific plantations (sites) (5 trees/site) across Ontario, Canada. Stem analysis data collected from these trees was used to develop and evaluate the growth models using a mixed effects modeling approach. Site and climate effects on diameter growth were examined by incorporating site and climate variables in the models. Including climate variables improved the fit statistics.
   Inside bark DBHs were predicted for 4 geographic areas of Ontario for the period 2021 to 2080. Three emissions trajectories known as representative concentration pathways (RCPs), each reflecting different levels of heat at the end of the century (i.e., 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 W m(-2)), were evaluated. At the end of the 2021 to 2080 growth period, projected diameters were wider by 11% and 23% for trees in the southeastern and southwestern parts, respectively, and narrower by 6% for those in the central west part of Ontario (under all climate change scenarios relative to those under a no change scenario). However, no pronounced difference in projected diameters was evident for trees in the far west part of the province regardless of climate change scenario (relative to the no change scenario). In the absence of climate data, the model fitted without climate variables can be used to estimate inside bark DBH.

AB Exploitation of fisheries and aquaculture practices are exposing marine fish populations to increasing genetic risks. Therefore, the integration of genetic information into fisheries and aquaculture management is becoming crucial to ensure species' long-term persistence. The raising commercial value of grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) and its roe represents a growing challenge to the sustainable management of this economically important fishery resource. Here, microsatellites were used to investigate patterns of genetic variation in a Mediterranean area that harbor flourishing fisheries and practice semi-intensive farming of grey mullet. Genetic diversity within populations is smaller than values reported in previous studies as a result of the lower polymorphism displayed by the new microsatellite loci. Lack of genetic structuring points to the existence of a unique genetic stock, which is consistent with the species' high dispersal capabilities. Nonetheless, differences in local population effective size as well as the excess of related individuals do not completely fit the picture of a large panmictic population. Baseline genetic information here gathered will allow to set up the genetic monitoring of regional fish stocks, which is needed to assess the impact of both harvesting and aquaculture on the genetic integrity of Mugil cephalus wild populations.

AB Cryptic species are morphologically identical but genetically distinct, and are prominent across numerous phyla. The coexistence of such closely related species on local scales would seem to run counter to traditional coexistence and competition theory; it has been hypothesized as a consequence of differences in their resource use or tolerances to environmental conditions. We developed an individual-based model of a community of three cryptic Litoditis marina (nematode) species, to understand how individual-level interspecific and intraspecific interactions might explain the coexistence of these closely related species.
   The model incorporates individuals' reproduction, competition, dispersal and resource use. Data characterizing the cryptic species (growth rates, dispersal ability, competitive interactions and responses to changing environmental conditions) were obtained from laboratory experiments involving both mono- and multispecific nematode cultures, and are used to parameterize the model.
   Simulation studies are used to investigate which individual-level mechanisms of dispersal and interaction lead to the characteristic population-level patterns observed experimentally. Our results highlight the key role of intraspecific competition in mediating dispersal and therefore co-occurrence of the cryptic species. The differences in dispersal also influence the response of the cryptic species to competition, a combination of factors that provides an explanation for their co-occurrence. These results provide insights into how changes in individual-level processes can be amplified to affect population-level co-occurrence.

AB Eichhornia crassipes is one of the most ubiquitous invasive aquatic species in the world that negatively impact on native fauna and flora. The information on the occurrence of such invasive plant is crucial for the river/wetland management. The aim of the present study is to apply classification tree model (testing with the highest level of pruning confidence factor) integrated with an optimizer technique (greedy stepwise search algorithm) to predict the occurrence of this exotic species based on water quality and physical-habitat parameters. The ten sites (in the Anzali wetland, located in northern Iran) were monthly measured where the exotic species was present in 50% of sampling sites and it was absent in the remaining of the sites. In total, 120 samples of E. crassipes (60 presence and 60 absence instances) were monthly measured together with 12 environmental variables during 1-year study period (2017-2018). For the model, two-third of datasets (80 instances) was employed for the training and the remainder for the validation set (40 instances). Before model optimizing (with the pruning confidence factor, PCF=0.01), six variables were predicted by the model in three folds confirming that the non-occurrence of the exotic species might be associated with increasing flow velocity, depth of ecosystem, water turbidity, bicarbonate and dissolved oxygen concentration, while the occurrence of the exotic species (in terms of the abundance) might show an increase with increasing the concentration of nutrients such as phosphate. After model optimizing (with PCF=0.01), the model selected five variables in three folds (flow velocity, depth, phosphate, bicarbonate, and nitrate) so that except nitrate, other selected variables were in common before and after variable selection. CT integrated with GS model thus proved to have a high potential when applied for decision-making in the context of wetland management.

AB Tree growth sensitivity to climate can vary over space and time. This variability generates inconsistency in growth response to climate, which makes it difficult to assess the effects of past climate and global climate change on tree growth. A previous short-term study of Pseudopiptadenia contorta found a consistent growth response to climate in distinct locations, which raises the question, is the growth response of P. contorta to climate consistent over the long-term? We aimed to assess whether there is a common pattern of variation in tree ring width, build tree-ring width chronologies, and verify the consistency of the climate-growth response of P. contorta in two Atlantic Forest remnants. Wood samples were collected in Reserva Biol ' ogica de Poco das Antas (RBPA) and Reserva Biol ' ogica de Tingu ' a (RBT) in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Conventional dendrochronology methods were used for cross-dating, to build chronologies and to assess the climate-growth relationship. A common growth pattern was detected for P. contorta, and two tree-ring width chronologies were constructed. A congruent growth response was found for trees of RBPA and RBT to annual and spring precipitation as well as precipitation in the rainy months. Other climate-growth relationships were detected with other precipitation and temperature variables. Considering that P. contorta is a widespread species, occurring in other Brazilian biomes and forest formations, it is a promising model for developing further dendrochronological research including regional networks of replicated site chronologies, which could facilitate the reconstruction of historical climatic series and predictions of future impacts of climate change in tropical areas.

AB A large proportion of the biodiversity of Amazonia, one of the most diverse rainforest areas in the world, is yet to be formally described. One such case is the Neotropical frog genus Adenomera. We here evaluate the species richness and historical biogeography of the Adenomera heyeri clade by integrating molecular phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses with morphological and acoustic data. Our results uncovered ten new candidate species with interfluve-associated distributions across Amazonia. In this study, six of these are formally named and described. The new species partly correspond to previously identified candidate lineages 'sp. F' and 'sp. G' and also to previously unreported lineages. Because of their rarity and unequal sampling effort of the A. heyeri clade across Amazonia, conservation assessments for the six newly described species are still premature. Regarding the biogeography of the A. heyeri clade, our data support a northern Amazonian origin with two independent dispersals into the South American Dry Diagonal. Although riverine barriers have a relevant role as environmental filters by isolating lineages in interfluves, dispersal rather than vicariance must have played a central role in the diversification of this frog clade.

AB The US native liana, poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), responsible for contact dermatitis in humans, is a competitive weed with great potential for expansion in disturbed habitats. To facilitate a better understanding of this threat, we sought to evaluate habitat suitability, population demography, and biotic interactions of poison ivy, using a series of complementary field studies in the two habitats where it most commonly occurs-forest interiors and edges. Of the 2500 seeds planted across both habitats, poison ivy initially colonized forest interiors (32% emergence) at a higher rate than edge habitats (16.5% emergence). However, forest interior seedlings were less likely to survive (interior n = 3; edge n = 15), which might be attributed to herbivore pressure when the seedlings were smaller in the less competitive forest interior. Once established, the poison ivy seedlings appeared to be more tolerant of herbivory, except that of large grazers such as deer. The early life stage of seedling emergence, survival, and establishment are critical in poison ivy success, with biotic pressure, especially from plant competition and deer, limiting recruitment. A suitable habitat of this expanding native liana would increase with increasing forest fragmentation, but might be buffered by the expanding deer population.

AB Ophiura sarsii is a common brittle star species across the Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions of the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Ophiura sarsii is among the dominant echinoderms in the Barents Sea. We studied the genetic diversity of O. sarsii by sequencing the 548 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene. Ophiura sarsii demonstrated high genetic diversity in the Barents Sea. Both major Atlantic mtDNA lineages were present in the Barents Sea and were evenly distributed between the northern waters around Svalbard archipelago and the southern part near Murmansk coast of Kola Peninsula. Both regions, and other parts of the O. sarsii range, were characterized by high haplotype diversity with a significant number of private haplotypes being mostly satellites to the two dominant haplotypes, each belonging to a different mtDNA clade. Demographic analyses indicated that the demographic and spatial expansion of O. sarsii in the Barents Sea most plausibly has started in the Bolling-Allerod interstadial during the deglaciation of the western margin of the Barents Sea.

AB Deforestation is a key driver of biodiversity reduction worldwide and impacts ecosystem functioning, ecological processes, and species behavior. Here, we investigated the effects of deforestation on the diet of puma (Puma concolor) in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We characterized puma diets in the largest continuous Atlantic Forest remnant and compiled literature data on their diet across the biome for comparison. We divided localities (N = 16) into two systems, namely, preserved areas (>40% forest cover) and human-modified landscapes (HMLs; <40%), and compared the diets in terms of percentage of occurrence, mean weight of mammalian prey (MWMP), and niche breadth. We classified prey according to their body mass (small- to large-sized) and partitioned the contribution of vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and mammalian prey (10 orders). The puma diets varied widely across the Atlantic Forest, with prey size decreasing from preserved areas to HMLs. As deforestation increased, the proportion of small-sized prey also increased, leading to a reduction in the MWMP. Niche breadth varied independently of the context or forest cover. Ungulates, large rodents, and xenarthrans were the main prey for pumas in preserved areas, while small rodents and birds accounted for 55% in HMLs. Ungulate predation increased with forest cover augmentation, with the opposite pattern observed for small rodents. The puma diet parameters in the Atlantic Forest and across Neotropical regions were similar, whereas both differed from that of North America, where large-sized prey was more consumed. Deforestation drove pumas to feed on smaller prey (<1 kg), thus highlighting that the effects of deforestation can be even larger and affect the assemblage trophic structure.

AB Poverty is not only the primary attribute of most developing countries, but also expected to contribute to environmental degradation. With the recent rapid, but yet to be comprehensively developed renewable energy, this study examines the dynamic impact of renewable energy in mitigating the potential adverse effect of poverty on environmental destruction using econometric approaches for developing countries. Empirical results from GMM estimator show that over the period of 2001 and 2014, renewable energy tends to minimize the extent of environmental destruction due to poverty in the full sample of developing countries. The results of sub-samples of several income groups also sharing the same conclusion that environmental degradation increases with increases in poverty, but mitigated with more consumption of renewable energy. Thus, significant expansion and consumption of renewable energy could contribute to reduction in poverty and sustain the environmental quality.

AB Large mammals that occur in low densities, particularly in the high-altitude areas, are globally threatened due to fragile climatic and ecological envelopes. Among bear species, the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) has a distribution that is restricted to Himalayan highlands with relatively small and fragmented populations. To date, very little scientific information on the Himalayan brown bear, which is vital for the conservation of the species and the management of its habitats, especially in protected areas of the landscape, is available. The present study aims to understand the effectiveness of existing Himalayan Protected Areas in terms of representativeness for the conservation of Himalayan brown bear (HBB), an umbrella species in high-altitude habitats of the Himalayan region. We used the ensemble approach of the species distribution model and then assessed biological connectivity to predict the current and future distribution and movement of HBB in climate change scenarios for the year 2050. Approximately 33 protected areas (PAs) currently possess suitable habitats. Our model suggests a massive decline of approximately 73.38% and 72.87% under 4.5 and 8.5 representative concentration pathway (RCP) respectively in the year 2050 compared with the current distribution. The predicted change in suitability will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs; eight will become completely uninhabitable by the year 2050, followed by loss of connectivity in the majority of PAs. Habitat configuration analysis suggested a 40% decline in the number of suitable patches, a reduction in large habitat patches (up to 50%) and aggregation of suitable areas (9%) by 2050, indicating fragmentation. The predicted change in geographic isotherm will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs, eight of them will become completely inhabitable. Hence, these PAs may lose their effectiveness and representativeness in achieving the very objective of their existence or conservation goals. Therefore, we recommend adaptive spatial planning for protecting suitable habitats distributed outside the PA for climate change adaptation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A population study of Phytophthora cactorum was performed using ddRADseq sequence variation analysis completed by the analysis of effector genes-RXLR6, RXLR7 and SCR113. The population structure was described by F-statistics, heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity, number of private alleles, number of polymorphic sites, kinship coefficient and structure analysis. The population of P. cactorum in Europe seems to be structured into host-associated groups. The isolates from woody hosts are structured into four groups described previously, while isolates from strawberry form another group. The groups are diverse in effector gene composition and the frequency of outbreeding. When populations from strawberry were analysed, both asexual reproduction and occasional outbreeding confirmed by gene flow among distinct populations were detected. Therefore, distinct P. cactorum populations differ in the level of heterozygosity. The data support the theory of the mixed-mating model for P. cactorum, comprising frequent asexual behaviour and inbreeding alternating with occasional outbreeding. Because P. cactorum is not indigenous to Europe, such variability is probably caused by multiple introductions of different lineages from the area of its original distribution, and the different histories of sexual recombination and host adaptation of particular populations.

AB Genetic variability generally is associated with adaptive potential of species and can be assessed using microsatellite markers. Mexican long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris nivalis) are endangered, migratory nectarivores thought to be experiencing population declines. Despite historical and current tracking efforts, migratory connections among roost sites remain elusive. Our objective was to assess the genetic variability and connectivity of two of the most geographically separated populations of L. nivalis currently known-a mating roost in central Mexico used from September to March, and a maternity roost in western Texas used by adult females and their young from June to August. Twelve loci developed for L. yerbabuenae and four for Glossophaga soricina amplified L. nivalis DNA; of those 16 loci, seven (all from L. yerbabuenae) were useful in genetic analyses of 113 individuals. High levels of genetic variation in L. nivalis from the two sites were not significantly different and no substructure was detected between these two roost sites separated by more than 1,200 km. Further, we recovered evidence of close relationship (parent-offspring) in nine pairs of juveniles captured at the northern roost and adults from the southern roost, confirming a connection between the two locations. For this endangered species, the level of variation detected, the lack of a recent bottleneck, and estimates of effective population size, are encouraging for future recovery. Management plans aimed at conserving Mexican long-nosed bats should recognize the need for managing these bats as a single population and conserving foraging and roosting habitat along migratory routes to reduce population fragmentation.

AB In current evaluation, the genetic structure and diversity were investigated in ten linseed populations collected from five countries belong to two continents (America and Eurasia) to find different genotypes for introducing them for genetic breeding programs. We selected these populations, because they belong to different regions of Holarctic and Paleotropical phytogeographic kingdoms. For this purpose, the nuclear DNA was extracted using the CTAB-modified method and amplified using 32 ISSR primers. Genetic diversity parameters and polymorphism indexes widely varied among the evaluated populations. Moreover, the results of the analysis of variance test proved the significant genetic differences, which its great part belonged to inter-population rather than intra-population. These findings were consistent with the high G(ST) and H-T levels and small amounts of H-S and populations grouping in MDS plot, which revealed low amount of within population's diversity, except those for Arak and Masal populations. In addition, low amount of Nm, indicating a flat rate of gene flow and strong population differentiation. According to the STRUCTURE analysis and UPGMA tree of Nei's genetic distance, six genotypes were recognized among the studied populations. In the detected genotypes, populations with long geographical distances have the same genetic structure. It seems that the populations with the similar genetic structures have been originated from the same genetic diversity center. Hence, we assume that there are at least six centers of genetic diversity for flax in the world; however, evidences of ancestral gene flow were detected in genetic structure. These findings are consistent with the theory that there are several centers for flax genetic diversity around the world. Due to the high intraspecific diversity in Masal and Arak populations, individuals of these populations have great importance for genetic breeding programs of this species.

AB Invasive species can disrupt food webs by altering the abundance of prey species or integrating into the food web themselves. In the Gulf of Maine, there have been a suite of invasions that have altered the composition of the benthic ecosystem. These novel prey species can potentially benefit native predators depending on their nutritional value and relative abundance. We measured feeding instances of the native blood star, Henricia sanguinolenta, and changes in the seasonal abundances of invasive ascidian prey species. Results indicate that H. sanguinolenta forages optimally, as the blood star will prey on invasive ascidians when in high abundance, but feed on other species during periods of scarcity. Further, our study shows that blood stars prey on a wider variety of species than was previously known, such as small bivalves and barnacles. Additionally, we compared growth and reproduction of sea stars fed different combinations of invasive ascidians (Diplosoma listerianum or Botrylloides violaceus) or a native sponge (Haliclona oculata). Sea stars grew more on the native diet when compared with the invasive ascidian species, and D. listerianum appeared to be a superior quality food source when compared with B. violaceus. By comparing our data with historical data, we determined that there was a dramatic increase in sea star populations between 1980 and 2011, but then populations decreased by almost half from 2011 to 2016-2017. These data suggest that while invasive ascidians may have helped sea star populations at one point, sea stars are declining without their native food source.

AB Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes is a popular tool to address the problem of environmental degradation. However, these projects do not always produce their best outputs due to the inefficiencies of sustainable development policies. Although some sources of inefficiencies cannot be controlled, the implementation of PES systems following the integrated approach (more than one project acting on the same site) is expected to increase their benefits and offer solutions to some of their problems. Moreover, this integration should provide an optimal combination of both short and long-term ecosystem services, ensuring resilience to environmental and social change. This study analyses nine combinations of PES schemes and a Rural Development (RD) project in three regions of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. The focus is to analyse how different schemes can promote a continuous and long-term provision of the ecosystem services targeted by each project, as well to assess how the schemes, in general, can contribute to increasing the socio-ecological resilience of the benefitted area. Desk research and field interviews were conducted to obtain the necessary information to analyse the costs and benefits of the schemes. The data collected has provided us with qualitative information to illustrate the theory behind the project, and people's lived experiences. These outcomes and other socio-economic and environmental parameters were analysed through a Multicriteria Decision Analysis. The paper shows the integrated approaches have offered the best trade-off among the costs and benefits in all regions. At the same time, they have a high potential to ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem services in that area while acting towards a resilient community/environment.

AB Landscape features such as roads, hiking trails, and forest edge are prevalent features of urban forests. These features can negatively influence biodiversity through fragmentation and facilitate the penetration of invasive species, particularly predators such as domestic dogs and cats. This study examined how these landscape features affect the distribution of native and domestic mammals and how domestic species affect the occupancy and activity patterns of native mammals. To this end, we conducted camera trap surveys in forested urban and suburban parks in Indiana and Kentucky, USA, to record the presence of native species (deer, raccoons, coyote, and opossums) and non-native predators (domesticated cats and dogs) in relation to distance to nearest roads, hiking trails, and forest edge. We found negative correlations between proximity to roads, hiking trails, and forest edge and the occupancy of the native species with this effect extending up to 300 m. We also found evidence that the presence of dog and cat was negatively correlated with the occupancy for all native species. We recommend park management consider the impact of roads, hiking trails, and forest edge when designing parks and the enforcement of dog leash regulations for the conservation of large mammals in urban parks.

AB Forest gaps are essential small-scale disturbances in forest succession. However, little attention has been paid to the long-term effects of gap dynamics on woody species regeneration and succession. We selected 20 medium and 25 large gaps representing a range of age classes (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 years) from remote-sensing images obtained in 1964, 1976, 1986, 1993, 2003, and 2014 to examine long-term gap regeneration processes in a secondary forest in Northeast China. We conducted field surveys to determine the regeneration status, density index (DI), and richness index (RI) of selected gaps. The importance value (IV) of each woody species was calculated, and all species were classified by shade tolerance. The results showed that in gaps of 0-10 years, the DI and RI were mainly dominated by shade-intolerant species in large gaps and intermediate species in medium gaps. When gap age increased to 10-20 years, the greatest RI was observed in large gaps due to an increase in intermediate species, and the dominant species (IV > 0.1) changed from shrubs to trees (Acer mono). The DI and RI decreased over time in medium gaps, but A. mono remained the dominant species in these gaps. By 20-30 years after gap formation, large gaps showed decreased DI and RI, associated with the exclusion of shade-intolerant and intermediate species, and Tilia amurensis joined the dominant species class. In medium gaps, a decrease in DI was associated with self-thinning among intermediate shade-tolerant species. Once gap age exceeded 30 years, the DI, RI, and dominant species became stable in both large and medium gaps. Our findings indicated that natural gaps can improve the regeneration of late-successional species in secondary forests, especially at the first 30 years. However, there was a barrier in succession of the secondary forests to climax forests relying on natural gap regeneration due to the absence of key species such as Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.). These results can provide a significant reference for close-to-nature management of temperate secondary forests in practice.

AB Ericaceous plants rely on ericoid mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient acquisition. However, the factors that affect the composition and structure of fungal communities associated with the roots of ericaceous plants remain largely unknown. Here, we use a 4.1-million-year (myr) soil chronosequence in Hawaii to test the hypothesis that changes in nutrient availability with soil age determine the diversity and species composition of fungi associated with ericoid roots. We sampled roots of a native Hawaiian plant, Vaccinium calycinum, and used DNA metabarcoding to quantify changes in fungal diversity and community composition. We also used a fertilization experiment at the youngest and oldest sites to assess the importance of nutrient limitation. We found an increase in diversity and a clear pattern of species turnover across the chronosequence, driven largely by putative ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. Fertilization with nitrogen at the youngest site and phosphorus at the oldest site reduced fungal diversity, suggesting a direct role of nutrient limitation. Our results also reveal the presence of novel fungal species associated with Hawaiian Ericaceae and suggest a greater importance of phosphorus availability for communities of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi than is generally assumed.

AB Understanding the impacts of edge effects on ecological interactions plays an integral role in planning ecosystem recovery from human perturbations, as well as conservation of habitats. Edge effects related to forest fragmentation cause changes in species diversity that can disrupt ecological networks. Here, we evaluated how the diversity of, and interactions between, herbivorous insects associated with individuals of a pioneer plant species, Mabea fistulifera (Euphorbiaceae) are affected by the disturbances related to edge effects. We addressed two specific questions: (i) How do the forest edges affect species richness, abundance and composition of herbivorous interacting with M. fistulifera? (ii) Do different disturbances related to edge effects affect the topology of individual-based plant-herbivorous networks? Herbivorous insects were sampled from three population patches of M. fistulifera in Brazilian Atlantic forest areas: two areas were subjected to distinct intensities of anthropogenic disturbances (firebreak and park access road, considered edges of low- and high-impact, respectively), and one in the forest interior (control). We expected a lower species richness and abundance of herbivorous interacting with plants in forest edges than in the forest interior apart from to differences in the species composition. Therefore, based on these predictions, we expected that the various disturbances related to edge effects may change the topology of individual-based plant-herbivorous networks. We observed that species richness and abundance of herbivorous in high-impact environments decreased in relation to forest interior, as well the species composition differed between these areas. Disturbance jeopardised network specialisation but did not change the topology of individual-based networks, which presented a modular pattern. Edges affected herbivorous diversity and decreased the interaction overlap as individual-based networks became highly specialised with increasing disturbance. These results enhance the understanding of edge effects and resilience of plant-herbivorous interactions in regularly disturbed tropical environments.

TI Wheat Can Access Phosphorus From Algal Biomass as Quickly and
   Continuously as From Mineral Fertilizer
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article

   efficiency; wheat
AB Algae can efficiently take up excess nutrients from waterways, making them a valuable resource potentially capable of replacing synthesized and mined fertilizers for agriculture. The capacity of algae to fertilize crops has been quantified, but it is not known how the algae-derived nutrients become available to plants. We aimed to address this question: what are the temporal dynamics of plant growth responses to algal biomass? to better propose mechanisms by which plants acquire nutrients from algal biomass and thereby study and promote those processes in future agricultural applications. Data from various sources were transformed and used to reconstruct the nutrient release from the algae Chlorella vulgaris and subsequent uptake by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (as reported in Schreiber et al., 2018). Plants had received 0.1x or 1x dried algae or wet algae, or zero, 0.1x or 1x mineral fertilizer calculated from agricultural practices for P application and grown to 55 days in three soils. Contents of P and other nutrients acquired from algae were as high as from mineral fertilizer, but varied based on moisture content and amount of algae applied to soils (by 55 days after sowing plants with 1x mineral fertilizer and 1x dried algae had 5.6 mg P g DWshoot; 2.2-fold more than those with 0 or 0.1x mineral fertilizer, 0.1x dried algae and wet algae, and 1x wet algae). Absolute and relative leaf area growth and estimated P uptake rates showed similar dynamics, indicating that wheat acquires P from algae quickly. A model proposes that algal fertilizer promotes wheat growth after rapid transformation in soil to inorganic nutrients. We conclude theoretically that phosphorus from algal biomass is available to wheat seedlings upon its application and is released gradually over time with minor differences related to moisture content on application. The growth and P uptake kinetics hint at nutrient forms, including N, and biomass stimulation worthy of research to further exploit algae in sustainable agriculture practices. Temporal resolved phenotype analyses in combination with a mass-balance approach is helpful for understanding resource uptake from recycled and biofertilizer sources by plants.

AB As some intertidal biota presently live near their upper tolerable thermal limits when emersed, predicted hotter temperatures and an increased frequency of extreme-heat events associated with global climate change may challenge the survival and persistence of such species. To predict the biological ramifications of climate change on rocky seashores, ecologists have collected baseline rock temperature data, which has shown substrate temperature is heterogenous in the rocky intertidal zone. A multitude of factors may affect rock temperature, although the potential roles of boulder surface (upper versus lower), lithology (rock type) and minerology have been largely neglected to date. Consequently, a common-garden experiment using intertidal boulders of six rock types tested whether temperature characteristics differed among rock types, boulder surfaces, and whether temperature characteristics were associated with rock mineralogy. The temperature of the upper and lower surfaces of all six rock types was heterogeneous at the millimetre to centimetre scale. Three qualitative patterns of temperature difference were identified on boulder surfaces: gradients; mosaics; and limited heterogeneity. The frequency of occurrence of these temperature patterns was heavily influenced by cloud cover. Upper surfaces were generally hotter than lower surfaces, plus purple siltstone and grey siltstone consistently had the hottest temperatures and white limestone and quartzite the coolest. Each rock type had unique mineralogy, with maximum temperatures correlated with the highest metallic oxide and trace metal content of rocks. These baseline data show that rock type, boulder surface and mineralogy all contribute to patterns of heterogenous substrate temperature, with the geological history of rocky seashores potentially influencing the future fate of species and populations under various climate change scenarios.

AB Meeting rising demand for oil palm whilst minimizing the loss of tropical biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions is a core conservation challenge. One potential solution is focusing the expansion of high-yielding crops on presently low-yielding farmlands alongside protecting nearby tropical forests that can enhance provision of ecosystem functions. A key question is how this solution would impact invertebrate functional diversity. We focus on oil palm in the Colombian Llanos, where plantations are replacing improved cattle pastures and forest fragments, and on dung beetles, which play key functional roles in nutrient cycling and secondary seed dispersal. We show that functional richness and functional diversity of dung beetles is greater in oil palm than in cattle pasture, and that functional metrics did not differ between oil palm and remnant forest. The abundance-size class profile of dung beetles in oil palm was more similar to forest than to pasture, which had lower abundances of the smallest and largest dung beetles. The abundance of tunneling and rolling dung beetles did not differ between oil palm and forest, while higher forest cover increased the abundance of diurnal and generalist-feeding beetles in oil palm landscapes. This suggests that prioritizing agricultural development on low-yielding cattle pasture will have positive effects on functional diversity and highlights the need for forest protection to maintain ecosystem functioning within agricultural landscapes.

AB Wildfire is a natural process in Brazilian savannas, but human activities alter fire regimes and threaten biodiversity. In this study, we used an ecoacoustics approach to assess fauna responses and recovery after wildfire in a Brazilian savanna Six passive acoustic monitoring devices were used to record soundscapes before and after a wildfire a at burned and non-burned sites for one year and one month (September 2012 to September 2013). Power Spectral Density and the Acoustic Complexity Index were used to track biophony. Before the fire, the two sites had similar biophonic patterns (PSD: T = 1136, Z = 1.52, P = 0.12; ACI: T = 1117, Z = 1.10, P = 0.26) and soniferous species richness (Site 1 = 52 and Site 2 = 49). However, in the first two sessions of recordings after the tire, biophony became higher at the burned site during the day (PSD: T = 211 and 233; Z = 4.13 and 6.41; ACI: T = 120 and 469, Z = 5.14 and 7.07; all P < 0.00). During the night, biophony was usually higher at the non-burned site until May 2013 (PSD: T = 0 to 453; Z = 3.30 to 5.90; ACI: T= 333 to 491, Z = 3.80 to 4.93; all P < 0.00). Biophony became similar (P = 0.17 to 0.38) at the two sites or higher (P = 0.00 to 0.01) at the burned site from July to September 2013 (PSD: T = 55 to 1167; Z = 1.35 to 6.89; ACI: T = 719 to 1365, Z = 0.87 to 3.04). After the fire, a reduction of soniferous species at the burned site was observed for insects and bats. Both biophonic activity and soniferous species showed a tendency to recover one year after the fire, but there were still less species in September 2013 (non-burned = 43 and burned = 37) when compared to September 2012 at both sites (Site 1 = 52 and Site 2 = 49). Our results showed that changes in the natural regimes of fire can negatively impact the biodiversity and reinforce the need for monitoring protocols and inspection of wildfires.

AB Population genomic approaches can characterize dispersal across a single generation through to many generations in the past, bridging the gap between individual movement and intergenerational gene flow. These approaches are particularly useful when investigating dispersal in recently altered systems, where they provide a way of inferring long-distance dispersal between newly established populations and their interactions with existing populations. Human-mediated biological invasions represent such altered systems which can be investigated with appropriate study designs and analyses. Here we apply temporally restricted sampling and a range of population genomic approaches to investigate dispersal in a 2004 invasion of Aedes albopictus (the Asian tiger mosquito) in the Torres Strait Islands (TSI) of Australia. We sampled mosquitoes from 13 TSI villages simultaneously and genotyped 373 mosquitoes at genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): 331 from the TSI, 36 from Papua New Guinea (PNG) and four incursive mosquitoes detected in uninvaded regions. Within villages, spatial genetic structure varied substantially but overall displayed isolation by distance and a neighbourhood size of 232-577. Close kin dyads revealed recent movement between islands 31-203 km apart, and deep learning inferences showed incursive Ae. albopictus had travelled to uninvaded regions from both adjacent and nonadjacent islands. Private alleles and a co-ancestry matrix indicated direct gene flow from PNG into nearby islands. Outlier analyses also detected four linked alleles introgressed from PNG, with the alleles surrounding 12 resistance-associated cytochrome P450 genes. By treating dispersal as both an intergenerational process and a set of discrete events, we describe a highly interconnected invasive system.

AB When prioritizing populations for conservation of a given species, it is unclear whether the distribution of standing genetic variation can be used as a suitable proxy for the distribution of useful adaptive genetic variation. We tested whether using genome-wide and putatively adaptive genetic variation give similar prioritization results. We identified adaptive loci via their association with either environmental factors or phenotypic traits using two genomic data sets: yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia) across North America and lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta) in western Canada. We measured pairwise differentiation among populations using a principal components analysis and used a phylogenetic approach (NeighborNet networks) coupled with a measure of evolutionary distinctiveness (Shapley value) to attribute a priority rank to each population. Overall, we found that prioritization rankings using adaptive variation alone were not significantly divergent from rankings based on genome-wide genetic variation. Our testing framework might be of immediate use to conservation practitioners collecting next-generation sequencing data, and we call for further investigation in other species. Our results suggest that we may not need to pursue the contingent step of identifying adaptive variation in species of concern before prioritizing populations, i.e. a naive approach of using genome-wide genetic variation might be a suitable proxy for identifying local adaptation.

AB Aims For plants, elemental nutrients are important belowground resources that sustain growth and survival. To understand how tropical plant nutrient status responds to environmental variation, we asked whether concentrations of nutrients in root and leaf tissues track gradients in soil nutrient concentrations and if tissue nutrient concentrations respond independently or in concert to soil nutrient concentrations. Methods We measured soil nutrient concentrations of rhizosphere soil and root and leaf tissue elemental concentrations of saplings from 14 Angiosperm families in montane tropical forest of Jianfengling, China. Using mixed-effects models, we modeled the nutrient concentration of plant tissues as a function of soil resources. Results Of fourteen elements measured, seven -nitrogen, boron, phosphorus, potassium, manganese, copper and zinc- increased in concentrations in root and leaf tissues with higher soil nutrient availability; two decreased -aluminum and carbon; three were invariant -magnesium, sulfur, and calcium; and two -sodium and iron- showed contrasting patterns between leaves and roots. Eight elements necessary to leaf physiological function, but also used in root functioning -nitrogen, boron, magnesium phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, manganese- were more concentrated in leaves than roots. Additionally, most elements showed tradeoffs in concentrations between roots and leaves. Plant lineage (i.e. family) explained very little of the variation about this overall trend. Conclusions Overall, increases in tissue nutrient concentrations with soil fertility were subtle if present at all. Thus, we conclude that tissue nutrients of juvenile tropical trees have a high degree of elemental homeostasis with local-scale soil nutrient content in Jianfengling.

TI Differences in genetic diversity and divergence between brooding and
   broadcast spawning corals across two spatial scales in the Coral
   Triangle region
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Coral Triangle region contains the world's highest marine biodiversity, however, these reefs are also the most threatened by global and local threats. A main limitation that prevents the implementation of adequate conservation measures is that connectivity and genetic structure of populations is poorly known. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity patterns of tropical corals in Indonesia on two different spatial scales, as well as by comparing two different reproduction strategies. Genotyping was based on microsatellite markers for 316 individual Seriatopora hystrix colonies and 142 Acropora millepora colonies sampled in Pulau Seribu and Spermonde Archipelago in 2012 and 2013. Differences in allelic diversity and a strong signature of divergence associated with historical land barriers at the Sunda Shelf were found for the brooding coral Seriatopora hystrix. However, differences in diversity and divergence were not pronounced in the broadcast spawning coral Acropora millepora. Within Spermonde Archipelago, two groups were identified: (1) sites of the sheltered inner-shelf and mid-shelf, which were found to be highly interconnected and (2) mid-shelf and outer-shelf sites characterised by higher differentiation. These patterns of contemporary dispersal barriers and genetic diversity can be explained by the differences in life history of the corals, as well as by oceanographic conditions facilitating larval dispersal. The contemporary dispersal barriers found within the Spermonde Archipelago emphasise the need for incorporating connectivity data in future conservation efforts.

DE Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Biodiversity; Ecosystem stability;

AB Background and aims Nutrient resource utilization is essential for plant community composition and productivity. Previous studies found that an increase in resource diversity causes species losses and reduces plant diversity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can increase plant productivity and nutrient uptake, however, whether AM fungi can reduce the negative influence of nutrient resource diversity on plant composition is still not well understood.
   Methods A microcosm experiment was conducted with four phosphorus (P) sources (at five levels of P resource diversity) and two AM fungal species, and the plant community composition, aboveground biomass, and P content were measured and calculated.
   Results Plant species diversity and richness decreased with increasing soil P resource diversity in the absence of AM fungi, while the decrease was less when AM fungi were present. The biomass and P content of the aboveground plants increased with increasing AM fungal diversity and soil P resource diversity. The results of a structural equation model suggest that AM fungi could reduce the negative effects of increasing P resource diversity on plant community composition by improving plant density and P uptake.
   Conclusions Our results indicate that AM fungi can maintain higher plant species diversity and increase plant productivity by increasing P resource utilization efficiency.

AB Vegetation formations are undergoing constant floristic and structural change over time and space. Assessing these changes represents an important step to understand the effects of disturbances and propose ecosystem conservation and management strategies. We still lack, however, information on the dynamics of the woody vegetation in Cerrado Rupestre (rupestrian Cerrado-RC) formations over time, which comprise important refuge of the vegetation of the Brazilian Savanna and occur on rocky outcrops, which are considered restrictive environments. In this context, we describe the changes in floristic composition, richness, species diversity and structure of vegetation in RC over 12-year and link patterns to the disturbances that occur in the area-wildfire and cattle presence. We gathered data from three surveys conducted in RC in the Pireneus State Park (PSP), Goias, Brazil. We also registered hot pixels inside the study area and in the PSP neighboring area indicating presence of bovine and equine cattle in the Park. Disturbances, occurrence of wildfires, and presence of cattle promoted changes in vegetation structure, with a decrease in the number of small individuals, but not in diversity parameters. The increase in richness, evenness and diversity, even under the effect of disturbances, demonstrates the resilience of the RC. However, if these disturbances keep occurring, resilience will be compromised, with clearer changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure, according to what we proposed in a theoretical model describing the synergistic influence of cattle presence, exotic grass and wildfires on the dynamics of the Cerrado Rupestre.

AB BackgroundIn the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), four species of parrotfishes with complex phylogeographic histories co-occur in sympatry on rocky reefs from Baja California to Ecuador: Scarus compressus, S. ghobban, S. perrico, and S. rubroviolaceus. The most divergent, S. perrico, separated from a Central Indo-Pacific ancestor in the late Miocene (6.6 Ma). We tested the hypothesis that S. compressus was the result of ongoing hybridization among the other three species by sequencing four nuclear markers and a mitochondrial locus in samples spanning 2/3 of the latitudinal extent of the TEP.ResultsA Structure model indicated that K=3 fit the nuclear data and that S. compressus individuals had admixed genomes. Our data could correctly detect and assign pure adults and F1 hybrids with>0.90 probability, and correct assignment of F2s was also high in some cases. NewHybrids models revealed that 89.8% (n=59) of the S. compressus samples were F1 hybrids between either S. perricoxS. ghobban or S. perricoxS. rubroviolaceus. Similarly, the most recently diverged S. ghobban and S. rubroviolaceus were hybridizing in small numbers, with half of the admixed individuals assigned to F1 hybrids and the remainder likely>F1 hybrids. We observed strong mito-nuclear discordance in all hybrid pairs. Migrate models favored gene flow between S. perrico and S. ghobban, but not other species pairs.ConclusionsMating between divergent species is giving rise to a region-wide, multispecies hybrid complex, characterized by a high frequency of parental and F1 genotypes but a low frequency of >F1 hybrids. Trimodal structure, and evidence for fertility of both male and female F1 hybrids, suggest that fitness declines sharply in later generation hybrids. In contrast, the hybrid population of the two more recently diverged species had similar frequencies of F1 and >F1 hybrids, suggesting accelerating post-mating incompatibility with time. Mitochondrial genotypes in hybrids suggest that indiscriminate mating by male S. perrico is driving pre-zygotic breakdown, which may reflect isolation of this endemic species for millions of years resulting in weak selection for conspecific mate recognition. Despite overlapping habitat use and high rates of hybridization, species boundaries are maintained by a combination of pre- and post-mating processes in this complex.

Natural sources of noise predate the origin of hearing organs in animals. Therefore, it is unlikely that animals have only recently evolved strategies to cope with anthropogenic noise de novo but, rather, already have preexisting coping mechanisms, because o countless generations of evolution within a naturally noisy world, on which contemporary selection is now likely acting. We review strategies to cope with natural sources of noise and suggest a more quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how particular characteristics of noise have shaped animal populations and communities in the past, enabling us to predict the effects that novel sources of noise will have on the future.

AB The Eastern Cape Province harbors almost half of the indigenous forest in South Africa, but these forests are threatened by large-scale agricultural and urban development planned for the coming decade. Additional anthropogenic development is likely to cause further fragmentation and degradation of forests inhabited by the dusky pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus hesperidus). We used eight microsatellite markers to study the genetic diversity, population structure, and migration, of P. hesperidus (n = 120) across 14 sites in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. We examined the effect of contemporary land cover types on genetic differentiation to assess whether current levels of urbanization and agricultural development affect gene flow. High gene flow and low population structure were evident across sampled sites, apart from genetic discontinuities at the northern (Oribi Gorge Nature Reserve) and southern (Alexandria Forest) ends of the seaboard. Genetic discontinuity at Oribi Gorge may relate to anthropogenic modification of two rivers surrounding the forest, while the Alexandria-linked barrier is a climatic break known as the Bedford gap. Migration rates generally were low between sites except for one Scarp forest, Manubi State Forest, from which individuals dispersed to other sites. The Amatole Mistbelt forests supported high genetic diversity, and likely served as a refugium for P. hesperidus during the Last Glacial Maximum. The composition of land cover classes between sites was a poor predictor of genetic differentiation, although it seems likely that P. hesperidus uses riparian habitats and wetlands for dispersal. Lastly, urban and agricultural development did not have a significant effect on genetic differentiation, which may reflect the wide niche breadth and intermediate distribution range of the species. This study provides insights into genetic diversity and gene flow of P. hesperidus across the study region prior to agricultural intensification and large-scale urbanization.

AB Leiolepis ocellata is a lizard species distributing in topographically diverse habitats in northern Thailand. To explore its evolutionary history, 113 samples of L. ocellata were collected from 11 localities covering its distributional range in northern Thailand, and sequenced for mtDNA fragments (Cyt b and ND2). Pairwise comparisons across sampling localities yielded significant genetic differentiation (F-ST and Jost's D) but no clear pattern of isolation by distance could be demonstrated based on the Mantel test. Phylogenetic and network analyses highlighted six haplogroups. Their divergence times were estimated to occur during the Pleistocene, much more recent than major orogenic events affecting northern Thailand. Instead, the results suggested that lineage divergences, of particularly eastern and western haplogroups of the region, coincided with the major rivers in the region (Yom river and Ping river, respectively), indicating vicariance in response to riverine barriers. Furthermore, ecological niche modeling suggested an expansion of suitable habitats of L. ocellata, when LGM-liked conditions. This expansion potentially facilitated their dispersal among adjacent localities leading to lineage diversification and genetic admixture, after the riverine divergence.

AB 1. Large areas of highly productive tropical forests occur on weathered soils with low concentrations of available phosphorus (P). In such forests, root and microbial production of acid phosphatase enzymes capable of mineralizing organic phosphorus is considered vital to increasing available P for plant uptake.
   2. We measured both root and soil phosphatase throughout depth and alongside a variety of root and soil factors to better understand the potential of roots and soil biota to increase P availability and to constrain estimates of the biochemical mineralization within ecosystem models.
   3. We measured soil phosphatase down to 1 m, root phosphatase to 30 cm, and collected data on fine-root mass density, specific root length, soil P, bulk density, and soil texture using soil cores in four tropical forests within the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico.
   4. We found that soil phosphatase decreased with soil depth, but not root phosphatase. Furthermore, when both soil and root phosphatase were expressed per soil volume, soil phosphatase was 100-fold higher that root phosphatase.
   5. Both root and soil factors influenced soil and root phosphatase. Soil phosphatase increased with fine-root mass density and organic P, which together explained over 50% of the variation in soil phosphatase. Over 80% of the variation in root phosphatase per unit root mass was attributed to specific root length (positive correlation) and available (resin) P (negative correlation).
   6. Synthesis: Fine-root traits and soil P data are necessary to understand and represent soil and root phosphatase activity throughout the soil column and across sites with different soil conditions and tree species. These findings can be used to parameterize or benchmark estimates of biochemical mineralization in ecosystem models that contain fine-root biomass and soil P distributions throughout depth.

AB Our research is the most comprehensive study of jaguar behavior ecology in Mexico. By analyzing and describing the movements and use of the space, as well as the interactions among individual jaguars, we can better understand their behavioral differences, habitat use, and home range. This type of information is critical for the development and implementation of effective and appropriate conservation strategies. We identified home range size for 14 jaguars in a 13-year period and described the interspecific relations and use of space by the percentages of overlap of the territories between individuals. Collectively, the average home range size was larger than 200 km(2), ranging from 48 to 633 km(2) and averaging 296 km(2) for males varied and 37-435 km(2), with an average of 148 km(2), for females. However, home range sizes did not differ significantly among males or females. Male territory overlapped about 3.3% on average (range 2.5-15.5%), suggesting that most of the time males avoid each other. Average overlap of female territory was 12%, ranging from 7 to 100%. Males share an average of 18% (range 2-56%) of its territory and with up to five females, suggesting that a given male may be related to all of them at certain periods of time. There were no seasonal changes (dry and rainy seasons) in home range sizes for both male and females. Our research is an important contribution to the ecological information essential for landscape-level conservation plans for the protection of the jaguars and the biological diversity of the wider Yucatan Peninsula in which they inhabit.

AB Mammals figure prominently in tropical ecology because of their role in seed dispersal, herbivore control, and nutrient cycling. Urbanization is a conservation concern for mammals not only because of lost habitat, but also other negative impacts such as illegal hunting and pollution. Some mammals are resilient to urbanization and can persist in degraded habitats; however, this has not been studied in many tropical sites. We used camera traps to study mammals in Peperpot Nature Park (PNP), a secondary forest located 5 km from the capital of Suriname, and compared it to the large Central Suriname Nature Reserve (CSNR). We found fewer species in PNP (20) compared to CSNR (30), however, PNP included apex predators and species of conservation concern, and the two sites had a similar relative abundance of large cats and most mesocarnivores. Smaller mammal species had higher relative abundance at PNP while larger herbivores were scarce or absent, likely from poaching, as PNP is still connected to interior forests. The detection models revealed that the park, the camera trap was set in, was the most common significant factor for most species, suggesting that broader landscape level effects are important. In occupancy models, the null model was the most common top model across species, but then followed by park. Despite fewer species being detected than in large protected areas, the presence of some species in PNP which are historically absent in developed areas shows promise for small urban tropical forests to support robust mammal communities, provided they maintain some connectivity to larger source habitats.

AB Plant invasions can have major impacts on ecosystems and influence global species diversity. In Central Europe, Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) and American goldenrods (Solidago canadensis and S. gigantea) are important invaders often establishing dense and homogeneous stands, especially in urban and other disturbed habitats. We investigated their impacts on plant-dwelling spiders (abundance, family structure, guild structure) and potential spider prey items during flowering season within an urbanized landscape using a paired design comparing invaded and native reference vegetation plots. In general, flowering American goldenrods and Himalayan balsam had no significant impacts on the spider family composition. Invasion of American goldenrods further had no effect on total spider abundance and potential prey item abundance. In contrast, goldenrods showed a significantly increased crab spider (Thomisidae) abundance while being less inhabited by web builders. Himalayan balsam negatively influenced free hunters and running crab spider (Philodromidae) abundance, while we found no effects on other groups and total spider abundance. For Himalayan balsam, potential prey item abundance was higher than in native vegetation stands. Notwithstanding that our results only represent a snapshot of the system, they suggest that large-scale removal of urban goldenrod stands during flowering season might negatively influence local spider abundance, especially of crab spiders. Management efforts should therefore be accompanied by compensation measures to avoid disruptive effects on local plant-dwelling spider communities.

AB Tropical forests have been focused for mitigating climate change impact through carbon sequestration in plant biomass under clean development mechanism (CDM). Since trees represent more than 98% of the above ground plant biomass, variation in tree growth rate drives carbon dynamics in tropical forests. By using tree-ring analysis, trait-based measurements, and field observations, we aimed at understanding the drivers of growth rate variation in four South Asian tropical moist forest tree species varying in plant functional types. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that mainly demographic and wood traits represented the first axis explaining 37% of the variance, whereas the second axis was represented by the leaf traits. Stem growth rate (DI) showed a nonlinear negative relation with competition index (CI) and the ratio of crown surface area to basal area (CBR) in three out of four tree species (p < 0.001) except Lagerstroemia speciosa which showed no significant relationship with any of the studied variables. DI was linearly positively related with light interception index (LI) and the ratio of sapwood area to heartwood area (SHR) in the shade intolerant Magnolia champaca and Toona ciliata (p < 0.001). Sap wood area (SA) had a strong positive effect on DI in the three species (p < 0.001). Taking tree size as a random factor and thus accounting for ontogenetic effects on tree growth, linear mixed effect modelling revealed that CI, SA and SHR are the best predictors of DI in M. champaca (AIC = 25.81, R-m(2) = 0.81) and T. ciliata (AIC = 62.95, R-m(2) = 0.61). In C. tabularis, CI, SA and CBR included in the best model predicting DI (AIC = 94.62, R-m(2) = 0.55). Variance partitioning analysis showed that the highest pure effect was observed in C. tabularis contributed by CI (12%), while the highest joint effect was found in M. champaca contributed by CI, SA and SHR (40%). Our analyses suggest that competition by neighbouring trees especially for soil moisture and the amount of active xylem portion are the main drivers of tree growth in moist tropical forests. Since tree growth rates regulate forest carbon dynamics, the insights into the growth drivers of the four selected species revealed by the study have important implications for forest/plantation management with a focus on carbon storage under CDM.

   assay; Dichotomous choice tests; Limia
AB Reproductive investment was initially thought to be the key selective force behind male mate preference for female characters, like size or ornamentation (i.e., the preference by males for certain females). Yet, evidence of polygynous species, where male reproductive investments are often inexpensive compared to those of females, have also been described to possess male preference. Our study aims to understand how reproductive investment influences the selection of choosy males in polygynous systems using two species of livebearing fishes varying in reproductive investment: Limia perugiae, in which males invest heavily into reproduction, and L. zonata in which males invest minimally into reproduction. We hypothesized that male reproductive investment when combined with fecundity selection will favour the evolution of male mate preference and thereby lead to males that invest heavily into reproduction being choosier than males that invest minimally. When male Limia were exposed to two females simultaneously, one from the small size class and one from the large size class, L. zonata chose large females over small ones, whereas L. perugiae allocated the same amount of time regardless of female size class. Although we fail to find support for our original hypotheses, our study highlights the need for a more thorough examination of non-model species like Limia. We suggest future studies analyse reproductive investment as it interacts with cryptic choice, multiple sensory cues as well as expand comparisons to multiple Limia species, especially those endemic to Cuba, Grand Cayman, and Jamaica.

AB Nibblers (family Girellidae) are reef fishes that are mostly distributed in the Indo-Pacific, with one exception: Girella stuebeli, which is found in the Cabo Verde Archipelago, in the Atlantic Ocean. We capitalized on this unusual distribution to study the evolutionary history of the girellids, and determine the relationship between G. stuebeli and the remaining nibbler taxa. Based on thousands of genomic markers (RAD sequences), we identified the closest relatives of G. stuebeli as being a clade of three species endemic to the northwestern Pacific, restricted to the Sea of Japan and vicinity. This clade diverged from G. stuebeli approximately 2.2 Mya. Two alternative potential routes of migration may explain this affinity: a western route, from the Tropical Eastern Pacific and the Tropical Western Atlantic, and an eastern route via the Indian Ocean and Southern Africa. The geological history and oceanography of the regions combined with molecular data presented here, suggest that the eastern route of invasion (via the Indian Ocean and Southern Africa) is a more likely scenario.

AB Tropical forests are the main reservoirs for global biodiversity and climate control. As secondary forests are now more widespread than primary forests, understanding their functioning and role in the biosphere is increasingly important. This includes understanding how they achieve stability, how they accumulate species and build biodiversity and how they cycle nutrients and carbon. This study investigates how we can restore tropical secondary forests to resemble high biomass, highly biodiverse and stable ecosystems seen today only in primary, undisturbed forests. The study used historic aerial photographs and recent high-resolution satellite images from 1945 to 2014 to map forest patches with five age categories, from 14-years to over 70-years, in Hong Kong's degraded tropical landscape. A forest inventory comprising 28 quadrats provided a rare opportunity to relate patterns of species composition at different stages during the succession with topographic and soil characteristics. The topographic variables accounted for 15% of the variance in species abundance, and age of forest stands explained 29%. Species richness rapidly increased after the first 15 years, but was lower in old-growth, than in medium age forest. This is attributed to the inability of late-successional species to disperse into the young forests as the natural dispersal agents (birds, mammals) have been lost. Light-loving pioneers which are unable to tolerate the shade of older forests, cannot regenerate in their own shade, therefore species diversity declines after a few decades. For ecosystem restoration in tropical secondary forests, introduction of late-successional species is necessary to assist natural succession, given the absence of native fauna, seed dispersal agents, and the surrounding altered environment. We also show that remote sensing can play a pivotal role in understanding the recovery and functioning of secondary forest regeneration as its contribution to the biosphere is increasingly important.

AB The phylogeny of the cricket genus Eidmanacris is used to analyse its historical distribution and diversification in three South American biomes: Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Chiquitano Dry Forest. A morphological phylogeny with all the 29 species of Eidmanacris and the Geographically explicit Event Model (GEM) is used to explain their colonization and diversification through three different biomes and their ancestral habitats and distributional areas. We analysed ecologically-significant characters, such as body size and metanotal characters, to test whether if morphology, habitat, or behaviour are connected. The relations of these features with the colonisation of wetter or drier biomes based on the distributional area, phylogeny and diversity of the genus were also tested. The results show that the ancestral distribution of the genus was the Atlantic Forest, and that biome occupancy, habitat, size, and mating behaviour evolved congruently through the phylogeny, drawing a coherent pattern of changes through Eidmanacris evolution toward the colonisation of drier biomes. Our results indicate that gallery forests could play a key role in the distribution and diversification of Eidmanacris species.

AB State and local governments consider payment for ecosystem services (PES) a valuable tool for watershed protection. However, regional differences in PES policies, which significantly influence province-scale cooperation, have been seldom documented. The interrelationships among these policies directly affect overall PES development in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). Textual analysis was used to categorize the content of PES policies in 11 provinces from 2004 to 2018. Then, we assessed these PES policies with four indicators (i.e., policy intensity, interdepartmental coordination, diversity, and duration). Finally, we analyzed the impact factors of these regional differences. The results showed that the number of PES policies increased yearly, reaching a peak in 2017. Provinces in the upper reaches had the highest policy-intensity score (7.38), followed by downstream provinces (6.39) and provinces in the middle reaches (4.52). Regarding interdepartmental coordination, the downstream areas exhibited the most interdepartment interaction (27.92%), followed by the upstream areas (20.76%) and the middle areas (19.18%). Diversity in the middle reaches was the highest (scored 4.3) while the upstream area exhibited the lowest diversity value (3.25). Downstream provinces issued PES policies the earliest, with a duration 5.52 years, followed by the upstream provinces (4.68) and middle provinces (4.28). Policy intensity was significantly correlated with fixed-asset investment, solid-waste generation, and population. The results suggest that PES in the YREB needs to be strengthened by enhancing policy consistency. In this regard, identifying regional differences in PES policies can help improve the coordination of PES policies for the whole YREB.

Recent advances in 3D forest reconstruction as well as the use of radiative transfer modelling provide new insights into spatio-temporal variations of light distribution within a forest canopy.
   We used high resolution laser scanning data coupled with in-situ leaf optical properties (LOP) measurements to parameterize the DART radiative transfer model for a temperate deciduous forest on the Laegern mountain, Switzerland, and for a tropical rain forest located in the Lambir Hills national park, Borneo, Malaysia. Combining terrestrial and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) laser scanning acquisitions allowed a high detailed, 3D reconstruction of forest canopies.
   We analyse the impact of the two contrasting forest canopies, both in terms of structure as well as optical properties, on the 3D extinction of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR, 400 nm - 700 nm) for a whole diurnal cycle. We show that PAR extinction is mainly driven by the canopy structure, resulting in an exponential light extinction profile for the temperate and a more linear extinction profile in the tropical site. The larger 3D heterogeneity in canopy structure for the tropical site also resulted in larger variability in light extinction throughout the whole canopy. We found that contrasting LOPs between the two forests had a minor influence on light extinction. However, approximating light extinction profiles with layered Beer-Lambert or Big-Leaf models only poorly represented the 3D heterogeneity of light extinction within the canopy, illustrating the need for more detailed 3D modelling of light distribution within forest ecosystems. This can give us important insights into light-related mechanisms driving species coexistence, competition and diversity in complex forest ecosystems.

AB In peri-urban regions, the establishment of new forest patches can be affected by specific community assembly rules driving species extinction debts and colonization credits. This might result in species surpluses or deficits and shifts in species composition along forest establishment, whose association with human-driven landscape transformation remains largely unknown. We have compared plant assemblages in peri-urban Mediterranean forests of contrasting history (recent vs. preexisting; post- vs. pre-1956) according to species' habitat requirements (forest, scrub-grassland, synanthropic or other) and dispersal mode (vertebrate- vs. non-vertebrate), while considering site and landscape characteristics. Species richness and cover were mostly associated to site characteristics, but also to forest connectivity and history. Connectivity increased total species cover, forest species richness and both richness and cover of vertebrate-dispersed species, while reducing non-forest species richness and synanthropic species cover. Regarding forest history, recent stands showed higher total and non-forest species richness, higher scrub-grassland species cover and lower cover of vertebrate-dispersed species than preexisting forests. Thus, recent stands exhibit a species surplus due to the extinction debt of scrub-grassland species and the transient abundance of synanthropic species, despite the observed colonization credit of vertebrate-dispersed species. These results emphasize the importance of forest connectivity when managing plant species assemblage in peri-urban forest patches but also highlight the need to consider recent history of habitat patches to manage time lags in biodiversity change in human-transformed landscapes.

AB The eradication of invasive species from islands yields significant conservation returns. However, novel challenges continue to arise as projects expand in their scope, complexity and scale. Prey-loss and secondary poisoning were historically considered to have limited impact on native top-order predators when planning eradications, but this has rarely been tested quantitatively.
   We used a 10-year timeseries of Brown Skua Stercorarius antarcticus lonnbergi breeding surveys and isotopic dietary analysis on Macquarie Island to investigate how prey-loss and secondary poisoning deaths resulting from the eradication of an abundant invasive prey species, European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, affected a top-order predator.
   Skua nest density declined from 7.14 nests/km(2) (95% CI: 6.01-8.27) in the presence of rabbits (pre-eradication) to 3.73 nests/km(2) (95% CI: 2.96-4.51) in the first 3 years after the eradication of rabbits, before showing signs of recovery in the 4 years thereafter. However, breeding success dropped from 1.01 chicks/nest (95% CI: 0.76-1.26) to as low as 0.38 chicks/nest (95% CI: 0.23-0.53) with little evidence of recovery.
   Secondary poisoning affected a greater number of skuas than anticipated prior to the eradication, including skuas nesting in areas where rabbits were not typically hunted as prey. We highlight that invasive prey often replace native prey in the diet of native predators rather than provide an additional source of food, and rapid eradication of non-native prey can have long-term impacts for predators, particularly when recovery of native prey is slow.
   Synthesis and applications. Monitoring programmes that complement large-scale eradication projects and address (a) trophic-driven declines in predator populations and (b) population-level impacts of secondary poisoning are integral to ensuring bottom-up effects of eradications are anticipated and adequately quantified. If prey deficits caused by eradication of invasive prey are expected to be severe but short-lived, supplementary feeding programmes may buffer against increased predation pressure on native prey and reduced breeding success of native predators. Alternatively, if the rapid recovery of native prey is not expected to occur naturally, breeding programmes and translocation of native prey prior to assist recovery of native predators should be considered to support ecosystem restoration.

AB The summer of 2017 in the Calabria Region (South Italy) was an exceptional wildfire season with the largest area burned by wildfires in the last 11 years (2008-2019). The equivalent black carbon (EBC) and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements, recorded at the high-altitude Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Monte Curcio (MCU) regional station, were analyzed to establish the wildfires' impact on air quality, human health, and the ecosystem. A method was applied to identify the possible wildfires that influenced the air quality based on the integration of fire data (both satellite and ground-based) and the high-resolution WRF-HYSPLIT trajectories. The satellite-based fires applied to WRF-HYSPLIT with 10 km of spatial resolution allowed us to establish that for 52.5% of total cases, wildfires were located outside the Calabria Region, and they were influenced by long-range transport. Nonetheless, the impact on human health, qualitatively evaluated in terms of passively smoked cigarettes (PSC) corresponding to the EBC, was greater when wildfires were local. Indeed, for wildfires located mainly in Calabria, the equivalent PSC ranged from 2.75 to 11.08. This maximum PSC value was close to the daily number of smoked cigarettes in Calabria (approximately 12.4). Even if this analogy does not imply a proportional effect between the estimated number of cigarettes smoked and the effective wildfire EBC exposure, this result suggests that wildfire emissions may have negative effects on people's health. Moreover, a focus on the Calabria Region was conducted using high-resolution ground-based GPS and higher resolution WRF-HYSPLIT back-trajectories (2 km) to measure wildfires. The validity of the methodology was confirmed by the EBC and CO positive correlation with the ratio between the identified ground-based burned areas and the distance from the sampling station. Moreover, the impact on the ecosystem was studied by analyzing the land vegetation loss due to the wildfires that contributed to air quality reduction at the MCU station. A total of more than 1679 ha of vegetation burned, the main losses comprising forests and shrubland. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global warming, extreme climate events, earthquakes and their accompanying socioeconomic disasters pose significant risks to humanity. Yet due to the nonlinear feedbacks, multiple interactions and complex structures of the Earth system, the understanding and, in particular, the prediction of such disruptive events represent formidable challenges to both scientific and policy communities. During the past years, the emergence and evolution of Earth system science has attracted much attention and produced new concepts and frameworks. Especially, novel statistical physics and complex networks based techniques have been developed and implemented to substantially advance our knowledge of the Earth system, including climate extreme events, earthquakes and geological relief features, leading to substantially improved predictive performances. We present here a comprehensive review on the recent scientific progress in the development and application of how combined statistical physics and complex systems science approaches such as critical phenomena, network theory, percolation, tipping points analysis, and entropy can be applied to complex Earth systems. Notably, these integrating tools and approaches provide new insights and perspectives for understanding the dynamics of the Earth systems. The overall aim of this review is to offer readers the knowledge on how statistical physics concepts and theories can be useful in the field of Earth system science. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB As humanity continues to alter the environment extensively, comprehending the effect of anthropogenic disturbances on the health, survival, and fitness of wildlife is a crucial question for conservation science. Many primate populations occupy suboptimal habitats prone to diverse anthropogenic disturbances that may be sources of acute and chronic stress. Quantification of glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations has repeatedly been used to explore the impact of disturbances on physiological stress. Although it is still debated, prolonged elevation of GC levels may impair reproduction, growth, and immune system activity of individuals. We quantified the effect of anthropogenic disturbances on physiological stress in primates with a global meta-analysis based on data from 26 articles, covering 24 distinct species in 13 different countries. Anthropogenic disturbances were classified into 6 distinct categories: habitat loss, habitat degradation, ongoing logging, hunting, tourism, and other human activities. We calculated effect sizes (Hedges' g) with the standardized mean difference in GC concentrations between primates affected by human activity and their undisturbed conspecifics. We ran random-effects models and subgroup analyses to estimate the overall effect as well as a cumulative effect size for each disturbance category. Overall, primates inhabiting sites subject to anthropogenic disturbances exhibited significantly higher GC levels (g = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.28-0.93). Habitat loss and hunting were overall associated with increased GC concentrations, whereas the cumulative effects of the other disturbances were not statistically significant. Biologically, high GC levels may increase fitness by enabling individuals to overcome the challenges linked to anthropogenic disturbances. However, primates in disturbed environments may have sustained elevated GC levels. To strengthen future research, it is necessary to control confounding factors systematically (e.g., diet, reproductive status, predatory pressure, and resource availability) and improve understanding of the link between GC levels and the health, fitness, and survival of animals.

TI What Would a Tree Say About Its Size?

ID FOREST; CARBON; DENSITY; BIOMASS; HEIGHT; RESPIRATION; RETHINKING;
   MORTALITY; IMPACTS; CLIMATE
AB When developing theories, designing studies, and interpreting the results, researchers are influenced by their perception of tree size. For example, we may compare two trees of the same size belonging to different species, and attribute any differences to dissimilarities between the species. However, the meaning of "same size" depends on the measures of size used. Wood density influences certain measures, such as biomass, but does not influence e.g., trunk diameter. Therefore, the choice of the measure of size can reverse any conclusions. Hence, it is import to consider which measure of size should be used. I argue that the most common measure of size, i.e., trunk diameter, is often a bad choice when wood density varies, as diameter is then not directly related to processes important in evolution. When trees with equal diameters but differing wood densities are compared, the tree with denser wood is larger if the measure of size is related to construction cost or trunk strength, a proxy of leaf area. From this perspective, the comparison is then conducted between a biologically larger heavy-wooded tree and a smaller light-wooded tree, and the differences between the trees may be caused by size instead of wood density. Therefore, trunk biomass and strength may often be more suitable measures of size, as they reflect the construction cost and biomechanical potency linked to leaf area crown height, often too challenging to estimate more directly. To assess how commonly inadequate measures of tree size have been used, I reviewed 10 highly cited journal articles. None of these 10 articles discussed the impact of wood density on biological size, and instead based the analyses on diameters or basal areas. This led to conclusions that could change or even reverse in an analysis based on biomass or strength. Overall, I do not suggest avoiding the use of diameter, but I recommend considering result sensitivity to the measure of size, particularly in studies ones with variable wood densities.

TI Lessons in ecology and conservation from a tropical forest fragment in
   Singapore
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Tropical forest fragments; Defaunation; Ecological resilience; Urban
   nature reserves
AB Forest fragments are increasingly common in the tropics as pristine forests are cleared. Fragments stranded within cities are especially stress-prone due to their greatly altered environment and high human impacts. We review biodiversity and ecological studies from Bukit Timah, a tropical forest fragment in Singapore, to ask how this forest has contributed to our understanding of tropical ecology and fragmentation effects, and list the conservation values of this forest. Evidence from Amazonian fragments predicts that losses in diversity and forest function follow fragmentation, and although Bukit Timah has adhered to some of those predictions, other aspects of the forest appeared remarkably resilient. As might be expected, declines in plant, invertebrate, bird, and mammal diversity occurred not only historically but also across two surveys made about 20 years apart. In other ways Bukit Timah proved surprising. Aboveground biomass fluctuated but did not plummet drastically, and was comparable to levels found in primary forests in the region. The extirpation of large fauna did not appear to reduce the dispersal of large seeded plant species, likely due to continued dispersal by small-mammals and birds. Exotic tree species are confined to recovering secondary forest fringes and do not threaten the primary forest, except for perhaps shade tolerant Par ' a rubber and a handful of cultivated fruit trees. Studies of birds and plants found that life history differences could account for differences in genetic connectivity or isolation for different species, with population genetic implications for other taxa. Despite being a small fragment, new species of plants and animals continue to be discovered or re-discovered. Clearly, there are reasons to celebrate Bukit Timah as a forest fragment that withstood two centuries of human impacts. Nonetheless, many measures can be implemented to better secure its future.

AB Species distribution models are useful for identifying the ecological characteristics that may limit a species' geographic range and for inferring patterns of speciation. Here, we test a hypothesis of niche conservatism across evolutionary time in a group of manakins (Aves: Pipridae), with a focus on Chiroxiphia boliviana, and examine the degree of ecological differentiation with other Chiroxiphia and Antilophia manakins. We tested whether allopatric sister species were more or less similar in environmental space than expected given their phylogenetic distances, which would suggest, respectively, ecological niche conservatism over time or ecologically mediated selection (i.e. niche divergence). We modeled the distribution of nine manakin taxa (C. boliviana, C. caudata, C. lanceolata, C. linearis, C. p. pareola, C. p. regina, C. p. napensis, Antilophia galeata and A. bokermanni) using Maxent. We first performed models for each taxon and compared them. To test our hypothesis we followed three approaches: (1) we tested whether C. boliviana could predict the distribution of the other manakin taxa and vice versa; (2) we compared the ecological niches by using metrics of niche overlap, niche equivalency and niche similarity; and (3) lastly, we tested whether niche differentiation corresponded to phylogenetic distances calculated from two recent phylogenies. All models had high training and test AUC values. Mean AUC ratios were high (>0.8) for most taxa, indicating performance better than random. Results suggested niche conservatism, and high niche overlap and equivalency between C. boliviana and C. caudata, but we found very low values between C. boliviana and the rest of the taxa. We found a negative, but not significant, relationship between niche overlap and phylogenetic distance, suggesting an increase in ecological differentiation and niche divergence over evolutionary time. Overall, we give some insights into the evolution of C. boliviana, proposing that ecological selection may have influenced its speciation.

AB This study presents the results of over 6 years (11/2011-12/2017) of energy and water flux measurements on the first eddy covariance site in Vietnam, in a mature tropical moist forest under monsoon climate. The dry season, lasting approximately four months, has strong interannual variations. Six-year average precipitation and evapotranspiration amounted to 2518 +/- 253 mm and 1519 +/- 105 mm per year, respectively, and net radiation total was 4897 +/- 145 MJ m(-2) per year. On average, the evapotranspiration increased from 3.64 +/- 1.02 mm d(-1) in a dry season to 4.65 +/- 1.02 mm d(-1) in a wet season, in parallel with a slight counterintuitive increase in net radiation, from 5.44 +/- 1.20 mm d(-1) to 5.70 +/- 1.40 mm d(-1) (equivalent water layer that evaporates using the relevant energy). In the driest months, evapotranspiration remained at a level of 60-80 mm per month in spite of nearly absent precipitation. Sensible heat increased in the second half of a dry season. The Bowen ratio was small in a wet season, increased to 1.0 in dry months, while it reached 2.2 in the anomalously hot conditions of April 2016. The average ratio of daily latent heat to daily net radiation in dry and wet season equalled to 68.9 +/- 21.4% and 83.0 +/- 8.5%, respectively. The energy balance closure in different years varied from 77.2 to 82.4% and was better in the hottest months. Canopy stomatal conductance fell sharply in hot-dry conditions and restricted evapotranspiration. Stomata' regulation of evapotranspiration occurred during three to five months depending on the severity of the dry season; however, in a wet season, evapotranspiration was fully dependent on net radiation and evapotranspiration occurred as a passive response to atmospheric demand.

AB Range-limited endemic taxa are threatened by loss of genomic diversity, which can lead to extirpation and extinction. The imperiled and narrowly distributed edaphic endemic Carex scirpoidea subsp. convoluta (Cyperaceae), which is primarily limited to alvar soils on the northern shores of Lake Huron in North America, exhibits such risk. In contrast, the conspecific C. scirpoidea subsp. scirpoidea is widely distributed across a vast geographical range and occupies various arctic and alpine habitat types. Using ddRADseq, population genomic analyses of 11 North American populations of C. scirpoidea including five subsp. convoluta populations revealed similar-to-higher levels of genomic diversity in the latter compared to its more widely distributed conspecific subsp. scirpoidea. Dioecy and a nearly obligate outcrossing mode of reproduction have likely contributed to the maintenance of genomic diversity in subsp. convoluta, preventing inbreeding depression, and contributing to the evolutionary potential of populations of this taxon. Phylogenomic and Bayesian analyses of ddRADseq data revealed that subsp. convoluta is paraphyletic with Eastern North American subsp. scirpoidea populations, suggesting that it best be considered a locally adapted ecotype. Furthermore, Eastern North America populations of both taxa arose from populations that likely occupied periglacial refugia south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, where they no longer occur. Herein, we identify conservation units among the sampled Eastern North American C. scirpoidea populations to aid management efforts, which we suggest should include habitat protection and replanting for habitat restoration purposes.

AB 1. Understanding the factors driving population structure in marine mammals is needed to evaluate the impacts of previous exploitation, current anthropogenic threats, conservation status, and success of population recovery efforts.
   2. Sperm whales are characterized by a worldwide distribution, low genetic diversity, complex patterns of social and genetic structure that differ significantly within and between ocean basins, and a long history of being commercially whaled. In Australia, sperm whales from the (International Whaling Commission assigned) southern hemisphere 'Division 5' stock were very heavily exploited by whaling.
   3. The present study assessed the potential effects of whaling on the genetic diversity of sperm whales in Australia and the population genetic structure of these whales within a global context. A combination of historical and contemporary sperm whale samples (n = 157) were analysed across six regions, from south-eastern Australia ('Division 6' stock in the Pacific Ocean) to south-western Australia ('Division 5' stock in the Indian Ocean).
   4. Sperm whales sampled from the 'Division 5' and 'Division 6' stocks belong to the same population based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses. Four novel sperm whale mtDNA haplotypes were identified in animals from Australian waters. Levels of genetic diversity were low in Australian sperm whales but were similar to those previously reported for populations in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
   5. Given the genetic distinctiveness of sperm whales in Australian waters from other regions in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the lack of recovery in population numbers, further scientific studies are needed to increase our understanding of population dynamics and the effectiveness of threat management strategies in this species.

AB How animals partition activity throughout the day is influenced by processes that affect supply and obtainability of resources. However, as resource supply and usability are often entrained by the same diurnal pattern, it has been difficult to disentangle their relative importance. Given the strong influence that tide has on the distribution and accessibility of resources, intertidal systems present opportunities to examine questions surrounding the drivers of activity patterns. Here, we used multisensory biologgers to study the activity patterns of a coastal marine predator, sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion acutidens), in a tidally driven environment. Hidden Markov models were used to identify relatively high and low locomotory activity states, which were used as proxies for behavioural-activity states and to examine the factors underpinning variation in activity patterns. Although tide governs the spatial distributions of this species and showed some effect on sharks' activity, diurnal light patterns were the predominant factor influencing behavioural-activity patterns, with the probability of high activity peaking overnight. Temperature and body size also had minor negative influences on the probability of animals being in the high-activity state. Interestingly, sharks were least likely to be in a high-activity state during high tide, a time of presumed high resource supply, contradicting the common assumption that this species forages during high tide. We suggest that despite the importance of the accessibility of resources, functional constraints, such as sensory (e.g., visual) and mechanical (e.g., swimming) performance ultimately underpin the activity patterns of intertidal marine predators through their influence on foraging success.

AB A population genomic approach was employed to investigate the diversity within species to create a more robust, lineage-specific conservation strategy for an endangered orchid. Pleione formosana is a species native to southeastern China and Taiwan, where it is distributed at an altitude range of 1,200-2,500 m the foggy mountain area and grows in mosses on half-shaded rocks or tree trunks. To identify whether the level of genetic diversity in the species, we used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to analysis the sub-populations of the species. Fifty-eight individuals of P. formosana were sampled from a total of nine populations within continental island Taiwan and three populations in China as outgroup. Treatment of all samples involved five major steps: sample preparation, library assembly, sequencing, SNP calling and diversity analysis. GBS markers confirmed the China outgroup as distinct, and provided resolution of two clusters of population genetic structure in Taiwan. Outliers provide higher genetic differentiation, and some GBS tags associated with climatic factor were found. Genomic diversity identified among the three clusters suggests that conservation of this species will be best served by considering them as three evolutionary significant units (ESUs). This approach will maximize evolutionary potential among all species during increased isolation and environmental change. According to the genetic consequences, restoration strategies should be carried out in all populations to preserve genetic diversity and evolutionary potential for different environmental factors.

AB Anthropocentric defaunation affects critical ecological processes, such as seed dispersal, putting ecosystems and biomes at risk, and leading to habitat impoverishment. Diverse restoration techniques could reverse the process of habitat impoverishment. However, in most of the restoration efforts, only vegetation cover is targeted. Fauna and flora are treated as isolated components, neglecting a key component of ecosystems' functioning, the ecological interactions. We tested whether the resilient frugivorous generalist fauna can improve habitat quality by dispersing native plant species through the use of fruit feeders as in a semideciduous seasonal urban forest fragment. A total of 32 sampling points was selected at a heavily degraded 251-ha urban forest fragment, with feeders installed at two heights monitored by camera-traps. Variable quantities of native fruits of 27 zoochorous species were offered alternately in the feeders. Based on more than 36,000 h of video records, Turdus leucomelas (Class Aves), Sapajus nigritus (Class Mammalia), and Salvator merianae (Class Reptilia) were recorded ingesting the highest fruit species richness. Didelphis albiventris (Class Mammalia) was the most frequent visitor but consumed only pulp in most of the visits. The frugivorous birds were recorded at a high visitation rate and consumed a wider variety of fruits. Our study opens a new avenue to combine the traditional approach of ecosystems recovery and ecological interactions restauration in an urban forest fragment.

AB Background Disentangling the dynamics of microbial interactions within communities improves our comprehension of metacommunity assembly of microbiota during host development and under perturbations. To assess the impact of stochastic variation of neutral processes on microbiota structure and composition under disturbance, two types of microbial habitats, free-living (water), and host-associated (skin and gut) were experimentally exposed to either a constant or gradual selection regime exerted by two sublethal cadmium chloride dosages (CdCl2). Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) was used as a piscivorous ecotoxicological model. Using 16S rDNA gene based metataxonomics, quantitative diversity metrics of water, skin and gut microbial communities were characterized along with development and across experimental conditions. Results After 30 days, constant and gradual selection regimes drove a significant alpha diversity increase for both skin and gut microbiota. In the skin, pervasive negative correlations between taxa in both selection regimes in addition to the taxonomic convergence with the environmental bacterial community, suggest a loss of colonisation resistance resulting in the dysbiosis of yellow perch microbiota. Furthermore, the network connectivity in gut microbiome was exclusively maintained by rare (low abundance) OTUs, while most abundant OTUs were mainly composed of opportunistic invaders such as Mycoplasma and other genera related to fish pathogens such as Flavobacterium. Finally, the mathematical modelling of community assembly using both non-linear least squares models (NLS) based estimates of migration rates and normalized stochasticity ratios (NST) based beta-diversity distances suggested neutral processes drove by taxonomic drift in host and water communities for almost all treatments. The NLS models predicted higher demographic stochasticity in the cadmium-free host and water microbiomes, however, NST models suggested higher ecological stochasticity under perturbations. Conclusions Neutral models agree that water and host-microbiota assembly promoted by rare taxa have evolved predominantly under neutral processes with potential involvement of deterministic forces sourced from host filtering and cadmium selection. The early signals of perturbations in the skin microbiome revealed antagonistic interactions by a preponderance of negative correlations in the co-abundance networks. Our findings enhance our understanding of community assembly host-associated and free-living under anthropogenic selective pressure.

AB Mixed plantations composed of Eucalyptus intercropped with a high diversity of native tree species are a promising option for combining biodiversity recovery with wood production during forest landscape restoration. The viability of this approach relies not only on its potential to offset implementation costs but also on the capacity of native trees to perform well when intercropped with Eucalyptus. We investigated competition for light and nutrients in these mixed plantations in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We compared (1) Eucalyptus monocultures, (2) plantations composed of native species for restoration, and (3) mixed plantations intercropping Eucalyptus with native tree species, in which Eucalyptus replaced native pioneers. We found no evidence of competition for nutrients or facilitation. Native species plots intercepted more Photosynthetically Active Radiation than Eucalyptus monocultures or mixtures. Our results add to the previous studies on these experiments and altogether suggest that well-managed mixed plantations of Eucalyptus and a high diversity of native tree species are a viable silvicultural solution for offsetting the costs of forest landscape restoration in the tropics.

AB The market demand for hardwood is relevant for the forest sector and has consistently increased. However, the extraction of hardwood from native forests and its chain production exert detrimental effects on climate and biodiversity conservation. Selective logging contributes to the destruction and degradation of forests, which are often unaccounted to wooden products. We quantified the CO2 footprint of Amazon lumber based on "cradle-to-gate" and "cradle-to-market" frameworks using published data. Each stage of the production chain exhibited wide uncertainties, embodied by a range of results. Selective logging primarily acts in Amazon rainforest areas composed of 510-590 tCO(2)/ha in the aboveground biomass to extract 3-9 trees/ha (3-16% of forest biomass). Nearly 4-33% of forest was degraded to open trails, and to fall and remove commercial trees. Further, logging residues were left in the forests and decomposed in CO2. Notably, sawmills transformed at least 54% of the log biomass into residues, which were subsequently burned or degraded. The cradle-to-gate analysis indicated that the CO2 footprint of Amazon lumber ranged from 5.8-23.8 tCO(2)/t dry biomass, contingent upon the forest density and efficiency of production chain. Specifically, logging and sawing residues were the primary generators of CO2 emissions: 5.8-23.5 tCO(2)/t; while energy consumption accounted for less than 2%. Therefore, mitigation measures should focus on the reduction of residues and on ensuring their application in other products. Further, we recommend the integration of Amazon wood footprint data in construction material databases to support environmentally conscious decision-making by consumers and professionals.

Here, we explored this assumption to identify the effects of landscape structure on scorpion assemblages distributed in two tropical environments in Brazil, with different levels of human disturbance. Scorpions were collected from 28 sampling localities across the Atlantic Forest (n = 12) and Caatinga dry forest (n = 16), resulting in 3,781 specimens from 13 species, 5 genera, and 2 families. We found that scorpion species composition and abundance were more sensitive to changes in landscape configuration than was species richness. Additionally, scorpion assemblage responses were quite different between the two environments. From this observation we highlighted three main findings: (i) the Atlantic Forest assemblage possesses an abundance-dependent response to landscape; (ii) variation in species composition of Atlantic Forest and Caatinga were affected by landscape diversity and presence of croplands, respectively; (iii) the Atlantic Forest is inhabited by assemblages that are more sensitive to landscape changes than that is Caatinga. Implications for insect conservation We argue that a site-dependent process may explain the effects of human activities on scorpion assemblages at local and regional scale. Moreover, we provide substantial information for decision-makers to support their conservation strategies for neglected ecosystems, such as those present in Caatinga and the Atlantic Forest.

AB Climate change is predicted to cause northward migration of boreal tree species. However, the success of such a migration will be determined by trees' ability to acclimate to the environmental conditions at the potential new site. This study was aimed to assess the interactive effects of changes in photoperiod associated with northward migration and soil warming on the ecophysiological traits of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) under different carbon dioxide concentrations [CO2]. We examined the responses of foliar gas exchange and seedling cold hardiness after exposing 1-year old seedlings to two [CO2] (400 and 950 mu mol mol(-1)), two soil temperatures (growing season average at seed origin and 5 degrees C warmer) and three photoperiod regimes (seed origin, and 5 degrees and 10 degrees further north) for one growing season. We found that the CO2 elevation significantly increased photosynthetic rate measured at treatment CO2, photosynthetic water use efficiency, maximum rate of carboxylation and triose phosphate utilization. Some of the effects were modified by photoperiod. Furthermore, the CO2 elevation and soil warming both reduced seedling cold hardiness, as indicated by increases in injury index. The lack of interactions between photoperiod and other treatments (elevated [CO2] and soil temperature) suggests that young jack pine seedlings may have the ability to acclimate to the new photoperiod regimes at higher latitudes north of the seed origin.

AB It has been hypothesised that rivers serve as biogeographic barriers and Pleistocene forest refuges may explain the rich species diversity observed within Neotropical rainforests. The lack of correspondence between Amazonian and Atlantic forest species in South America is a good model for testing such hypotheses. We used molecular, ancestral area reconstruction, and potential paleodistribution analyses of Chiroxiphia pareola to test above hypotheses and examine the diversification and/or geographical expansion of populations. Six genes, two mitochondrial and four nuclear, were analysed. All population splits were estimated to have occurred in the Pliocene-Pleistocene period, and the occurrence of an Amazon population split was supported by historical river dynamics. Amazonian populations were not monophyletic, and the eastern Amazonian cluster was a sister of the Atlantic Forest population. Molecular divergence occurring between the Amazonian and Atlantic forest populations was low when compared to splits between the lineages separated by Amazonian rivers. During the early to middle Pleistocene era, regions associated with mountain slopes and riverbanks connected the Amazonian and Atlantic Forest populations near the interior of the Brazilian Northeast semiarid region, which might have facilitated species dispersal from Amazonia into the Atlantic Forest. After this point, the populations were separated, and the Atlantic Forest population remained stable until the end of the Pleistocene and Holocene eras when short-range expansion and demographic growth occurred. Our results provide evidence that highlights the role of rivers and historical climate change in the diversification of Amazonian and Atlantic Forest bird species through the Plio-Pleistocene era.

AB Understanding the role of environmental conditions and geographic space on species distributions is a major goal of ecological studies. Here, we investigate the effects of soil properties, a native bamboo (Actinocladum verticillatum (Nees) McClure ex Soderstr) ground cover and geographic distance on species richness and turnover in the Brazilian Cerrado. We established three transects along a forest-savanna gradient (14 degrees 41 ' S and 52 degrees 20 ' W), from the lowland next to a stream to the top of a hill, where we sampled the woody plant community (DBH >= 3 cm), soil properties and ground cover of A. verticillatum. We evaluated changes in species composition with a principal coordinates analysis, and the effects of the environmental predictors on species richness using generalised linear models and on species turnover using generalised dissimilarity modelling. We found that species richness increases with K concentration in the soil and decreases with Zn concentration in the soil and bamboo cover. The predictors explained 62% of species turnover, with environmental parameters (soil properties, bamboo cover and altitude) having the most significant contribution (80%), followed by the spatially structured environmental variation (20%). The most important environmental predictors of woody species turnover were soil concentration of Zn, P and K, altitude, and bamboo cover. Changes in species richness and composition in the studied gradient were strongly associated with plot height, bamboo cover and soil content of K, Zn and P. Our findings indicate that nutrient availability and competition with bamboo explain vegetation structure and composition in this region.

AB Few genetic studies that provide biological, ecological and evolutionary information have been conducted for parrotfishes, including Sparisoma viride, and none has covered the full geographic range of this species. Here, we examine the genetic patterns of the Stoplight parrotfish (S. viride) in the Greater Caribbean and its relationship with the recognized biogeographic provinces in the region. Phylogeographic, population and coalescent analyses were performed to examine the genetic structure and connectivity of S. viride populations throughout its entire range within the Greater Caribbean. Two mitochondrial (control region and coxI) and one nuclear (RHO) markers were used. The Stoplight parrotfish shows high haplotypic diversity (h) and low nucleotide diversity (pi) in the control region, and low genetic diversity in coxI and RHO. No evidence of genetic structure was found, indicating a panmictic population throughout the Greater Caribbean with highly symmetrical migration rates among previously defined Caribbean biogeographic provinces. The demographic history estimates indicate events of bottlenecks followed by a population expansion dated at 80,000 years ago (kya) during the Pleistocene epoch. These results suggest that the contrasting environmental conditions that define the Greater Caribbean provinces are not barriers to gene flow for S. viride. The phylogeographic patterns of Stoplight parrotfish could be associated with the biological characteristics of the species (such as extensive pelagic larval duration and use of multiple habitats), historical demographic events and physical conditions of the Greater Caribbean, promoting the genetic homogeneity of the species in the region.

AB Urbanization is a major cause of biodiversity loss and disconnection between people and nature. For this reason, the creation and maintenance of green areas as part of the urban landscape is a common practice in cities around the world. These green areas are generally a result of particular public policies regarding how these areas can be accessed, maintained, and how they are connected to other natural fragments in the city. In an effort to investigate aspects of the ecology of such green areas of the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil, the present study measured distinct parameters of the structure of butterfly assemblages from 19 forest fragments of distinct classes of protection, testing the influence of different policies (protection category) on butterfly assemblages. Comparatively, we also tested the predictive power of landscape variables (at distinct scales) and fragment quality (e.g. diameter at breast height, density of vegetation) using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Overall, 14,596 individuals belonging to 412 butterfly species were recorded, but values of species diversity and composition are very heterogeneous, indicating that the protection categories do not significantly interfere with the structure of the butterfly assemblages. More important than the protection category is the forest fragment quality and landscape connectivity. Our models showed that degraded fragments tend to present a specific butterfly composition, whereas the more urbanized landscape have poor butterfly species richness. These results reinforce the importance of implementing public policies that prioritize the conservation of the quality of forest fragments in every class of protection, as well as the conservation of forest fragments throughout the urban landscape.

AB Riparian zones are among the most valuable ecosystems on the earth. They act as the ecological engineers that improve river health through delivering a range of ecosystem functions. Stream bank stabilization, pollutant and sediment buffering, temperature regulation, provision of energy to river food webs and communities, groundwater recharge and provision of ecological corridors and habitat for wildlife, are among major ecosystem functions of riparian zones that play a great role in river health. Besides these ecosystem functions, riparian zones also provide various ecosystem goods and services for human well-being. But in the current scenario, riparian zones are under severe threat due to agricultural activities, urbanization, river flow alteration, overexploitation, climate change, pollution, and biological invasion. In the present and probable future scenarios of declining river health and global environmental changes, there is a pressing need of an integrated approach for managing riparian zones. This review article aims to advocate an integrated approach for riparian zone management based on various components such as riparian condition assessment, policy framework, stakeholder's participation, management practices, legislation, and awareness. Authors also discussed riparian zones in context of their concepts, features, functions, and threats.

AB During the Permian, major icehouse-greenhouse climate shifts and tectonic reconfiguration had important biogeographic implications, especially for climate-sensitive organisms such as fusulinids. Here we present multivariate methods on a global fusulinid species dataset including 1546 species from 58 localities in the Early (Asselian, Sakmarian, Artinskian and Kungurian) and Middle (Roadian, Wordian and Capitanian) Permian. Our results show that fusulinid global provincialism was high in the Asselian, Sakmarian, and Artinskian, driven by the development of multiple fusulinid bioregions in and near the Tethys Ocean. During the Asselian, Uralian sites and nearby regions of western Tethys were distinct from eastern Tethys, while stations in Arctic Russia and Norway formed a separate Boreal bioregion. Tectonic closure of the oceanic gateway in the southern Urals resulted in progressive isolation of the Uralian and Boreal bioregions during the Sakmarian and Artinskian and their ultimate disappearance by the Kungurian. Climate warming likely was the most important control on the Sakmarian formation of the distinct peri-Gondwana bioregion, because its development coincided with deglaciation following the Late Paleozoic Ice Age but preceded the separation of the Cimmerian terranes from northern margin of Gondwana. On the other hand, northward movement of the Cimmerian blocks following Artinskian-Kungurian rifting ultimately led to the merger of the peri-Gondwanan bioregion with tropical Tethyan faunas, resulting in lower provincialism in the Guadalupian and minimal faunal differentiation across Tethys. In contrast, faunal similarity between Tethys and eastern Panthalassa (the McCloud region and southwestern United States) was higher in the Asselian-Artinskian but decreased in the Kungurian and Middle Permian, perhaps as the result of sluggish ocean circulation following the warming episode of Late Paleozoic deglaciation.

AB Habitat fragmentation creates numerous small forest patches separated by human land use that may affect the compositional and structural attributes and ecosysem functions particularly the nutrient dynamics in forest ecosystems. We tested this hypothesis along a fragment size gradient in subtropical broadleaved forests in Cherrapunjee area of Meghalaya, northeast India following standard methods of vegetation sampling and nutrient dynamics. The study revealed that the structure and composition of woody species, shrubs and herbs varied significantly (p<0.05) along a fragment size gradient. Similarly, the leaf litter standing crop as well as total litter fall and annual N and P return through litter fall varied significantly (p<0.05) across fragments and were higher in the larger fragments as compared to the smaller fragments. Therefore, the results of the study collectively suggest that understanding the overall ecological implications of the effect of fragmentation on the structure and functioning of subtropical broadleaved forest ecosystem of Meghalaya, north east India, is imperative to outline pertinent conservation strategies.
