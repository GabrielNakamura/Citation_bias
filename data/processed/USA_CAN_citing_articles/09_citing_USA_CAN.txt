AB Noise may drive changes in the composition and abundance of animals that communicate vocally. Traffic produces low-frequency noise (< 3 kHz) that can mask acoustic signals broadcast within the same frequency range. We evaluated whether birds that sing within the frequency range of traffic noise are affected by acoustic masking (i.e., increased background noise levels at the same frequency of vocalizations reduce detection of vocalization) and are less abundant in areas where traffic noise is loud (44-57 dB). We estimated occupancy, the expected probability that a given site is occupied by a species, and detection probabilities of eight forest-breeding birds in areas with and without traffic noise as a function of noise and three measures of habitat quality: percent forest cover, distance from plot center to the edge of forest, and the number of standing dead trees or snags. For the two species that vocalize at the lowest peak frequency (the frequency with the most energy) and the lowest overall frequency (Yellow-billed Cuckoo [Coccyzus americanus] and White-breasted Nuthatch [Sitta carolinensis]), the presence of traffic noise explained the greatest proportion of variance in occupancy, and these species were 10 times less likely to be found in noisy than in quiet plots. For species that had only portions of their vocalizations overlapped by traffic noise, either forest cover or distance to forest edge explained more variation in occupancy than noise or no single variable explained occupancy. Our results suggest that the effects of traffic noise may be especially pronounced for species that vocalize at low frequencies.

AB P>1. Non-native invasive and nitrogen (N)-fixing plant species can cause large ecosystem-level impacts, particularly when they differ in functionally important plant traits from native and non N-fixing species. However, it remains unclear as to whether and how plant invasion status and N fixation ability consistently influence key plant leaf and litter traits, and trait-driven processes like herbivory and decomposition.
   2. We compared leaf and litter traits, leaf palatability and litter decomposability for 41 co-occurring woody species, including native N-fixers, native non N-fixers, invasive N-fixers and invasive non N-fixers, from a New Zealand floodplain. We tested the hypotheses that: (i) invasive and N-fixing species have higher foliar N and specific leaf area, and lower concentrations of defensive phenolics and structural compounds than do native and non N-fixing species, and (ii) invasive and N-fixing species generally produce more decomposable litter and palatable foliage than do native and non N-fixing species.
   3. Consistent with our hypotheses, invaders had higher foliar N and N : P ratio, and lower C : N ratio, than did native species. However, in contrast to our hypotheses, foliar phenolics were higher for the invaders while other leaf and litter traits were unaffected by invasion status. Further, N-fixers had higher N and N : P ratios, and lower C : N ratios than did non N-fixers, but other leaf and litter traits were unaffected by N fixation ability.
   4. Leaf palatability was unaffected by invasion status but was higher for N-fixers than for non N-fixers. Litter decomposability was unaffected both by invasion status and N fixation ability. We found a significant positive relationship between leaf palatability and litter decomposability across all species, because similar traits, particularly the C : P ratio and total phenolic concentrations of plant tissues, were correlated with both processes.
   5. Our results demonstrate that a small number of key traits, such as C : P ratio and total phenolic concentrations, drive both herbivory and decomposition irrespective of plant invasion status or N fixation ability. As such, they highlight that interspecific differences in particular plant traits, rather than plant functional group memberships based on invasion status and N fixation ability, are more effective in predicting palatability and decomposability.

AB P>1. Studying the spatial pattern of plants may provide significant insights into processes and mechanisms that maintain species richness. We used data from a fully mapped 25-ha temperate forest plot at Changbaishan (CBS), north-eastern China, to conduct a community-wide assessment of the type and frequency of intra- and interspecific spatial association patterns. We analysed complex scale effects in the patterning of large trees of 15 common species. First, we tested for overall spatial patterning at 6, 30 and 50 m neighbourhoods and classified the types of bivariate association patterns at these spatial scales (analysis 1). We then explored small-scale (0-20 m) association patterns conditioning on the larger-scale pattern (analysis 2) and tested for positive large-scale (50-250 m) association patterns (analysis 3).
   2. Analysis 1 provided ample evidence for non-random spatial patterning, and the type and frequency of spatial association patterns changed with scale. Trees of most species pairs co-occurred less than expected by chance and positive associations were rare in local neighbourhoods. Analysis 2 revealed a separation of scales in which significant small-scale interactions faded away at distances of 10-15 m. One third of all species pairs showed significant and mostly negative bivariate small-scale association, which occurred more often than expected by chance between species sharing attributes such as family, fruit type and habitat association. This suggests the occurrence of competitive interactions. Analysis 3 showed that only 8% of all species pairs co-occurred at large scales.
   3. Comparison of our results with an analogous study conducted in the species-rich tropical forest at Sinharaja, Sri Lanka, revealed several structural similarities including the dominance of segregation and partial overlap in the overall patterning (analysis 1) and the separation of scales (analysis 2). However, species pairs at CBS showed considerably more significant negative small-scale associations (31% vs. 6% at Sinharaja).
   4. Synthesis. The techniques presented here allow for a detailed analysis of the complex spatial associations in species-rich forests and have the potential to reveal indicative patterns that may allow researchers to discriminate among competing hypotheses of community assemblage and dynamics. However, this will require comparative studies involving a large number of plots.

AB Ecosystem services (ES), such as biological control, pollination, soil formation, nutrient cycling in agriculture are vital for the sustainable supply of food and fibre. The current trends of decline in the ability of agricultural ecosystems to provide ES pose great threat to food security worldwide. This paper discusses the concept of ES and identifies ES associated with agriculture. It discusses the economic and ecological benefits of these ES on farmland in general and its linkages with organic agriculture. The provision of ES on farmland may help to motivate the redesign of small-scale farms using new eco-technologies based on novel and sound ecological knowledge. This has potential to meet the food demand of growing population without damaging human health and the environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. The provision of environmental flows and the removal of barriers to water flow are high priorities for restoration where changes to flow regimes have caused degradation of riverine ecosystems. Nevertheless, flow regulation is often accompanied by changes in catchment and riparian land-use, which also can have major impacts on river health via local habitat degradation or modification of stream energy regimes.
   2. The challenges are determining the relative importance of flow, land-use and other impacts as well as deciding where to focus restoration effort. As a consequence, flow, catchment and riparian restoration efforts are often addressed in isolation. River managers need decision support tools to assess which flow and catchment interventions are most likely to succeed and, importantly, which are cost-effective.
   3. Bayesian networks (BNs) can be used as a decision support tool for considering the influence of multiple stressors on aquatic ecosystems and the relative benefits of various restoration options. We provide simple illustrative examples of how BNs can address specific river restoration goals and assist with the prioritisation of flow and catchment restoration options. This includes the use of cost and utility functions to assist decision makers in their choice of potential management interventions.
   4. A BN approach facilitates the development of conceptual models of likely cause and effect relationships between flow regime, land-use and river conditions and provides an interactive tool to explore the relative benefits of various restoration options. When combined with information on the costs and expected benefits of intervention, one can derive recommendations about the best restoration option to adopt given the network structure and the associated cost and utility functions.

AB Aim
   Eurycorymbus cavaleriei (Levl.) Rehd. et Hand.-Mazz. (Sapindaceae) is a Tertiary relict tree endemic to subtropical China. This area is a centre for speciation and evolution within the East Asia biome and one of its most important refugial locations. In this study we aim to elucidate the phylogeographical patterning in E. cavaleriei, in order to identify the locations of the species' main refugia and the predominant patterns of migration that have led to the contemporary spatial genetic structure of chloroplast variation.
   Location
   Subtropical China.
   Methods
   We sampled 18 populations of E. cavaleriei throughout its geographical range. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence data from two non-coding regions ((trnS/trnG and pl20/5'-rps12) were obtained from 170 individuals for phylogeographical analyses. Relationships among cpDNA haplotypes were determined using median-joining networks. Genetic structure was examined by spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA). Population differentiation was estimated by G(ST) and N-ST statistics.
   Results
   Ten distinct haplotypes were identified. The level of differentiation among populations was relatively high (G(ST) = 0.817), and N-ST was significantly higher than G(ST) (P < 0.05), indicating that strong phylogeographical structure is exhibited by this species. The SAMOVA revealed five diverging groups of related haplotypes, which coincide with major landscape features in this region.
   Main conclusions
   The high differentiation among populations of E. cavaleriei may be a combined effect of historical and contemporary processes, such as the low effective population size for the chloroplast genome of a dioecious species, long-term range fragmentation and limited seed dispersal for the species. Clear-cut geographical distributions of ancestral haplotypes of the species suggest multiple potential refugia across subtropical China. The identified refugial regions have long been recognized as centres of plant diversity and endemism for China and have also been suggested as glacial refugia for many other plant species. The combination of these factors means that these locations should be considered as the highest priority for inclusion in conservation policies and sustainable forest management strategies for subtropical China.

TI Nocturnal evapotranspiration in eddy-covariance records from three

AB Nocturnal evapotranspiration (ETN) is often assumed to be negligible in terrestrial ecosystems, reflecting the common assumption that plant stomata close at night to prevent water loss from transpiration. However, recent evidence across a wide range of species and climate conditions suggests that significant transpiration occurs at night, frustrating efforts to estimate total annual evapotranspiration (ET) from conventional methods such as the eddy-covariance technique. Here, the magnitude and variability of ETN is explored in multiple years of eddy-covariance measurements from three adjacent ecosystems in the Southeastern U.S.: an old grass field, a planted pine forest, and a late-successional hardwood forest. After removing unreliable data points collected during periods of insufficient turbulence, observed ETN averaged 8-9% of mean daytime evapotranspiration (ETD). ETN was driven primarily by wind speed and vapor pressure deficit and, in the two forested ecosystems, a qualitative analysis suggests a significant contribution from nocturnal transpiration. To gapfill missing data, we investigated several methodologies, including process-based multiple non-linear regression, relationships between daytime and nighttime ET fluxes, marginal distribution sampling, and multiple imputation. The utility of the gapfilling procedures was assessed by comparing simulated fluxes to reliably measured fluxes using randomly generated gaps in the data records, and by examining annual sums of ET from the different gapfilling techniques. The choice of gapfilling methodology had a significant impact on estimates of annual ecosystem water use and, in the most extreme cases, altered the annual estimate of ET by over 100 min year(-1), or ca. 15%. While no single gapfiling methodology appeared superior for treating data from all three sites, marginal distribution sampling generally performed well, producing flux estimates with a site average bias error of <10%, and a mean absolute error close to the random measurement error of the dataset (12.2 and 9.8 W m(-2), respectively).

AB Non-native invasive plants can greatly alter community and ecosystem properties, but efforts to predict which invasive species have the greatest impacts on these properties have been generally unsuccessful. An hypothesis that has considerable promise for predicting the effects of invasive non-native plant species is the mass ratio hypothesis (i.e. that dominant species exert the strongest effects). We tested this hypothesis using data from a four year removal experiment in which the presence of two dominant shrub species (one native and the other not), and subordinate plant species, were manipulated in factorial combinations over four years in a primary successional floodplain system. We measured the effects of these manipulations on the plant community, soil nutrient status and soil biota in different trophic levels of the soil food web. Our experiment showed that after four years, low-biomass non-native plant species exerted disproportionate belowground effects relative to their contribution to total biomass in the plant community, most notably by increasing soil C, soil microbial biomass, altering soil microbial community structure and increasing the abundance of microbial-feeding and predatory nematodes. Low-biomass, non-native plant species had distinct life history strategies and foliar traits (higher foliar N concentrations and higher leaf area per unit mass) compared with the two dominant shrub species (97% of total plant mass). Our results have several implications for understanding species' effects in communities and on soil properties. First, high-biomass species do not necessarily exert the largest impacts on community or soil properties. Second, low-biomass, inconspicuous non-native species can influence community composition and have important trophic consequences belowground through effects on soil nutrient status or resource availability to soil biota. Our finding that low-biomass non-native species influence belowground community structure and soil properties more profoundly than dominant species demonstrates that the mass ratio hypothesis does not accurately predict the relative effects of different coexisting species on community- and ecosystem-level properties.

AB In order to reproduce successfully in a temporally varying environment, iteroparous animals must exhibit considerable behavioural flexibility across their lifetimes. By adjusting timing of breeding each year, parents can ensure optimal overlap between the energy intensive period of offspring production and the seasonal peak in favourable environmental conditions, thereby increasing their chances of successfully rearing young.
   Few studies investigate variation among individuals in how they respond to fluctuating conditions, or how selection acts on these individual differences, but this information is essential for understanding how populations will cope with rapid environmental change.
   We explored inter-annual trends in breeding time and individual responses to environmental variability in common guillemots Uria aalge, an important marine top predator in the highly variable California Current System. Complex, nonlinear relationships between phenology and oceanic and climate variables were found at the population level. Using a novel application of a statistical technique called random regression, we showed that individual females responded in a nonlinear fashion to environmental variability, and that reaction norm shape differed among females.
   The pattern and strength of selection varied substantially over a 34-year period, but in general, earlier laying was favoured. Females deviating significantly from the population mean laying date each year also suffered reduced breeding success, with the strength of nonlinear selection varying in relation to environmental conditions.
   We discuss our results in the wider context of an emerging literature on the evolutionary ecology of individual-level plasticity in the wild. Better understanding of how species-specific factors and local habitat features affect the timing and success of breeding will improve our ability to predict how populations will respond to climate change.

AB The physical, economic, and sociocultural displacement of local peoples from protected areas generates intense discussion among scholars and policy makers. To foster greater precision and clarity in these discussions, we used a conceptual framework from the political economy literature to examine different forms of human displacement from protected areas. Using marine protected areas (MPAs) to ground our analysis, we characterized the 5 types of property rights that are reallocated (lost, secured, and gained) through the establishment of protected areas. All forms of MPA "displacement" involve reallocation of property rights, but the specific types and bundles of rights lost, secured, and gained dramatically shape the magnitude, extent, and equity of MPA impacts-positive and negative-on governance, economic well-being, health, education, social capital, and culture. The impacts of reallocating rights to MPA resources vary within and among social groups, inducing changes in society, in patterns of resource use, and in the environment. To create more environmentally sustainable and socially just conservation practice, a critical next step in conservation social science research is to document and explain variation in the social impacts of protected areas.

AB Life-history decisions are strongly affected by environmental conditions. In birds, incubation is energetically expensive and affected significantly by ambient temperature. We reduced energetic constraints for female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) by experimentally heating nests during incubation by an average of 6.9 degrees C to test for changes in incubation behaviour.
   Females in heated boxes (hereafter 'heated females') increased time spent incubating and maintained higher on-bout and off-bout egg temperatures. This indicates that female energetic constraints, not maximizing developmental conditions of offspring, determine incubation investment. Furthermore, this result suggests that embryonic developmental conditions in unmanipulated nests are suboptimal.
   We found individual variation in how females responded to experimental heating. Early-laying (i.e. higher phenotypic quality) females with heated nests increased egg temperatures and maintained incubation constancy, while later-laying (lower quality) heated females increased incubation constancy. Changes in egg temperature were due to changes in female behaviour and not due directly to increases in internal nest-box temperatures.
   Behaviour during the incubation period affected hatching asynchrony. Decreased variation in egg temperature led to lower levels of hatching asynchrony, which was also generally lower in heated nests.
   Our study finds strong support for the prediction that intermittent incubators set their incubation investment at levels dictated by energetic constraints. Furthermore, females incubating in heated boxes allocated conserved energy primarily to increased egg temperature and increased incubation attentiveness. These results indicate that studies investigating the role of energetics in driving reproductive investment in intermittent incubators should consider egg temperature and individual variation more explicitly.

AB Genomic scans for selection are a useful tool for identifying genes underlying phenotypic transitions. In this article, we describe the results of a genome scan designed to identify candidates for genes targeted by selection during the evolution of cultivated sunflower. This work involved screening 492 loci derived from ESTs on a large panel of wild, primitive (i.e., landrace), and improved sunflower (Helianthus annuus) lines. This sampling strategy allowed us to identify candidates for selectively important genes and investigate the likely timing of selection. Thirty-six genes showed evidence of selection during either domestication or improvement based on multiple criteria, and a sequence-based test of selection on a subset of these loci confirmed this result. In view of what is known about the structure of linkage disequilibrium across the sunflower genome, these genes are themselves likely to have been targeted by selection, rather than being merely linked to the actual targets. While the selection candidates showed a broad range of putative functions, they were enriched for genes involved in amino acid synthesis and protein catabolism. Given that a similar pattern has been detected in maize (Zea mays), this finding suggests that selection on amino acid composition may be a general feature of the evolution of crop plants. In terms of genomic locations, the selection candidates were significantly clustered near quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to phenotypic differences between wild and cultivated sunflower, and specific instances of QTL colocalization provide some clues as to the roles that these genes may have played during sunflower evolution.

AB Few urban studies of avian diversity discriminate between native and exotic species, although highly modified urban environments typically support significant numbers of non-native species. High overall diversity may mask poor native diversity. We identify which native species are successful in a variety of urban habitats in a New Zealand city, and examine the roles that garden size and complexity, native fragments, and vegetation composition and cover play in explaining variations in native and exotic avian diversity. Nearly half(44%) of 39 species recorded were exotic: four(three exotic and one native) comprised 45% of birds counted. While there was little variation between habitats in combined native and exotic species richness, the number and abundance of bush-dependent natives differed. Similarity measures identified three groups: (1) commercial, industrial and residential areas with small structurally simple gardens where 3-4 exotic species were numerically dominant and few bush natives made up <10% of the total count; (2) Suburbs with medium/large gardens dominated by lawns. shrubs and trees, with many exotic species but also several bush natives (comprising 24-32% of the total count); and (3) bush fragments where both diversity and species richness of bush natives were highest (comprising 50-75% of the total count), including four insectivores absent from all residential areas. Vegetation structure, composition and cover, and proximity to fragments did not explain much of the variation in total or native species richness and diversity, but did explain 69% and 72% of bush-native species richness and abundance respectively.

AB There is an increasing need and interest in including indicators of landscape fragmentation in monitoring systems of sustainable landscape management. Landscape fragmentation due to transportation infrastructure and urban development threatens human and environmental well-being by noise and pollution from traffic, reducing the size and viability of wildlife Populations, facilitating the spread of invasive species, and impairing the scenic and recreational qualities of the landscape. This paper provides the rationale, method, and data for including landscape fragmentation in monitoring systems, using as an example the Swiss Monitoring System of Sustainable Development (MONET). We defined and compared four levels of fragmentation analysis, Or fragmentation geometries (FGs), each based on different fragmenting elements, e.g., only anthropogenic, or combinations of anthropogenic and natural elements. As each FG has specific strengths and weaknesses, the most appropriate choice of FG depends on the context and objectives of a study. We present data on the current degree of landscape fragmentation for the five ecoregions and 26 cantons in Switzerland for all four FGs. Our results show that the degree of landscape fragmentation as quantified by the effective mesh size method is strongly supported by the postulates and indicator selection criteria Of MONET, and we identify the most suitable FG focusing on the land area below 2100 m (e.g., excluding lakes) and allowing for an equitable comparison of fragmentation degrees among regions that differ in area covered by lakes and high mountains. For a more detailed analysis of landscape fragmentation in the context of environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments, a combination of all four FGs may provide a more informative tool than any single FG.

AB The two main assembly processes claimed to structure plant communities are habitat filtering and competitive interactions. The set of species growing in fire-prone communities has been filtered. in such a way that species without fire-persistence traits have not successfully entered the community. Because plant traits are evolutionarily conserved and. re traits are correlated with other plant traits, communities under high. re frequency should not include all possible trait combinations, and thus the morphospace occupation by species in these communities should be lower than expected by chance (underoccupied). In contrast, communities under low. re frequency would lack the filtering factor, and thus their underoccupation of the morphospace is not expected. We test this prediction by comparing the morphospace occupation by species in communities located in the western Mediterranean Basin, five of them subject to high. re frequency (HiFi) and four to low. re frequency (LowFi). We first compile a set of morphological and functional traits for the species growing on the nine sites, then we compute the morphospace occupation of each site as a convex hull volume, and finally, to assert that our results are not a product of a random branching pattern of evolution, we simulate our traits under a null model of neutral evolution and compare the morphospace occupation of the simulated traits with the results from the empirical data. The results suggest that, as predicted, there is a clear differential morphospace occupation between communities under different. re regimes in such a way that the morphospace is underoccupied in HiFi communities only. The simulation of a neutral evolutionary model does not replicate the observed pattern of differential morphospace occupation, and thus it should be attributed to assembly processes. In conclusion, our results suggest that. re is a strong community assembling process, filtering the species that have fire-persistent traits and thus assembling phenotypically and phylogenetically clustered communities with vacant zones in the morphospace.

AB Despite long-standing awareness of the potentially important ecological role of fruit bats, we know little about the ecology of the vast majority of species. Here we report the results of a pilot satellite tracking study aimed at establishing the scale of movement of the straw-coloured fruit bat Eidolon helvum. This was the first ever attempt to track African fruit bats using satellite telemetry. We tagged four bats with solar-charged 12 g satellite transmitters at Kasanka National Park in December 2005 and obtained a combined total of 104 different location fixes over a 149-day period. Before migrating, bats foraged as far as 59 km from the roost in a single evening; by contrast, one migrating individual moved 370 km in one night. Bats travelled an average 29 km day(-1) over the period of study, with bats that appeared to be migrating moving north-west from Kasanka at an average 90 km day(-1). The greatest cumulative distance travelled by a single bat was 2518 km in 149 days. The results show conclusively that the straw-coloured fruit bat E. helvum is capable of migrating thousands of kilometres across central Africa on an annual basis, implying that the fruit pulse in northern Zambia is richer than anything on offer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the same time of the year.

SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Pollination; agriculture; ecosystem services; bees; spatial modeling;
   landscape design
AB Developing landscape design principles for the provision of ecosystem services is crucial to efficient and widespread implementation of environmental service-based projects. We investigate optimal farm design for agricultural pollination services from bees nesting in native habitat, integrating ecological and economic approaches in a spatial modeling framework. We evaluate the simplest case, and then add consideration of bee metapopulation dynamics and heterogeneity in farmland productivity. We find that the need for spatially even pollination coverage across farms means that bee habitat is often denser at the edges, rather than the centers, of optimally designed farms, and also highly constrains the ability of farmers to site bee habitat in less-productive areas of farms with spatial gradients in agricultural fertility. Optimal farm configuration is not purely a matter of uniform size and spacing of bee habitat: in some circumstances, farms combine large parcels-to ensure bee population persistence-with smaller, dispersed patches to provide spatially continuous pollination services. The highest-yield farm designs are those with a relatively small (but non-zero) area of pollination reservoirs, suggesting a conservation strategy of small parcels of service-providing habitat interspersed throughout working landscapes. The design principles outlined here are likely general and applicable to other ecosystem services supplied at local scales, such as agricultural pest control.

AB Context dependency is deemed to position the outcomes of species interactions along a continuum of mutualism to parasitism. Thus, it is imperative to understand which factors determine where a particular interspecific interaction falls along the continuum. Over the past 20 years research on the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis has resulted in sufficient independent studies to now generalize about the factors and mechanisms that affect host response to ectomycorrhizas. Using meta-analysis we quantitatively evaluated the role of biotic (partner identity and colonization levels of ectomycorrhizal fungi) and abiotic (phosphorus levels) factors in determining host biomass, height, and shoot : root responses to ectomycorrhizal associations. On average, seedlings across multiple host genera increased in total biomass when inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi regardless of the identity of the fungal associate; host genera differed in the magnitude of response for both total biomass and shoot : root ratio. Association with different fungal genera modified only host allocation of biomass to shoots and roots. Neither level of colonization on inoculated seedlings nor the level of contamination on control seedlings relative to colonization levels by target fungi on inoculated seedlings was important in explaining variation in effect sizes for any growth response. None of our proposed factors (identity of partners, colonization level, magnitude of contamination, or duration of association) explained variation in effect sizes for shoot height, although in general seedlings were taller when inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi. Phosphorus additions did not influence effect sizes. Although the general trend across studies was for a positive response of hosts to ectomycorrhizal inoculation, publication bias and methodological issues effectively reduce and distort the spectrum on which we evaluate host responses to ectomycorrhizal inoculation. Our results indicate that the variation in ectomycorrhizal fungi perceived by the host may be of a discrete (presence/absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi) rather than continuous nature (variation in identity or abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi).

AB Multiple forces structure natural microbial communities, but the relative roles and interactions of these drivers are poorly understood. Gradients of physical and chemical parameters can be especially influential. In traditional ecological theory, variability in environmental conditions across space and time represents habitat heterogeneity, which may shape communities. Here we used aquatic microbial communities as a model to investigate the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and community composition and dynamics. We defined spatial habitat heterogeneity as vertical temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) gradients in the water column, and temporal habitat heterogeneity as variation throughout the open-water season in these environmental parameters. Seasonal lake mixing events contribute to temporal habitat heterogeneity by destroying and re-creating these gradients. Because of this, we selected three lakes along a range of annual mixing frequency (polymictic, dimictic, meromictic) for our study. We found that bacterial community composition (BCC) was distinct between the epilimnion and hypolimnion within stratified lakes, and also more variable within the epilimnia through time. We found stark differences in patterns of epilimnion and hypolimnion dynamics over time and across lakes, suggesting that specific drivers have distinct relative importance for each community.

ID RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; TRANSITIONS; RESILIENCE
AB Numerous arguments have been put forward regarding the need for a major change in water resources management. In particular increasing awareness of the impacts of climate change has lead to the insight that water management must be become more flexible in order to deal with uncertainties and surprise. This paper argues for a paradigm shift through the development and implementation of integrated and adaptive water management approaches. Adaptive management is defined here as a systematic process for improving management policies and practices by learning from the outcomes of implemented management strategies.
   Development and implementation of adaptive management approaches requires structural changes in water management regimes. Such changes are slow due the inertia inherent in prevailing regimes. Concepts for understanding water regime properties and transition processes are summarized. Emphasis is given to the role of actor platforms and processes of social learning in multi-level governance regimes. The paper concludes a strong recommendation to implement learning cycles as an integral part of water management.

AB Several recent studies have suggested that a substantial portion of today's plant diversity in the Neotropics has resulted from the dispersal of taxa into that region rather than vicariance, but more data are needed to substantiate this claim. Guatteria (Annonaceae) is, with 265 species, the third largest genus of Neotropical trees after Inga (Fabaceae) and Ocotea (Lauraceae), and its widespread distribution and frequent occurrence makes the genus an excellent model taxon to study diversification patterns. This study reconstructed the phylogeny of Guatteria and inferred three major biogeographical events in the history of the genus: (1) a trans-oceanic Miocene migration from Central into South America before the closing of the Isthmus of Panama; (2) a major diversification of the lineage within South America; and (3) several migrations of South American lineages back into Central America via the closed Panamanian land bridge. Therefore, Guatteria is not an Amazonian centred-genus sensu Gentry but a major Miocene diversification that followed its dispersal into South America. This study provides further evidence that migration into the Neotropics was an important factor in the historical assembly of its biodiversity. Furthermore, it is shown that phylogenetic patterns are comparable to those found in Ocotea and Inga and that a closer comparison of these genera is desirable. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Because endocrine mechanisms are thought to mediate behavioral responses to changes in the environment, examining these mechanisms is essential for understanding how long-lived seabirds adjust their foraging decisions to contrasting environmental conditions in order to maximize their fitness. In this context, the hormone corticosterone (CORT) deserves specific attention because of its major connections with locomotor activities. We examined for the first time the relationships between individual CORT levels and measurements of foraging success and behavior using satellite tracking and blood sampling from wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) before (pretrip CORT levels) and after (posttrip CORT levels) foraging trips during the incubation period. Plasma CORT levels decreased after a foraging trip, and the level of posttrip CORT was negatively correlated with individual foraging success, calculated as total mass gain over a foraging trip. Pretrip CORT levels were not linked to time spent at sea but were positively correlated with daily distance traveled and maximum range at sea. In this study, we were able to highlight the sensitivity of CORT levels to variation in energy intake, and we showed for the first time that individual CORT levels can be explained by variation in foraging success. Relationships between pretrip CORT levels and daily distance traveled and maximum range were independent of pretrip body mass, suggesting that slight elevations in pretrip CORT levels might facilitate locomotor activity. However, because both foraging behavior and pretrip CORT levels could be affected by individual quality, future experimental studies including manipulation of CORT levels are needed to test whether CORT can mediate foraging decisions according to foraging conditions.

AB The Ponto-Caspian round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) was introduced to the Gulf of Gdansk, southern Baltic Sea, in the late 1980s, and it has now become the dominant demersal fish species in shallow water. This study aimed to assess diet preferences and the degree of diet overlap between the round goby and the native flounder (Platichthys flesus). Results from time-series of stomach contents and stable isotope analyses of wild-caught fish, together with prey preference experiments carried out in the laboratory, showed that the two species consumed similar species and sizes of prey. The similarities in diet suggest potential for food competition. Catch data showed both reverse depth distributions of round goby and flounder when round gobies were abundant and that the abundances of the two species were negatively correlated. The diet overlap between small flounders and round gobies was greatest when goby abundance was least, suggesting that abundance of round gobies may restrict flounder habitat utilization and, therefore, also food availability to the latter. Therefore, round gobies may have a negative influence on the commercially important flounder.

AB Increasing connectivity is frequently proposed as an effective strategy to address biodiversity decline within fragmented habitats. Woodland habitats in Great Britain have been significantly reduced in area and are described as having 'fragmented' distribution. Many researchers have associated declines in woodland species with fragmentation. Currently, there is a concerted effort to increase connectivity (through increasing the number of physical links) between woodlands, often through the development of habitat networks, with the aim of increasing biodiversity. This aim is driven through rising interest in the role of landscape scale processes in biodiversity conservation and increasing concern of the fate of populations facing a predicted increase in habitat isolation through climate change.
   In this paper, the evidence behind the assumption that increasing connectivity will increase biodiversity is reviewed, together with the assumptions made during development of models that identify potential networks within which connectivity is to be increased. Gaps identified within the evidence base lead to the suggestion of new research areas that will provide a firm basis from which more informed evaluation of increasing connectivity for biodiversity gain can be developed. Alternative approaches to enhancing woodland biodiversity in fragmented landscapes are proposed. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Analyses of spatial patterns of distribution of populations and assemblages along envirorimental gradients are common in marine ecology. How these patterns vary at different spatial scales has seldom been examined, despite the fact that patterns in nature are intrinsically scale-dependent. This study quantified variability in subtidal assemblages at a hierarchy of spatial scales along a depth gradient, using several univariate and multivariate techniques. Despite variation in the sizes of depth effects in time and space, there were large, significant and generally characterisable differences in the structure of assemblages at different depths. The sizes of multivariate and univariate components of variation at different spatial scales were compared at each of 3 different depths (5, 15 and 25 m), using a bias-corrected bootstrapping approach. The sizes of variance components at different spatial scales varied with depth and choice of transformation. In all cases, the largest component of variation was at the smallest scale (tens of centimeters). A pattern of decreasing residual variance with depth was seen for untransformed data, while a pattern of increasing residual variance with depth was seen for presence/absence data. In contrast, variation among locations (separated by > 1 km) and among sites (separated by hundreds of metres) was largest at intermediate depths (similar to 15 m), regardless of the transformation used. The multivariate procedures used here offer several advantages over previously used techniques, providing suitable quantitative methods for analysing, at multiple scales, the patchy and complex nature of rocky subtidal assemblages.

AB To determine annual litter production of regenerating forest areas in the Tigray highlands of northern Ethiopia monthly litter production was monitored over a two-year period in areas with varying degree of vegetation cover restoration. Total annual litter production varied from 30 to 425 g m(-2) and increased significantly where areas were closed for a longer time. Litter production was depending on vegetation cover through an exponential relation and was influenced also by soil fertility. Leaf litter typically constituted between 70 and 85% of total litter production, while contributions of woody and reproductive litter varied according to species composition. Strong seasonality in litterfall was explained by pronounced seasonal variation in rainfall. Standing crop of litter built up once an area was closed for grazing, increasing from around 20 g m(-2) in degraded grazing lands to nearly 600 g m(-2) in an old exclosure. Litter accumulation was mainly determined by litter input, but was also influenced by litter quality, species composition and microclimate development in the restoring forest areas. A detailed study of nine dominant shrub and tree species revealed three distinct litter production patterns, corresponding to drought-deciduous species, evergreen species and (semi-)evergreen Acacia species respectively.

AB 1 Resprouting has been much studied in mature plants and seedlings, but with little attention to how resprouting ability may change with ontogeny in cross-species datasets. Because damage exposure and avoidance through large size may differ between growth forms, size-stage, growth form and disturbance type may interact.
   2 A Bayesian mixed-effects model was used to analyse a wide-ranging literature dataset of resprouting responses following clipping or burning. There were distinct ontogenetic patterns of resprouting ability between growth forms. In ground-dwelling plants, seedling resprouting ability was high and was maintained as plants grew. In trees, survivorship increased with size-stage. However, for disturbances resulting in stem-kill, resprouting ability of trees declined with increasing size.
   3 The finding of distinct ontogenetic patterns of sprouting ability between growth forms demonstrates how species trade-off damage avoidance with resprouting ability to achieve persistence, and provides an example of the life-history trade-off of avoidance and tolerance of damage.
   4 Large random effects associated with between-species variation indicated that although such ontogenetic patterns can be detected, each growth form contains species employing diverse strategies. Bayesian modelling enables flexible and powerful analyses of literature datasets, to reveal diverse strategies often obscured by classical analyses exploring only main effects.

AB We examined the relative influences of pre-fight housing condition, contest intensity, and contest outcome in modulating post-fight stress hormone concentrations in territorial male convict cichlids (Archocentrus nigrofasciatus). Individuals were housed either in isolation or in semi-natural communal tanks. Pairs of male cichlids that differed considerably in body mass were selected from the same housing regime. Pre-fight water-borne cortisol levels were obtained before allowing the dyad to interact until contest resolution, after which time post-fight cortisol levels were obtained from the winner and loser. There were no outcome-related differences in post-fight cortisol concentrations following escalated or non-escalated contests, a result that held true for both housing regimes. Pre-fight cortisol levels were significantly higher than post-fight cortisol levels, suggesting that initial confinement in a beaker for the water-borne hormone samples was a stressor, but that the animals acclimated quickly to confinement. Fights involving previously isolated participants were significantly more intense than those involving group-housed animals, which we explain as being a function of established relationships between social isolation, heightened acute cortisol responsiveness, and the expression of excessive aggressive behavior. Only group-housed losers demonstrated the ability to modulate aggression or hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) activity in a graded fashion to acute increases in cortisol or changes in contest intensity, respectively. We discuss a variety of factors that could disrupt the ability of isolates to appropriately modulate interactions between social behavior and the HPI axis, and we examine a number of functional hypotheses underlying the sensitivity of group-housed losers to changes in contest dynamics.

AB Although strategies to conserve biodiversity (e.g., the establishment of reserves and the management offlagship, umbrella, indicator, and keystone species) are valuable, they entail practical and conceptual difficulties. A focus on niche construction and ecosystem engineering, however, could provide new insights and methods for conservation biology. Many organisms modulate the availability of resources to other species by causing state changes in biotic or abiotic materials (ecosystem engineering), in the process frequently changing the selection to which the ecosystem engineers and other organisms are exposed (niche construction). We describe growing evidence that organisms have significant nontrophic impacts on ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity, and outline established means of identifying key species involved in niche construction. On the basis of this engineering perspective, wepropose a number of measures that could be employed to enhance conservation efforts.

AB The concept of nutrient use efficiency is central to understanding ecosystem functioning because it is the step in which plants can influence the return of nutrients to the soil pool and the quality of the litter. Theory suggests that nutrient efficiency increases unimodally with declining soil resources, but this has not been tested empirically for N and water in grassland ecosystems, where plant growth in these ecosystems is generally thought to be limited by soil N and moisture. In this paper, we tested the N uptake and the N use efficiency (NUE) of two Stipa species (S. grandis and S. krylovii) from 20 sites in the Inner Mongolia grassland by measuring the N content of net primary productivity (NPP). NUE is defined as the total net primary production per unit N absorbed. We further distinguished NUE from N response efficiency (NRE; production per unit N available). We found that NPP increased with soil N and water availability. Efficiency of whole-plant N use, uptake, and response increased monotonically with decreasing soil N and water, being higher on infertile (dry) habitats than on fertile (wet) habitats. We further considered NUE as the product of the N productivity (NP the rate of biomass increase per unit N in the plant) and the mean residence time (MRT; the ratio between the average N pool and the annual N uptake or loss). The NP and NUE of S. grandis growing usually in dry and N-poor habitats exceeded those of S. krylovii abundant in wet and N-rich habitats. NUE differed among sites, and was often affected by the evolutionary trade-off between NP and MRT, where plants and communities had adapted in a way to maximize either NP or MRT, but not both concurrently. Soil N availability and moisture influenced the community-level N uptake efficiency and ultimately the NRE, though the response to N was dependent on the plant community examined. These results show that soil N and water had exerted a great impact on the N efficiency in Stipa species. The intraspecific differences in N efficiency within both Stipa species along soil resource availability gradient may explain the differences in plant productivity on various soils, which will be conducive to our general understanding of the N cycling and vegetation dynamics in northern Chinese grasslands.

AB Understanding the effect of cropping patterns on population dynamics, dispersal, and habitat selection of insect pests has been an unresolved challenge. Here, we studied the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus (Knight) (Heteroptera: Miridae), in cotton during early summer in central Arizona. We used a general approach based on global positioning system (GPS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies combined with spatial statistics to assess the maximum distance at which forage and seed alfalfa, fallow fields with weeds, and cotton affect L. hesperus population density. Using a set of 50 cotton fields as focal fields, we found that forage and seed alfalfa as well as weeds acted as L. hesperus sources for these cotton fields. The source effect did not extend beyond 375, 500, and 1500 m for forage alfalfa, weeds, and seed alfalfa, respectively. Conversely, cotton fields acted as L. hesperus sinks, but this effect did not extend further than 750 m from the focal cotton fields. These findings suggest that specific spatial arrangements of these field types could reduce L. hesperus damage to cotton. The spatially explicit approach used here provides a direct evaluation of the effects of agroecosystem heterogeneity on pest population dynamics, dispersal, and habitat selection, which is a significant asset for the development and improvement of areawide pest management.

AB Determining the mechanisms by which invasive species exclude natives is critical for conserving and restoring native populations in impacted habitats. In recent decades the grass Phragmites australis has been aggressively invading coastal marshes of North America, with monocultures often replacing diverse assemblages of plants.
   Our objective was to quantify how P. australis modifies the abiotic (soil and light conditions) and biotic (litter and shoots) environment and to determine the mechanisms by which it excludes two common forbs, the annual chenopod Atriplex patula var. hastata and the perennial aster Solidago sempervirens, from the highest tidal elevations of a brackish marsh in southern New England, USA.
   In a 3-year field experiment we added seeds of both forb species to stands of P. australis, where we manipulated shoots and litter in an orthogonal design, and to uninvaded marsh areas dominated by the rush Juncus gerardi, where we manipulated the shoots of the marsh vegetation. In general, seedling establishment and the number of plants surviving until the end of the growing season were substantially greater in areas not invaded by P. australis, and both shoots and litter limited the abundance of forbs within stands.
   Forbs surviving within stands of P. australis grew larger and produced more seeds than those in uninvaded areas, indicating that changes to the soil resulting from invasion do not preclude the survival of established forbs. This was confirmed by a glasshouse study where the performance of forbs in soil collected from within stands of P. australis was better than in soil from areas dominated by J. gerardi.
   Similar to many invasive grasses in terrestrial communities, P. australis excludes native forbs through competition, modifying the biotic environment of the marsh at both the ground (litter) and above-ground (shoots) levels. Our results suggest that successful invaders, such as P. australis, are likely to be the ones that can engineer habitats in multiple ways and limit populations of native species across several critical stages of their life history.

AB Aim To test whether congeneric species are significantly associated with one another in space, either positively or negatively. Also, to provide a framework for a causal investigation of co-occurrence patterns by a parallel comparison of interactions in geographical and ecological data matrices.
   Location For the analysis of congeneric species' co-occurrences we used 30 matrices covering a wide range of taxa and geographical areas, while for the causal investigation we used the distribution of 50 terrestrial isopod species on 20 islands and 264 sampling stations in the central Aegean archipelago, as well as a number of ecological variables for each sampling station.
   Methods We developed a software program (COOC) that incorporates the species-by-species approach to co-occurrence analysis using EcoSim's output of prior null model analysis of co-occurrence. We describe this program in detail, and use it to investigate one of the most common assembly rules, namely, the decreased levels of co-occurrence among congeneric species pairs. For the causal analysis, we proceed likewise, cross-checking the results from the geographical and the ecological matrices. There is only one possible combination of results that can support claims for direct competition among species.
   Results We do not get any strong evidence for widespread competition among congeneric species, while most communities investigated do not show significant patterns of species associations. The causal analysis suggests that the principal factors behind terrestrial isopod species associations are of historical nature. Some exceptional cases are also discussed.
   Main conclusions Presence/absence data for a variety of taxa do not support the assembly rule that congeneric species are under more intense competition compared to less related species. Also, these same data do not suggest strong interactions among species pairs, regardless of taxonomic status. When significant species associations can be seen in such matrices, they mainly reflect the effects of history or of habitat requirements.

AB The role and quatitative importance of free-living nematodes in marine and estuarine soft sediments remain enigmatic for lack of empirical evidence on the feeding habits and trophic position of most nematode species. Here we use natural abundances of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of some abundant nematode species/genera from estuarine intertidal sediments to assess their trophic level and major food sources. In all stations, delta(15)N of different dominant nematode species/genera spanned a range of 3.6 to 6.3 ppt, indicating that at least two trophic levels were represented. The large nematodes Enoplus brevis, Enoploides longispiculosus and Adoncholaimus fuscus consistently had high delta(15)N, in line with mouth-morphology based predictions and empirical evidence on their predacious feeding modes. Daptonema sp., Metachromadora remanei, Praeacanthonchus punctatus and 'Chromadoridae' (dominated by Ptycholaimellus ponticus) had comparatively lower delta(15)N, and delta(13)C suggesting that microphytobenthos (MPB) is their major carbon source, although freshly sedimented particulate organic matter may also contribute to their nutrition in silty sediments. The trophic position of Sphaerolaimus sp., a genus with documented predacious ecology mode, was ambiguous. Ascolaimus elongatus elongatus had delta(15)N signatures indicating a predacious ecology, which is at variance with expectations from existing feeding type classifications. Our study shows that despite limitations imposed by the biomass requirements for EA-IRMS (elemental analyser-isotope ratio mass spectrometry)-natural isotope abundances of carbon and nitrogen are powerful tools to unravel trophic structure within nematode communities. At the same time, the prominence of different trophic levels results in a large span of delta(15)N, largely invalidating the use of nitrogen isotype abundances to assess food sources and trophic level of whole nematode communities.

AB Gross primary production (F-GPP) may be calculated from net ecosystem CO2 exchange (F-NEE), measured, for example, by means of the eddy covariance method, provided an estimate of daytime ecosystem respiration is available. The latter is now often estimated by extrapolating functional relationships between nighttime F-NEE, when F-GPP is zero, and temperature to daytime conditions. The present paper deals with one problem associated with this approach, namely the reduction of leaf respiration in light relative to darkness, which causes an overestimation of daytime ecosystem respiration, and hence F-GPP, The over-estimation of F-GPP is quantified for a mountain meadow in the Austrian Alps using a coupled model of the reduction of leaf dark respiration as a function of light intensity and within-canopy radiative transfer. For the two study years analysed in the present paper, model simulations suggest a reduction of F-GPP by 11-13% and 13-17%, for a low and a high estimate of the maximum leaf-level reduction of dark respiration, respectively. This reduction is shown to be most sensitive to the ratio between F-GPP and total ecosystem respiration, as well as to the ratio between leaf and total ecosystem respiration. The largest factors of uncertainty in this modelling approach are the cause for and the actual level of the reduction of leaf dark respiration in light. The significance of the present findings for estimating F-GPP of other sites is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of climate change through thermal stress-related coral bleaching on coral reefs of the Western Indian Ocean has been well documented and is caused by rising sea water temperatures associated with background warming trends and extreme climate events. Recent studies have identified a number of factors that may reduce the impact of coral bleaching and mortality at a reef or sub-reef level. However, there is little scientific consensus as yet, and it is unclear how well current science supports the immediate needs of management responses to climate change. This paper provides evidence from the Western Indian Ocean in support of recent hypotheses on coral and reef vulnerability to thermal stress that have been loosely termed 'resistance and resilience to bleaching'. The paper argues for a more explicit definition of terms, and identifies three concepts affecting coral-zooxanthellae holobiont and reef vulnerability to thermal stress previously termed 'resistance to bleaching': 'thermal protection', where some reefs are protected from the thermal conditions that induce bleaching and/or where local physical conditions reduce bleaching and mortality levels; 'thermal resistance', where individual corals bleach to differing degrees to the same thermal stress; and 'thermal tolerance', where individual corals suffer differing levels of mortality when exposed to the same thermal stress. 'Resilience to bleaching' is a special case of ecological resilience, where recovery following large-scale bleaching mortality varies according to ecological and other processes. These concepts apply across multiple levels of biological organization and temporal and spatial scales. Thermal resistance and tolerance are genetic properties and may interact with environmental protection properties resulting in phenotypic variation in bleaching and mortality of corals. The presence or absence of human threats and varying levels of reef management may alter the influence of the above factors, particularly through their impacts on resilience, offering the opportunity for management interventions to mitigate the impacts of thermal stress and recovery on coral reefs. These concepts are compiled within an overarching framework of spatial resilience theory. This provides a framework for developing linked scientific and management questions relating to the larger scale impacts of climate change on coral reefs, their management needs and prospects for their future.

AB Controls on root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) include host nutrient status, identity of symbionts and soil physico-chemical properties. Here we show, in the field, that the subset of the AMF community colonizing the roots of a common grass species, Daclylis glomerata, was strongly controlled by neighboring roots of a different plant species, Centaurea maculosa, an invasive forb, thus adding, a biological spatial component to controls on root colonization. Using an AMF-specific, 18s rDNA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis method, significant differences were found between AMF community fingerprints of samples derived from roots of grasses with (G(Cm)) and without (G(0)) neighboring C. maculosa. There were also significant differences between samples derived from C. maculosa roots (C-mac) and both G(Cm), and Go roots. Sample ordination indicated three generally distinct groups consisting of C-mac, G(Cm), and G(0), with G(Cm), samples being of intermediate distance between Go and C-max. Our results indicate that, with the presence of C. maculosa, AMF communities of D. glomerata shift to reflect community composition associated with C. maculosa roots. These results highlight the importance of complex spatial distributions of AMF communities at the scale of a root system. An additional dimension to our Study is that C. maculosa is an aggressively invasive plant in the intermountain West. Viewed in this light, these results Suggest that pervasive influences of this plant on AMF communities, specifically in roots of its competitors, may represent a mechanism contributing to its invasive success. However, further work is clearly required to determine the extent to which AMF genotypic alteration by neighboring plants influences competitive relationships.

AB Species presence/absence surveys are commonly used in monitoring programs, metapopulation studies and habitat modelling, yet they can never be used to confirm that a species is absent from a location. Was the species there but not detected, or was the species genuinely absent? Not accounting for imperfect detection of the species leads to misleading conclusions about the status of the population under study. Here some recent modelling developments are reviewed that explicitly allow for the detection process, enabling unbiased estimation of occupancy, colonization and local extinction probabilities. The methods are illustrated with a simple analysis of presence/absence data collected on larvae and metamorphs of tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) in 2000 and 2001 from Minnesota farm ponds, which highlights that misleading conclusions can result from naive analyses that do not explicitly account for imperfect detection.

AB Diversity of ectotrophic mycobionts on outplanted seedlings of two oak species (Quercus rubra and Quercus prinus) was estimated at two sites in mature mixed forests in the southern Appalachian Mountains by sequencing nuclear 5.8S rRNA genes and the flanking internal transcribed spacer regions I and II (ITS). The seedlings captured a high diversity of mycorrhizal ITS-types and late-stage fungi were well represented. Total richness was 75 types, with 42 types having a frequency of only one. The first and second order jackknife estimates were 116 and 143 types, respectively. Among Basidiomycetes, tomentelloid/thelephoroid, russuloid, and cortinarioid groups were the richest. The ascomycete Cenococcum geophilum was ubiquitously present. Dominant fungi included a putative Tuber sp. (Ascomycetes), and Basidiomycetes including a putative Craterellus sp., and Laccaria cf. laccata. Diversity was lower at a drier high elevation oak forest site compared to a low elevation mesic cove - hardwood forest site. Fungal specificity for red oak vs. white oak seedlings was unresolved. The high degree of rarity in this system imposes limitations on the power of community analyses at finer scales. The high mycobiont diversity highlights the potential for seedlings to acquire carbon from mycelial networks and confirms the utility of using outplanted seedlings to estimate ectomycorrhizal diversity.

AB Although habitat fragmentation is suspected to pose a major threat to biodiversity, its impact on abundant invertebrate species has been little investigated. We assessed the genetic population structure of the flightless ground beetle Abax parallelepipedus in a forest fragmented by two main roads and a highway using five microsatellite loci. We detected low levels of genetic differentiation, which was concordant with the high population densities of 632-1707 individuals/ha estimated with a mark-recapture method. A Mantel test detected a highly significant increase of pairwise F-ST-values with the number of roads between sampling locations. As expected, the most pronounced effect of the isolation due to roads was observed in the sample from the smallest fragment (highway exit loop), which was differentiated significantly from most other locations. However, no signs of a recent bottleneck or a loss of genetic variability were detected in this population, indicating a still relatively large effective population size (N-e). Computer simulations confirmed that the observed F-ST-values were indeed compatible with a N-e of a few hundred individuals in this fragment, assuming strong or absolute isolation since the construction of the roads. We discuss the implications of our findings for the conservation of abundant but poorly dispersing species in fragmented habitats.

AB Ecologists increasingly use spatial statistics to study vegetation patterns. Mostly, however, these techniques are applied in a purely descriptive fashion without a priori statements on the pattern characteristics expected. We formulated such a priori predictions in a study of spatial pattern in a semi-arid Karoo shrubland, South Africa. Both seed dispersal and root competition have been discussed as processes shaping the spatial structure of this community. If either of the two processes dominates pattern formation, patterns within and between shrub functional groups are expected to show distinct deviations from null models. We predicted the type and scale of these deviations and compared predicted to observed pattern characteristics. As predicted by the seed dispersal hypothesis, small-scale co-occurrence within and between groups of colonisers and successors was increased as compared to complete spatially random arrangement of shrubs. The root competition predictions, however, were not met as shrubs of similar rooting depth co-occurred more frequently than expected under random shrub arrangement. Since the distribution of rooting groups to the given shrub locations also failed to match the root competition predictions, there was little evidence for dominance of root competition in pattern formation. Although other processes may contribute to small-scale plant co-occurrence, the sufficient and most parsimonious explanation for the observed pattern is that its formation was dominated by seed dispersal. To characterise point patterns we applied both cumulative (uni- and bivariate K-function) and local (pair- and mark-correlation function) techniques. Based on our results we recommend that future studies of vegetation patterns include local characteristics as they independently describe a pattern at different scales and can be easily related to processes changing with interplant distance in a predictable fashion.

AB Fossil fuels developed from ancient deposits of organic material, and thus can be thought of as a vast store of solar energy from which society meets >80% of its current energy needs. Here, using published biological, geochemical, and industrial data, I estimate the amount of photosynthetically fixed and stored carbon that was required to form the coal, oil, and gas that we are burning today. Today's average U. S. Gallon (3.8 L) of gasoline required approximately 90 metric tons of ancient plant matter as precursor material. The fossil fuels burned in 1997 were created from organic matter containing 44x10(18) g C, which is >400 times the net primary productivity (NPP) of the planet's current biota. As stores of ancient solar energy decline, humans are likely to use an increasing share of modern solar resources. I conservatively estimate that replacing the energy humans derive from fossil fuels with energy from modern biomass would require 22% of terrestrial NPP, increasing the human appropriation of this resource by similar to50%.

AB Vegetative regeneration of individual genotypes of Asian Reynoutria taxa. which are invasive in the Czech Republic, was studied in R. sachalinensis (five genotypes), R. japonica (a single genotype present in the country), and their hybrid R. X bohemica (nine genotypes). Identity of genotypes was confirmed by isozyme analysis. Ten rhizome segments of each genotype were planted in a randomized block design. After 30 d, the regeneration rate of each genotype was measured as the proportion of rhizomes that produced shoots. Emergence time and final mass of each shoot were recorded. The regeneration rate and final shoot mass were significantly affected by genotype in R. X bohemica but not in R. sachalinensis. In R. X bohemica, easily regenerating genotypes grew faster. Regeneration characteristics that crucially contribute to the fitness of these vegetatively spreading plants are closely related to each other. In genotypes with a low regeneration rate, early-emerging shoots produced more biomass, while in those with a high regeneration rate. shoot mass was independent of emergence time. Mean clone size recorded in the field was marginally significantly related to emergence time during regeneration; regeneration characteristics might thus affect the extent of R. X bohemica invasion at a regional scale. Hybrids genetically intermediate between the parents regenerated better than those closely related to parents. Novel hybrid invasive genotypes may be produced by rare sexual reproduction, fixed by clonal growth, and present a previously unknown threat to native vegetation.

AB The geographical variation in parasite community structure among populations of the same host species remains one of the least understood aspects of parasite community ecology. Why are parasite communities clearly structured in some host populations, and randomly assembled in others? Here, we address this fundamental question using data on the metazoan parasite communities of different host size-classes of four distinct populations of a small pelagic fish, the Argentine anchovy, Engraulis anchoita, from the South West Atlantic. Within each fish sample, fish length was correlated with both the total intensity of parasites and species richness among infracommunities. More importantly, average fish length correlated with mean infracommunity richness and mean total intensity across the fish samples, indicating that the characteristics of parasite assemblages in a fish population are strongly influenced by the size of its fish in relation to those in other populations. Nested subset patterns were observed in about half of the fish samples. This means that the presence or absence of parasite species among fish individuals is often not random; however, no repeatability of nestedness among component communities was observed. Average fish length did not influence directly the likelihood that a parasite assemblage was significantly nested. However, variables influenced by average fish length, namely mean infracommunity richness and mean total intensity, determine the probability that a nested hierarchy will be observed; host size may thus indirectly affect parasite community structure either itself or via its influence on host movement and feeding patterns. To some extent, this apparent link may be due to the sensitivity of nestedness analyses to the proportion of presence in a presence/absence matrix; this in itself is a biological feature of the parasite community, however, which is associated with mean host length.

AB We examined the selective consequences of variation in behaviour and endocrine physiology in two female throat-colour morphs of the lizard, Uta stansburiana in the wild. Female morphs differed in home-range distribution patterns and corticosterone levels in relation to the density and frequency of their female neighbours. Levels of plasma corticosterone of yellow-throated females increased with increased density of both morphs. in contrast, orange-throated females had reduced levels of corticosterone in response to increased density of orange females. Additionally, females with lower corticosterone survived poorly, suggesting that social interactions and high local densities of orange females may be potentially costly for orange females. These results are consistent with decreased fitness effects and suppression of immune function previously reported for orange female morphs surrounded by more orange neighbours. These correlations, in conjunction with previous work in this system, indicate that corticosterone is likely to be an important physiological mechanism regulating female fitness in nature.

AB I analyzed patterns of variation in root mass allocation and root morphology among seedlings of woody species in relation to environmental factors in four Neotropical forests. Among forests, I explored the response of root traits to sites varying in water or nutrient availability. Within each forest, I explored the plastic response of species to different microhabitats: gaps and understory. Additionally, I explored evidence for life history correlation of root and shoot traits by comparing species differing in their successional group (light-demanding [22 spp.] or shade tolerant [27 spp.]) and germination type (species with photosynthetic cotyledons or species with reserve cotyledons). At each forest site, young seedlings from 10 to 20 species were excavated. A total of 55 species was collected in understory conditions and 31 of them were also collected in gaps. From each seedling, six morphological ratios were determined. Allocation to roots was higher in forest sites with the lowest soil resources. Roots were finer and longer in the most infertile site, while roots were deeper in the site with the longest dry season. Seedling traits did not differ between germination types. Shade tolerant species allocated more to roots and developed thicker roots than light-demanding species. Light-demanding species showed stronger plastic responses to habitat than shade tolerant species, and species with photosynthetic cotyledons showed lower plasticity than species with reserve cotyledons. Overall, these results suggest that among Neotropical species, root allocation and root morphology of seedlings reflect plant adjustments to water or nutrient availability at geographic and microhabitat scales. In addition, life history specialization to light environments is suggested by differences among groups of species in their allocation to roots and in their root morphology.

   ANALYSIS; CLADISTIC-ANALYSIS; HISTORY; POPULATIONS
AB There is a long-standing debate about the fate of the mountain flora of the European Alps during the Pleistocene ice ages. Two main scenarios of glacial survival of alpine plant taxa have been discussed, namely (1) total extinction within glaciated areas, survival in peripheral refugia, and postglacial re-immigration into vacant areas (tabula rasa hypothesis), and (2) long-term in situ survival within glaciated regions in isolated ice-free areas above the ice-shield (nunatak hypothesis). Four alpine species with differing distributions and ecological demands were investigated to elucidate their glacial history using molecular methods (AFLPs, RFLPs of cpDNA, RAPDs). Their glacial histories are very diverse. Whereas in situ survival in the most intensely glaciated Central Alps played an important role in Eritrichium nanum, the low alpine Erinus alpinus survived in situ on some mountains of the northern Swiss Prealps, and Rumex nivalis grows at intermediate alpine elevations in snow-beds in both the northern and the Central Swiss Alps. In the common arctic-alpine Saxifraga oppositifolia, the species with the widest distribution and ecological amplitude as compared to the other three species, it is not possible to reconstruct its glacial history. It is probable, therefore, that in the Alps, as in northern Europe, resident genotypes surviving glaciation in situ were integrated into the gene pool of postglacially immigrating periglacial individuals. The size of refugia differed according to species and region. On the one hand, refugia were restricted to individual mountains (E. alpinus, R. nivalis). On the other hand, they spanned several mountain ranges in larger areas (E. nanum, E. alpinus). Postglacial migration over longer distances was inferred for E. alpinus from southern France to northern Switzerland, and, over shorter distances, for R. nivalis from the northern Prealps into the Central Alps in Switzerland. Both postglacial immigration and in situ survival shaped the phylogeography at least of E. alpinus and R. nivalis. It is likely, therefore, that the nunatak and the tabula rasa hypotheses are too simplistic to describe the rich diversity of glacial and postglacial processes in Alpine plant species. It rather appears that the glacial history of each species is to a certain degree unique and influenced by its ecological demands or breeding systems. Moreover, stochasticity has to be regarded of essential importance, since factors such as preglacial distribution patterns or postglacial dispersal or extinction events should have had effects on the present genetic composition and the distribution of a species.

AB Human society affects environmental change but is also vulnerable to these changes. This relation has generated a number of theories that either focus on how we affect the environment or how the environment affects us. Few theories explicitly focus on the interaction. This paper will establish the range of data required to give an assessment of how likely an ecosystem is to change (which we label environmental sensitivity) and the ability of communities to adapt (social resilience). These findings allow us to generate a new method for assessing the reflexive relation between society and the environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aquatic ecosystems are a key component of the Earth's biosphere. A large number of studies document substantial impact of solar UV radiation on individual species, yet considerable uncertainty remains with respect to assessing impacts on ecosystems. Several studies indicate that the impact of increased UV radiation appears relatively low when considering overall ecosystem response, while, in contrast, effects on individual species show considerable responses. Ecosystem response to climate variability incorporates both synergistic and antagonistic processes with respect to UV-related effects, significantly complicating understanding and prediction at the ecosystem level. The impact of climate variability on UV-related effects often becomes manifest via indirect effects such as reduction in sea ice, changes in water column bio-optical characteristics, changes in cloud cover and shifts in oceanographic biogeochemical provinces.

AB Grasslands comprise approximately 40% of the world's terrestrial. surface. Consequently, grassland ecosystems are a significant component of the global carbon cycle. In order to better understand how grazing affects the carbon cycle of grasslands, this study measured CO2 exchange rate (CER) and soil respiration rate (SRR) on 130 ha pastures with a 56-year-history of heavy (60% removal) and light (20% removal) grazing, and their accompanying 0.8 ha exclosures, on the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado, USA. A CER chamber that covered I m 2 of native grassland was used on five plots in each of the four areas. Mid-day CER and SRR were measured during the growing seasons of 1995-1997, along with green vegetation index (GVI, similar to leaf area index) and plant species composition.
   When averaged over each growing season, there was no significant difference in CER of grazed pastures versus exclosures. However, there were seasonal differences in CER, which varied over the 3 years. Differences in CER between grazed pastures and exclosures were not related to GVI, which rarely differed between treatments. Grazing treatment differences in CER were driven by climate variability and species composition differences resulting from long-term grazing and exclusion from grazing. Exclosures had more cool-season (C-3) grasses and forbs than grazed plots, which contained more warm-season (C-4) grasses (primarily Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag. Ex Steud.). The somewhat unique, cool spring of 1995 was favorable to cool-season plant metabolism and resulted in higher CER in exclosures compared with grazed pastures. Warm, dry conditions in spring of 1996 favored warm-season species, resulting in higher CER in the heavily-grazed pasture. In 1997, there was little difference in CER between grazed pastures and exclosures. There were very few sampling dates when SRR was different in grazed pastures and exclosures. This study suggests that these intensities of cattle grazing do not alter the photosynthetic and soil respiration components of the carbon cycle of the US shortgrass prairie. It appears that cattle grazing can be a sustainable component of managing this ecosystem for maximum global carbon sequestration. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Historical biogeography and comparative phylogeography have much in common. Both seek to discover common historical patterns in the elements of biotas, although typically at different tiers of evolutionary history. Comparative phylogeography is based on phylogeographic analyses of multiple taxa, usually widespread species. By comparing the phylogeographic structures of numerous widespread sympatric species, one can infer whether the current fauna has been historically stable, as evidenced by the relative frequency of geographically congruent reciprocally monophyletic groups. Alternatively, if species distributions are ephemeral over evolutionary time, a mixture of phylogeographic structures is expected. Coalescence analyses contribute information about history irrespective of whether haplotype phylogenies; are structured or not. In the aridlands of North America, several isolating events are evident in the phylogeographic patterns of birds, mammals and herps. A mid-peninsular seaway in Baja California, dated at ca. one million years before present, had a pervasive effect, with 13 of 16 assayed species showing a concordant split. Hence, this community appears to have been a stable assemblage of species over the past one million years. In contrast, the avifauna of the Sonoran-Chihuahuan deserts consists of two species with a concordant split and three other species that are undifferentiated across both deserts. Hence, the species in this area have had different histories. The Baja biota appears to resemble its ancestral configuration to a greater degree than the Sonoran-Chihuahuan one. A deeper evolutionary event separated taxa in Baja California from the eastern deserts, showing that the aridlands fauna was affected by events at different times resulting in overlain tiers of history.

AB 1. Bottom-up approaches based on individual behaviour can help to identify key variables influencing populations at larger scales. Instream habitat models have been developed to predict the consequences, for populations in stream reaches, of fish preferences for particular hydraulic conditions observed at the scale of individuals. Conventional instream habitat models (e.g. PHABSIM) predict habitat values for species or life stages in reaches, and their changes with discharge. Despite their worldwide use, they have been subject to continuing criticism and have been mainly limited to site-specific case studies.
   2. We ran conventional instream habitat models in 58 French stream reaches dominated by brown trout. Using non-linear mixed effect models, we demonstrated that the outputs of instream habitat models (habitat values for three trout life stages and five other species) are predictable from average characteristics of reaches (discharge, depth, width and bed particle size).
   3. Our models closely reflect variations in habitat values within-reaches (with discharge) and between-reaches. Within-reach changes are linked to the Reynolds number of reaches, while between-reach changes depend mainly on the Froude number at median daily discharge. These two dimensionless variables combine discharge, mean depth and mean width of reaches. Independent model validations showed robust model predictions that are consistent with studies of habitat values for brown trout made in larger streams from western North America.
   4. Our results contribute to identifying the main hydraulic variables governing estimates of fish habitat values. They should facilitate habitat studies in multiple streams, at the basin or larger scales, while reducing their cost. They should enhance the biological validation of habitat model predictions, which remains critical.

Multivariate analysis can be used for both descriptive and predictive modeling. This paper provides an intuitive geometric introduction to the more commonly used and relevant multivariate methods in weed science research, including ordination, discriminant analysis, and canonical analysis. These methods are illustrated using a simple artificial data set consisting of abundance measures of six weed species and two soil variables over 12 sample plots.

According to their role in landscape metabolism, two categories of landscape components are distinguished, ecotones/retention compartments and conduits/corridors. Conduits such as macropores, preferential interflow-paths. drainage tiles and streams rapidly relocate nitrate to headwaters. Retention compartments like the capillary fringe/saturated zone and riparian vegetation eliminate N through denitrification. The differential role of compartments is illustrated with quantitative examples from the literature. On the landscape level retention potential for N is spatially variable and quantitatively limited, while its realisation is uncertain. Notwithstanding, the literature indicates that on a watershed basis the bulk of total N input is retained; thus the potential is discussed for the retention of nitrate on different scales, i.e. the field, landscape, regional and global scale. The transitory retention of excess nitrate in soil and subsoil solution, soil organic matter, groundwater and riparian vegetation may delay nitrate discharge to the aquatic system for decades, contributing to the low emission factors on basin scale. The adverse effects arising from denitrification are discussed, presenting data on the emission of nitrous oxide from the entirety of the different landscape compartments. It is concluded that reliance on landscape metabolism and self-purification postpones the problem of global N overload and partially transfers it to the atmosphere. An assessment scheme is presented which in the face of the unpredictability of ecosystem and landscape behaviour is risk oriented (instead of impact oriented). The scheme uses a budget approach, which accounts for the critical role of corridors and considers the scale and scope of N emissions. A conceptual framework for the remediation of N overload is presented which rests on the realisation of cycling principles and zero-emission approaches on all scales of agricultural production and which pleads for regional approaches that transcend sectoral boundaries and Lake account of overall regional N fluxes.

AB Soft-sediment macrobenthos data from the southern part of the Norwegian continental shelf was used to study faunal patterns and spatial variability, and to evaluate different measures of marine biodiversity. Water depth and sediment characteristics were remarkably uniform over the spatial sampling scale of 130 x 70 km, and relations between measured environmental variables and community structure were weak. Out of 175 recorded species, 10 % spanned the entire sampling area (16 sites), while 27 % were restricted to a single site. The number of rare species was positively correlated with species richness. Common species were widely spatially distributed, while species of low abundance had strongly compressed range sizes. The distribution of species varied among the 4 dominant taxonomic groups: the polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs, and echinoderms, Polychaetes were the most common taxonomic group and had the highest proportion of widespread species. Whittaker's beta diversity measure (beta (W), extent of change in species composition among sites) varied among the dominant taxonomic groups and was highest for crustaceans, followed by molluscs. Neither the number of shared species nor the complementarity (biotic distinctness) between all pairwise permutations of sites was linked to spatial distance. However, the Bray-Curtis similarity between all pairwise combinations of sites was a function of spatial arrangement and was the most sensitive measure of beta diversity. Faunal pattern changed across the study area, despite the uniform habitat. Furthermore, faunal pattern and variability changed with scales. The measurement of biodiversity is therefore dependent on spatial scale, and cross-scale studies are important. The abstract concept of biodiversity as the 'variety of life' cannot be encapsulated by a single measure, Distributions of species and community differences should be taken into account in addition to species diversity when measuring marine biodiversity and planning conservation areas, and more than 1 taxonomic group should be studied in a system.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems contain large amounts of carbon (C) and have the potential to significantly increase atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Peatlands are particularly important for C storage, although little is known about the effects of anthropogenic activities on C balance in these ecosystems. Sheep-grazing and rotational burning are widely practised on blanket peat moorlands in the United Kingdom. The effects of these activities on C sequestration in peat has been investigated with a long-term randomized block experiment with treatments: (a) grazed 1 unburnt; (b) grazed 1 burnt every ten years; (c) ungrazed 1 unburnt. C accumulation under these treatments was compared by identifying a chronologically synchronous horizon within the peat common to all treatment plots. This fixed point was defined by the 'take-off' in concentration of spheroidal carbonaceous particles and was supported by the record of charcoal fragments. There was no significant difference in recent C accumulation rates between lightly grazed and ungrazed plots. In contrast, after 30 years there was significantly less C stored in the blanket peat in plots which had been burned every ten years. The results indicate that light sheep-grazing at this site did not affect rates of C accumulation in blanket peat, but decadal burning of moorland reduced C sequestration.

AB Large carnivores are often used as focal species (indicators, umbrellas, flagships or keystones) in conservation strategies either aimed at conserving carnivores, the rest of the biodiversity that occupies their habitats, or both. We evaluate their suitability for these roles in the context of boreal forest biodiversity conservation in the muti-use landscapes of Scandinavia. The enormous conflicts, especially with livestock, that carnivores cause in these areas makes them very controversial flagships to the extent that it may affect rural people's attitudes to conservation in general. Because of the broad habitat tolerance of large carnivores and their prey, and the difficulties in surveying carnivore numbers, they are very insensitive and impractical indicators of forest biodiversity. This ability of large carnivores to thrive in industrial forests means that the many species that are sensitive to modern forestry will not fall under the umbrella of areas managed for large carnivores. If large carnivores have a keystone function with respect to affecting the density of their ungulate prey it is likely to lead to even further conflicts with hunters who gain economic benefit from harvesting wild ungulates. In other words, none of the classic 'ecological' arguments are likely to help justify large carnivore conservation, and large carnivore conservation is unlikely to help conserve the rest of the boreal forest's biodiversity. Based on these arguments we recommend that (1) justification for large carnivore conservation focus on the real philosophical and value orientated reasons rather than ecological justifications, (2) that this conservation should be brought about in practice by dedicated management programs that specifically address the conflicts caused by large carnivores, and (3) that boreal forest biodiversity is best conserved by specific actions designed to establish reserves or change forestry practices.

AB Our ability to predict whether elevated atmospheric CO2 will alter the cycling of C and N in terrestrial ecosystems requires understanding a complex set of feedback mechanisms initiated by changes in C and N acquisition by plants and the degree to which changes in resource acquisition (C and N) alter plant growth and allocation. To gain further insight into these dynamics, we grew six genotypes of Populus tremuloides Michx. that differ in autumnal senescence (early vs, late) under experimental atmospheric CO2 (35.7 and 70.7 Pa) and soil-N availability (low and high) treatments. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were manipulated with open-top chambers, and soil-N availability was modified in open-bottom root boxes by mixing different proportions of native A and C horizon soil. Net N mineralization rates averaged 61 ng N.g(-1).d(-1) in low-N soil and 319 ng N.g(-1).d(-1) in high-N soil. After 2.5 growing seasons, we harvested above- and belowground plant components in each chamber and determined total biomass, N concentration, N content, and the relative allocation of biomass and N to leaves, stems, and roots.
   Elevated CO2 increased total plant biomass 16% in low-N soil and 38% in high-N soil, indicating that the growth response of P. tremuloides to elevated CO2 was constrained by soil-N availability. Greater growth under elevated CO2 did not substantially alter the allocation of biomass to above- or belowground plant components. At both levels of soil-N availability, elevated CO2 decreased the N concentration of all plant tissues. Despite declines in tissue N concentration, elevated CO2 significantly increased whole-plant N content in high-N soil (ambient = 137 g N/chamber; elevated = 155 g N/chamber), but it did not influence whole-plant N content in low-N soil (36 g N/chamber). Our results indicate that plants in high-N soil obtained greater amounts of soil N under elevated CO2 by producing a proportionately larger fine-root system that more thoroughly exploited the soil. The significant positive relationship between fine-root biomass and total-plant N content we observed in high-N soil further supports this contention. In low-N soil, elevated CO did not increase fine-root biomass or production, and plants under ambient and elevated CO2 obtained equivalent amounts of N from soil. In high-N soil, it appears that greater acquisition of soil N under elevated CO2 fed forward within the plant to increase rates of C acquisition, which further enhanced plant growth response to elevated CO2.

AB Coral reef community structure has remained remarkably stable over a 10 yr period within a small protected marine area despite repeated hurricane impacts. Local community dynamics have been highly variable, however. Sites that were destroyed by disease in the 1970s are showing little or no recovery, while sites less than a kilometre away that were devastated by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 are recovering well. Strong coral recruitment has occurred in shallow, exposed areas that showed the greatest hurricane impacts, and these areas are now more species rich than in 1988, although coral cover has not reached pre-hurricane levels. Coral colony survivorship has been high throughout most of the study area. Partial mortality rates were elevated for several years following Hurricane Hugo, but significant whole coral-head mortality only occurred during periods with hurricane impacts and only at the most exposed sites. Overall, the coral community has proved resilient to closely repeated major hurricane impacts. From a single case study we cannot attribute this resilience to the relatively low level of human impacts, but grazing fish populations have apparently remained high enough to keep macroalgae in check despite the mass mortality of the herbivore Diadema antillarum in the 1980s.

AB 1 Seedlings of 16 West African timber tree species were grown in six neutral shade-houses with irradiances 2%, 6%, 10%, 28%, 44% and 66% of unshaded values.
   2 Tested species included well-known pioneers, which showed negative growth in 2% irradiance but which responded strongly to increased irradiance, and very shade-tolerant non-pioneers, which had positive growth in 2% irradiance but responded only slightly to increased irradiance.
   3 For all species, maximum growth occurred at an irradiance varying between 10% and 44%. The inhibition of growth at higher irradiance was greater in the more shade-tolerant species.
   4 Data from growth analyses were used in a principal components analysis to quantify the species' positions on a light response gradient. The growth variables most strongly correlated with this gradient were relative growth rate (RGR) and relative diameter growth in 2% irradiance, and also apparent quantum efficiency and leaf mortality rate in both 2% and 66% irradiance. These results draw attention to the importance of performance in deep forest shade in defining differences among tropical forest tree species.
   5 The second (independent) axis of the principal components analysis separated three species that are known from other experiments to be drought tolerant. Other species' traits of functional significance (adult deciduousness, seed size, seed dispersal) were only weakly, if at all, associated with the gradient of light response.
   6 Possible methods for efficient placement of other species on the gradient of light response are discussed. Formulation of standardized conditions simulating deep shade would allow diameter growth to be used as a simple non-destructive measure of a species' position on the gradient of light response, which could then be applied to any tropical forest flora.

AB 1. One current approach to the prediction of community characteristics is to use models of key local-scale processes (e.g, niche dimensions) affecting individuals and to estimate the effects of these attributes over larger scales. We tested this approach, focusing on how the hydraulic habitat structures fluvial fish communities.
   2. We used a recent statistical habitat model to predict fish community characteristics in eleven reaches in the Rhone river basin in France. Predictions were made 'blindly' since most reaches were not used to calibrate the model. The model reflects species preferences for local hydraulics. We made predictions of the fish community from the local hydraulic conditions found in the reaches under low flow conditions. The overall abundance and the relative abundance (both as indices) of fish species, specific size classes and species traits (i.e, reproductive, trophic, morphological and others) were predicted. We summarized our predictions of the relative abundance of species as two 'community structure indices' using Principal Component Analysis.
   3. Our predictions from low-flow hydraulics were compared with long-term observations of fish communities. The relative abundance of species actually observed depended largely on zoogeographic factors within the Rhone basin which could not be predicted by the model. The model predicted 13% of the variance in the indices of relative abundance at the species level and 23% of this variance at the trait level for all zoogeographic regions combined. However, when focused on reaches within a geographic region, the model explained up to 47% of the same variance. Therefore, geographic regions act as 'filters' on the relative abundance of species, but hydraulics do affect fish communities within a given geographical context.
   4. For the synthetic 'community structure indices', we obtained good predictions from hydraulics independently of the geographical context (variance explained up to 95%). These indices were linked to simple key hydraulic characteristics of river reaches (Froude and/or Reynolds number). The indices enabled interpretations of the links between hydraulics, geomorphology, discharge and community patterns. These links were consistent with existing knowledge of species and their traits.
   5. In addition to the above validations, the habitat model partly explained the observed effects of impoundment on fish communities.
   6. The present results show that stream hydraulics strongly impact fish community structure. Consequently, our findings confirm that community characteristics can be predicted using models of the local-scale habitat requirements of the species forming the community.

AB Scale-specific patterns of resource distribution on landscapes entrain attributes of-resident animal communities such that species body-mass distributions are organized into distinct aggregations. Species within each aggregation respond to resources over the same range of scale. This discontinuous pattern has predictive power: invasive species and extinct or declining species in landscapes subject to human transformation tend to be located at the edge of body-mass aggregations (P < 0.01), which may be transition zones between distinct ranges of scale. Location at scale breaks affords species great opportunity, but also potential crisis.

AB An energetics mechanism is proposed to explain the trade-off between current and future reproduction. Surplus energy can be used for reproductive tissue (current reproduction) or somatic tissue (needed for future reproduction); therefore, we needed to determine first, when does growth of somatic and reproductive tissues occur, and second, how and when is energy allocated to reproduction. Walleye were sampled monthly from the commercial fishery in Lake Erie. Morphological attributes were recorded from these walleye, as well as the lipid composition of a smaller subsample. Energy for reproduction is acquired in the winter, spring, and summer before spawning and stored as visceral lipids. Ovarian lipids are largely derived from visceral fat deposits; thus, females appear to be capital breeders. Females elaborate gonadal tissue only if there is sufficient visceral fat. The circannual endocrine switch to reproduction may occur in midsummer (August) and in October. Females may discontinue ovarian development during the early winter if there is insufficient surplus energy (visceral fat). Year-class variation may be partly explained by the energy condition of the females and the proportion of the stock able to spawn successfully each year.

AB Marine turtles, salmon, and many other marine and terrestrial animals exhibit similar reproductive strategies in which the adults return to the site of their birth (''natal homing''). For these species, imprinting is the basic mechanism that allows every individual to place its progeny in an environment geographically similar to the one experienced at an early life stage. A tentative generalization of ''natal homing'' is presented within which homing is viewed as part of a continuum of reproductive strategies, all relying on imprinting. This generalization postulates that a newborn individual memorizes early environmental cues, which later determine the choice of its reproductive environment. Thus, the same mechanism accounts for successive generations reproducing at the same geographic location (philopatry) or aiming at a moving target, i.e., a set of environmental conditions that do not always have the same earth coordinates (dispersal). As a consequence, the adaptability of a population to its environment is ensured because of the diversity and multitude of imprinted individuals and not because of their individual adaptability. Diversity of life is thus perhaps more impressive than usually thought. Some ecological and evolutionary consequences of this generalization are explored and its application to marine fish discussed.

AB Changes in forest disturbance affect their sustainability. This study finds that between 1986 and 2016, 36 million disturbances by humans or other causes affected 17% of Europe's forest area.
   Changes in forest disturbances can have strong impacts on forests, yet we lack consistent data on Europe's forest disturbance regimes and their changes over time. Here we used satellite data to map three decades of forest disturbances across continental Europe, and analysed the patterns and trends in disturbance size, frequency and severity. Between 1986 and 2016, 17% of Europe's forest area was disturbed by anthropogenic and/or natural causes. We identified 36 million individual disturbance patches with a mean patch size of 1.09 ha, which equals an annual average of 0.52 disturbance patches per km(2)of forest area. The majority of disturbances were stand replacing. While trends in disturbance size were highly variable, disturbance frequency consistently increased and disturbance severity decreased. Here we present a continental-scale characterization of Europe's forest disturbance regimes and their changes over time, providing spatial information that is critical for understanding the ongoing changes in Europe's forests.

AB Empirical evidence for the response of soil carbon cycling to the combined effects of warming, drought and diversity loss is scarce. Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) plays a central role in regulating the flow of carbon through soil, yet how biotic and abiotic factors interact to drive it remains unclear. Here, we combine distinct community inocula (a biotic factor) with different temperature and moisture conditions (abiotic factors) to manipulate microbial diversity and community structure within a model soil. While community composition and diversity are the strongest predictors of CUE, abiotic factors modulated the relationship between diversity and CUE, with CUE being positively correlated with bacterial diversity only under high moisture. Altogether these results indicate that the diversity x ecosystem-function relationship can be impaired under non-favorable conditions in soils, and that to understand changes in soil C cycling we need to account for the multiple facets of global changes.

AB Urban agglomeration has become the most salient feature of global urbanization in recent decades, while spatiotemporal patterns and evolution remain poorly understood in urban agglomerations, which limit the decision-makers to make more informed decisions to improve the regional environment. Here we selected one of the most rapidly urbanized regions in the world - Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (PRDR), located in southern China, as the case. Landsat images spanning from 1995 to 2015 were used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). Four types of regional heat island (RHI) degree were defined for further analysis. Then multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of RHI were identified with the help of cloud-based computing, spatial and landscape analysis. We found that (1) traditional urban heat island (UHI) appears as an RHI on an urban agglomeration scale. In PRDR, we found RHI expended with increasing connectivity, especially in the estuary areas where isolated UHI gradually merged during the rapid urbanization. (2) The contribution of main cities in PRDR to RHI and the evolutionary trends and pattern, which is changed from a west-east to a southwest-northeast gradient, have been revealed. (3) Considering the scale effect and different RHI categories, we revealed that during the urbanization, the aggregation of the RHI is significant on a larger-scale, and the area of 4 degrees C <= Relative LST <= 8 degrees C is the stable and high-risk area, which provide scientific bases for the governance of the thermal environment on the regional scale. (4) The study also indicates the cooling effect of forests and water is better than that of grassland, while the cooling effect of grassland is uncertain. The methods and results of this study not only have implications on environmental planning and management in the PRDR but also provide useful insights into the thermal environment research and practice in other urban agglomerations.

AB Land use/land cover and its change is a certain reflection of the interaction of natural factors and human activity in regional ecological environment, and the change of land use/land cover also affects the regional ecological process. Among regional ecological assessments, the landscape ecological risk assessment by land use/land cover changes is a regional ecological risk assessment method that is based on spatial pattern perspectives. The research on typical ecological fragile areas that respond strongly to global change focuses on coastal zones, wetlands and transition zones between cropping areas and nomadic areas; however, there are no related studies on the Tibetan Plateau. This study proposed an ecological risk assessment on Delingha City on the Tibetan plateau by using RS (remote sensing) and GIS (geographic information system) methods Based on land use/land cover variations in Delingha City during the periods 1986-2000 and 2000-2015, regional ecological risk changes were analysed to provide scientific bases for the ecological protection of cities on the Tibetan Plateau. The results indicated that: 1) From 1986 to 2000, major land use/land cover changes took place in the south of the city; in general, grassland was converted into farmland. From 2000 to 2015, the spatial distribution of land use changes was chaotic; however, the land use changes in the south were more concentrated and significant. 2) More than half of Delingha City fall under low ecological risk zones, which are mainly located in high-altitude mountainous area in north Delingha. High ecological risk areas are mainly located in the low-lying and flat landscapes in the south. 3) During the research period, the significant decrease of highest-and high-risk zones and considerable increase of low-risk zone indicate an improvement of the overall ecological environment in Delingha City through 1986-2015.

AB Many human populations are undergoing an extinction of experience, with a progressive decline in interactions with nature. This is a consequence both of a loss of opportunity for, and orientation towards, such experiences. The trend is of concern in part because interactions with nature can be good for human health and wellbeing. One potential means of redressing these losses is through the intentional provision of resources to increase wildlife populations in close proximity to people, thereby increasing the potential for positive human-nature experiences, and thence the array of benefits that can result. In this paper, we review the evidence that these resource subsidies have such a cascade of effects. In some Westernized countries, the scale of provision is extraordinarily high, and doubtless leads to both positive and negative impacts for wildlife. In turn, these impacts often lead to more frequent, reliable and closer human-nature interactions, with a greater variety of species. The consequences for human wellbeing remain poorly understood, although benefits documented in the context of human-nature interactions more broadly seem likely to apply. There are also some important feedback loops that need to be better characterized if resource provisioning is to contribute effectively towards averting the extinction of experience.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Anthropogenic resource subsidies and host-parasite dynamics in wildlife'.

AB Climate change can influence consumer populations both directly, by affecting survival and reproduction, and indirectly, by altering resources. However, little is known about the relative importance of direct and indirect effects, particularly for species important to ecosystem functioning, like pollinators. We used structural equation modelling to test the importance of direct and indirect (via floral resources) climate effects on the interannual abundance of three subalpine bumble bee species. In addition, we used long-term data to examine how climate and floral resources have changed over time. Over 8 years, bee abundances were driven primarily by the indirect effects of climate on the temporal distribution of floral resources. Over 43 years, aspects of floral phenology changed in ways that indicate species-specific effects on bees. Our study suggests that climate-driven alterations in floral resource phenology can play a critical role in governing bee population responses to global change.

AB Background: Roots are the primary site for plant-microbe interactions. Among the three root-associated layers (i.e., rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and endorhiza), the rhizoplane is a key component serving a critical gating role that controls microbial entry into plant roots. The microbial communities colonizing the three layers are believed to be gradually enriched from the bulk soil inoculum. However, it is unknown how this enrichment process, particularly the rhizosphere to rhizoplane step, is affected by biotic stresses, such as disease. In this study, we address this question using the citrus root-associated microbiome as a model.
   Results: We identified the rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties of the citrus root-associated microbiome and determined how they were affected by Huanglongbing (HLB), a severe systemic disease caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. Multiple rhizoplane-enriched genera were identified, with Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia being the most dominant. Plant-derived carbon sources are an important driving force for the enrichment process. The enrichment of functional attributes, such as motility, chemotaxis, secretion systems, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis, demonstrated more active microbe-plant interactions on the rhizoplane than the rhizosphere. We observed that HLB impaired the rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane enrichment process of the citrus root-associated microbiome in three ways: (1) by decreasing the relative abundance of most rhizoplane-enriched genera; (2) by reducing the relative abundance and/or expression activity of the functional attributes involved in microbe-plant interactions; and (3) by recruiting more functional features involved in autotrophic life cycle adaptation, such as carbon fixation and nitrogen nitrification in the HLB rhizoplane microbiome. Finally, our data showed that inoculation of Burkholderia strains isolated from the healthy citrus root-associated microbiome could trigger the expression of genes involved in induced systemic resistance in inoculated plants.
   Conclusions: HLB causes decreased relative abundance and/or expression activity of rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties, collectively resulting in impaired plant host-microbiome interactions. Manipulation of the citrus root-associated microbiome, for instance, by inoculating citrus roots with beneficial Burkholderia strains, has potential to promote plant health. Our results provide novel insights for understanding the contributions of the community enrichment process of the root-associated microbiome to the plant hosts.

AB Global sustainability policies, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or the Aichi Targets, aim to ensure sustainable development, including improved human well-being and the conservation of nature. Although not yet explicitly used to evaluate the progress towards sustainable development, the ecosystem service concept implies a direct link between biodiversity and human well-being. This study explores how and which ecosystem services are currently considered in the SDGs and the Aichi Targets. We also identify which information might be already available for monitoring the progress towards their goals by reviewing national ecosystem assessments. This allows the identification of the main knowledge gaps for monitoring progress towards these global sustainability targets.
   There is a wealth of information on all major ecosystem services categories which is directly relevant for the Aichi Targets and the SDGs. The top 25% most cited ecosystem services across both policy documents are: Natural heritage and diversity, Capture fisheries, Aquaculture, Water purification, Crops, Cultural heritage & diversity and Livestock. Most monitoring information recommended for the global sustainability goals, as well as in the information available from national assessments, is biased towards supply related aspects of ecosystem services flows. In contrast, there is much less information on social behaviour, use, demand and governance measures. Indicators are rarely available for all aspects of a specific ecosystem service.
   The national statistical bureaus currently in charge of providing observations for reporting on SDGs, could be well placed to address this bias, by integrating ecological observations with socio-economic statistics into socioecological indicators for ecosystem services flows. IPBES can potentially address the gaps identified in this paper by improving coverage of the different dimensions of ecosystem services flows.

AB In recent years, conservation planning, policy, and communications have increasingly emphasized the human benefits, or "ecosystem services," provided by nonhuman nature. In response to this utilitarian, anthropocentric framing, some conservationists have countered that nonhuman nature is valuable for more than its instrumental use to humans. In other words, these critics maintain that nonhuman nature has intrinsic value, which the ecosystem services paradigm fails to duly acknowledge. Proponents of the ecosystem services approach have responded in turn, either by proposing that intrinsic value can be integrated into the ecosystem services framework, or by justifying the pull away from intrinsic value on the grounds that it does not motivate broad support for conservation. We suggest these debates have been clouded by an ambiguous conceptualization of intrinsic value, which in fact has a rich intellectual heritage in philosophy and environmental ethics. We therefore review some of the major work from these literatures, to provide members of the conservation community with a deeper understanding of intrinsic value that, we hope, will inform more focused and productive discourse. Following this review, we highlight two common ways intrinsic value has been misinterpreted in recent debates around ecosystem services. As a result of these misinterpretations, we argue, the non-anthropocentric ethical concerns raised by many critics of the ecosystem services approach remain effectively unaddressed. We conclude by offering logical, practical, and moral reasons why the concept of intrinsic value continues to be relevant to conservationists, even and especially in the emerging ecosystem services paradigm.

AB Cooperation is a ubiquitous behavior in many biological systems and is well-known for promoting Allee effects. However, few studies have paid attention to mechanisms inducing Allee effects in predators. Here, we focus on hunting cooperation and use a classical predator prey system for identifying the impact of this mechanism. We add a cooperation term to the attack rate of the predator population, and investigate the equilibrium stability in phase plane and bifurcation diagrams. We show that hunting cooperation can be beneficial to the predator population by increasing the attack rate. We identify a scenario in which hunting cooperation produces Allee effects in predators and allows the latter to persist when the prey population does not sustain them in the absence of hunting cooperation. However, hunting cooperation can turn detrimental to predators when prey density drastically decreases because of increased predation pressure, which in turn decreases the predator intake. Hunting cooperation can also destabilize the system and promote a sudden collapse of the predator population. We generalize the model and prove that demographic Allee effects always occur when (1) the attack rate increases with the predator density, and (2) the functional response increases with the attack rate. We conclude that Allee effects in predators might be more widespread than expected. Mechanisms inducing such effects may strongly influence not only predators, but also the fate of ecosystems involving predators as in biological control programs.

AB 1. Climate models predict that the frequency, intensity and duration of drought events will increase in tropical regions. Although water withdrawal from deep soil layers is generally considered to be an efficient adaptation to drought, there is little information on the role played by deep roots in tropical forests. Tropical Eucalyptus plantations managed in short rotation cycles are simple forest ecosystems that may provide an insight into the water use by trees in tropical forests.
   2. The contribution made by water withdrawn from deep soil layers to the water required for evapotranspiration was quantified daily from planting to harvesting age for a Eucalyptus grandis stand using a soil water transfer model coupled with an ecophysiological forest model (MAESPA). The model was parameterized using an extensive data set and validated using time series of the soil water content down to a depth of 10 m and water-table level, as well as evapotranspiration measured using eddy covariance.
   3. Fast root growth after planting provided access to large quantities of water stored in deep soil layers over the first 2 years. Eucalyptus roots reached the water-table at a depth of 12 m after 2 years. Although the mean water withdrawal from depths of over 10 m amounted to only 5% of canopy transpiration from planting to a harvesting age of 5 years, the proportion of water taken up near the water-table was much higher during dry periods. The water-table rose from 18 to 12 m below-ground over 2 years after the harvest of the previous stand and then fell until harvesting age as evapotranspiration rates exceeded the annual rainfall.
   4. Deep rooting is an efficient strategy to increase the amount of water available for the trees, allowing the uptake of transient gravitational water and possibly giving access to a deep watertable. Deep soil layers have an important buffer role for large amounts of water stored during the wet season that is taken up by trees during dry periods. Our study confirms that deep rooting could be a major mechanism explaining high transpiration rates throughout the year in many tropical forests.

AB In this study, an ecological vulnerability assessment indicator system was constructed using the "exposure-climate sensitivity-adaptive capacity" framework according to the theory of ecological vulnerability. An improved ecosystem service value calculation model was proposed based on empirical parameters. Using Yancheng Nature Reserve in China as an example, we employed remote sensing data to conduct an empirical analysis of the changes in the spatiotemporal pattern, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of typical landscape types over the period from 1987 to 2013. The statistical results derived from landscape pattern indices (LPIs) showed that during the investigation period, three natural wetland landscape types (i.e., Spartina alterniflora, Suaeda glauca, and Phragmites australis) showed gradually increased fragmentation in the study area. The ecological vulnerability scores of the major landscape types (in descending order) were P. australis (0.053), farmland (0.047), S. alterniflora (0.042), S. glauca (0.031), and bare mud flat (0.002). The results derived from the ecosystem service value fluctuation index (ESVFI) showed that from 1987 to 1997, the value of the ecosystem services provided by S. glauca and P. australis wetlands decreased, whereas that of S. alterniflora wetlands increased continuously. From 2002 to 2013, the value of the ecosystem services provided by all three types of natural wetland showed a downward trend. In conclusion, the combined effects of human and natural factors, including the expansion of farmland and the invasion of S. alterniflora, and changes in seawater erosion and deposition led to changes in the landscape patterns, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of the Yancheng Nature Reserve during the investigation period. The results indicate that a "dual adaptive" management system based on natural succession and supplemented by appropriate manual intervention should be implemented, and the management efficiency and flexibility should be improved to meet the common needs of biodiversity conservation and economic development.

AB Disturbances are a major determinant of forest carbon stocks and uptake. They generally reduce land carbon stocks but also initiate a regrowth legacy that contributes substantially to the contemporary rate of carbon stock increase in US forestlands. As managers and policy makers increasingly look to forests for climate protection and mitigation, and because of increasing concern about changes in disturbance intensity and frequency, there is a need for synthesis and integration of current understanding about the role of disturbances and other processes in governing forest carbon cycle dynamics, and the likely future of this and other sinks for atmospheric carbon. This paper aims to address that need by providing a quantitative review of the distribution, extent and carbon impacts of the major disturbances active in the US. We also review recent trends in disturbances, climate, and other global environmental changes and consider their individual and collective contributions to the US carbon budget now and in the likely future. Lastly, we identify some key challenges and opportunities for future research needed to improve current understanding, advance predictive capabilities, and inform forest management in the face of these pressures.
   Harvest is found to be the most extensive disturbance both in terms of area and carbon impacts, followed by fire, windthrow and bark beetles, and lastly droughts. Collectively these lead to the gross loss of about 200 Tg C y(-1) in live biomass annually across the conterminous US. At the same time, the net change in forest carbon stocks is positive (190 Tg C y(-1)), indicating not only forest resilience but also an apparently large response to growth enhancements such as fertilization by CO2 and nitrogen. Uncertainty about disturbance legacies, disturbance interactions, likely trends, and global change factors make the future of the US forest carbon sink unclear. While there is scope for management to enhance carbon sinks in US forests, tradeoffs with other values and uses are likely to significantly limit practical implementation. Continued and expanded remote sensing and field-based monitoring capabilities and manipulative experimentation are needed to improve understanding of the US forest carbon sink, and assess how disturbance processes are responding to the pressures of global environmental change. In addition, continued development and application of holistic, decision support tools that consider a range of forest values are needed to enable managers and policy makers to use the best available information for guiding forest resources now and into the future.

AB The evolutionary mechanisms generating the tremendous biodiversity of islands have long fascinated evolutionary biologists. Genetic drift and divergent selection are predicted to be strong on islands and both could drive population divergence and speciation. Alternatively, strong genetic drift may preclude adaptation. We conducted a genomic analysis to test the roles of genetic drift and divergent selection in causing genetic differentiation among populations of the island fox (Urocyon littoralis). This species consists of six subspecies, each of which occupies a different California Channel Island. Analysis of 5293 SNP loci generated using Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing found support for genetic drift as the dominant evolutionary mechanism driving population divergence among island fox populations. In particular, populations had exceptionally low genetic variation, small N-e (range = 2.1-89.7; median = 19.4), and significant genetic signatures of bottlenecks. Moreover, islands with the lowest genetic variation (and, by inference, the strongest historical genetic drift) were most genetically differentiated from mainland grey foxes, and vice versa, indicating genetic drift drives genome-wide divergence. Nonetheless, outlier tests identified 3.6-6.6% of loci as high F-ST outliers, suggesting that despite strong genetic drift, divergent selection contributes to population divergence. Patterns of similarity among populations based on high FST outliers mirrored patterns based on morphology, providing additional evidence that outliers reflect adaptive divergence. Extremely low genetic variation and small Ne in some island fox populations, particularly on San Nicolas Island, suggest that they may be vulnerable to fixation of deleterious alleles, decreased fitness and reduced adaptive potential.

AB Niche and neutral processes drive community assembly and metacommunity dynamics, but their relative importance might vary with the spatial scale. The contribution of niche processes is generally expected to increase with increasing spatial extent at a higher rate than that of neutral processes. However, the extent to what community composition is limited by dispersal (usually considered a neutral process) over increasing spatial scales might depend on the dispersal capacity of composing species. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the distribution and diversity of species known to have great powers of dispersal (hundreds of kilometres), we analysed the relative importance of niche processes and dispersal limitation in determining beta-diversity patterns of aquatic plants and cladocerans over regional (up to 300 km) and continental (up to 3300 km) scales. Both taxonomic groups were surveyed in five different European regions and presented extremely high levels of beta-diversity, both within and among regions. High beta-diversity was primarily explained by species replacement (turnover) rather than differences in species richness (i.e. nestedness). Abiotic and biotic variables were the main drivers of community composition. Within some regions, small-scale connectivity and the spatial configuration of sampled communities explained a significant, though smaller, fraction of compositional variation, particularly for aquatic plants. At continental scale (among regions), a significant fraction of compositional variation was explained by a combination of spatial effects (exclusive contribution of regions) and regionally-structured environmental variables. Our results suggest that, although dispersal limitation might affect species composition in some regions, aquatic plant and cladoceran communities are not generally limited by dispersal at the regional scale (up to 300 km). Species sorting mediated by environmental variation might explain the high species turnover of aquatic plants and cladocerans at regional scale, while biogeographic processes enhanced by dispersal limitation among regions might determine the composition of regional biotas.

AB Rationale: Improved understanding of the lung microbiome in HIV-infected individuals could lead to better strategies for diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis of HIV-associated pneumonias. Differences in the oral and lung microbiomes in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals are not well defined. Whether highly active antiretroviral therapy influences these microbiomes is unclear.
   Objectives: We determined whether oral and lung microbiomes differed in clinically healthy groups of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects.
   Methods: Participating sites in the Lung HIV Microbiome Project contributed bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing data from oral washes and bronchoalveolar lavages(BALs) obtained from HIV-uninfected individuals (n = 86), HIV-infected individuals who were treatment naive (n = 18), and HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (n = 38).
   Measurements and Main Results: Microbial populations differed in the oral washes among the subject groups (Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Rothia, and Atopobium), but there were no individual taxa that differed among the BALs. Comparison of oral washes and BALs demonstrated similar patterns from HIV-uninfected individuals and HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, with multiple taxa differing in abundance. The pattern observed from HIV-infected individuals who were treatment naive differed from the other two groups, with differences limited to Veillonella, Rothia, and Granulicatella. CD4 cell counts did not influence the oral or BAL microbiome in these relatively healthy, HIV-infected subjects.
   Conclusions: The overall similarity of the microbiomes in participants with and without HIV infection was unexpected, because HIV-infected individuals with relatively preserved CD4 cell counts are at higher risk for lower respiratory tract infections, indicating impaired local immune function.

AB Hundreds of experiments have now manipulated species richness (SR) of various groups of organisms and examined how this aspect of biological diversity influences ecosystem functioning. Ecologists have recently expanded this field to look at whether phylogenetic diversity (PD) among species, often quantified as the sum of branch lengths on a molecular phylogeny leading to all species in a community, also predicts ecological function. Some have hypothesized that phylogenetic divergence should be a superior predictor of ecological function than SR because evolutionary relatedness represents the degree of ecological and functional differentiation among species. But studies to date have provided mixed support for this hypothesis. Here, we reanalyse data from 16 experiments that have manipulated plant SR in grassland ecosystems and examined the impact on above-ground biomass production over multiple time points. Using a new molecular phylogeny of the plant species used in these experiments, we quantified how the PD of plants impacts average community biomass production as well as the stability of community biomass production through time. Using four complementary analyses, we show that, after statistically controlling for variation in SR, PD (the sum of branches in a molecular phylogenetic tree connecting all species in a community) is neither related to mean community biomass nor to the temporal stability of biomass. These results run counter to past claims. However, after controlling for SR, PD was positively related to variation in community biomass over time due to an increase in the variances of individual species, but this relationship was not strong enough to influence community stability. In contrast to the non-significant relationships between PD, biomass and stability, our analyses show that SR per se tends to increase the mean biomass production of plant communities, after controlling for PD. The relationship between SR and temporal variation in community biomass was either positive, non-significant or negative depending on which analysis was used. However, the increases in community biomass with SR, independently of PD, always led to increased stability. These results suggest that PD is no better as a predictor of ecosystem functioning than SR.Synthesis. Our study on grasslands offers a cautionary tale when trying to relate PD to ecosystem functioning suggesting that there may be ecologically important trait and functional variation among species that is not explained by phylogenetic relatedness. Our results fail to support the hypothesis that the conservation of evolutionarily distinct species would be more effective than the conservation of SR as a way to maintain productive and stable communities under changing environmental conditions.

AB Rationale: Microbiome studies typically focus on bacteria, but fungal species are Common in many body sites and can have profound effects on the host. Wide gaps exist in the understanding of the fungal microbiome (mycobiome) and its relationship to lung disease.
   Objectives: To characterize the mycobiome at different respiratory tract levels in persons with and without HIV infection and in HIV-infected individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Methods: Oral washes (OW), induced sputa (IS), and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were collected from 56 participants. We performed 18S and internal transcribed spacer sequencing and used the neutral model to identify fungal species that are likely residents of the lung. We used ubiquity ubiquity plots, random forest, logistic regression, and metastats to compare fungal communities by HIV status and presence of COPD.
   Measurements and Main Results: Mycobiomes of OW, IS, and BAL shared common organisms, but each also had distinct members. Candida was dominant in OW and IS, but BAL had 39 fungal species that were disproportionately more abundant than in the OW. Fungal communities in BAL differed significantly by HIV status and by COPD, with Pneumocystis jirovecii significantly overrepresented in both groups. Other fungal species were also identified as differing in HIV and COPD.
   Conclusions: This study systematically examined the respiratory tract mycobiome in a relatively large group. By identifying Pneumocystis and other fungal species as overrepresented in the lung in HIV and in COPD, it is the first to determine alterations in fungal communities associated with lung dysfunction and/or HIV, highlighting the clinical relevance of these findings.

   FACTOR; GREEN-ALGAE; GENOME; POTASSIUM; GENE; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS
AB The effective development of salt tolerant crops requires an understanding that the evolution of halophytes, glycophytes and our major grain crops has involved significantly different processes. Halophytes (and other edaphic endemics) generally arose through colonization of habitats in severe disequilibrium by pre-adapted individuals, rather than by gradual adaptation from populations of glycophytes'. Glycophytes, by contrast, occur in low sodium ecosystems, where sodium was and is the major limiting nutrient in herbivore diets, suggesting that their evolution reflects the fact that low sodium individuals experienced lower herbivory and had higher fitness. For domestication/evolution of crop plants, the selective pressure was human imposed and involved humans co-opting functions of defense and reproductive security. Unintended consequences of this included loss of tolerance to various stresses and loss of the genetic variability needed to correct that. Understanding, combining and manipulating all three modes of evolution are now critical to the development of salt tolerant crops, particularly those that will offer food security in countries with few economic resources and limited infrastructure. Such efforts will require exploiting the genetic structures of recently evolved halophytes, the genetic variability of model plants, and endemic halophytes and minor' crops that already exist.

AB Pacific red lionfish Pterois volitans, introduced to Atlantic waters in the 1980s, represent a particularly successful invasive marine predator with strong effects on native prey. Previous experiments examining the effects of lionfish on native fish communities have been conducted on small patch reefs. However, the effects of lionfish on native reef-fish communities over larger spatial scales-scales at which conservation and management efforts are typically applied-have not been examined experimentally. Beginning in June 2009, I conducted a large-scale field experiment near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. Ten large (1400 to 4000 m(2)) coral reefs were paired based on location and similarity of habitat, and baseline surveys of their fish communities were conducted. Quarterly removals of lionfish were then conducted on 1 reef in each pair, while the densities of lionfish on the other reefs were standardized at typical post-invasion levels. Through August 2010, quarterly surveys showed that lionfish caused significant changes in native reef-fish communities, including reductions in the total density (up to 46.3 +/- 13.7%, mean +/- SEM), biomass (31.9 +/- 10.7%), and species richness (21.4 +/- 9.1%) of prey-sized fishes (all individuals <10 cm total length). Lionfish also caused substantial reductions in the biomass of prey-sized herbivorous fishes (33.9 +/- 16.0%) and piscivores (98.6 +/- 39.5%). However, these negative effects on small fish did not translate to observable declines in a larger size-class (all individuals 10 to 20 cm total length) over the 14 mo study period.

AB Developmental plasticity has been proposed to facilitate phenotypic diversification in plants and animals, but the macroevolutionary potential of plastic traits remains to be objectively tested. We studied the evolution of feeding structures in a group of 90 nematodes, including Caenorhabditis elegans, some species of which have evolved a mouthpart polyphenism, moveable teeth, and predatory feeding. Comparative analyses of shape and form, using geometric morphometrics, and of structural complexity revealed a rapid process of diversification associated with developmental plasticity. First, dimorphism was associated with a sharp increase in complexity and elevated evolutionary rates, represented by a radiation of feeding-forms with structural novelties. Second, the subsequent assimilation of a single phenotype coincided with a decrease in mouthpart complexity but an even stronger increase in evolutionary rates. Our results suggest that a macroevolutionary "pulse" of plasticity promotes novelties and, even after the secondary fixation of phenotypes, permits sustained rapid exploration of morphospace.

AB Climate change is altering the species composition, structure, and function of vegetation in natural terrestrial ecosystems. These changes can also impact the essential ecosystem goods and services derived from these ecosystems. Following disturbances, remote-sensing datasets have been used to monitor the disturbance and describe antecedent conditions as a means of understanding vulnerability to change. To a lesser extent, they have also been used to predict when desired ecosystems are vulnerable to degradation or loss. In this paper, we review studies that have applied remote sensing imagery to characterize vegetation vulnerability in both retrospective and prospective modes. We first review vulnerability research in natural terrestrial ecosystems including temperate forests, tropical forests, boreal forests, semi-arid lands, coastal areas, and the arctic. We then evaluate whether remote sensing can evaluate vulnerability sufficiently in advance of future events in order to allow the implementation of mitigation strategies, or whether it can only describe antecedent conditions a posteriori. The majority of existing research has evaluated vulnerability retrospectively, but key studies highlight the considerable potential for the development of early warnings of future vulnerability. We conclude that future research needs to focus on the development of a greater number of remotely sensed metrics to be used in a prospective mode in assessing vulnerability of terrestrial vegetation under change.

AB The symbiosis between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and plants is evolutionarily widespread. The response of plant growth to inoculation by these fungi (mycorrhizal growth response; MGR) is highly variable, ranging from positive to negative. Some of this variation is hypothesized to be associated with root structure and function. Specifically, species with a coarse root architecture, and thus a limited intrinsic capacity to absorb soil nutrients, are expected to derive the greatest growth benefit from inoculation with AM fungi.
   To test this hypothesis, previously published literature and phylogenetic information were combined in a meta-analysis to examine the magnitude and direction of relationships among several root architectural traits and MGR.
   Published studies differed in the magnitude and direction of relationships between root architecture and MGR. However, when combined, the overall relationship between MGR and allocation to roots, root diameter, root hair length and root hair density did not differ significantly from zero.
   These findings indicate that possessing coarse roots is not necessarily a predictor of plant growth response to AM fungal colonization. Root architecture is therefore unlikely to limit the evolution of variation in MGR.

AB Aim The species-area relationship (SAR) is widely used in conservation science to predict the number of species likely to go extinct as a result of habitat loss. Often, studies employing the SAR use total species richness as the dependent variable. However, this overlooks the fact that habitat specialists and generalists differ in their susceptibility to habitat loss. We undertook a synthetic review of 23 habitat island datasets for birds to determine the impact of habitat generalists on the SAR.
   Location Global.
   Methods We sourced 19 habitat island datasets from the literature and combined these data with four of our own empirically gathered datasets. For each dataset, we classified all bird species as either forest habitat specialists or generalists. We then fitted the power SAR model (log-log and nonlinear forms) to the specialists, generalists and all species for each dataset and compared the resulting model parameters. We compared differences in the rate of change in richness with area between specialists and generalists using the first derivative of a multimodel SAR.
   Results We found that the slope of the power model was steeper for habitat specialists in the majority of datasets, and this difference was significant in 15 and 16 of the 23 datasets, for the nonlinear and log-log forms of the power model, respectively. Comparison of the multimodel SAR curve derivatives revealed further differences in the rate of change in species richness with area between subsets.
   Main conclusions The z values of both forms of the power model of the specialists' SARs were generally larger, often considerably so, than the values used in most SAR studies predicting extinctions from habitat loss. Thus, studies that have used z values derived from SAR studies using total richness may be underestimating the impact of habitat loss on specialist species, which are likely to be those of greatest conservation concern.

AB Our knowledge of Glomeromycotan fungi rests largely on studies of cultured isolates. However, these isolates probably comprise one life-history strategy - ruderal. Consequently, our knowledge of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may be biased towards fungi that occur primarily in disturbed habitats and associate with disturbance-tolerant host plants. We can expect to see a signal for this in DNA-based community surveys: human-impacted habitats and cultivated plants should yield a higher proportion of AM fungal species that have been cultured compared with natural habitats and wild plants.
   Using the MaarjAM database (a curated open-access database of Glomeromycotan sequences), we performed a meta-analysis on studies that described AM fungal communities from a variety of habitats and host plants.
   We found a greater proportion of cultured AM fungal taxa in human-impacted habitats. In particular, undisturbed forests and grasslands/savannahs contained significantly fewer cultured taxa than human-impacted sites. We also found that wild plants hosted fewer cultured fungal taxa than cultivated plants.
   Our data show that natural communities of AM fungi are composed largely of uncultured taxa, and this is particularly pronounced in natural habitats and wild plants. We are better poised to understand the functioning of AM symbioses associated with cultivated plants and human-impacted habitats.

AB Peatlands have been recognised as globally important carbon sinks over long timescales that produced a global, net-climatic cooling effect over the Holocene. However, little is known about the role of tropical peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We therefore determine the past rates of carbon storage and release in the Indonesian peatlands of Kalimantan and Sumatra the largest global concentration of tropical peatlands since 20 ka (kiloannum before present). Using a novel GIS (geographic information system) approach we provide a spatially-explicit reconstruction of peatland expansion in a series of paleogeographic maps.
   Sea-level change is identified as the principal driver for peatland formation and expansion in western Indonesia as it controls both atmospheric moisture supply and the hydrological gradient on the islands. Initiation of inland peatlands in Kalimantan was coupled to periods of rapid deglacial sea-level rise with rates of over 10 mm yr(-1) whereas coastal peatlands could only form after 7 ka when the rate of sea-level rise had slowed to 2.4 mm yr(-1). Falling sea levels after 5 ka led to rapid peatland expansion in coastal lowlands and a doubling of the total peatland area in western Indonesia to 131,500 km(2) between 2.3 ka and 0 ka. As a result of slow peatland expansion from 15 to 6 ka and rapid expansion afterwards the rate of annual carbon storage of all western Indonesian peatlands remained <1 Tg C yr(-1) until 6 ka and then increased to 7.2 Tg C yr(-1) by 0 ka. Associated with this rise in carbon storage was an exponential growth of the peat carbon pool from 0.01 Pg C by 15 ka to 23.2 Pg C at present, of which 70% is stored in coastal peatlands. In inland Kalimantan peatlands, falling sea levels together with increased El Nino activity induced an annual carbon release of 0.15 Tg C yr(-1) from aerobic peat decay since 2 ka. Cumulative carbon losses from anaerobic decomposition do not seem to limit peat bog growth in the tropical peatlands of Indonesia. Carbon losses from Holocene peat fires are only known from the Kutai basin since 4.4 Ka with an associated release of 0.1-3.6 Tg C per fire event, which never surpassed the contemporaneous annual C storage. The peatlands of western Indonesia were thus a persistent carbon sink since 15 ka but this sink was of global importance only over the past 2000 years when it likely contributed to a slower growth in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Currently, annual losses of carbon from peat drainage and fires are on average 28 times higher than the pre-disturbance rate of uptake implying that this carbon reservoir has recently switched from being a net carbon sink to a significant source of atmospheric carbon and is currently in danger of eradication.

AB Heteromorphic sex chromosomes have originated independently in many species, and a common feature of their evolution is the degeneration of the Y chromosome, characterized by a loss of gene content and function. Despite being of broad significance to our understanding of sex chromosome evolution, the genetic changes that occur during the early stages of Y-chromosome degeneration are poorly understood, especially in plants. Here, we investigate sex chromosome evolution in the dioecious plant Rumex hastatulus, in which X and Y chromosomes have evolved relatively recently and occur in two distinct systems: an ancestral XX/XY system and a derived XX/XY1Y2 system. This polymorphism provides a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of sex chromosome age on patterns of divergence and gene degeneration within a species. Despite recent suppression of recombination and low X-Y divergence in both systems, we find evidence that Y-linked genes have started to undergo gene loss, causing similar to 28% and similar to 8% hemizygosity of the ancestral and derived X chromosomes, respectively. Furthermore, genes remaining on Y chromosomes have accumulated more amino acid replacements, contain more unpreferred changes in codon use, and exhibit significantly reduced gene expression compared with their X-linked alleles, with the magnitude of these effects being greatest for older sex-linked genes. Our results provide evidence for reduced selection efficiency and ongoing Y-chromosome degeneration in a flowering plant, and indicate that Y degeneration can occur soon after recombination suppression between sex chromosomes.

AB By coupling synoptic data from a basin-wide assessment of streamwater chemistry with network-based geostatistical analysis, we show that spatial processes differentially affect biogeochemical condition and pattern across a headwater stream network. We analyzed a high-resolution dataset consisting of 664 water samples collected every 100 m throughout 32 tributaries in an entire fifth-order stream network. These samples were analyzed for an exhaustive suite of chemical constituents. The fine grain and broad extent of this study design allowed us to quantify spatial patterns over a range of scales by using empirical semivariograms that explicitly incorporated network topology. Here, we show that spatial structure, as determined by the characteristic shape of the semivariograms, differed both among chemical constituents and by spatial relationship (flow-connected, flow-unconnected, or Euclidean). Spatial structure was apparent at either a single scale or at multiple nested scales, suggesting separate processes operating simultaneously within the stream network and surrounding terrestrial landscape. Expected patterns of spatial dependence for flow-connected relationships (e.g., increasing homogeneity with downstream distance) occurred for some chemical constituents (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, sulfate, and aluminum) but not for others (e.g., nitrate, sodium). By comparing semivariograms for the different chemical constituents and spatial relationships, we were able to separate effects on streamwater chemistry of (i) fine-scale versus broad-scale processes and (ii) in-stream processes versus landscape controls. These findings provide insight on the hierarchical scaling of local, longitudinal, and landscape processes that drive biogeochemical patterns in stream networks.

AB Landscape graphs are now widely used for representing and analysing ecological networks. Although several studies have provided methodological syntheses of how to use these tools to quantify functional connectivity, it is still unclear how landscape graphs can be used for decision support in land planning. This paper outlines the different types of application that may provide relevant responses to the main questions arising in land planning about ecological networks. Three approaches are distinguished according to their objective: (1) to support prioritisation within an ecological network from a conservationist perspective; (2) to increase connectivity by identifying the best locations for adding new elements to the network, either when starting from the current state of the network or when seeking to mitigate the barrier effect engendered by a development project; (3) to assess the potential impact of a development project in terms of decreased connectivity. The computations based on connectivity metrics are explained for each of these three approaches. Then each approach is illustrated in the context of a pond network near the town of Belfort, in eastern France. The results show how the same connectivity metric used in the different approaches may serve different purposes. This emphasises the potential value of landscape graphs for the land-planning decision-support process and not just for conservation purposes (i.e. prioritisation). (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Abiotic filtering is a major driver of gradients in the structure and functioning of ecosystems from the tropics to the poles. It is thus likely that environmental filtering is an important assembly process at the transition of biogeographical zones where many species occur at their range limits. Shifts in species abundances and association patterns along environmental gradients can be indicative of environmental filtering, which is predicted to be stronger in areas of high abiotic stress and to promote increased similarity of ecological characteristics among co-occurring species. Here we test these hypotheses for scleractinian corals along a broad latitudinal gradient in high-latitude eastern Australia, where corals occur at the margins of their ranges and environmental tolerances. We quantify variation in taxonomic, zoogeographic, and functional patterns combined with null model approaches and demonstrate systematic spatial variation in community structure and significant covariance of species abundance distributions and functional characteristics along the latitudinal gradient. We describe a strong biogeographic transition zone, consistent with patterns expected under abiotic filtering, whereby species are sorted along the latitudinal gradient according to their tolerances for marginal reef conditions. High-latitude coastal reefs are typified by widely distributed, generalist, stress-tolerant coral species with massive and horizontally spreading morphologies and by diminishing influence of tropical taxa at higher latitudes and closer to the mainland. Higher degree of ecological similarity among co-occurring species than expected by chance supports the environmental filtering hypothesis. Among individual traits, the structural traits corallite size and colony morphology were filtered most strongly, suggesting that characteristics linked to energy acquisition and physical stability may be particularly important for coral survival in high-latitude environments. These findings highlight interspecific differences and species interactions with the environment as key drivers of community organization in biogeographic transition zones and support the hypothesis that environmental filters play a stronger role than biotic interactions in structuring ecological communities in areas of high abiotic stress.

AB Changes in land use, land cover, and land management present some of the greatest potential global environmental challenges of the 21st century. Urbanization, one of the principal drivers of these transformations, is commonly thought to be generating land changes that are increasingly similar. An implication of this multiscale homogenization hypothesis is that the ecosystem structure and function and human behaviors associated with urbanization should be more similar in certain kinds of urbanized locations across biogeophysical gradients than across urbanization gradients in places with similar biogeophysical characteristics. This paper introduces an analytical framework for testing this hypothesis, and applies the framework to the case of residential lawn care. This set of land management behaviors are often assumed-not demonstrated-to exhibit homogeneity. Multivariate analyses are conducted on telephone survey responses from a geographically stratified random sample of homeowners (n = 9,480), equally distributed across six US metropolitan areas. Two behaviors are examined: lawn fertilizing and irrigating. Limited support for strong homogenization is found at two scales (i.e., multi- and single-city; 2 of 36 cases), but significant support is found for homogenization at only one scale (22 cases) or at neither scale (12 cases). These results suggest that US lawn care behaviors are more differentiated in practice than in theory. Thus, even if the biophysical outcomes of urbanization are homogenizing, managing the associated sustainability implications may require a multiscale, differentiated approach because the underlying social practices appear relatively varied. The analytical approach introduced here should also be productive for other facets of urban-ecological homogenization.

AB AimTo test the Eltonian noise hypothesis (ENH), that biotic interactions do not affect species distributions at large geographical scales.
   LocationThe Brazilian cerrado, a central South American savanna and biodiversity hotspot.
   MethodsWe modelled the distributions of 11 species of cerrado parrots using the software Maxent at four different spatial resolutions. We built models using abiotic variables, biotic variables (distribution of diet resources) and models combining abiotic and biotic variables. We compared model performance using the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), retrieved from test data. We partitioned the variance between sets of predictors using a generalized linear model (GLM). Finally, we evaluated whether improvement in model performance (higher AUC values) in models with both abiotic and biotic variables, was related to the species' dietary niche breadth and/or spatial resolution of the models.
   ResultsWe found that model performance was improved in most cases by the addition of biotic variables. Our variance-partitioning approach revealed that abiotic and biotic variables contribute independently to the final model. We found no relationship between model improvement and spatial resolution. We also found no relationship between dietary niche breadth and model improvement, indicating that dietary generalist and specialist species were not differently affected by the inclusion of biotic variables in the models.
   Main conclusionsOur results did not support the ENH. In this study, we explicitly incorporated a biotic variable (diet resource distribution) into species distribution models (SDMs), and we showed that these variables generally improve models and have independent contributions. These results agree with previous studies that incorporated biotic variables into SDMs. Ultimately, our results indicate that SDMs performed with abiotic variables only may depict only a partial representation of the geographical distribution of a species.

AB The rapid expansion of global urban development is increasing opportunities for wildlife to forage and become dependent on anthropogenic resources. Wildlife using urban areas are often perceived dichotomously as urban or not, with some individuals removed in the belief that dependency on anthropogenic resources is irreversible and can lead to increased human-wildlife conflict. For American black bears (Ursus americanus), little is known about the degree of bear urbanization and its ecological mechanisms to guide the management of human-bear conflicts. Using 6 years of GPS location and activity data from bears in Aspen, Colorado, USA, we evaluated the degree of bear urbanization and the factors that best explained its variations. We estimated space use, activity patterns, survival, and reproduction and modeled their relationship with ecological covariates related to bear characteristics and natural food availability. Space use and activity patterns were dependent on natural food availability (good or poor food years), where bears used higher human density areas and became more nocturnal in poor food years. Patterns were reversible, i.e., individuals using urban areas in poor food years used wildland areas in subsequent good food years. While reproductive output was similar across years, survival was lower in poor food years when bears used urban areas to a greater extent. Our findings suggest that bear use of urban areas is reversible and fluctuates with the availability of natural food resources, and that removal of urban individuals in times of food failures has the potential to negatively affect bear populations. Given that under current predictions urbanization is expected to increase by 11% across American black bear range, and that natural food failure years are expected to increase in frequency with global climate change, alternative methods of reducing urban human-bear conflict are required if the goal is to prevent urban areas from becoming population sinks.

AB Temperate-zone trees must fulfill cultivar-specific chilling and heat requirements during the dormant period, in order to produce leaves and flowers in the following growing season. Timing and accumulation rate of chill and heat are understood to determine the timing of spring events, but both processes are difficult to observe in dormant tree buds. Where long-term phenological observations are available, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression offers a statistical opportunity to delineate phases of chill and heat accumulation and determine the climatic requirements of trees. This study uses PLS regression to explore how the timing of spring events of chestnut in China, cherry in Germany and walnut in California is related to variation in the daily rates of chill and heat accumulation, as calculated with horticultural models. Dependent variables were 39 years of flowering dates for chestnuts in Beijing (China), 25 years of cherry bloom in Klein-Altendorf (Germany) and 54 years of walnut leaf emergence in Davis (California, USA). These were related to daily accumulation rates of chill, calculated with the Dynamic Model, and heat, calculated with the Growing Degree Hours Model. Compared to an earlier version of the procedure, in which phenological dates were related to unprocessed temperature data, delineation of chilling and forcing phases was much clearer when using horticultural metrics to quantify chill and heat. Chestnut bloom in the cold-winter climate of Beijing was found to depend primarily on the rate of heat accumulation, while cherry bloom in the temperate climate of Germany showed dependence on both chill and heat accumulation rates. The timing of walnut leaf emergence in the mild-winter climate of California depended much more strongly on chill accumulation rates. Chilling (in Chill Portions = CP) and heat (in Growing Degree Hours = GDH) requirements determined based on PLS regression were 79.8 +/- 5.3 CP and 13,466 +/- 1918 GDH for chestnut bloom in Beijing, 104.2 +/- 8.9 CP and 2698 +/- 1183 GDH for cherry bloom in Germany, and 37.5 +/- 5.0 CP and 11,245 +/- 1697 GDH for walnut leaf emergence in California. Spring phases of cherry in Klein-Altendorf and especially chestnut in Beijing will likely continue to advance in response to global warming, while for walnut in California, inadequate chilling may cause delays in flowering and leaf emergence. Such delays could serve as an early-warning indicator that future productivity may be threatened by climate change. The R package 'chillR' makes the method used in this study available for wider use.

AB Adaptive radiations present fascinating opportunities for studying the evolutionary process. Most cases come from isolated lakes or islands, where unoccupied ecological space is filled through novel adaptations. Here, we describe an unusual example of an adaptive radiation: symbiotic mussels that colonized island-like chemosynthetic environments such as hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and sunken organic substrates on the vast deep-sea floor. Our time-calibrated molecular phylogeny suggests that the group originated and acquired sulfur-oxidizing symbionts in the Late Cretaceous, possibly while inhabiting organic substrates and long before its major radiation in the Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene. The first appearance of intracellular and methanotrophic symbionts was detected only after this major radiation. Thus, contrary to expectations, the major radiation may have not been triggered by the evolution of novel types of symbioses. We hypothesize that environmental factors, such as increased habitat availability and/or increased dispersal capabilities, sparked the radiation. Intracellular and methanotrophic symbionts were acquired in several independent lineages and marked the onset of a second wave of diversification at vents and seeps. Changes in habitat type resulted in adaptive trends in shell lengths (related to the availability of space and energy, and physiological trade-offs) and in the successive colonization of greater water depths.

AB Climatic change is anticipated to alter disturbance regimes for many ecosystems. Among the most important effects are changes in the frequency, size, and intensity of wildfires. Serotiny (long-term canopy storage and the heat-induced release of seeds) is a fire-resilience mechanism found in many globally important terrestrial ecosystems. Life-history traits and physiographic differences in ecosystems lead to variation in serotiny; therefore, some systems may exhibit greater resilience to shifting disturbances than others do. We present a conceptual framework to explore the consequences of changing disturbance regimes (such as mean and variance in fire severity or return intervals) to serotinous species and ecosystems and implications of altered serotinous resilience at local and regional scales. Four case studies are presented, and areas needing further research are highlighted. These studies illustrate that, despite the reputed fire resilience of serotiny, more fire does not necessarily mean more serotinous species across all systems in which they occur.

AB The choice of an appropriate allometric model is a critical step in reducing uncertainties in forest biomass stock estimates. With large greenhouse gases emissions due to deforestation, a systematic assessment and comparison of the models available in Indonesia is crucial for accurate assessments of forest carbon stocks and implementing REDD+ projects. In the present study, we compared the ability of two regional and two generic (pantropical) allometric models to estimate biomass at both tree and plot levels. We showed that regional models had lower performance in estimating tree biomass, with greater bias (-31-8%) and higher AIC (177-204), compared to generic models (bias: 2-2%; AIC: 57-67). At the plot level, the regional models underestimated biomass stocks by 0-40% compared to the best generic model. The error in plot biomass stocks associated to models relying solely upon DBH ranged between 5 and +15%. The integration of tree height estimated regionally resulted in an overestimate of 5-10% in unmanaged forests. Despite the difficulty to accurately assess tree heights in tropical forests, integrating all or part of them in biomass assessment can reduce uncertainties. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Many alpine and subalpine plant species exhibit phenological advancements in association with earlier snowmelt. While the phenology of some plant species does not advance beyond a threshold snowmelt date, the prevalence of such threshold phenological responses within plant communities is largely unknown. We therefore examined the shape of flowering phenology responses (linear versus nonlinear) to climate using two long-term datasets from plant communities in snow-dominated environments: Gothic, CO, USA (19742011) and Zackenberg, Greenland (1996-2011). For a total of 64 species, we determined whether a linear or nonlinear regression model best explained interannual variation in flowering phenology in response to increasing temperatures and advancing snowmelt dates. The most common nonlinear trend was for species to flower earlier as snowmelt advanced, with either no change or a slower rate of change when snowmelt was early (average 20% of cases). By contrast, some species advanced their flowering at a faster rate over the warmest temperatures relative to cooler temperatures (average 5% of cases). Thus, some species seem to be approaching their limits of phenological change in response to snowmelt but not temperature. Such phenological thresholds could either be a result of minimum springtime photoperiod cues for flowering or a slower rate of adaptive change in flowering time relative to changing climatic conditions.

AB Disturbances are natural features of ecosystems that promote variability in the community and ultimately maintain diversity. Although it is recognized that global change will affect environmental disturbance regimes, our understanding of the community dynamics governing ecosystem recovery and the maintenance of functional diversity in future scenarios is very limited. Here, we use one of the few ecosystems naturally exposed to future scenarios of environmental change to examine disturbance and recovery dynamics. We examine the recovery patterns of marine species from a physical disturbance across different acidification regimes caused by volcanic CO2 vents. Plots of shallow rocky reef were cleared of all species in areas of ambient, low, and extreme low pH that correspond to near-future and extreme scenarios for ocean acidification. Our results illustrate how acidification decreases the variability of communities, resulting in homogenization and reduced functional diversity at a landscape scale. Whereas the recovery trajectories in ambient pH were highly variable and resulted in a diverse range of assemblages, recovery was more predictable with acidification and consistently resulted in very similar algal-dominated assemblages. Furthermore, low pH zones had fewer signs of biological disturbance (primarily sea urchin grazing) and increased recovery rates of the dominant taxa (primarily fleshy algae). Together, our results highlight how environmental change can cause ecosystem simplification via environmentally mediated changes in community dynamics in the near future, with cascading impacts on functional diversity and ecosystem function.

AB Background The four common soil-transmitted helminth species Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and the two hookworm species Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus are endemic in South America, but their distribution, infection prevalence, and regional burden are poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the risk and number of people infected with A lumbricoides, T trichiura, and hookworm across South America.
   Methods We did a systematic review of reports on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection in South America published up to May 14,2012. We extracted and georeferenced relevant survey data and did a meta-analysis of the data to assess the geographical distribution of the infection risk with Bayesian geostatistical models. We used advanced Bayesian variable selection to identify environmental determinants that govern the distribution of soil-transmitted helminth infections.
   Findings We screened 4085 scientific papers and identified 174 articles containing relevant survey prevalence data. We georeferenced 6948 survey locations and entered the data into the open-access Global Neglected Tropical Diseases database. Survey data were sparse for the south of the continent and for the western coast, and we identified no relevant information for Uruguay and little data for smaller countries such as Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, and Ecuador. Population-adjusted prevalence of infection with A lumbricoides was 15.6%, with T trichiura was 12.5%, and with hookworm was 11.9% from 2005 onwards. Risks of contracting soil-transmitted helminth infection have substantially reduced since 2005 (odds ratio 0.47 [95% Bayesian credible interval 0.46-0.47] for A lumbricoides, 0.54 [0.54-0.55] for T trichiura, and 0-58 [0-58-0-59] for hookworm infection).
   Interpretation Our findings offer important baseline support for spatial targeting of soil-transmitted helminthiasis control, and suggest that more information about the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection is needed, especially in countries in which we estimate prevalence of infection to be high but for which current data are scarce.

AB Patterns of interspecific introgression may vary geographically, and the distribution of introgressed variants can yield insight into the historical dynamics of genetic interactions between hybridizing species. Urodele amphibians, often characterized by limited mobility, deep intraspecific genetic structuring and vulnerability to climatic changes, constitute suitable models for such historical inferences. Here, we combine an extensive survey of the mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (15 microsatellites) genomes in the Carpathian newt, Lissotriton montandoni (Lm) with species distribution modelling (SDM). Populations of the smooth newt, L.vulgaris (Lv) from the areas surrounding the Lm range were also sampled to test whether gene flow between these hybridizing species extends beyond the area of strict syntopy. The extent of introgression differs dramatically between the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome. While multiple, spatially and temporally distinct introgression events from Lv resulted in complete mtDNA replacement in Lm, there was little evidence of recent interspecific nuclear gene flow in the assayed markers. Microsatellite differentiation within Lm defines three units, probably derived from separate glacial refugia, located in the northern, eastern and southern part of the Carpathians. In situ survival and range fragmentation of Lm are supported by SDM, corroborating the role of the Carpathians as a major refugial area. Our results, in combination with previous reports of extensive introgression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, emphasize the complexity of historical gene exchange between Lm and Lv.

AB Lost biomass of anadromous forage species resulting from the seventeenth to nineteenth century damming of waterways and from overharvest in the northeastern United States contributed to significant changes in coastal marine terrestrial ecosystems. Historic alewife populations in Maine for the years 1600-1900 were assessed using analyses of nineteenth and twentieth century harvest records and waterway obstruction records dating to the 1600s. Obstructed spawning access in nine watersheds reduced the annual alewife productivity per watershed to 0%-16% of virgin estimates, equaling a cumulative lost fisheries production of 11 billion fish from 1750 to 1900. Including preharvest production, our estimates suggest a lost flux of anadromous forage fish increasing from 10 million fish per year in 1700 to 1.4 billion annually by 1850. Our results suggest a realignment of current restoration goals is needed to recognize oceanic and freshwater ecosystem interdependence and the gap between current targets and potential productivity

AB Cell wall fibre and lamina density may interactively affect leaf toughness and leaf lifespan. Here, we tested this with seedlings of 24 neotropical tree species differing in shade tolerance and leaf lifespan under standardized field conditions (140867 d in gaps; longer in shade). We quantified toughness with a cutting test, explicitly seeking a mechanistic linkage to fibre.
   Lamina density, but not fracture toughness, exhibited a plastic response to gaps vs shade, while neither trait was affected by leaf age. Toughness corrected for lamina density, a recently recognized indicator of material strength per unit mass, was linearly correlated with cellulose content per unit dry mass.
   Leaf lifespan was positively correlated with cellulose and toughness in shade-tolerant species but only weakly in gap-dependent species. Leaf lifespan was uncorrelated with lamina thickness, phenolics and tannin concentrations. In path analysis including all species, leaf lifespan was directly enhanced by density and toughness, and indirectly by cellulose via its effect on toughness. Different suites of leaf traits were correlated with early seedling survival in gaps vs shade.
   In conclusion, cellulose and lamina density jointly enhance leaf fracture toughness, and these carbon-based physical traits, rather than phenolic-based defence, explain species differences in herbivory, leaf lifespan and shade survival.

AB We assessed whether (1) arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of roots (RC) and/or plant responses to arbuscular mycorrhizae (MR) vary with plant phylogeny and (2) MR and RC can be more accurately predicted with a phylogenetic predictor relative to a null model and models with plant trait and taxonomic predictors. In a previous study, MR and RC of 95 grassland species were measured. We constructed a phylogeny for these species and found it explained variation in MR and RC. Next, we used multiple regressions to identify the models that most accurately predicted plant MR. Models including either phylogenetic or phenotypic and taxonomic information similarly improved our ability to predict MR relative to a null model. Our study illustrates the complex evolutionary associations among species and constraints of using phylogenetic information, relative to plant traits, to predict how a plant species will interact with AMF.

AB Ecological theory suggests that spatial distribution of biodiversity is strongly driven by community assembly processes. Thus the study of diversity patterns combined with null model testing has become increasingly common to infer assembly processes from observed distributions of diversity indices. However, results in both empirical and simulation studies are inconsistent. The aim of our study is to determine with simulated data which facets of biodiversity, if any, may unravel the processes driving its spatial patterns, and to provide practical considerations about the combination of diversity indices that would produce significant and congruent signals when using null models. The study is based on simulated species assemblages that emerge under various landscape structures in a spatially explicit individual-based model with contrasting, predefined assembly processes. We focus on four assembly processes (species-sorting, mass effect, neutral dynamics and competition colonization trade-off) and investigate the emerging species distributions with varied diversity indices (alpha, beta and gamma) measured at different spatial scales and for different diversity facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We find that 1) the four assembly processes result in distinct spatial distributions of species under any landscape structure, 2) a broad range of diversity indices allows distinguishing between communities driven by different assembly processes, 3) null models provide congruent results only for a small fraction of diversity indices and 4) only a combination of these diversity indices allows identifying the correct assembly processes. Our study supports the inference of assembly processes from patterns of diversity only when different types of indices are combined. It highlights the need to combine phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic diversity indices at multiple spatial scales to effectively infer underlying assembly processes from diversity patterns by illustrating how combination of different indices might help disentangling the complex question of coexistence.

AB Among the statistical methods available to control for phylogenetic autocorrelation in ecological data, those based on eigenfunction analysis of the phylogenetic distance matrix among the species are becoming increasingly important tools. Here, we evaluate a range of criteria to select eigenvectors extracted from a phylogenetic distance matrix (using phylogenetic eigenvector regression, PVR) that can be used to measure the level of phylogenetic signal in ecological data and to study correlated evolution. We used a principal coordinate analysis to represent the phylogenetic relationships among 209 species of Carnivora by a series of eigenvectors, which were then used to model log-transformed body size. We first conducted a series of PVRs in which we increased the number of eigenvectors from 1 to 70, following the sequence of their associated eigenvalues. Second, we also investigated three non-sequential approaches based on the selection of 1) eigenvectors significantly correlated with body size, 2) eigenvectors selected by a standard stepwise algorithm, and 3) the combination of eigenvectors that minimizes the residual phylogenetic autocorrelation. We mapped the mean specific component of body size to evaluate how these selection criteria affect the interpretation of non-phylogenetic signal in Bergmann's rule. For comparison, the same patterns were analyzed using autoregressive model (ARM) and phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS). Despite the robustness of PVR to the specific approaches used to select eigenvectors, using a relatively small number of eigenvectors may be insufficient to control phylogenetic autocorrelation, leading to flawed conclusions about patterns and processes. The method that minimizes residual autocorrelation seems to be the best choice according to different criteria. Thus, our analyses show that, when the best criterion is used to control phylogenetic structure, PVR can be a valuable tool for testing hypotheses related to heritability at the species level, phylogenetic niche conservatism and correlated evolution between ecological traits.

AB Macroecology examines the relationship between organisms and their environment at large spatial (and temporal) scales. Typically, macroecologists explain the large-scale patterns of abundance, distribution and diversity. Despite the difficulties in sampling and characterizing microbial diversity, macroecologists have recently also been interested in unicellular organisms. Here, I review the current advances made in microbial macroecology, as well as discuss related ecosystem functions. Overall, it seems that microorganisms suit surprisingly well to known species abundance distributions and show positive relationship between distribution and adundance. Microbial species-area and distance-decay relationships tend to be weaker than for macroorganisms, but nonetheless significant. Few findings on altitudinal gradients in unicellular taxa seem to differ greatly from corresponding findings for larger taxa, whereas latitudinal gradients among microorganisms have either been clearly evident or absent depending on the context. Literature also strongly emphasizes the role of spatial scale for the patterns of diversity and suggests that patterns are affected by species traits as well as ecosystem characteristics. Finally, I discuss the large role of local biotic and abiotic variables driving the community assembly in unicellular taxa and eventually dictating how multiple ecosystem processes are performed. Present review highlights the fact that most microorganisms may not differ fundamentally from larger taxa in their large-scale distribution patterns. Yet, review also shows that many aspects of microbial macroecology are still relatively poorly understood and specific patterns depend on focal taxa and ecosystem concerned.

AB Tropical forests are important sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor of ozone. In tropical montane forests nitrogen limitation is common which affects both soil N2O and NO fluxes and forest productivity. Here we present evidence that forest productivity and N-oxide (N2O + NO) fluxes are linked through N availability along elevation and topographic gradients in tropical montane forests. We measured N-oxide fluxes, several indices of N availability, and forest productivity along an elevation gradient from 1000 m to 3000 m and along topographic gradients. Organic layer thickness of the soils increased and N availability decreased with increasing elevation and along the topographic gradient from the lower slope position to the ridges. Annual N2O fluxes ranged from -0.53 mu g(N)m(-2)h(-1) to 14.54 mu g(N)m(-2)h(-1) while NO fluxes ranged from -0.02 mu g(N)m(-2)h(-1) to 1.13 mu g(N)m(-2)h(-1). Both N-oxide fluxes and forest productivity increased with increasing N availability and showed close positive correlations with indices of N availability (C/N ratio and delta N-15 signature of litterfall). We interpret the close correlations of N-oxide fluxes with total litterfall and tree basal area increment as evidence that N availability links N-oxide fluxes and forest productivity. This opens the possibility to include forest productivity as co-variable in predictions of N-oxide fluxes in nitrogen limited tropical montane forests. Especially increment of tree basal area was a promising proxy to predict soil N-oxide fluxes in these N limited ecosystems, possibly because it better reflects long-term forest productivity than total litterfall.

AB Urban greenways are proven strategies to counter ecological fragmentation and improve urban sustainability. However, significant challenges remain when seeking to integrate multiple functions into priority-oriented planning. In this paper, we focus on the city of Wuhan (China) to present an innovative approach for developing multi-functional greenway networks. Based on remote sensing and geographical information systems, this approach applies a least-cost path model, a kernel density analysis and a proxy index to identify and integrate multiple needs into priority greenway networks. Our priorities are bird and small mammal conservation, human recreation and water protection. In the cost settings of the least-cost path model, we include simulated construction costs to realistically identify corridors. This method insures that our results reflect the expenses necessary for the construction of greenways. Our study demonstrates that the kernel density method is an effective tool to illustrate priorities by revealing the potential utilisation intensity of corridors. Based on the proposed method, we identify eight potential greenway networks, each highlighting different sets of priorities. We divide these priority greenway networks into three categories of ecological security: ideal greenways, backbone greenways and the comprehensive greenway network. The latter represents the integration of animal conservation, human recreation and water protection objectives. Because priorities can be added, interchanged or weighted according to local specificities, our study offers a methodological framework applicable to developing and developed cities.

AB Urban habitat heterogeneity can modify interactions across species and lead to spatially fine grained differences in beta-diversity patterns and their associated ecosystem services. Here, we study the impacts of landscape heterogeneity and climatic variability on: (1) the richness and diversity patterns of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) and (2) the abundance and West Nile virus infection rate of the house mosquito, Culex pipiens, in Chicago, USA. We conducted a four year long study (2005-2008) in 8 sites that captured a gradient of urban heterogeneities. We found a total of 19 mosquito species, a representative sample of mosquito species richness in the area, according to both model estimation (Chao2 +/- S. E. = 20.50 +/- 2.29) and faunal records for Chicago. We found that heterogeneity in the landscape was the best predictor of both mosquito species richness and diversity, with the most heterogeneous landscapes harboring the largest number of species. In general there were no changes in species richness over the years that could be associated with weather patterns and climatic variability (WPCV). In contrast, changes in diversity were associated with WPCV. Our results also showed that WPCV had major impacts on house mosquito abundance and West Nile virus mosquito infection rate (MIR) patterns. Although MIR was independent of mosquito diversity, it was associated with overall mosquito abundance, which had a convex association with species richness (i.e., abundance increases to a point after which it decreases as function of species richness). Finally, our results highlight the importance of considering dominant vector species as part of a community of vectors, whose biodiversity patterns can directly or indirectly impact the risk of infectious disease transmission.

AB Urban parks constitute critical biodiversity hotspots in crowded, concrete-dominated city environments. Despite the importance, they remain little researched. This paper assesses the biodiversity and distribution of trees in urban parks in the southern Indian city of Bangalore. 127 plots were used to survey tree distribution in parks across the city. The distribution is largely dominated by a few common species. The proportion of exotic species was very high, with 77% of trees belonging to introduced species. Park history had an impact on distribution. Old parks had fewer but larger trees, and greater species diversity compared to recently established parks. Old parks also differed in species composition, having a greater proportion of large canopy trees compared to young parks. Examination of size distributions revealed that large canopied species were gradually being phased out, and replaced by narrow and medium sized tree species which are easier to maintain, but which may not provide the same environmental and ecological benefits. Greater attention requires to be paid to the selection of trees in cities, not just with a view to easy maintenance as is currently the case, but to select an appropriate mix of trees that supports biodiversity and maximizes environmental and ecosystem services.

AB P>While the importance of terrestrial linkages to aquatic ecosystems is well appreciated, the degree of terrestrial support of aquatic consumers remains debated. Estimates of terrestrial contributions to lake zooplankton have omitted a key food source, phytoplankton produced below the mixed layer. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data from 25 Pacific Northwest lakes to assess the relative importance of particulate organic matter (POM) from the mixed layer, below the mixed layer and terrestrial detritus to zooplankton. Zooplankton and deep POM were depleted in 13C relative to mixed layer POM in lakes that can support deep primary production. A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model estimated that terrestrial detritus contributed < 5% to zooplankton production, and confirms the role of lake optical and thermal properties; deep POM accounted for up to 80% of zooplankton production in the clearest lakes. These results suggest terrestrial support of lake zooplankton production is trivial.

AB Landscape-scale processes (e.g. habitat loss) are major drivers of the global biodiversity crisis, but the complexity and size of landscapes makes study design at this scale difficult. However, the impact of statistical problems associated with sub-optimal study design on inferences drawn from landscape-scale studies is poorly understood. Here, we examine how three common statistical 'pitfalls' associated with sub-optimal study design - (1) using landscapes that overlap in space; (2) using only a portion of the potential range of the landscape predictor variable(s) of interest; (3) failing to account for correlations among landscape predictor variables - affect the inferred relationships between the abundances of six species of anurans and the amount of forest in the landscape using a large (n = 1141) empirical dataset from Wisconsin and Michigan, USA. We show that sub-optimal study design alone can be sufficient to cause a switch in the sign of the inferred relationship between a species response and landscape structure, and that using only a portion of the potential range of a predictor variable, and correlations between predictor variables, are particularly likely to affect inferences. Our results also provide the first evidence of a non-monotonic relationship between forest amount and gray treefrog abundance, and suggest that inconsistencies in the literature about the inferred relationships between anuran presence/abundance and forest amount in the Great Lakes basin are likely largely due to sampling design issues. Increased attention to study design is therefore necessary for the development of robust generalizations in landscape ecology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the past ten years, international initiatives have led to the development of large sets of genomic resources that allow comparative genomic studies between plant genomes at a high level of resolution. Comparison of map-based genomic sequences revealed shared intra-genomic duplications, providing new insights into the evolution of flowering plant genomes from common ancestors. Plant genomes can be presented as concentric circles, providing a new reference for plant chromosome evolutionary relationships and an efficient tool for gene annotation and cross-genome markers development. Recent palaeogenomic data demonstrate that whole-genome duplications have provided a motor for the evolutionary success of flowering plants over the last 50-70 million years.

AB Metacommunity theory suggests that relationships between diversity and ecosystem stability can be determined by the rate of species dispersal among local communities. The predicted relationships, however, may depend upon the relative strength of local environmental processes and disturbance. Here we evaluate the role of dispersal frequency and local predation perturbations in affecting patterns of diversity and stability in pond plankton metacommunities. Pond metacommunities were composed of three mesocosm communities: one of the three communities maintained constant "press'' predation from a selective predator, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus); the second community maintained "press'' conditions without predation; and the third community experienced recurrent "pulsed'' predation from bluegill sunfish. The triads of pond communities were connected at either no, low (0.7%/d), or high (20%/d) planktonic dispersal. Richness and composition of zooplankton and stability of plankton biomass and ecosystem productivity were measured at local and regional spatial scales. Dispersal significantly affected diversity such that local and regional biotas at the low dispersal rate maintained the greatest number of species. The unimodal local dispersal-diversity relationship was predator-dependent, however, as selective press predation excluded species regardless of dispersal. Further, there was no effect of dispersal on beta diversity because predation generated local conditions that selected for distinct community assemblages. Spatial and temporal ecosystem stability responded to dispersal frequency but not predation. Low dispersal destabilized the spatial stability of producer biomass but stabilized temporal ecosystem productivity. The results indicate that selective predation can prevent species augmentation from mass effects but has no apparent influence on stability. Dispersal rates, in contrast, can have significant effects on both species diversity and ecosystem stability at multiple spatial scales in metacommunities.

AB Increased nitrogen (N) deposition caused by human activities has altered ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. To understand the effects of altered N availability, we measured the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and the microbial community in northern hardwood forests exposed to long-term (12 years) simulated N deposition (30 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and hyphal in-growth bags. Intra- and extraradical AMF biomass and total microbial biomass were significantly decreased by simulated N deposition by 36, 41, and 24%, respectively. Both methods of extraradical AMF biomass estimation (soil PLFA 16:1 omega 5c and hyphal in-growth bags) showed comparable treatment responses, and extraradical biomass represented the majority of total (intra-plus extraradical) AMF biomass. N deposition also significantly affected the microbial community structure, leading to a 10% decrease in fungal to bacterial biomass ratios. Our observed decline in AMF and total microbial biomass together with changes in microbial community structure could have substantial impacts on the nutrient and carbon cycling within northern hardwood forest ecosystems.

AB Water resources demand constant conservation actions due to several problems (e.g. riparian vegetation cut-off, construction of dams. acidification, sewage and pesticide spills) that degrade the aquatic systems worldwide and affect its physicochemical parameters and habitat characteristics. Odonata is a potential group of organisms that could indicate these habitat alterations once they have aquatic and terrestrial life forms. In this study, we tested the use of adult odonate individual species and community assemblage measures to evaluate the effect of riparian vegetation cut-off and sewage discharges. The study was performed at Turvo Sujo River, in Vicosa, Southern Brazil. We selected twelve sites, six of them were upstream and six were downstream the city. Species abundance and species richness estimates of adult odonates were performed on sunny days during summer and winter. We analyzed the goodness-of-fit of the species abundances to geometric and lognormal series. We also measured the Habitat Physical Integrity Score (HPIS), pasture and forest proportions and physicochemical water parameters at each site. Only few species were abundant in up- and downstream regions. Abundance of Argia modesta was higher at the upstream (t = 3.188; df = 17: p = 0.005) than at the downstream region and this species is a potential habitat bioindicator organisms. Species richness was statistically different only in the wet season and species-abundance relations at the two regions fitted well to both geometric and lognormal series. The lack of riparian vegetation indicates a loss of habitat integrity and heterogeneity at Turvo Sujo River basin, which was mainly dominated by lake-dwelling odonate species. Low species richness differences are caused by species pool biases toward those ones capable to survive at degraded ecosystems, suggesting that the effects of water parameters are much less important than a landscape dominated by pastures and practically without forests. We suggest the use of species-abundance models (like geometric and lognormal series) to determine the degree of impacts over a given community once they are simple models and can show intrinsic processes structuring communities.

AB Interspecific hybridization and polyploidy are pivotal processes in plant evolution and speciation. The fate of new hybrid and polyploid taxa is determined by their ability to reproduce either sexually or asexually. Hybrids and allopolyploids with odd chromosome numbers are frequently sterile but some establish themselves through asexual reproduction (vegetative or apomixis). This allows novel genotypes to become established by isolating them from gene flow and leads to complex patterns of variation. The genus Sorbus is a good example of taxonomic complexity arising from the combined effects of hybridization, polyploidy and apomixis. The Avon Gorge in South-west Britain contains the greatest diversity of Sorbus in Europe, with three endemic species and four putative endemic novel hybrids among its 15 native Sorbus taxa. We used a combination of nuclear microsatellite and chloroplast DNA markers to investigate the evolutionary relationships among these Sorbus taxa within the Avon Gorge. We confirm the genetic identity of putative novel taxa and show that hybridization involving sexual diploid species, primarily S. aria and S. torminalis and polyploid facultative apomictic species from subgenus Aria, has been responsible for generating this biodiversity. Importantly our data show that this creative evolutionary process is ongoing within the Avon Gorge. Conservation strategies for the rare endemic Sorbus taxa should therefore consider all Sorbus taxa within the Gorge and must strive to preserve this evolutionary process rather than simply the individual rare taxa that it produces.

AB The Thailand-Cambodia border is the epicenter for drug-resistant falciparum malaria. Previous studies have shown that chloroquine (CQ) and pyrimethamine resistance originated in this region and eventually spread to other Asian countries and Africa. However, there is a dearth in understanding the origin and evolution of dhps alleles associated with sulfadoxine resistance. The present study was designed to reveal the origin(s) of sulfadoxine resistance in Cambodia and its evolutionary relationship to African and South American dhps alleles. We sequenced 234 Cambodian Plasmodium falciparum isolates for the dhps codons S436A/F, A437G, K540E, A581G and A613S/T implicated in sulfadoxine resistance. We also genotyped 10 microsatellite loci around dhps to determine the genetic backgrounds of various alleles and compared them with the backgrounds of alleles prevalent in Africa and South America. In addition to previously known highly-resistant triple mutant dhps alleles SGEGA and AGEAA (codons 436, 437, 540, 581, 613 are sequentially indicated), a large proportion of the isolates (19.3%) contained a 540N mutation in association with 437G/581G yielding a previously unreported triple mutant allele, SGNGA. Microsatellite data strongly suggest the strength of selection was greater on triple mutant dhps alleles followed by the double and single mutants. We provide evidence for at least three independent origins for the double mutants, one each for the SGKGA, AGKAA and SGEAA alleles. Our data suggest that the triple mutant allele SGEGA and the novel allele SGNGA have common origin on the SGKGA background, whereas the AGEAA triple mutant was derived from AGKAA on multiple, albeit limited, genetic backgrounds. The SGEAA did not share haplotypes with any of the triple mutants. Comparative analysis of the microsatellite haplotypes flanking dhps alleles from Cambodia, Kenya, Cameroon and Venezuela revealed an independent origin of sulfadoxine resistant alleles in each of these regions.

AB Although divergent natural selection is common in nature, the extent to which genetic constraints bias evolutionary trajectories in its presence remains largely unknown. Here we develop a general framework to integrate estimates of divergent selection and genetic constraints to estimate their contributions to phenotypic divergence among natural populations. We apply these methods to estimates of phenotypic selection and genetic covariance from sexually selected traits that have undergone adaptive divergence among nine natural populations of the fly Drosophila serrata. Despite ongoing sexual selection within populations, differences in its direction among them, and genetic variance for all traits in all populations, divergent sexual selection only weakly resembled the observed pattern of divergence. Accounting for the influence of genetic covariance among the traits significantly improved the alignment between observed and predicted divergence. Our results suggest that the direction in which sexual selection generates divergence may depend on the pattern of genetic constraint in individual populations, ultimately restricting how sexually selected traits may diversify. More generally, we show how evolution is likely to proceed in the direction of major axes of genetic variance, rather than the direction of selection itself, when genetic variance-covariance matrices are ill conditioned and genetic variance is low in the direction of selection.

AB Life history traits are critical components of fitness and frequently reflect adaptive responses to environmental pressures. However, few genes that contribute to natural life history variation have been identified. Insulin signalling mediates the determination of life history traits in many organisms, and single gene manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that individual genes in the pathway have the potential to produce major effects on these quantitative traits. We evaluated allelic variation at two insulin signalling genes, the Insulin-like Receptor (InR) and its substrate, chico, in natural populations of D. melanogaster. We found different patterns of variation: InR shows evidence of positive selection and clines in allele frequency across latitude; chico exhibits neutral patterns of evolution. The clinal patterns at InR are replicated between North America and Australia, showing striking similarity in the distribution of specific alleles and the rate at which allele frequencies change across latitude. Moreover, we identified a polymorphism at InR that appears to be functionally significant and consistent with hypothetical patterns of selection across geography. This polymorphism provides new characterization of genic regions of functionality within InR, and is likely a component in a suite of genes and traits that respond adaptively to climatic variation.

AB Anopheles gambiae, the major malaria vector in Africa, can be divided into two subgroups based on genetic and ecological criteria. These two subgroups, termed the M and S molecular forms, are believed to be incipient species. Although they display differences in the ecological niches they occupy in the field, they are often sympatric and readily hybridize in the laboratory to produce viable and fertile offspring. Evidence for assortative mating in the field was recently reported, but the underlying mechanisms awaited discovery. We studied swarming behaviour of the molecular forms and investigated the role of swarm segregation in mediating assortative mating. Molecular identification of 1145 males collected from 68 swarms in Doneguebougou, Mali, over 2 years revealed a strict pattern of spatial segregation, resulting in almost exclusively monotypic swarms with respect to molecular form. We found evidence of clustering of swarms composed of individuals of a single molecular form within the village. Tethered M and S females were introduced into natural swarms of the M form to verify the existence of possible mate recognition operating within-swarm. Both M and S females were inseminated regardless of their form under these conditions, suggesting no within-mate recognition. We argue that our results provide evidence that swarm spatial segregation strongly contributes to reproductive isolation between the molecular forms in Mali. However this does not exclude the possibility of additional mate recognition operating across the range distribution of the forms. We discuss the importance of spatial segregation in the context of possible geographic variation in mechanisms of reproductive isolation.

AB Size frequency distributions of canopy gaps are a hallmark of forest dynamics. But it remains unknown whether legacies of forest disturbance are influencing vertical size structure of landscapes, or space-filling in the canopy volume. We used data from LiDAR remote sensing to quantify distributions of canopy height and sizes of 434 501 canopy gaps in five tropical rain forest landscapes in Costa Rica and Hawaii. The sites represented a wide range of variation in structure and natural disturbance history, from canopy gap dynamics in lowland Costa Rica and Hawaii, to stages and types of stand-level dieback on upland Mauna Kea and Kohala volcanoes. Large differences in vertical canopy structure characterized these five tropical rain forest landscapes, some of which were related to known disturbance events. Although there were quantitative differences in the values of scaling exponents within and among sites, size frequency distributions of canopy gaps followed power laws at all sites and in all canopy height classes. Scaling relationships in gap size at different heights in the canopy were qualitatively similar at all sites, revealing a remarkable similarity despite clearly defined differences in species composition and modes of prevailing disturbance. These findings indicate that power-law gap-size frequency distributions are ubiquitous features of these five tropical rain forest landscapes, and suggest that mechanisms of forest disturbance may be secondary to other processes in determining vertical and horizontal size structure in canopies.

AB The degree to which habitat fragmentation affects bird incidence is species specific and may depend on varying spatial scales. Selecting the correct scale of measurement is essential to appropriately assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on bird occurrence. Our objective was to determine which spatial scale of landscape measurement best describes the incidence of three bird species (Pyriglena leucoptera, Xiphorhynchus fuscus and Chiroxiphia caudata) in the fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest and test if multi-scalar models perform better than single-scalar ones. Bird incidence was assessed in 80 forest fragments. The surrounding landscape structure was described with four indices measured at four spatial scales (400-, 600-, 800- and 1,000-m buffers around the sample points). The explanatory power of each scale in predicting bird incidence was assessed using logistic regression, bootstrapped with 1,000 repetitions. The best results varied between species (1,000-m radius for P. leucoptera; 800-m for X. fuscus and 600-m for C. caudata), probably due to their distinct feeding habits and foraging strategies. Multi-scale models always resulted in better predictions than single-scale models, suggesting that different aspects of the landscape structure are related to different ecological processes influencing bird incidence. In particular, our results suggest that local extinction and (re)colonisation processes might simultaneously act at different scales. Thus, single-scale models may not be good enough to properly describe complex pattern-process relationships. Selecting variables at multiple ecologically relevant scales is a reasonable procedure to optimise the accuracy of species incidence models.

AB Aim To investigate the potential impacts of climate change on stream fish assemblages in terms of species and biological trait diversity, composition and similarity.
   Location One-thousand one-hundred and ten stream sections in France.
   Methods We predicted the future potential distribution of 35 common stream fish species facing changes in temperature and precipitation regime. Seven different species distribution models were applied and a consensus forecast was produced to limit uncertainty between single-models. The potential impacts of climate change on fish assemblages were assessed using both species and biological trait approaches. We then addressed the spatial distribution of potential impacts along the upstream-downstream gradient.
   Results Overall, climate change was predicted to result in an increase in species and trait diversity. Species and trait composition of the fish assemblages were also projected to be highly modified. Changes in assemblages' diversity and composition differed strongly along the upstream-downstream gradient, with upstream and midstream assemblages more modified than downstream assemblages. We also predicted a global increase in species and trait similarity between pairwise assemblages indicating a future species and trait homogenization of fish assemblages. Nevertheless, we found that upstream assemblages would differentiate, whereas midstream and downstream assemblages would homogenize. Our results suggested that colonization could be the main driver of the predicted homogenization, while local extinctions could result in assemblage differentiation.
   Main conclusions This study demonstrated that climate change could lead to contrasted impacts on fish assemblage structure and diversity depending on the position along the upstream-downstream gradient. These results could have important implications in terms of ecosystem monitoring as they could be useful in establishing areas that would need conservation prioritization.

AB Understanding the conditions under which species traits, species-environment relationships, and the spatial structure of the landscape interact to shape local communities requires quantifying the relative contributions of space and the environment on community composition. Using analogous sampling of arboreal and terrestrial oribatid mite communities across a large spatial scale in a temperate rainforest, we quantified the variation in oribatid mite community structure relating to environmental and spatial factors, and tested whether terrestrial and arboreal communities demonstrated a difference in their patterns of community composition based on the assumption of differences in dispersal potential. The expectation that terrestrial oribatid mite communities are spatially structured while arboreal communities are environmentally structured was supported by our analyses at the level of variation in beta diversity, but not by assessing beta diversity itself. We found that terrestrial oribatid mite communities with active, cursorial dispersal demonstrate spatial constraint consistent with reduced long-distance dispersal opportunities and high environmental dissimilarity among sites. Arboreal communities, which potentially disperse long distances via passive aerial vectors, show a spatial signature associated with patterns in beta diversity and a correlation with environmental dissimilarities among sites. In the arboreal community, moisture content of the substrate, total tree height, and average sampled branch height were significant factors explaining beta diversity patterns. For ground-dwelling species, predator abundance and soil type were important local determinants of community variability. Both communities showed clear spatial structuring, suggesting that dispersal limitation continues to influence community composition across multiple forest watershed locations. Our results provide evidence of dispersal-maintained diversity patterns in response to local environmental factors in arboreal and terrestrial communities. The relative importance of stochastic dispersal assembly may be dependent on strong deterministic effects associated with micro-site and macro-site environmental variation, particularly across large spatial scales.

AB Most studies of habitat selection by large herbivores focus on the resource availability and interactions with other species, but neglect the importance of an animal being familiar with an area due to past use. Yet, studies of the establishment and retention of territories, home ranges, birth sites, and feeding site choices in experimental settings have shown the importance of spatial familiarity at these scales. We used GPS locations of translocated wapiti Cervus elaphus, resource selection functions (RSF), and time-to-return to examine whether previous site use was important for selection of sites by wapiti in west-central Alberta. To construct RSFs, we used logistic regression that included spatial familiarity (presence of a previous GPS location within a 50-m radius) as well as estimates of herbaceous and shrub biomass, elevation, aspect, slope, and predation risk to wapiti from wolf predation, as dependent variables. We found that previous use had a strong positive relationship with subsequent site use, indicating that wapiti were not avoiding previously visited locations, as would be expected if memory of forage depletion (which we did not measure) determined response to familiar locations. Revisited sites were of higher quality, i.e. had more moderate terrain, higher forage, and lower predation risk, than sites that were not revisited, indicating that the selection of familiar locations was likely not the result of avoidance of unfamiliar locations. Finally, animals demonstrated preference for familiar locations that it had visited most recently, indicating that memory (which would decline with time) of higher site quality, rather than high quality alone, influenced selection for familiar locations. We conclude that spatial familiarity is important not only for large scale processes such as selection of home range and territory, but for smaller scale habitat selection and foraging as well.

AB California coast live oak ( Quercus agrifolia) forms tripartite symbiotic associations with arbuscular (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal (EMF) fungi. We selected oak individuals differing in topographic position and depth to groundwater ( mesicvalley vs. xeric hill sites) to investigate changes of tree mycorrhizal status in response to interannual rainfall variability. EMF root colonization, as well as hyphal abundance and viability in upper rhizosphere soil (0-30 cm), were negatively affected by severe multi-year drought, although not to the same extent in each topographic location. Oak trees growing in hill sites showed EMF colonization levels, < 1% in upper roots during drought. By contrast, oaks in valley sites maintained much higher EMF colonization (> 19%) in upper roots during drought. EMF root colonization increased sharply at both topographic positions during the ensuing wet year (78% in valley, 49% in hill), which indicates that the mycorrhizal status of roots in upper rhizosphere soil is highly responsive to interannual rainfall variability. Across sites and years, percentage EMF colonization and soil hyphal density and viability were strongly positively correlated with soil moisture potential, but percentage AMF root colonization was not. Interestingly, changes in percentage EMF root colonization and density of viable hyphae between a wet and a dry year were proportionally much greater in xeric hill sites than in mesic valley sites. The mycorrhizal status of oak trees was particularly responsive to changes in soil moisture at the hill sites, where roots in upper rhizosphere soil shifted from almost exclusively AMF during severe drought to predominantly EMF during the ensuing wet year. By contrast, the mycorrhizal status of oaks in the valley sites was less strongly coupled to current meteorological conditions, as roots in upper soil layers remained predominantly EMF during both a dry and a wet year. Canopy shading and hydraulic lift by oaks in valley sites likely contributed to maintain the integrity and viability of EMF roots and extraradical hyphae in upper rhizosphere soil during extended drought. Our results suggest that oak woodlands in water-limited ecosystems may become increasingly reliant on the AMF symbiosis under future climate change scenarios for the U. S. southwest and other world regions.

AB Invasive species are a global problem but most studies have focused on their direct rather than indirect ecological effects. We studied litter and soil-inhabiting invertebrate communities on 18 islands off northern New Zealand, to better understand the indirect ecological consequences of rat (Rattus) invasion. Nine islands host high densities of burrowing procellariid seabirds that transport large amounts of nutrients from the ocean to the land. The other nine have been invaded over the past 50-150 years by rat species that have severely reduced the density of seabirds by preying on eggs and chicks. Invaded islands had lower densities of seabird burrows but deeper forest litter than did the uninvaded islands, indicative of rats reducing disturbance effects of seabirds. However, despite deeper litter on the invaded islands, eight of the 19 orders of invertebrates that we measured were significantly less abundant on invaded islands. Furthermore, three soil-inhabiting micro-invertebrate groups that we measured were significantly less abundant on invaded islands. These differences probably result from rats thwarting transfer of resources by seabirds from the ocean to the land. We also investigated community-level properties of each of three test groups of invertebrates (minute land snails, spiders and soil nematodes) to illustrate this process. Spiders were equally abundant on both groups of islands, but showed lower species richness on the invaded islands. The other two groups showed no difference in species richness with island invasion status, but were more abundant on uninvaded islands. Reduced abundance of soil nematodes on invaded islands provides strong evidence of indirect consequences of seabird reduction by rats, because nematodes are unavailable to rats as prey. We predict that if rats are eradicated from islands, components of below-ground invertebrate dependent on seabird-mediated soil conditions may take considerable time to recover because they require subsequent seabird recolonisation.

AB Studies on riparian buffers have usually focused on the amount of land needed as habitat for the terrestrial life stages of semiaquatic species. Nevertheless, the landscape surrounding wetlands is also important for other key processes, such as dispersal and the dynamics of metapopulations. Multiple elements that influence these processes should therefore be considered in the delineation of buffers. We analyzed landscape elements (forest cover, density of roads, and hydrographic network) in concentric buffers to evaluate the scale at which they influence stream amphibians in 77 distinct landscapes. To evaluate whether our results could be generalized to other contexts, we determined whether they were consistent across the study areas. Amphibians required buffers of 100-400 m of suitable terrestrial habitat, but interspecific differences in the amount of habitat were large. The presence of amphibians was related to roads and the hydrographic network at larger spatial scales (300-1500 m), which suggests that wider buffers are needed with these elements. This pattern probably arose because these elements influence dispersal and metapopulation persistence, processes that occur at large spatial scales. Furthermore, in some cases, analyses performed on different sets of landscapes provided different results, which suggests caution should be used when conservation recommendations are applied to disparate areas. Establishment of riparian buffers should not be focused only on riparian habitat, but should take a landscape perspective because semiaquatic species use multiple elements for different functions. This approach can be complex because different landscape elements require different spatial extents. Nevertheless, a shift of attention toward the management of different elements at multiple spatial scales is necessary for the long-term persistence of populations.

AB Here we review the bioindicator potentials of several arthropod groups in forest management. First, we describe the indicator potentials of frequently used arthropod groups in general forest management, and then evaluate ecosystem function and plural taxonomic groups to infer forest biodiversity We then review indicator potentials of arthropod groups to explore the ecological consequences of forest management practices. Different arthropod groups respond differently to forest management. Ants, carabid beetles, and spiders often respond to local-scale, disturbance-induced vegetation development caused by thinning and can be used to infer the ecological suitability of forest management treatments. Dung beetles and moths respond to habitat alterations caused by forest fragmentation and can indicate the suitability of landscape-level forest management techniques. Butterflies and cerambycid beetles respond highly positively to the presence of herbaceous plants and understory trees and can be used to infer the integrity of thinning treatments in forest management. Syrphid flies, which are strong flyers associated with vegetation complexity, can be used as bioindicators of landscape-level forest management practices. Monitoring regulatory service providers may also help when designing forest management practices. We propose using arthropod bioindicator groups to effectively design and assess ecologically sustainable management plans for both natural and plantation forests.

AB Plants with poorly attractive flowers or with little floral rewards may have inadequate pollinator service, which in turn reduces seed output. However, pollinator service of less attractive species could be enhanced when they are associated with species with highly attractive flowers (so called 'magnet-species'). Although several studies have reported the magnet species effect, few of them have evaluated whether this positive interaction result in an enhancement of the seed output for the beneficiary species. Here, we compared pollinator visitation rates and seed output of the invasive annual species Carduus pycnocephalus when grow associated with shrubs of the invasive Lupinus arboreus and when grow alone, and hypothesized that L. arboreus acts as a magnet species for C. pycnocephalus. Results showed that C. pycnocephalus individuals associated with L. arboreus had higher pollinator visitation rates and higher seed output than individuals growing alone. The higher visitation rates of C. pycnocephalus associated to L. arboreus were maintained after accounting for flower density, which consistently supports our hypothesis on the magnet species effect of L. arboreus. Given that both species are invasives, the facilitated pollination and reproduction of C. pycnocephalus by L. arboreus could promote its naturalization in the community, suggesting a synergistic invasional process contributing to an 'invasional meltdown'. The magnet effect of Lupinus on Carduus found in this study seems to be one the first examples of indirect facilitative interactions via increased pollination among invasive species.

AB Trees forage for light through optimal leaf display. Effective leaf display is determined by metamer traits (i.e., the internode, petiole, and corresponding leaf), and thus these traits strongly co-determine carbon gain and as a result competitive advantage in a light-limited environment. We examined 11 metamer traits of sun and shade trees of 38 coexisting moist forest tree species and determined the relative strengths of intra- and interspecific variation. Species-specific metamer traits were related to two variables that represent important life history variation; the regeneration light requirements and average leaf size of the species. Metamer traits varied strongly across species and, in contrast to our expectation, showed only modest changes in response to light. Intra- and interspecific responses to light were only congruent for a third of the traits evaluated. Four traits, amongst which leaf size, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf area ratio at the metamer level (LAR) showed even opposite intra- and interspecific responses to light. Strikingly, these are classic traits that are thought to be of paramount importance for plant performance but that have completely different consequences within and across species. Sun trees of a given species had small leaves to reduce the heat load, but light-demanding species had large leaves compared to shade-tolerants, probably to outcompete their neighbors. Shade trees of a given species had a high SLA and LAR to capture more light in a light-limited environment, whereas shade-tolerant species have well-protected leaves with a low SLA compared to light-demanding species, probably to deter herbivores and enhance leaf lifespan. There was a leaf-size-mediated trade-off between biomechanical and hydraulic safety, and the efficiency with which species can space their leaves and forage for light. Unexpectedly, metamer traits were more closely linked to leaf size than to regeneration light requirements, probably because leaf-size-related biomechanical and vascular constraints limit the trait combinations that are physically possible. This suggests that the leaf size spectrum overrules more subtle variation caused by the leaf economics spectrum, and that leaf size represents a more important strategy axis than previously thought.

ID PLANT-COMMUNITIES; DISTRIBUTIONS; IMPACTS
AB Pioneering efforts to predict shifts in species distribution under climate change used simple models based on the correlation between contemporary environmental factors and distributions. These models make predictions at coarse spatial scales and assume the constancy of present correlations between environment and distribution. Adaptive management of climate change impacts requires models that can make more robust predictions at finer spatio-temporal scales by accounting for processes that actually affect species distribution on heterogeneous landscapes. Mechanistic models of the distribution of both species and vegetation types have begun to emerge to meet these needs. We review these developments and highlight how recent advances in our understanding of relationships among the niche concept, species diversity and community assembly point the way towards more effective models for the impacts of global change on species distribution and community diversity.

AB Aim Variation in species richness has been related to (1) environmental conditions (water, energy and habitat characteristics) and (2) regional differences (contingent historical events and regional particularities that result in differences between regional faunas acting at broad extents). Whereas climatic factors have been widely studied, the effects of regional differences are less often quantified. This work aims to characterize global trends in the species richness of mammal assemblages with respect to both current and historical influences.
   Location All terrestrial biogeographical realms except Antarctica.
   Methods Species richness in checklists from 224 sites distributed worldwide were investigated by partitioning the variation between a general set of habitat/climate factors, biogeographical regions, and their overlaps. Additional analyses studied the specific overlaps of region, water and energy. Data were also divided according to area to determine if the strength of these effects varies according to the size of sites.
   Results Environmental effects explained 38% of richness variation across all sites, whereas environmentally independent regional effects explained 11% and the overlap between region and environment explained 13%. Results were similar when only larger sites (between 1000 km(2) and 10,000 km(2)) were considered. However, the importance of the overlap between region and all environmental variables was greater in smaller sites (between 100 km(2) and 1000 km(2)). In contrast, the specific importance of water and energy variables and their overlap with region was greater in larger sites. The strength of the independent effect of region remained almost invariant regardless of the size of the sites studied.
   Main conclusions The relationship between species richness and climate varies with scale and among regions. Although environmental variables are the strongest correlates of richness, the unique history and physiographic characteristics of a region produce differences between the richness of mammal assemblages and their response to environmental gradients. The importance of environmental variables varies with scale: climatic gradients are more important at coarse grain (larger sites), possibly as a result of their effects on species ranges, whereas habitat type is more important at the smaller sites, where the importance of ecological interactions increases. Therefore, regional differences and the scale at which richness is measured should be taken into account when evaluating species richness-energy hypotheses.

ID TEST-PERFORMANCE
AB Stricker & Ward (2004) examined stereotype threat with a national sample of students taking an Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus exam, and a smaller sample taking Computerized Placement Tests (CPT). They inquired about gender either before (traditional) or after the test (which can reduce stereotype threat). They reported no significant effects of question timing. We reanalyze their findings, and argue that their conservative criterion for evidence led them to overlook significant stereotype threat effects with real practical implications. Women benefited substantially on the Calculus test, and on the CPT-Reading when demographics were asked after testing rather than before. This simple, small, and inexpensive change could increase U.S. women receiving AP Calculus AB credit by more than 4,700 every year.

AB A paradox of invasion biology is that even though native species are locally adapted to environmental conditions, nonnative species without this advantage often invade. Ecologists have advanced four main theories to explain why invaders are successful in some places and not others: biotic resistance, environmental resistance, human disturbance, and natural enemies. However, none of these theories alone can account for invasions by two trout species outside their native ranges in North America. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are able to displace native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) in the inland western US, but are themselves displaced by nonnative rainbow trout (O. mykiss) in the southeastern US. An alternative hypothesis is that an interaction among zoogeography, evolutionary history, and environmental resistance from the natural flow regimes can account for this paradox. The nonnative species invade successfully at the southern edge of the ranges of the native species, which are farthest from their ancestral origins. Due to their evolutionary history, the native species are poorly adapted to the natural disturbance regime at the southern limit of their ranges, but the nonnative species are preadapted by chance due to theirs. This alternative hypothesis about the interaction between the historical contingency of evolution and environmental resistance should be more widely tested, to inform both invasion biology and the conservation of native trout.

AB The dynamic and distributed work environment in critical care requires a high level of collaboration among clinical team members and a sophisticated task coordination system to deliver safe, timely and effective care. A complex cognitive system underlies the decision-making process in such cooperative workplaces. This methodological review paper addresses the issues of translating cognitive research to clinical practice with a specific focus on decision-making in critical care, and the role of information and communication technology to aid in such decisions. Examples are drawn from studies of critical care in our own research laboratories. Critical care, in this paper, includes both intensive (inpatient) and emergency (outpatient) care. We define translational cognition as the research on basic and applied cognitive issues that contribute to our understanding of how information is stored, retrieved and used for problem-solving and decision-making. The methods and findings are discussed in the context of constraints on decision-making in real-world complex environments and implications for supporting the design and evaluation of decision support tools for critical care health providers.

AB The subspecies concept has received considerable debate throughout the past century. Subspecies were originally used to delineate potential incipient species, but were later employed to simply capture geographical variation. There is a recent trend to eliminate the trinomial in light of new evidence. Discrete, diagnosable lineages are elevated to specific status, while those that show clinal variation and/or appear to represent ecological pattern classes are placed in synonymy with the parent species and the subspecific epithets are disregarded. Here, I examine the species boundaries of nightsnakes (Hypsiglena torquata) using standard phylogeographic methods and mtDNA data from 178 individuals. Previously, seventeen subspecies of H. torquata were described. In this study, I recognize six species in what was previously considered H. torquata: one is novel, two were previously recognized subspecies, while the remaining three are wide-spread, polymorphic lineages, composed of multiple subspecies. I make the case to maintain the subspecific lineages in these wide-ranging species because they are geographically cohesive, morphologically discrete, and may represent incipient species within each complex, which have not yet achieved speciation. These subspecies are maintained, not only pending future investigations, but because they provide a useful identity for the taxonomy of this diverse lineage. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Although natural regeneration is often the best method for establishing new oak (Quercus spp.) stands, there are increasingly more situations in which high potential for oak regeneration failure dictates the use of artificial regeneration including direct seeding and planting seedlings. Additionally, afforestation planting programs frequently incorporate oak species. Artificial regeneration of oak stands is challenging for numerous reasons. In this article we synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding growing and planting the major oak species in the eastern United States, point out critical research gaps, and provide some general growing, planting, and stand tending guidelines and recommendations. Adequate site preparation, careful planting of healthy, genetically adapted seed or seedlings of high morphological and physiological quality, and subsequent control of competing vegetation and browse damage are necessary actions to assure regeneration success. Oak seedling survival in the early years after planting or seeding is a poor indicator of regeneration success. Successful regeneration may be defined as having a desired proportion of the oak planting stock reach dominant/codominant status in the stand. The costs of all activities required to produce a successful oak tree in the future stand should be considered in economic comparison of alternative prescriptions for oak regeneration.

AB Why are some traits constitutive and others inducible? The term costs often appears in work addressing this issue but may be ambiguously defined. This review distinguishes two conceptually distinct types of costs: phenotypic costs and plasticity costs. Phenotypic costs are assessed from patterns of covariation, typically between a focal trait and a separate trait relevant to fitness. Plasticity costs, separable from phenotypic costs, are gauged by comparing the fitness of genotypes with equivalent phenotypes within two environments but differing in plasticity and fitness. Subtleties associated with both types of costs are illustrated by a body of work addressing predator-induced plasticity. Such subtleties, and potential interplay between the two types of costs, have also been addressed, often in studies involving genetic model organisms. In some instances, investigators have pinpointed the mechanistic basis of plasticity. In this vein, microbial work is especially illuminating and has three additional strengths. First, information about the machinery underlying plasticity-such as structural and regulatory genes, sensory proteins, and biochemical pathways-helps link population-level studies with underlying physiological and genetic mechanisms. Second, microbial studies involve many generations, large populations, and replication. Finally, empirical estimation of key parameters (e.g., mutation rates) is tractable. Together, these allow for rigorous investigation of gene interactions, drift, mutation, and selection-all potential factors influencing the maintenance or loss of inducible traits along with phenotypic and plasticity costs. Messages emerging from microbial work can guide future efforts to understand the evolution of plastic traits in diverse organisms.

AB The pursuit of sustainability in particular places and sectors often unravels at the edges. Efforts to tackle environmental problems in one place shift them somewhere else or are overwhelmed by external changes in drivers. Gains in energy efficiency of-appliances used in houses ire offset by greater total numbers or compensating changes in patterns of use. Analytical perspectives and practical initiatives, which treat production and consumption jointly, ire needed to complement experiences and efforts with sector-, place-, product- and consumer-oriented approaches.
   There is now a growing body of scholarship exploring a diverse range of initiatives and experiments aimed at enabling sustainable production-consumption systems (PCSs). Different approaches make divergent assumptions about market institutions, government regulation, sociotechnical innovation, and actor partnerships. From this body of work flow useful insights for others who would engage, for example, in redesigning relationships around services rather than products or between third world producers and first world consumers in fair trade initiatives.

AB Species invasions are of global significance, but predicting their impacts can be difficult. Introduced ecosystem engineers, however, provide an opportunity to test the underlying mechanisms that may be common to all invasive engineers and link relationships between changes in diversity and ecosystem function, thereby providing explanatory power for observed ecological patterns. Here we test specific predictions for an invasive ecosystem engineer by quantifying the impacts of habitat and resource modifications caused by North American beavers (Castor canadensis) on aquatic macroinvertebrate community structure and stream ecosystem function in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile. We compared responses to beavers in three habitat types: (1) forested (unimpacted) stream reaches, (2) beaver ponds, and (3) sites immediately downstream of beaver dams in four streams. We found that beaver engineering in ponds created taxonomically simplified, but more productive, benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Specifically, macroinvertebrate richness, diversity and number of functional feeding groups were reduced by half, while abundance, biomass and secondary production increased three- to fivefold in beaver ponds compared to forested sites. Reaches downstream of beaver ponds were very similar to natural forested sections. Beaver invasion effects on both community and ecosystem parameters occurred predominantly via increased retention of fine particulate organic matter, which was associated with reduced macroinvertebrate richness and diversity (via homogenization of benthic microhabitat) and increased macroinvertebrate biomass and production (via greater food availability). Beaver modifications to macroinvertebrate community structure were largely confined to ponds, but increased benthic production in beaver-modified habitats adds to energy retention and flow for the entire stream ecosystem. Furthermore, the effects of beavers on taxa richness (negative) and measures of macroinvertebrate biomass (positive) were inversely related. Thus, while a generally positive relationship between diversity and ecosystem function has been found in a variety of systems, this work shows how they can be decoupled by responding to alterative mechanisms.

AB This paper presents the Land Suitability Index (LSI), a transparent, modular hierarchical system of cartographic indices aimed at delivering Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of developmental land uses for regional planning (European Directive 2001/42/EC). The LSI evaluates land suitability by combining three main sub-indices concerning (i) the vulnerability of the biosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere to impacts arising from implementing development proposals; (ii) the natural heritage value of the target area; and (iii) its contribution to terrestrial ecological connectivity. We have used the LSI to evaluate the impact of municipal urban plans in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). For this case study, we provide redundancy and sensitivity analyses, and a partial validation using independent studies. Results showed noticeable inconsistencies between the municipal plans and the values of the LSI and its main sub-indices. There was moderate redundancy between sub-indices but considerable sensitivity to changes in input variables. Validation showed a high degree of coincidence with previous, independent, studies as regards connectivity. The quantitative and cartographic approach adopted by the methodology facilitates conveying the results to planners and policy makers. In addition, successive iterations to check the impact related to different alternative planning scenarios can be quickly performed. We therefore propose its application to other metropolitan areas.

AB We examined three ecological factors potentially causing premating reproductive isolation to determine whether divergent selection as a result of coevolution between South Hills crossbills (Loxia curvirostra complex) and Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta latifolia) promotes ecological speciation. One factor was habitat isolation arising because of enhanced seed defenses of lodgepole pine in the South Hills. This caused the crossbill call types (morphologically and vocally differentiated forms) adapted to alternative resources to be rare. Another occurred when crossbills of other call types moved into the South Hills late in the breeding season and feeding conditions were deteriorating so that relatively few non South Hills crossbills bred (" immigrant infecundity"). Finally, among those crossbills that bred, pairing was strongly assortative by call type (behavioral isolation). Total reproductive isolation between South Hills crossbills and the two other crossbills most common in the South Hills (call types 2 and 5) summed to .9975 and .9998, respectively, on a scale of 0 (no reproductive isolation) to 1 (complete reproductive isolation). These extremely high levels of reproductive isolation indicate that the divergent selection resulting from the coevolutionary arms race between crossbills and lodgepole pine is causing the South Hills crossbill to speciate.

AB Declines in many native fish populations have led to reassessments of management goals and shifted priorities from consumptive uses to species preservation. As management has shifted, relevant environmental characteristics have evolved from traditional metrics that described local habitat quality to characterizations of habitat size and connectivity. Despite the implications this shift has for how habitats may be prioritized for conservation, it has been rare to assess the relative importance of these habitat components. We used an information - theoretic approach to select the best models from sets of logistic regressions that linked habitat quality, size, and connectivity to the occurrence of chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) nests. Spawning distributions were censused annually from 1995 to 2004, and data were complemented with field measurements that described habitat quality in 43 suitable spawning patches across a stream network that drained 1150 km(2) in central Idaho. Results indicated that the most plausible models were dominated by measures of habitat size and connectivity, whereas habitat quality was of minor importance. Connectivity was the strongest predictor of nest occurrence, but connectivity interacted with habitat size, which became relatively more important when populations were reduced. Comparison of observed nest distributions to null model predictions confirmed that the habitat size association was driven by a biological mechanism when populations were small, but this association may have been an area- related sampling artifact at higher abundances. The implications for habitat management are that the size and connectivity of existing habitat networks should be maintained whenever possible. In situations where habitat restoration is occurring, expansion of existing areas or creation of new habitats in key areas that increase connectivity may be beneficial. Information about habitat size and connectivity also could be used to strategically prioritize areas for improvement of local habitat quality, with areas not meeting minimum thresholds being deemed inappropriate for pursuit of restoration activities.

AB Plants have unique biological attributes of great interest to researchers investigating population dynamics. Yet, until recently, organelle DNA had been seldom utilized for phylogeographic studies in plants. While cpDNA variation has been used extensively to construct interspecific phylogenies, many researchers have considered that the relatively low levels of intraspecific variation revealed by early studies of plant organelle DNA render these genomes of little use for intraspecific studies. In this review we introduce the field of plant phylogeography based on organelle polymorphisms by providing a detailed discussion of the processes underlying this variation. Progress in molecular organelle genetics has provided insights into the structure, variation, inheritance, vegetative segregation and recombination of organelle genomes. While some of these features (e.g. low substitution rates) may complicate phylogeographic studies, others (e.g. presence of two genomes and frequency of atypical modes of transmission) offer unique opportunities, many of which are virtually unexplored.

AB Northern peatlands are a diverse group of ecosystems varying along a continuum of hydrological, chemical, and vegetation gradients. These ecosystems contain about one third of the global soil carbon pool, but it is uncertain how carbon and water cycling processes and response to climate change differ among peatland types. This study examines midsummer CO2 and H2O fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique above seven northern peatlands including a low-shrub bog, two open poor fens, two wooded moderately rich fens, and two open extreme-rich fens. Gross ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration correlated positively with vegetation indices and with each other. Consequently, 24-hour net ecosystem CO2 exchange was similar among most of the sites (an average net carbon sink of 1.5 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)) despite large differences in water table depth, water chemistry, and plant communities. Evapotranspiration was primarily radiatively driven at all sites but a decline in surface conductance with increasing water vapor deficit indicated physiological restrictions to transpiration, particularly at the peatlands with woody vegetation and less at the peatlands with 100% Sphagnum cover. Despite these differences, midday evapotranspiration ranged only from 0.21 to 0.34 mm h(-1) owing to compensation among the factors controlling evapotranspiration. Water use efficiency varied among sites primarily as a result of differences in productivity and plant functional type. Although peatland classification includes a great variety of ecosystem characteristics, peatland type may not be an effective way to predict the magnitude and characteristics of midsummer CO2 and water vapor exchanges.

AB We lack a clear understanding of the enzootic maintenance of the bacterium (Yersinia pestis) that causes plague and the sporadic epizootics that occur in its natural rodent hosts. A key to elucidating these epidemiological dynamics is determining the dominant transmission routes of plague. Plague can be acquired from the bites of infectious fleas (which is generally considered to occur via a blocked flea vector), inhalation of infectious respiratory droplets, or contact with a short-term infectious reservoir. We present results from a plague modeling approach that includes transmission from all three sources of infection simultaneously and uses sensitivity analysis to determine their relative importance. Our model is completely parameterized by using data from the literature and our own field studies of plague in the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Results of the model are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with independent data from our field sites. Although infectious fleas might be an important source of infection and transmission via blocked fleas is a dominant paradigm in the literature, our model clearly predicts that this form of transmission cannot drive epizootics in prairie dogs. Rather, a short-term reservoir is required for epizootic dynamics. Several short-term reservoirs have the potential to affect the prairie dog system. Our model predictions of the residence time of the short-term reservoir suggest that other small mammals, infectious prairie dog carcasses, fleas that transmit plague without blockage of the digestive tract, or some combination of these three are the most likely of the candidate infectious reservoirs.

AB Restoration of habitats impacted by invasive plants is becoming an increasingly important tool in the management of native biodiversity, though most studies do not go beyond monitoring the abundance of particular taxonomic groups, Such as the return of native vegetation. Yet, the reestablishment of trophic interactions among organisms in restored habitats is equally important if we are to monitor and understand how ecosystems recover. This study examined whether food web interactions among arthropods (as inferred by abundance of naturally occurring stable isotopes of C [delta C-13] and N [delta N-15]) were reestablished in the restoration of a coastal Spartina alterniflora salt marsh that had been invaded by Phragmites australis.
   From patterns of C and N stable isotopes we infer that trophic interactions among arthropods in the native salt marsh habitats are characterized by reliance on the dominant marsh plant Spartina as a basal resource. Herbivores such as delphacid planthoppers and mirid bugs have isotope signatures characteristic of Spartina, and predatory arthropods such as dolicopodid flies and spiders likewise have delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures typical of Spartina-derived resources (approximately -13 parts per thousand and 10 parts per thousand, respectively). Stable isotope patterns also suggest that the invasion of Phragmites into salt marshes and displacement of Spartina significantly alter arthropod food web interactions. Arthropods in Phragmites-dominated sites have delta C-13 isotope values between -18 parts per thousand and -20 parts per thousand, suggesting reliance on detritus and/or benthic microalgae as basal resources and not on Phragmites, which has a 813 C approximately -26 parts per thousand. Since most Phragmites herbivores are either feeding internally or are rare transients from nearby Spartina, these resources do not provide significant prey resources for other arthropod consumers. Rather, predator isotope signatures in the invaded habitats indicate dependence on detritus/algae as basal resources instead of the dominant vegetation. The reestablishment of Spartina after removal of Phragmites, however, not only returned species assemblages typical of reference (uninvaded) Spartina, but stable isotope signatures suggest that the trophic interactions among the arthropods were also similar in reestablished habitats. Specifically, both herbivores and predators showed characteristic Spartina signatures, suggesting the return of the original grazer-based food web structure in the restored habitats.

AB The annual flood pulse in tropical lowland rivers creates a continually moving land-water margin that forces aquatic organisms of the littoral zone to relocate to new habitats at intervals ranging from days to weeks. Thus, species assemblages in patchy littoral-zone habitats have large potential to be influenced by stochastic colonization dynamics, whereby organisms may exhibit weak selection for mesohabitat features and arrive on a patch in no particular sequence. We examined species assemblages of fishes and macroinvertebrates occupying habitats of varying structural complexity through an annual flood cycle of the Cinaruco River, a species-rich floodplain river in the southern llanos of Venezuela. We collected 268 standardized samples that contained 54,596 individual fishes representing 156 species (23 families) and 6973 macroinvertebrates representing 8 families. Analysis of species-specific patterns of habitat occupancy based on a randomization procedure indicated greater species selectivity during low water (92% of taxa) relative to rising- and falling-water periods (60% and 63% of taxa, respectively). Community-wide correspondence analysis (CA) revealed similar patterns. Assemblages from similar habitat types clustered together in the CA ordination, and these nonrandom patterns were most apparent during low water. Results from partial canonical correspondence analysis revealed that assemblage structure was strongly influenced by habitat type (patches of different composition located within the shallow littoral zone of either the river main channel or lagoons), which accounted for 56% of the total explainable variation in the species X sample matrix. Mesohabitat parameters (e.g., water velocity, depth), sampling period (month), and location on the landscape explained 30%, 23%, and 17% of variation, respectively. As water level changes and the aquatic-terrestrial interface moves across the landscape, species assemblages in patchy littoral habitats, while highly variable, reconstitute with significant determinism. At the same time, a large proportion of unexplained variation in assemblage structure probably is associated with unmeasured components of landscape variation as well as a stochastic element in colonization dynamics.

AB Edible dormice (Glis glis) reproduce in years with beech mast seeding, but entire populations may skip reproduction in years when tree seeds, a major food resource of this small hibernator, are absent. We tested the hypothesis that the year-to-year variability in reproductive effort caused by this breeding strategy should lead to detectable differences in yearly survival rates. Therefore, we analyzed capture-recapture data from animals occupying nest boxes, collected over nine years at two study sites in Germany. Among fully grown adults (aged two years or older), survival probabilities were significantly lower (0.32 +/- 0.04) after reproductive years (n = 5) compared to years (n = 4) with absent or below-average reproduction (0.58 +/- 0.07) on both study sites. This trade-off between reproduction and subsequent survival was observed in both females and males and appears to be a relatively rare case in which costs of reproduction in terms of longevity are detectable at the population level. Effects of reproduction on survival were less pronounced when yearlings (with a generally lower reproductive effort) were included and were more distinct in a suboptimal habitat. Of those females breeding in nest boxes, 96.5% had only one or two litters within the study period. Considering these and previously published results, including a report of extremely high mean longevities (9-12 years) of dormice in a habitat with infrequent mast seeding, we conclude that edible dormice flexibly adjust life history tactics to local mast patterns. Long stretches of mast failures can in fact lead to relative semelparity, i.e., a strategy in which dormice "sit tight" for several ears until environmental conditions are favorable for reproduction.

AB Studies of multitrophic interactions between below- and aboveground communities have generally focused on soil organisms and antagonists of plant shoots and leaves (herbivores). Despite the widespread occurrence of plant mutualists below- and aboveground which can occur on the same host plant, the potential for interactions between them has not been considered. Here we demonstrate that aboveground plant mutualists, insect pollinators, are strongly influenced by belowground plant mutualists, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the roots of Chamerion angustifolium increased pollinator visitation and per cent seed set of this plant in the field by up to two times compared with non-mycorrhizal plants. We propose that interactions between belowground and aboveground mutualisms are widespread and may play important functional roles in populations and communities.

AB Induced defences, such as the predator avoidance morphologies in amphibians, result from spatial or temporal variability in predation risk. One important component of this variability should be the difference in hunting strategies between predators. However, little is known about how specific and effective induced defences are to different types of predators. We analysed the impact of both pursuing (fish, Gasterosteus aculeatus) and sit-and-wait (dragonfly, Aeshna cyanea) predators on tadpole (Rana dalmatina) morphology and performance (viz locomotive performance and growth rate). We also investigated the potential benefits of the predator-induced phenotype in the presence of fish predators. Both predators induced deeper tail fins in tadpoles exposed to threat of predation, and stickleback presence also induced longer tails and deeper tail muscles. Morphological and behavioural differences resulted in better escape ability of stickleback-induced tadpoles, leading to improved survival in the face of stickleback predation. These results clearly indicate that specific morphological responses to different types of predators have evolved in R. dalmatina. The specific morphologies suggest low correlations between the traits involved in the defence. Independence of traits allows prey species to fine-tune their response according to current predation risk, so that the benefit of the defence can be maximal.

AB Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is an ongoing threat to potato and tomato crop production worldwide and considerable fundamental and applied research is conducted with the long-term aim of improved disease control. Understanding the mechanisms, processes and rates of P. infestans evolution is an important factor in predicting the effectiveness and durability of new management practices. A range of phenotypic and genotypic tests has been applied to achieve this goal, but each has limitations and new methods are sought. Recent progress in P. infestans genomics is providing the raw data for such methods and new high-throughput codominant biomolecular markers are currently being developed that have tremendous potential in the study of P. infestans population biology, epidemiology, ecology, genetics and evolution. This paper reviews some key applications, recommends some changes in approach and reports on the status and potential of new and existing methods for probing P. infestans genetic diversity.

AB 1. We used stream fish and decapod spatial occurrence data extracted from a national database and recent surveys with geospatial landuse data, geomorphologic, climatic, and spatial data in a geographical information system (GIS) to model fish and decapod occurrence in the Wellington Region, New Zealand.
   2. To predict the occurrence of each species at a site from a common set of predictor variables we used a multi-response, artificial neural network (ANN), to produce a single model that predicted the entire fish and decapod assemblage in one procedure.
   3. The predictions from the ANN using this landscape scale data proved very accurate based on evaluation metrics that are independent of species abundance or probability thresholds. The important variables contributing to the predictions included the latitudinal and elevational position of the site reach, catchment area, average air temperature, the vegetation type, landuse proportions of the catchment, and catchment geology.
   4. Geospatial data available for the entire regional river network were then used to create a habitat-suitability map for all 14 species over the regional river network using a GIS. This prediction map has many potential uses including: monitoring and predicting temporal changes in fish communities caused by human activities and shifts in climate, identifying areas in need of protection, biodiversity hotspots, and areas suitable for the reintroduction of endangered or rare species.

AB Butterflies in the large Palearctic genus Agrodiaetus ( Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) are extremely uniform and exhibit few distinguishing morphological characters. However, these insects are distinctive in one respect: as a group they possess among the greatest interspecific karyotype diversity in the animal kingdom, with chromosome numbers (n) ranging from 10 to 125. The monophyly of Agrodiaetus and its systematic position relative to other groups within the section Polyommatus have been controversial. Characters from the mitochondrial genes for cytochrome oxidases I and II and from the nuclear gene for elongation factor 1alpha were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of Agrodiaetus using maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic methods. Ninety-one individuals, encompassing most of the taxonomic diversity of Agrodiaetus, and representatives of 14 related genera were included in this analysis. Our data indicate that Agrodiaetus is monophyletic. Representatives of the genus Polyommatus ( sensu stricto) are the closest relatives. The sequences of the Agrodiaetus taxa in this analysis are tentatively arranged into 12 clades, only 1 of which corresponds to a species group traditionally recognized in Agrodiaetus. Heterogeneous substitution rates across a recovered topology were homogenized with a nonparametric rate-smoothing algorithm before the application of a molecular clock. Two published estimates of substitution rates dated the origin of Agrodiaetus between 2.51 and 3.85 million years ago. During this time, there was heterogeneity in the rate and direction of karyotype evolution among lineages within the genus. Karyotype instability has evolved independently three times in the section Polyommatus, within the lineages Agrodiaetus, Lysandra, and Plebicula. Rapid karyotype diversification may have played a significant role in the radiation of the genus Agrodiaetus.

AB The application of no-take marine-reserve status to an area is expected to increase spawning-stock biomass of species targeted by fisheries, and to help sustain fisheries external to the reserve. However, empirical evidence on rates and patterns of increase of density and biomass of target species following closures to fishing, and of decrease when reserve status is removed, remains rare. We have monitored density and biomass of large predatory coral-reef fish (Serranidae [Epinephelinae], Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae, and Carangidae, as a group) visually in two small no-take marine reserves and at two control (open to fishing) sites in the Philippines from 1983 to 2000. At Sumilon reserve a complex history of management allowed 13 measurements of density and biomass at durations of reserve protection of -3 yr (i.e., fished for 3 years after reserve status removed) to 9 yr. At Apo reserve 13 measurements were taken at durations of protection of 1-18 yr. We recorded 11 significant (P < 0.05) changes in density at the four sites over the 17 years, three declines and eight increases. All three significant declines occurred when reserve protection was removed. Four of the eight significant increases occurred when reserve status was applied. This represents some of the best evidence currently available that application of marine-reserve status causes increases in abundance of target species. Three of the four significant increases in density required 4-6 yr of protection. Significant positive linear correlations of mean density of large predators against years 4 reserve protection were observed at both reserves. The pattern of increase of mean biomass against years of reserve protection was exponential, with biomass initially increasing more slowly than density. Density and biomass increased by factors of 12.2 and 17.3, respectively, during 18 yr of continuous protection in Apo reserve. At Sumilon Island three bouts of unregulated fishing of 1.5-3 yr duration eliminated density and biomass gains accumulated over 5-9 yr of marine reserve protection.

AB Due primarily to anthropogenic influences such as land use change, exotic species introductions, livestock grazing, altered hunting regimes, and predator control, wild ungulate populations have undergone tremendous shifts in recent decades. Although the result has been endangerment or extirpation in some regions, ungulate numbers have increased to locally or regionally high levels in other areas, causing shifts in plant species composition, problems for forest regeneration, and conflict with humans and domestic livestock. Our ability to find solutions to these problems is limited because we lack sufficient understanding of how ungulate species interact with predators, habitat, forage, competing species, and humans at multiple scales from small foraging patches to large regions.
   To bring together new findings in this area, encompassing various scales and foci of investigation, an international conference on "Forest Dynamics and Ungulate Herbivory" was held from 3 to 6 October 2001 in Davos, Switzerland. We provide a synthetic overview of the papers contained in this Special Issue, arising from that conference. A companion Special Issue of the Journal for Nature Conservation is devoted to the more management-oriented aspects of forest-ungulate interactions, entitled "Forest-Ungulate Interactions: Monitoring, Modeling and Management."
   From the papers in this issue, a number of important generalizations emerge to guide our understanding and further research. Our predictive understanding of foraging ecology needs to be generalized and scaled up, if it is to become useful for predicting the consequences of herbivory for broad-scale vegetation dynamics. Further, it is important to move beyond single-factor studies, to embrace the complexity of ungulate-vegetation interactions. The direction and magnitude of ungulate influences can be difficult to gauge because of complex interactions among species, structural units of vegetation or landscapes, ecosystem processes, and natural disturbances. Researchers need to look beyond the simplistic concept of "game damage", and comprehensively address the direct and indirect effects of ungulates on communities, ecosystems and landscapes. This may require a more systems-oriented, and less species-oriented approach. Ungulate-vegetation interactions need to be better understood over multiple scales, and particularly at the coarser scales that are of interest to managers and policy-makers. Finally, a long-term view of ungulate-vegetation interactions, where past, present, and future effects are considered in their appropriate temporal context, is absolutely essential.

AB To investigate the effects of urbanization on carabid beetles (Carabidae) and ground dwelling spiders (Araneae) a study was completed along a 20 km urban-rural forest gradient in the Helsinki-Espoo area of southern Finland. To study changes in assemblage structure, abundance and species richness, these taxa were collected in the year 2000 using pitfall traps, which had been placed in four forest sites within each of the urban, suburban and rural zones. We expected to find changes in the abundances and species richnesses in the two taxa across the urban-rural gradient, but did not find any. Our second and third hypotheses, stating that generalist species and small-bodied species should gain dominance along the gradient from rural to urban sites, were partly supported as carabid specialists were more characteristic of suburban and rural environments whereas generalists were more likely to be collected from rural areas compared to suburban or urban sites. Furthermore, medium to large-sized carabid individuals were more likely to be collected in the rural sites compared to urban forests. We found no evidence for significant changes in spider abundance or species richness across the urban-rural gradient in relation to body size or habitat specialization. We suggest that urbanization does not have significant effects on the total abundances and species richnesses in these two taxa. However, individual species responded differently to urbanization, and there were significant differences in the specialization and body sizes of carabids across the gradient.

AB We used the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method to obtain genetic markers distinguishing two subspecies of willow warblers Phylloscopus trochilus that have different migratory behaviours but are not differentiated in mitochondrial DNA or at several microsatellite loci. With the inverse-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach we converted a dominant AFLP-marker to a codominant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Across Scandinavia we typed 621 birds at the SNP locus AFLP-WW1 and we found a sigmoid change in allele frequencies centred around 62 degrees latitude. North of the latitudinal cline was a west-east cline. Both clines are narrower than one would expect from dispersal distances in willow warblers, which suggests that these are maintained by selection. The latitudinal cline at the locus AFLP-WW1 is paralleled by changes in several other traits, all of which might be maintained by a single selective force. The most plausible selection factor that we have identified is selection against hybrids because of inferior migratory behaviour. The selective force maintaining the east-west cline is less obvious. We discuss alternatives to the selection scenario, involving colonization history and asymmetric gene flow.

AB We present results from an ongoing field study conducted in Kansas grassland to examine correlates of invasibility and community stability along a natural gradient of plant diversity. Invasibility was evaluated by sowing seeds of 34 plant species into 40 experimental plots and then measuring colonization success after two growing seasons. Compositional stability, defined as resistance to change in species relative abundances over two growing seasons and in response to experimental disturbance, was measured in a separate set of 40 plots.
   We found that community susceptibility to invasion was greatest in high diversity microsites within this grassland. Multiple regression analyses suggested that the positive correlation between invasibility and plant diversity was due to the direct influences of the extrinsic factors that contribute to spatial variation in diversity (soil disturbances; light availability), not to any direct impact of diversity. In addition, we found that compositional stability in response to disturbance was greatest within low diversity microsites and was strongly related to the dominance (evenness) component of diversity.

AB 1. Spatial correlations between ecological patterns and processes are thought to be scale-dependent, yet surprisingly few studies have evaluated the correspondence between different levels of spatial scale and ecosystem structure and function.
   2. We evaluated the strength of relationships between the benthic macroinvertebrate communities of stony littoral habitats and levels of ecological scale and geographical position, using partial constrained ordination. Our hypothesis was that correlation strength would be inversely related to ecological scale, i.e. habitat > ecosystem > riparian > catchment > ecoregion.
   3. The effect of habitat was greater than that of other levels of spatial scale: 23% of the variance in taxonomic composition and 11% of that in functional composition was explained by habitat variables alone. However, greater spatial scales were also important. For example, the combined influence of riparian, catchment and ecoregion classification accounted for 24% (taxonomic) and 11% (functional) of the explained variance.
   4. Relationships between organisms and scale variables were, however, non-linear and a substantial amount of the functional variance was hidden in joint effects. These findings were not unexpected, and presumably indicate a close interdependence between local and regional-scale variables.

AB Understanding the natural variability in the stable carbon isotope composition of vegetation and soils can aid studies of soil carbon dynamics, and is a prerequisite for using C-13 as a natural tracer when vegetation communities change from one photosynthetic pathway to another (e.g. C4 pasture grasses replacing C3 forests). To examine the geographic and vertical patterns of delta(13)C under mature rain forest vegetation, we measured the isotopic composition of leaf litter, roots, and mineral soil profiles in 35 plots located in a 140,000-ha study region in northeastern Costa Rica. We hypothesized that soil carbon isotopic composition would be closely coupled to the signature of detrital inputs (the average delta(13)C of forest floor and fine-root biomass) and that the increase in delta(13)C with depth would be related to abiotic variables that influence soil carbon turnover rates. The correlations between surface soil isotopic composition (0-10 cm) and biophysical factors varied across the landscape. In multiple regression analyses, combinations of soil particle-size distribution and soil C/N ratio explained between 60% and 82% of the variation in surface soil isotopic composition for different regions in the landscape, but the isotopic composition of litter and roots did not explain any additional variation. The isotopic composition of litter, roots, and surface soils (0-20 cm) was fairly similar over large, regional gradients of elevation and edaphic properties (the range of variation was 2.6parts per thousand), but diverged considerably at depths below 20 cm (up to 5.8parts per thousand differences). These large regional differences in the isotopic composition of soil C at depth are attributed to variation in soil carbon turnover rates across the landscape. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB High body mass caused by fat storage during migration is believed to increase a bird's risk of predation by decreasing its ability to escape predators. We demonstrate the negative effect of wing loading (mass/wing area) on escape speed and angle of two migrating species of shorebird. We also show significant differences in escape performance between the species and genders. To help explain these differences, we test two potential proximate causes, wing shape and leg bone length. Wing shape is correlated with differences in escape performance between the species, but we found no correlation of wing shape or leg bone length with gender. Ultimately, greater predation risk due to habitat use or larger body size, for the species and genders respectively, may have resulted in evolution of enhanced escape ability.

AB The beetle Osmoderma eremita has received much attention in the last few years, as it is among those species with the highest priority in the European Union's Habitat Directive. In this paper the species is evaluated as a potential indicator and umbrella species for the endangered beetle fauna in tree hollows. To be useful as an indicator of a species-rich fauna it should be easy to inventory and be strongly correlated with the presence of other species. An umbrella species is a species which is so demanding that the protection of this species will automatically save many others. The species richness of saproxylic beetles and occupancy of O. eremita were surveyed in tree hollows in an area in southeastern Sweden by assessing the presence/absence of living and dead adults (including fragments) and larvae. The species richness was higher when O. eremita was present, both at tree and stand level. Several threatened species were associated with the presence of O. eremita, whereas others did not correlate with the occurrence of O. eremita. As O. eremita is easy to find and identify, it is useful as an indicator of stands with a rich beetle fauna in tree hollows. Osmoderma eremita can be used as an umbrella species, because if measures are taken to conserve O. eremita, many other species in the same habitat are also conserved. However, there are some beetles in tree hollows which seem to be more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than O. eremita, and may go extinct if only O. eremita is taken into consideration.

AB Empirical validation that putative umbrella species protect many co-occurring species is rare. Using 10 sets of data, representing two taxonomic groups and three ecoregions, we tested the effectiveness of a recently developed index for selection of umbrella species. We also tested whether species identified with the index were more effective umbrellas than species selected at random, evaluated whether sample size and intensity affect selection of umbrella species, and examined whether the index could identify cross-taxonomic umbrellas in a single ecoregion. Conserving all locations with at least one umbrella species would protect the vast majority of each assemblage. A more realistic scenario, conservation of subsets of locations with relatively high numbers of umbrella species, generally would protect greater than or equal to0.75 of each assemblage. Randomly selected sets of species often required that more locations be designated for protection than did sets selected using the umbrella index. The umbrella index tended to identify fewer locations that offered an equivalent level of species protection. Sampling intensity affected which species were identified as umbrellas, but not the proportion of species that would be protected. Umbrella species were no more effective than randomly selected species for cross-taxonomic applications; nonetheless, neither group was significantly less effective than same-taxon umbrellas. Particularly when selection of protected areas is not highly constrained, it may indeed be feasible to identify effective umbrella species. Unqualified utility of the umbrella index or umbrella species concept, however, is not supported by this study.

AB It is in the nature of today's world that interventionist, rather than protectionist, management strategies are likely to be in greater demand, because an enormous area of the earth's habitable surface has already been transformed by human action. [Holdgate, M.W., 1986. Summary and conclusions: characteristics and consequences of biological invasions. In: Kornberg, H., Williamson, M.H. (Eds), Quantitative aspects of the ecology of biological invasions. The Royal Society, London, pp. 733-742]
   Progress with ecological restoration in New Zealand is reviewed. A useful goal for restoration is that of rebuilding, as far as possible, the evolutionary and ecological context of species in the system, i.e. reinstating earlier selection regimes. Opportunities for restoring biological components of these regimes are greater than those available for restoring physical conditions. In this country, effective ecological restoration is not possible without control or eradication of introduced mammals. Descriptive models of systems to be restored are also a necessity for achieving goals. A particular problem is that caused by past extinctions of animal species. Replacement of some extinct species, within particular trophic guilds, with ecologically appropriate and related extant species, is suggested as a possible response to this problem.

AB We studied soil phosphorus (P) fractionation and P-use efficiencies (PUEs) of rainforests along altitudinal gradients (700-3100 m) on two types of parental rocks (sedimentary versus ultrabasic) on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. Sedimentary rocks were known to contain more quartz (which does not adsorb P) than ultrabasic rocks. The pool (top 30 cm) of total P was always greater on sedimentary (ranging from 34.9 to 72.6 g m(-2)) than on ultrabasic (9.0-29.2 g m(-2)) rocks at comparable altitudes. Accordingly, the pools of organic P and labile inorganic P were always greater on sedimentary than on ultrabasic rocks. The pool of primary mineral, calcium P increased upslope from 1.7 to 4.3 g m(-2) on sedimentary rock, suggesting that the altitudinal sequence of the sites reflected a decreasing magnitude of soil weathering upslope. The pool of calcium P on ultrabasic rock did not vary consistently with altitude (1.2-2.8 g m(-2)), probably reflecting the greater between-site variability of primary mineral P in parent rocks. When all sites were compared, the pool of most labile, bicarbonate-extracted inorganic P increased (ranging from 0.02 to 1.85 g m(-2)) with increasing calcium P. Calcium P was therefore considered to be an important P source to the biota on Kinabalu. Gross patterns in the variation of PUE (indexed as the reciprocal of the P concentration in litter) were best explained by the pool size of actively cycling P (total P minus occluded inorganic P). PUE, however, demonstrated distinct altitudinal patterns to generate an intricate conrol of P use pattern by soil P pools and altitude.

AB Fine scale variations and microscale spatial patterns of fungal biomass, bacterial biomass and soil properties were examined in a hardwood forest in southern Ohio. Two 0.5 x 2.0 m macroplots and four 10 x 10 cm microplots were established 0.25 m upslope and downslope of the base of a red oak (Quercus rubra) tree in a mixed oak forest in southeastern Ohio. These plots were sampled in a regular grid pattern for bacterial and fungal biomass, organic C, pH and moisture. Semivariance analysis was used to determine the degree of spatial autocorrelation among the samples from each plot. Significant linear/sill models for microbial and soil variables were produced for the two macroplots and the majority of the microplots. The proportion of variation accounted for by spatial pattern ranged from 0 to 100% for microbial variables, depending on location and variable. Patterns of variation for all variables measured in all plots were mapped using kriging. From the semivariance analysis, the kriged maps and path analysis, it became apparent that the spatial patterns of microbial biomass and organic C were condensed upslope of the tree base and expanded downslope below the tree base. Overall, the results indicate that considerable spatial variability in fungal and bacterial biomass exists at the 1-10 cm scale, and that this variability can be adequately managed by sampling in a pattern which takes into account both random and non-random (spatial) components of variation.

AB Selected water regime indices are used to describe the tolerances to flooding and exposure of littoral and floodplain plants of the River Murray, South Australia. The cover and abundance of 26 perennial species were surveyed at 12 sites along a reach where water levels were influenced by weir operations. Six indices were measured: days when water depths were greater than or equal to 0, 0-20, 20-60 and greater than or equal to 200 cm; days when plants were exposed to greater than or equal to 100 cm of water; and days of longest exposure to water. Ordinations of plant abundances were correlated with the frequency of flooding to 0-20 and 20-60 cm, and exposure to greater than or equal to 100 cm. Five species clusters were apparent, these being common floodplain species (e.g. Muehlenbeckia florulenta), uncommon floodplain species (e.g. Eleocharis acuta), species from the infrequently flooded littoral (e.g. Bolboschoenus caldwellii), species from the permanently flooded littoral (e.g. Vallisneria americana) and widespread, common species tolerant to flooding and exposure (11 species, including Phragmites australis, Cyperus gymnocaulos and Bolboschoenus medianus). Half of the 26 species occurred in at least four of seven regimes suggested by cluster analysis of water regime indices, thus indicating a broad tolerance to flooding and exposure. Preferred water regimes are summarised using minimum and maximum values and quartiles for the six indices, and similarities between preferences are illustrated by a model based on minimum spanning tree techniques.

AB We used an ecological model to simulate the trajectories of mangrove attributes according to different restoration criteria at geographically specific conditions and at decadal time scales. This model can contribute to the design and implementation of restoration projects, and also be used to verify key mechanisms controlling ecosystem attributes during the recovery period. An existing gap model of mangrove wetlands, FORMAN, was used to simulate restoration trajectories in one of the largest estuary rehabilitation projects (128 000 ha) in South America, Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta, Colombia (CGSM). Recovery of a disturbed mangrove forest based on simulations of basal area following reductions of salinity to 40 g/kg within 2 yr or 10 yr time periods suggests that in both cases dominance would reach about 75% of that in the reference site (80 m(2)/ha) in 40 yr, Both forests are > 80% dominated by Avicennia, and Laguncularia has greater basal area than Rhizophora in the remaining structure. Simulations of forest recovery with a 25 yr target for salinity reduction show that only about 50% one the basal area in the reference site is recovered after 40 yr, After 40 yr of recovery, both the 2 and 10 yr salinity targets produce higher basal area and different patterns of community composition (Laguncularia becomes the dominant species) under enhanced recruitment (planting program) than observed under more natural recruitment. Ecological models can be used to establish trajectories of mangrove response to a variety of initial site conditions at spatially explicit locations that can improve engineering designs, project operation, and more clearly define monitoring programs and natural resource valuation. Modelling techniques can be used to identify the appropriate spatial and temporal scales of problems associated with mangrove restoration projects that could improve our ability to conserve and manage one of the most valuable forested wetlands in the tropical coastal zone.

AB In the southern part of Korup National Park, Cameroon, nine replicate plots (40 x 80 m) in forest with low abundances (5-15% of the basal area of all trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh [girth at breast height]; LEM) and nine with high abundances (45-68%; HEM) of ectomycorrhizal caesalpiniaceous legumes were selected from an earlier enumeration along an east-west 5-km transect. The codominant caesalps in HEM plots were Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata, and T. moreliana, and ordination showed the LEM and HEM plots to be floristically distinct. The HEM plots lay in a large well-defined patch of these caesalps, set within surrounding LEM forest. A further contrast to HEM forest was achieved by selecting six LEM and six VLEM plots (very low, approximate to 0% ectomycorrhizal trees) on a second transect 12 km to the north. Korup has an annual rainfall of 5180 mm with one very distinct 3-mo dry season (December-February). The soils are sandy, acidic, and very phosphorus poor. The aim was to determine whether LEM and HEM plots differed in their litter and soil phosphorus status and the characteristics of their phosphorus cycles.
   On 13 occasions between August 1988 and September 1990, litter and soils in the surface root layer and the mineral layer 5 cm below were sampled on the main transect and analyzed for phosphorus fractions. This analysis distinguished between inorganic and organic forms and provided various measures of lability. Nitrogen and carbon contents, pH, and moisture contents of each layer, depth of the root layer, and amounts of litter (i.e., litter mass) and soil were the other main variables. In a subset of plots, leaf litterfall was collected over the period and analyzed for phosphorus and nitrogen, and two litter-bag experiments in early wet seasons estimated rates of litter disappearance. Root biomass and change with depth were estimated from pit samples within the plots.
   HEM plots had slightly higher mean basal area of trees than LEM plots (32.3 and 27.1 m(2)/ha, respectively) and higher fine root (less than or equal to 5 mm diameter) biomasses (519 and 364 g/m(2), 0-5 cm), but the same mean litter mass (155 g/m(2)) and annual leaf litterfall (720 g/m(2)) and very similar disappearance rates (1.82 g.m(-2).d(-1) on litterfall/mass basis; t(1/2) of 53 d from litter bags). Litter mass (and litterfall) reached a clear peak in the mid-dry season in both HEM and LEM plots (slightly earlier in HEM), almost completely disappearing by mid-wet season. The phosphorus concentrations in HEM falling leaf litter was much greater than in LEM (801 and 676 mu g/g) leading to greater inputs (1.79 and 1.35 mg.m(-2).d(-1)), while for nitrogen the concentrations and inputs were very similar (means 17.8 mg/g, 35.3 mg.m(-2).d(-1)). An important feature was the marked peak in phosphorus (but not nitrogen) concentration in litter in the HEM plots only in those years that did not follow a mast fruiting.
   Depth of the root layer was greater in the HEM than LEM plots (8.1 and 4.2 mm), as was carbon content (5.5 and 4.0%), but bulk density was less (0.85 and 1.30 g/cm(3)). Moisture contents, which tracked the seasons in all three layers, were slightly higher in HEM than LEM, as were clay and silt contents, but pH values were lower (4.19 and 4.59, root layer). The relative differences in the eight soil phosphorus fractions (resin-, bicarbonate- and NaOH-extractable, and chloroform-labile, inorganic, and organic) plus residual and total phosphorus were remarkably consistent between HEM and LEM plots. In the root layer total phosphorus was much higher in HEM than LEM plots (309 and 186 mu g/g, respectively) and likewise in the mineral layer (192 and 119 mu g/g, respectively): HEM/LEM ratios of approximate to 1.6 were maintained across nearly all fractions. Covariance analysis indicated that the basal areas of LEM and HEM plots could not account for the differences in phosphorus concentrations.
   Different fractions followed different trends with time, but these did not match seasons and showed, for the more labile inorganic phosphorus fractions especially, a linear decline over the study period. Interactions between forest type and date (split-plot repeated-measures analysis of variance) were rarely significant even though date itself invariably was. In marked contrast, nitrogen fractions did not decline, and labile organic nitrogen showed clear seasonal peaks. Differences between the LEM forest on the two transects (two occasions in common) were small and inconsistent, supporting the wider contrast. with HEM plots. Principal components analysis of the phosphorus and nitrogen fractions showed a strong discrimination between LEM and HEM plots. Calculation with amounts of phosphorus in the top 6 cm of the soil showed very similar patterns to the concentrations.
   Large ectomycorrhizal trees appeared to have increased the depth of the surface root layer, its phosphorus content, the labile phosphorus fraction (notably its organic component), and to have enhanced phosphorus cycling. The role of ectomycorrhizas in this process is discussed. The decline in labile phosphorus is explained by a phenological and climatic ectomycorrhizal response (PACER) hypothesis that highlights the relationship between phosphorus demand in mast fruiting years and soil phosphorus concentrations. The importance of this in adaptations by ectomycorrhizal caesalps to this strongly seasonal and phosphorus-poor site is considered.

AB I contrasted the short-term and long-term effects of predation risk on snail habitat use and resource dynamics. Pulmonate snails (Physella gyrina) were placed into experimental pools and exposed to four levels of predation risk while holding their density constant. Periphyton resources were made available in two habitats: open and covered. I hypothesized that a behavioral response by snails to predation risk would influence periphyton standing crop in the open and covered habitats, Snails responded to increasing predation risk by moving into safer. (covered) habitats, and the magnitude of their response was sensitive to the actual level of risk: intermediate levels of risk resulted in intermediate habitat use. However, nse of the risky (open) habitat by snails was time dependent. Snails initially responded strongly to predation risk, but they exhibited similar patterns of habitat use at all risk levels by the end of the experiment. Periphyton standing crop was positively related to predation risk. In contrast to snail habitat use, this response was initially weak and became stronger as the experiment progressed. Thus. the short-/and long-term responses of snail habitat use and periphyton standing crop contrasted sharply. I suggest that the changing patterns of snail habitat use over time are consistent with the idea that snails balance predation risk against foraging gains when selecting habitats and that the manner in which they balance foraging gains and predation risk determines the pattern of periphyton standing crops across habitats.

AB In this study, we investigate whether a tissue-level constraint can explain the general inverse relationship between growth rate and precocity of development in birds. On the whole, altricial (dependent) chicks grow three for four times faster than the less dependent, more able chicks of precocial species of similar adult mass. We suggest that an antagonism between growth and acquisition of mature function in skeletal muscle constrains postnatal growth and development in most species of birds. Altricial species, represented by European starlings in this study, hatch with skeletal muscle having low capacity for generating force but grow rapidly. Conversely, precocial species (northern bobwhite quail and Japanese quail), hatch with relatively mature skeletal muscle, especially in their legs, but grow more slowly. As development proceeds in all species, exponential growth rates decrease as muscles acquire adults levels of function. Among four variables associated with muscle function, exponential growth rate (EGR) was negatively correlated with pyruvate kinase activity (glycolysis), potassium concentration (electrical potential), and dry weight fraction (contractile proteins) in both pectoral and leg muscles but not with citrate synthase activity (aerobic metabolism) in either set of muscles. For pectoral muscle, these variables accounted for 87% of the total variation in EGR in all three species combined despite a twofold difference in growth rates between the starling and quail. EGRs of leg muscle (51% of variation accounted for) were less than predicted by the pectoral-muscle equation in quail during the early part of the postnatal period and in starling during the late postnatal period. This result would not contradict a growth rate-maturity constraint hypothesis if EGRs were down-regulated for allometric other considerations.

AB Non-native tree (NNT) species have been transported worldwide to create or enhance services that are fundamental for human well-being, such as timber provision, erosion control or ornamental value; yet NNTs can also produce undesired effects, such as fire proneness or pollen allergenicity. Despite the variety of effects that NNTs have on multiple ecosystem services, a global quantitative assessment of their costs and benefits is still lacking. Such information is critical for decision-making, management and sustainable exploitation of NNTs. We present here a global assessment of NNT effects on the three main categories of ecosystem services, including regulating (RES), provisioning (PES) and cultural services (CES), and on an ecosystem disservice (EDS), i.e. pollen allergenicity. By searching the scientific literature, country forestry reports, and social media, we compiled a global data set of 1683 case studies from over 125 NNT species, covering 44 countries, all continents but Antarctica, and seven biomes. Using different meta-analysis techniques, we found that, while NNTs increase most RES (e.g. climate regulation, soil erosion control, fertility and formation), they decrease PES (e.g. NNTs contribute less than native trees to global timber provision). Also, they have different effects on CES (e.g. increase aesthetic values but decrease scientific interest), and no effect on the EDS considered. NNT effects on each ecosystem (dis)service showed a strong context dependency, varying across NNT types, biomes and socio-economic conditions. For instance, some RES are increased more by NNTs able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, and when the ecosystem is located in low-latitude biomes; some CES are increased more by NNTs in less-wealthy countries or in countries with higher gross domestic products. The effects of NNTs on several ecosystem (dis)services exhibited some synergies (e.g. among soil fertility, soil formation and climate regulation or between aesthetic values and pollen allergenicity), but also trade-offs (e.g. between fire regulation and soil erosion control). Our analyses provide a quantitative understanding of the complex synergies, trade-offs and context dependencies involved for the effects of NNTs that is essential for attaining a sustained provision of ecosystem services.

AB Acarological surveys in areas outside the currently believed leading edge of the distribution of lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum), coupled with recent reports of their identification in previously uninvaded areas in the public health literature, suggest that this species is more broadly distributed in North America than currently understood. Therefore, we evaluated the potential geographic extent under present and future conditions using ecological niche modeling approach based on museum records available for this species at the Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (WRBU). The median prediction of a best fitting model indicated that lone star ticks are currently likely to be present in broader regions across the Eastern Seaboard as well as in the Upper Midwest, where this species could be expanding its range. Further northward and westward expansion of these ticks can be expected as a result of ongoing climate change, under both low- and high-emissions scenarios.

AB Fire refugia are landscape elements that remain unburned or minimally affected by fire, thereby supporting postfire ecosystem function, biodiversity, and resilience to disturbances. Although fire refugia have been studied across continents, scales, and affected taxa, they have not been characterized systematically over space and time, which is crucial for understanding their role in facilitating resilience in the context of global change. We identify four dichotomies that delineate an overarching conceptual framework of fire refugia: unburned versus lower severity, species-specific versus landscape-process characteristics, predictable versus stochastic, and ephemeral versus persistent. We outline the principal concepts underlying the ecological function of fire refugia and describe both the role of fire refugia and uncertainties regarding their persistence under global change. An improved understanding of fire refugia is crucial to conservation given the role that humans play in shaping disturbance regimes across landscapes.

AB In a rapidly changing climate, alpine plants may persist by adapting to new conditions. However, the rate at which the climate is changing might exceed the rate of adaptation through evolutionary processes in long-lived plants. Persistence may depend on phenotypic plasticity in morphology and physiology. Here we investigated patterns of leaf trait variation including leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nutrients (C, N, P) and isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) across an elevation gradient on Gongga Mountain, Sichuan Province, China. We quantified inter- and intra-specific trait variation and the plasticity in leaf traits of selected species to experimental warming and cooling by using a reciprocal transplantation approach. We found substantial phenotypic plasticity in most functional traits where ON, leaf area, and leaf P showed greatest plasticity. These traits did not correspond with traits with the largest amount of intraspecific variation. Plasticity in leaf functional traits tended to enable plant populations to shift their trait values toward the mean values of a transplanted plants' destination community, but only if that population started with very different trait values. These results suggest that leaf trait plasticity is an important mechanism for enabling plants to persist within communities and to better tolerate changing environmental conditions under climate change.

AB Governance is one of the most important factors for ensuring effective environmental management and conservation actions. Yet, there is still a relative paucity of comprehensive and practicable guidance that can be used to frame the evaluation, design, and analysis of systems of environmental governance. This conceptual review and synthesis article seeks to addresses this problem through resituating the broad body of governance literature into a practical framework for environmental governance. Our framework builds on a rich history of governance scholarship to propose that environmental governance has four general aims or objectives - to be effective, to be equitable, to be responsive, and to be robust. Each of these four objectives need to be considered simultaneously across the institutional, structural, and procedural elements of environmental governance. Through a review of the literature, we developed a set of attributes for each of these objectives and relate these to the overall capacity, functioning, and performance of environmental governance. Our aim is to provide a practical and adaptable framework that can be applied to the design, evaluation, and analysis of environmental governance in different social and political contexts, to diverse environmental problems and modes of governance, and at a range of scales.

AB Local-scale microclimatic conditions in forest understoreys play a key role in shaping the composition, diversity and function of these ecosystems. Consequently, understanding what drives variation in forest microclimate is critical to forecasting ecosystem responses to global change, particularly in the tropics where many species already operate close to their thermal limits and rapid land-use transformation is profoundly altering local environments. Yet our ability to characterize forest microclimate at ecologically meaningful scales remains limited, as understorey conditions cannot be directly measured from outside the canopy. To address this challenge, we established a network of microclimate sensors across a land-use intensity gradient spanning from old-growth forests to oil-palm plantations in Borneo. We then combined these observations with high-resolution airborne laser scanning data to characterize how topography and canopy structure shape variation in microclimate both locally and across the landscape. In the processes, we generated high-resolution microclimate surfaces spanning over 350 km(2), which we used to explore the potential impacts of habitat degradation on forest regeneration under both current and future climate scenarios. We found that topography and vegetation structure were strong predictors of local microclimate, with elevation and terrain curvature primarily constraining daily mean temperatures and vapour pressure deficit (VPD), whereas canopy height had a clear dampening effect on microclimate extremes. This buffering effect was particularly pronounced on wind-exposed slopes but tended to saturate once canopy height exceeded 20 m-suggesting that despite intensive logging, secondary forests remain largely thermally buffered. Nonetheless, at a landscape-scale microclimate was highly heterogeneous, with maximum daily temperatures ranging between 24.2 and 37.2 degrees C and VPD spanning two orders of magnitude. Based on this, we estimate that by the end of the century forest regeneration could be hampered in degraded secondary forests that characterize much of Borneo's lowlands if temperatures continue to rise following projected trends.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs are one prominent strategy to address economic externalities of resource extraction and commodity production, improving both social and ecological outcomes. But do PES and related incentive programs achieve that lofty goal? Along with considerable enthusiasm, PES has faced a wide range of substantial critiques. In this paper, we characterize seven major classes of concerns associated with common PES designs, and use these as inspiration to consider potential avenues for improvements in PES outcomes and uptake. The problems include (1) new externalities, (2) misplacement of rights and responsibilities, (3) crowding out existing motivations, (4) efficiency-equity tradeoffs, (5) monitoring costs, (6) limited applicability, and (7) top-down prescription/alienating agency. As currently practiced, many PES programs are thus of limited benefit and even potentially detrimental to sustainability. From this dire conclusion, we highlight several innovations that might be combined and extended in a novel approach to PES that may address all seven problems. Recognizing that PES necessarily articulate and even normalize values, our proposed approach entails designing these institutions intentionally to articulate rights and responsibilities conducive to sustainability those we might collectively seek to entrench. Problems remain, and new ones may arise, but the proposed approach may offer a way to reimagine PES as a major social and economic tool for enabling sustainable relationships with nature, conserving and restoring ecosystems and their benefits for people now and in the future.

AB Coral reefs have entered an era of 'ecological crisis' as climate change drives catastrophic reef loss worldwide. Coral growth and stress susceptibility are regulated by their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium). The phylogenetic diversity of Symbiodinium frequently corresponds to patterns of coral health and survival, but knowledge of functional diversity is ultimately necessary to reconcile broader ecological success over space and time. We explore here functional traits underpinning the complex biology of Symbiodinium that spans free-living algae to coral endosymbionts. In doing so we propose a mechanistic framework integrating the primary traits of resource acquisition and utilisation as a means to explain Symbiodinium functional diversity and to resolve the role of Symbiodinium in driving the stability of coral reefs under an uncertain future.

AB Aim We studied global variation in beta diversity patterns of lake macrophytes using regional data from across the world. Specifically, we examined (1) how beta diversity of aquatic macrophytes is partitioned between species turnover and nestedness within each study region, and (2) which environmental characteristics structure variation in these beta diversity components.
   Location Global.
   Methods We used presence-absence data for aquatic macrophytes from 21 regions distributed around the world. We calculated pairwise-site and multiple-site beta diversity among lakes within each region using SOrensen dissimilarity index and partitioned it into turnover and nestedness coefficients. Beta regression was used to correlate the diversity coefficients with regional environmental characteristics.
   Results Aquatic macrophytes showed different levels of beta diversity within each of the 21 study regions, with species turnover typically accounting for the majority of beta diversity, especially in high-diversity regions. However, nestedness contributed 30-50% of total variation in macrophyte beta diversity in low-diversity regions. The most important environmental factor explaining the three beta diversity coefficients (total, species turnover and nestedness) was elevation range, followed by relative areal extent of freshwater, latitude and water alkalinity range.
   Main conclusions Our findings show that global patterns in beta diversity of lake macrophytes are caused by species turnover rather than by nestedness. These patterns in beta diversity were driven by natural environmental heterogeneity, notably variability in elevation range (also related to temperature variation) among regions. In addition, a greater range in alkalinity within a region, likely amplified by human activities, was also correlated with increased macrophyte beta diversity. These findings suggest that efforts to conserve aquatic macrophyte diversity should primarily focus on regions with large numbers of lakes that exhibit broad environmental gradients.

AB Alterations in gut microbial colonization during early life have been reported in infants that later developed asthma, allergies, type 1 diabetes, as well as in inflammatory bowel disease patients, previous to disease flares. Mechanistic studies in animal models have established that microbial alterations influence disease pathogenesis via changes in immune system maturation. Strong evidence points to the presence of a window of opportunity in early life, during which changes in gut microbial colonization can result in immune dysregulation that predisposes susceptible hosts to disease. Although the ecological patterns of microbial succession in the first year of life have been partly defined in specific human cohorts, the taxonomic and functional features, and diversity thresholds that characterize these microbial alterations are, for the most part, unknown. In this review, we summarize the most important links between the temporal mosaics of gut microbial colonization and the age-dependent immune functions that rely on them. We also highlight the importance of applying ecology theory to design studies that explore the interactions between this complex ecosystem and the host immune system. Focusing research efforts on understanding the importance of temporally structured patterns of diversity, keystone groups, and inter-kingdom microbial interactions for ecosystem functions has great potential to enable the development of biologically sound interventions aimed at maintaining and/or improving immune system development and preventing disease.

AB The recent widespread application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for microbial disease investigations has spurred the development of new bioinformatics tools, including a notable proliferation of phylogenomics pipelines designed for infectious disease surveillance and outbreak investigation. Transitioning the use of WGS data out of the research laboratory and into the front lines of surveillance and outbreak response requires user-friendly, reproducible and scalable pipelines that have been well validated. Single Nucleotide Variant Phylogenomics (SNVPhyl) is a bioinformatics pipeline for identifying high-quality single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and constructing a whole-genome phylogeny from a collection of WGS reads and a reference genome. Individual pipeline components are integrated into the Galaxy bioinformatics framework, enabling data analysis in a user-friendly, reproducible and scalable environment. We show that SNVPhyl can detect SNVs with high sensitivity and specificity, and identify and remove regions of high SNV density (indicative of recombination). SNVPhyl is able to correctly distinguish outbreak from non-outbreak isolates across a range of variant-calling settings, sequencing-coverage thresholds or in the presence of contamination. SNVPhyl is available as a Galaxy workflow, Docker and virtual machine images, and a Unix-based command-line application.

AB F-53B, the commercial product of chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs), has been used in Chinese chrome plating industry for 30 years, and was recently identified in the environment, which caused great concerns. So far, limited investigations have been performed on their environmental occurrence, fate and impact. In this study, we demonstrated the wide occurrence of Cl-PFESAs and their trophic transfer behavior in marine organisms from Chinese Bohai Sea. 6:2 Cl-PFESA (<0.016-0.575 ng/g wet weight) was the dominant congener, and 8:2 CI-PFESA (<0.022-0.040 ng/g) was occasionally detected. Compared to other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) of concern, the levels of Cl-PFESAs were relatively lower in marine organisms. Based on the comparative analysis of CI-PFESA contamination in mollusk samples collected in 2010-2014, both the concentrations and detection frequencies of Cl-PFESAs tended to increase in this region. And this kind of chemicals were more vulnerable to be accumulated in marine organisms at relatively higher trophic levels. Similar to perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and the long chain perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), 6:2 Cl-PFESA could be magnified along the food chain. Accordingly, the potential threat might be posed to the wildlife and human. beings-due to unintended exposure to Cl-PFESAs.

AB As a long-standing biomedical model, rats have been frequently used in studies exploring the correlations between gastrointestinal (GI) bacterial biota and diseases. In the present study, luminal and mucosal samples taken along the longitudinal axis of the rat digestive tract were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based analysis to determine the baseline microbial composition. Results showed that the community diversity increased from the upper to lower GI segments and that the stratification of microbial communities as well as shift of microbial metabolites were driven by biogeographic location. A greater proportion of lactate-producing bacteria (such as Lactobacillus, Turicibacter and Streptococcus) were found in the stomach and small intestine, while anaerobic Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, fermenting carbohydrates and plant aromatic compounds, constituted the bulk of the large-intestinal core microbiota where topologically distinct co-occurrence networks were constructed for the adjacent luminal and mucosal compartments. When comparing the GI microbiota from different hosts, we found that the rat microbial biogeography might represent a new reference, distinct from other murine animals. Our study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the rat GI microbiota landscape for the research community, laying the foundation for better understanding and predicting the disease-related alterations in microbial communities.

AB The environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei causes an estimated 165,000 cases of human melioidosis per year worldwide and is also classified as a biothreat agent. We used whole genome sequences of 469 B. pseudomallei isolates from 30 countries collected over 79 years to explore its geographic transmission. Our data point to Australia as an early reservoir, with transmission to Southeast Asia followed by onward transmission to South Asia and East Asia. Repeated reintroductions were observed within the Malay Peninsula and between countries bordered by the Mekong River. Our data support an African origin of the Central and South American isolates with introduction of B. pseudomallei into the Americas between 1650 and 1850, providing a temporal link with the slave trade. We also identified geographically distinct genes/variants in Australasian or Southeast Asian isolates alone, with virulence-associated genes being among those over-represented. This provides a potential explanation for clinical manifestations of melioidosis that are geographically restricted.

AB Vertebrates perform key roles in ecosystem processes via trophic interactions with plants and insects, but the response of these interactions to environmental change is difficult to quantify in complex systems, such as tropical forests. Here, we use the functional trait structure of Amazonian forest bird assemblages to explore the impacts of land-cover change on two ecosystem processes: seed dispersal and insect predation. We show that trait structure in assemblages of frugivorous and insectivorous birds remained stable after primary forests were subjected to logging and fire events, but that further intensification of human land use substantially reduced the functional diversity and dispersion of traits, and resulted in communities that occupied a different region of trait space. These effects were only partially reversed in regenerating secondary forests. Our findings suggest that local extinctions caused by the loss and degradation of tropical forest are non-random with respect to functional traits, thus disrupting the network of trophic interactions regulating seed dispersal by forest birds and herbivory by insects, with important implications for the structure and resilience of human-modified tropical forests. Furthermore, our results illustrate how quantitative functional traits for specific guilds can provide a range of metrics for estimating the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem processes, and the response of such processes to land-cover change.

AB Explaining the evolution of species geographical ranges is fundamental to understanding how biodiversity is distributed and maintained. The solution to this classic problem in ecology and evolution remains elusive: we still do not fully know how species geographical ranges evolve and what factors fuel range expansions. Resolving this problem is now more crucial than ever with increasing biodiversity loss, global change and movement of species by humans. Here, we describe and evaluate the hypothesis that hybridization between species can contribute to species range expansion. We discuss how such a process can occur and the empirical data that are needed to test this hypothesis. We also examine how species can expand into new environments via hybridization with a resident species, and yet remain distinct species. Generally, hybridization may play an underappreciated role in influencing the evolution of species ranges. Whether-and to what extent-hybridization has such an effect requires further study across more diverse taxa.

   DUPLICATION
AB An unintended consequence of global change is an increase in opportunities for hybridization among previously isolated lineages. Here we illustrate how global change can facilitate the breakdown of reproductive barriers and the formation of hybrids, drawing on the flora of the British Isles for insight. Although global change may ameliorate some of the barriers preventing hybrid establishment, for example by providing new ecological niches for hybrids, it will have limited effects on environment-independent post-zygotic barriers. For example, genic incompatibilities and differences in chromosome numbers and structure within hybrid genomes are unlikely to be affected by global change. We thus speculate that global change will have a larger effect on eroding pre-zygotic barriers (eco-geographical isolation and phenology) than post-zygotic barriers, shifting the relative importance of these two classes of reproductive barriers from what is usually seen in naturally produced hybrids where pre-zygotic barriers are the largest contributors to reproductive isolation. Although the long-term fate of neo-hybrids is still to be determined, the massive impact of global change on the dynamics and distribution of biodiversity generates an unprecedented opportunity to study large numbers of unpredicted, and often replicated, hybridization experiments', allowing us to peer into the birth and death of evolutionary lineages.

AB Although theory suggests geographic variation in species' performance is determined by multiple niche parameters, little consideration has been given to the spatial structure of interacting stressors that may shape local and regional vulnerability to global change. Here, we use spatially explicit mosaics of carbonate chemistry, food availability and temperature spanning 1280 km of coastline to test whether persistent, overlapping environmental mosaics mediate the growth and predation vulnerability of a critical foundation species, the mussel Mytilus californianus. We find growth was highest and predation vulnerability was lowest in dynamic environments with frequent exposure to low pH seawater and consistent food. In contrast, growth was lowest and predation vulnerability highest when exposure to low pH seawater was decoupled from high food availability, or in exceptionally warm locations. These results illustrate how interactions among multiple drivers can cause unexpected, yet persistent geographic mosaics of species performance, interactions and vulnerability to environmental change.

TI Correlates of extinction risk in squamate reptiles: the relative

AB AimEvaluating the relative roles of biological traits and environmental factors that predispose species to an elevated risk of extinction is of fundamental importance to macroecology. Identifying species that possess extinction-promoting traits allows targeted conservation action before precipitous declines occur. Such analyses have been carried out for several vertebrate groups, with the notable exception of reptiles. We identify traits correlating with high extinction risk in squamate reptiles, assess whether these differ with geography, taxonomy and threats, and make recommendations for future Red List assessments.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe collected data on biological traits and environmental factors for a representative sample of 1139 species of squamate reptiles. We used phylogenetically controlled regression models to identify general correlates of extinction risk, threat-specific correlates of risk and realm-specific correlates of risk. We also assessed the relative importance of range size versus other factors through multiplicative bivariate models, partial regressions and variance partitioning.
   ResultsRange size was the most important predictor of extinction risk, reflecting the high frequency of reptiles assessed under range-based IUCN criteria. Habitat specialists occupying accessible ranges were at a greater risk of extinction: although these factors never contributed more than 10% to the variance in extinction risk, they showed significant interactions with range size. The predictive power of our global models ranged from 23% to 29%. The general overall pattern remained the same among geographical, taxonomic and threat-specific data subsets.
   Main conclusionsProactive conservation requires shortcuts to identify species at high risk of extinction. Regardless of location, squamate reptiles that are range-restricted habitat specialists living in areas highly accessible to humans are likely to become extinct first. Prioritizing species that exhibit such traits could forestall extinction. Integration of data sources on human pressures, such as accessibility of species ranges, may aid robust and time-efficient assessments of species extinction risk.

AB Many studies illustrate variable patterns in individual species distribution shifts in response to changing temperature. However, an assemblage, a group of species that shares a common environmental niche, will likely exhibit similar responses to climate changes, and these community-level responses may have significant implications for ecosystem function. Therefore, we examine the relationship between observed shifts of species in assemblages and regional climate velocity (i.e., the rate and direction of change of temperature isotherms). The assemblages are defined in two sub-regions of the U.S. Northeast Shelf that have heterogeneous oceanography and bathymetry using four decades of bottom trawl survey data and we explore temporal changes in distribution, spatial range extent, thermal habitat area, and biomass, within assemblages. These sub-regional analyses allow the dissection of the relative roles of regional climate velocity and local physiography in shaping observed distribution shifts. We find that assemblages of species associated with shallower, warmer waters tend to shift west-southwest and to shallower waters over time, possibly towards cooler temperatures in the semi-enclosed Gulf of Maine, while species assemblages associated with relatively cooler and deeper waters shift deeper, but with little latitudinal change. Conversely, species assemblages associated with warmer and shallower water on the broad, shallow continental shelf from the Mid-Atlantic Bight to Georges Bank shift strongly northeast along latitudinal gradients with little change in depth. Shifts in depth among the southern species associated with deeper and cooler waters are more variable, although predominantly shifts are toward deeper waters. In addition, spatial expansion and contraction of species assemblages in each region corresponds to the area of suitable thermal habitat, but is inversely related to assemblage biomass. This suggests that assemblage distribution shifts in conjunction with expansion or contraction of thermal habitat acts to compress or stretch marine species assemblages, which may respectively amplify or dilute species interactions to an extent that is rarely considered. Overall, regional differences in climate change effects on the movement and extent of species assemblages hold important implications for management, mitigation, and adaptation on the U.S. Northeast Shelf.

AB In the Danube River Basin multiple pressures affect the river system as a consequence of river engineering works, altering both the river hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. The main, objective of this paper is to identify the effects of hydropower development, flood protection and engineering works for navigation on the Danube and to examine specific impacts of these developments on sediment transport and river morphology. Whereas impoundments are characterised by deposition and an excess of sediment with remobilisation of fine sediments during severe floods, the remaining five free flowing sections of the Danube are experiencing river bed erosion of the order of several centimetres per year. Besides the effect of interruption of the sediment continuum, river bed degradation is caused by an increase in the sediment transport capacity following an increase in slope, a reduction of river bed width due to canalisation, prohibition of bank erosion by riprap or regressive erosion following base level lowering by flood protection measures and sediment dredging. As a consequence, the groundwater table is lowered, side-arms are disconnected, instream structures are lost and habitat quality deteriorates affecting the ecological status of valuable floodplains. The lack of sediments, together with cutting off meanders, leads also to erosion of the bed of main arms in the Danube Delta and coastal erosion. This paper details the causes and effects of river engineering measures and hydromorphological changes for the Danube. It highlights the importance of adopting a basin-wide holistic approach to river management and demonstrates that past management in the basin has been characterised by a lack of integration. To-date insufficient attention has been paid to the wide-ranging impacts of river engineering works throughout the basin: from the basin headwaters to the Danube Delta, on the Black Sea coast. This highlights the importance of new initiatives that seek to advance knowledge exchange and knowledge transfer within the basin to reach the goal of integrated basin management.

AB A resurrection ecology reconstruction of 14 morphological, life history and behavioural traits revealed that a natural Daphnia magna population rapidly tracked changes in fish predation by integrating phenotypic plasticity and widespread evolutionary changes both in mean trait values and in trait plasticity. Increased fish predation mainly generated rapid adaptive evolution of plasticity (especially in the presence of maladaptive ancestral plasticity) resulting in an important change in the magnitude and direction of the multivariate reaction norm. Subsequent relaxation of the fish predation pressure resulted in reversed phenotypic plasticity and mainly caused evolution of the trait means towards the ancestral pre-fish means. Relaxation from fish predation did, however, not result in a complete reversal to the ancestral fishless multivariate phenotype. Our study emphasises that the study population rapidly tracked environmental changes through a mosaic of plasticity, evolution of trait means and evolution of plasticity to generate integrated phenotypic changes in multiple traits.

AB The Atlantic Forest suffered five centuries of continuous deforestation related to successive economic cycles, and is now reduced to 11.7 % of its original cover. The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact was launched in 2009 and aims to restore 15 million hectares until 2050. Natural regeneration can play an important role in meeting this target, however little attention has been paid to this process and there is a gap in the knowledge about its driving factors at the landscape scale. We mapped forest cover of an Atlantic Forest municipality in Southeastern Brazil, in five timeslots between years 1978 and 2014, and used the weights of evidence method for modeling its spatial dynamics, in order to understand where natural regeneration is occurring and which are the main factors related to this phenomenon. In 36 years, forest cover increased 3,020 hectares (15.3 %), related to the decreasing of both rural population (R-2 = 0.9794, p = 0.0013) and cropland cover (R-2 = 0.8679, p = 0.0212). Landscape metrics shows the increment of number of fragments and structural connectivity among them. The main spatial variables influencing forest cover dynamics were topographic position, slope, solar radiation, soil type and distance to forest, urban areas and roads. Secondary forests provide ecosystem services that can turn into economic benefits, and natural regeneration can reduce restoration costs to the municipality. The cost of active restoration of the same area would have meant a total expense of U$ 15.1 million (U$ 419 k/year). We show here that spontaneous regeneration must be accounted for and incorporated into the spatial planning of Atlantic Forest restoration.

AB Consistent expanding urbanization dramatically transforms natural habitats and exposes organisms to novel environmental challenges, often leading to reduced species richness and diversity in cities. However, it remains unclear how individuals are affected by the urban environment and how they can or cannot adjust to the specific characteristics of urban life (e.g. food availability). In this study, we used an integrative multi-component approach to investigate the effects of urbanization on the nutritional status of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We assessed several morphological and physiological indices of body condition in both juveniles (early post-fledging) and breeding adults from four sites with different levels of urbanization in France, Western Europe. We found that sparrows in more urbanized habitats have reduced body size and body mass compared to their rural conspecifics. However, we did not find any consistent differences in a number of complementary indices of condition (scaled mass index, muscle score, hematocrit, baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels) between urban and rural birds, indicating that urban sparrows may not be suffering nutritional stress. Our results suggest that the urban environment is unlikely to energetically constrain adult sparrows, although other urban-related variables may constrain them. On the other hand, we found significant difference in juvenile fat scores, suggesting that food types provided to young sparrows differed highly between habitats. In addition to the observed smaller size of urban sparrows, these results suggest that the urban environment is inadequate to satisfy early-life sparrows' nutritional requirements, growth, and development. The urban environment may therefore have life-long consequences for developing birds.

AB Background: Cardiometabolic risk is the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, or stroke, which are leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the potential of low-calorie cranberry juice (LCCJ) to lower cardiometabolic risk.
   Methods.: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study was conducted with controlled diets. Thirty women and 26 men (mean baseline characteristics: 50 y; weight, 79 kg; body mass index, 28 kg/m(2)) completed an 8-wk intervention with LCCJ or a flavor/color/energy-matched placebo beverage. Twice daily volunteers consumed 240 mL of LCCJ or the placebo beverage, containing 173 or 62 mg of phenolic compounds and 6.5 or 7.5 g of total sugar per 240-mL serving, respectively.
   Results: Fasting serum triglycerides (TGs) were lower after consuming LCCJ and demonstrated a treatment x baseline interaction such that the participants with higher baseline TG concentrations were more likely to experience a larger treatment effect (1.15 +/- 0.04 mmol/L vs. 1.25 +/- 0.04 mmol/L, respectively; P = 0.027). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was lower for individuals consuming LCCJ than for individuals consuming the placebo beverage [In transformed values of 0.522 +/- 0.115 In(mg/L) vs. 0.997 +/- 0.120 In(mg/L), P = 0.0054, respectively, and equivalent to 1,69 mg/L vs. 2.71 mg/L back-transformed]. LCCJ lowered diastolic blood pressure (BP) compared with the placebo beverage (69.2 +/- 0.8 mm Hg for LCCJ vs. 71.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg for placebo; P = 0.048). Fasting plasma glucose was lower (P = 0.03) in the LCCJ group (5.32 +/- 0.03 mmol/L) than in the placebo group (5.42 +/- .03 mmol/L), and LCCJ had a beneficial effect on homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance for participants with high baseline values (P = 0.035).
   Conclusion: LCCJ can improve several risk factors of CVD in adults, including circulating TGs, CRP, and glucose, insulin resistance, and diastolic BP. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01295684.

AB Establishing the genetic and molecular basis underlying adaptive traits is one of the major goals of evolutionary geneticists in order to understand the connection between genotype and phenotype and elucidate the mechanisms of evolutionary change. Despite considerable effort to address this question, there remain relatively few systems in which the genes shaping adaptations have been identified. Here, we review the experimental tools that have been applied to document the molecular basis underlying evolution in several natural systems, in order to highlight their benefits, limitations and suitability. In most cases, a combination of DNA, RNA and functional methodologies with field experiments will be needed to uncover the genes and mechanisms shaping adaptation in nature.

AB Plant tissues host a variety of fungi. One important group is the dark septate endophytes (DSEs) that colonize plant roots and form characteristic intracellular structures melanized hyphae and microsclerotia. The DSE associations are common and frequently observed in various biomes and plant taxa. Reviews suggest that the proportion of plant species colonized by DSE equal that colonized by AM and microscopic studies show that the proportion of the root system colonized by fungi DSE can equal, or even exceed, the colonization by AM fungi. Despite the high frequency and suspected ecological importance, the effects of DSE colonization on plant growth and performance have remained unclear. Here, we draw from over a decade of experimentation with the obscure DSE symbiosis and synthesize across large bodies of published and unpublished data from Arabidopsis thaliana and Allium porrum model systems as well as from experiments that use native plants to better resolve the host responses to DSE colonization. The data indicate similar distribution of host responses in model and native plant studies, validating the use of model plants for tractable dissection of DSE symbioses. The available data also permit empirical testing of the environmental modulation of host responses to DSE colonization and refining the "mutualism-parasitism-continuum" paradigm for DSE symbioses. These data highlight the context dependency of the DSE symbioses: not only plant species but also ecotypes vary in their responses to populations of conspecific DSE fungi environmental conditions further shift the host responses similar to those predicted based on the mutualism-parasitism-continuum paradigm. The model systems provide several established avenues of inquiry that permit more detailed molecular and functional dissection of fungal endophyte symbioses, identifying thus likely mechanisms that may underlie the observed host responses to endophyte colonization.

AB Rhodiola L. (Crassulaceae) is a mid-sized plant genus consisting of about 70 species, with most species distributed on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and the adjacent areas, and several species in north-east Asia, Europe, and North America. This study explored the origin and diversification history of Rhodiola and tested the biogeographic relationships between the QTP and other regions of the Northern Hemisphere. We sequenced the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers and eight plastid DNA fragments representing 55 species of Rhodiola, and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships with maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Several instances of incongruence between the nuclear and the plastid data sets were revealed, which can best be explained by reticulate evolution. Species of Rhodiola and Pseudosedum form a well-supported clade sister to Phedimus. Dating analysis suggested that the origin and diversification times of this group are largely correlated with the extensive uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Ancestral state reconstruction supports the hypothesis that Rhodiola originated on the QTP, and then dispersed to other regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Our findings highlight the importance of the uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in promoting species diversification and the possible role of reticulate evolution in the diversification process. Our results also suggest the biogeographic significance of QTP as the source area in alpine plant evolution in the Northern Hemisphere. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The phyllosphere is colonized by complex microbial communities, which are adapted to the harsh habitat. Although the role and ecology of nonpathogenic microorganisms of the phyllosphere are only partially understood, leaf microbiota could have a beneficial role in plant growth and health. Pesticides and biocontrol agents are frequently applied to grapevines, but the impact on nontarget microorganisms of the phyllosphere has been marginally considered. In this study, we investigated the effect of a chemical fungicide (penconazole) and a biological control agent (Lysobacter capsici AZ78) on the leaf microbiota of the grapevine at three locations. Amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene and of the internal transcribed spacer were sequenced for bacterial and fungal identification, respectively. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that the richness and diversity of bacterial and fungal populations were only minimally affected by the chemical and biological treatments tested, and they mainly differed according to grapevine locations. Indigenous microbial communities of the phyllosphere are adapted to environmental and biotic factors in the areas where the grapevines are grown, and they are resilient to the treatments tested. The biocontrol properties of phyllosphere communities against downy mildew differed among grapevine locations and were not affected by treatments, suggesting that biocontrol communities could be improved with agronomic practices to enrich beneficial populations in vineyards.

AB Bathymetric biodiversity patterns of marine benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes have been identified in the extant fauna of the deep continental margins. Depth zonation is widespread and evident through a transition between shelf and slope fauna from the shelf break to 1000m, and a transition between slope and abyssal fauna from 2000 to 3000m; these transitions are characterised by high species turnover. A unimodal pattern of diversity with depth peaks between 1000 and 3000m, despite the relatively low area represented by these depths. Zonation is thought to result from the colonisation of the deep sea by shallow-water organisms following multiple mass extinction events throughout the Phanerozoic. The effects of low temperature and high pressure act across hierarchical levels of biological organisation and appear sufficient to limit the distributions of such shallow-water species. Hydrostatic pressures of bathyal depths have consistently been identified experimentally as the maximum tolerated by shallow-water and upper bathyal benthic invertebrates at in situ temperatures, and adaptation appears required for passage to deeper water in both benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes. Together, this suggests that a hyperbaric and thermal physiological bottleneck at bathyal depths contributes to bathymetric zonation. The peak of the unimodal diversity-depth pattern typically occurs at these depths even though the area represented by these depths is relatively low. Although it is recognised that, over long evolutionary time scales, shallow-water diversity patterns are driven by speciation, little consideration has been given to the potential implications for species distribution patterns with depth. Molecular and morphological evidence indicates that cool bathyal waters are the primary site of adaptive radiation in the deep sea, and we hypothesise that bathymetric variation in speciation rates could drive the unimodal diversity-depth pattern over time. Thermal effects on metabolic-rate-dependent mutation and on generation times have been proposed to drive differences in speciation rates, which result in modern latitudinal biodiversity patterns over time. Clearly, this thermal mechanism alone cannot explain bathymetric patterns since temperature generally decreases with depth. We hypothesise that demonstrated physiological effects of high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature at bathyal depths, acting on shallow-water taxa invading the deep sea, may invoke a stress-evolution mechanism by increasing mutagenic activity in germ cells, by inactivating canalisation during embryonic or larval development, by releasing hidden variation or mutagenic activity, or by activating or releasing transposable elements in larvae or adults. In this scenario, increased variation at a physiological bottleneck at bathyal depths results in elevated speciation rate. Adaptation that increases tolerance to high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature allows colonisation of abyssal depths and reduces the stress-evolution response, consequently returning speciation of deeper taxa to the background rate. Over time this mechanism could contribute to the unimodal diversity-depth pattern.

AB Aims
   Understanding what drives the variation in species composition and diversity among local communities can provide insights into the mechanisms of community assembly. Because ecological traits are often thought to be phylogenetically conserved, there should be patterns in phylogenetic structure and phylogenetic diversity in local communities along ecological gradients. We investigate potential patterns in angiosperm assemblages along an elevational gradient with a steep ecological gradient in Changbaishan, China.
   Methods
   We used 13 angiosperm assemblages in forest plots (32 x 32 m) distributed along an elevational gradient from 720 to 1900 m above sea level. We used Faith's phylogenetic diversity metric to quantify the phylogenetic alpha diversity of each forest plot, used the net relatedness index to quantify the degree of phylogenetic relatedness among angiosperm species within each forest plot and used a phylogenetic dissimilarity index to quantify phylogenetic beta diversity among forest plots. We related the measures of phylogenetic structure and phylogenetic diversity to environmental (climatic and edaphic) factors.
   Important Findings
   Our study showed that angiosperm assemblages tended to be more phylogenetically clustered at higher elevations in Changbaishan. This finding is consistent with the prediction of the phylogenetic niche conservatism hypothesis, which highlights the role of niche constraints in governing the phylogenetic structure of assemblages. Our study also showed that woody assemblages differ from herbaceous assemblages in several major aspects. First, phylogenetic clustering dominated in woody assemblages, whereas phylogenetic overdispersion dominated in herbaceous assemblages; second, patterns in phylogenetic relatedness along the elevational and temperature gradients of Changbaishan were stronger for woody assemblages than for herbaceous assemblages; third, environmental variables explained much more variations in phylogenetic relatedness, phylogenetic alpha diversity and phylogenetic beta diversity for woody assemblages than for herbaceous assemblages.

AB The aim of this paper is to shed new light on urban common property systems. We deal with urban commons in relation to urban green-space management, referring to them as urban green commons. Applying a property-rights analytic perspective, we synthesize information on urban green commons from three case-study regions in Sweden, Germany, and South Africa, and elaborate on their role for biodiversity conservation in urban settings, with a focus on business sites. Cases cover both formally established types of urban green commons and bottom-up emerged community-managed habitats. As our review demonstrates, the right to actively manage urban green space is a key characteristic of urban green commons whether ownership to land is in the private, public, the club realm domain, or constitutes a hybrid of these. We discuss the important linkages among urban common property systems, social-ecological learning, and management of ecosystem services and biodiversity. Several benefits can be associated with urban green commons, such as a reduction of costs for ecosystem management and as designs for reconnecting city-inhabitants to the biosphere. The emergence of urban green commons appears closely linked to dealing with societal crises and for reorganizing cities: hence, they play a key role in transforming cities toward more socially and ecologically benign environments. While a range of political questions circumscribe the feasibility of urban green commons, we discuss their usefulness in management of different types of urban habitats, their political justification and limitation, their potential for improved biodiversity conservation, and conditions for their emergence. We conclude by postulating some general policy advice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a multilevel modeling framework for simulating the emergence of landscape spatial structure in urbanizing regions using a combination of field-based and object-based representations of land change. The FUTure Urban-Regional Environment Simulation (FUTURES) produces regional projections of landscape patterns using coupled submodels that integrate nonstationary drivers of land change: per capita demand, site suitability, and the spatial structure of conversion events. Patches of land change events are simulated as discrete spatial objects using a stochastic region-growing algorithm that aggregates cell-level transitions based on empirical estimation of parameters that control the size, shape, and dispersion of patch growth. At each time step, newly constructed patches reciprocally influence further growth, which agglomerates over time to produce patterns of urban form and landscape fragmentation. Multilevel structure in each submodel allows drivers of land change to vary in space (e.g., by jurisdiction), rather than assuming spatial stationarity across a heterogeneous region. We applied FUTURES to simulate land development dynamics in the rapidly expanding metropolitan region of Charlotte, North Carolina, between 1996 and 2030, and evaluated spatial variation in model outcomes along an urban-rural continuum, including assessments of cell- and patch-based correctness and error. Simulation experiments reveal that changes in per capita land consumption and parameters controlling the distribution of development affect the emergent spatial structure of forests and farmlands with unique and sometimes counterintuitive outcomes.

AB Mobility is a millenary human strategy to deal with environmental change. An outstanding example of mobility is transhumance, an ancient pastoralist practice consisting of the seasonal migration of livestock between ecological regions following peaks in pasture productivity. The maintenance of transhumance depends partly on the preservation of related traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). We (a) identified and characterized social groups that hold transhumance-related TEK, (b) analyzed trends in transhumance-related TEK across generations and social groups, (c) examined the factors that influence variation in levels of TEK, and (d) analyzed elements of transhumance-related TEK as examples of adaptive strategies to cope with global change. We used transhumance on the Conquense Drove Road, a major active transhumant network in Spain, as a case study. Through an indepth literature review, participant observation, semistructured interviews, and a focus group discussion, we developed a survey to examine transhumance-related knowledge, practices, and beliefs. We collected survey data from 150 informants. Although a rich body of TEK persisted among transhumant shepherds, we found a marked loss of TEK among transhumants born after 1975, who scored one-fifth lower on survey items than other generations. The maintenance of transhumance on foot is the most important factor influencing TEK preservation. We conclude that in developed country settings, maintaining conditions for herd mobility can contribute to enhancing the adaptive capacity of agrarian societies to cope with global environmental change.

AB RATIONALE In stable isotope research, the use of accurate, species-specific diet-tissue discrimination factors (i.e., ?13C and ?15N) is central to the estimation of trophic position relative to primary consumers and to the identification of the dietary sources of an individual. Previous research suggested that the diet of fin whales from the waters off northwestern Spain is overwhelmingly based on krill, thus permitting reliable calculation of discrimination values in this wild population. METHODS After confirming that the stable isotope ratios (d13C and d15N values) in muscle from 65 aged fin whales remained constant through age classes (465 years), the signatures were determined in muscle, bone protein, skin, liver, kidney, baleen plates and brain, as well as food (krill), from a subset of individuals to calculate discrimination factors. Signatures were determined by means of elemental analysis isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS) using a ThermoFinnigan Flash 1112. RESULTS The isotopic values remained constant regardless of age. The mean ?15N values between krill and whale tissues ranged from 2.04 in bone protein to 4.27 parts per thousand in brain, and those of ?13C ranged from 1.28 in skin to 3.11 parts per thousand in bone protein. This variation was consistent with that found in other groups of mammals, and is attributed to variation in tissue composition and physiology. CONCLUSIONS Because discrimination factors are relatively constant between taxonomically close species, the results here obtained may be reliably extrapolated to other cetaceans to improve dietary reconstructions. The skin discrimination factors are of particular relevance to monitoring diet through biopsies or other non-destructive sampling methods. The large difference in bone protein discrimination factors from those of other tissues should be taken into consideration when bone collagen is used to determine trophic level or to assess diet in paleodietary isotopic reconstructions.

AB This study tested the hypothesis that soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) spatial distributions show clear relationships with soil properties and vegetation composition as well as climatic conditions. Further, this study aimed to find the corresponding controlling parameters of SOC and TN storage in high-altitude ecosystems. The study was based on soil, vegetation and climate data from 42 soil pits taken from 14 plots. The plots were investigated during the summers of 2009 and 2010 at the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Relationships of SOC density with soil moisture, soil texture, biomass and climatic variables were analyzed. Further, storage and vertical patterns of SOC and TN of seven representative vegetation types were estimated. The results show that significant relationships of SOC density with belowground biomass (BGB) and soil moisture (SM) can be observed. BGB and SM may be the dominant factors influencing SOC density in the topsoil of the study area. The average densities of SOC and TN at a depth of 1 m were about 7.72 kg C m(2) and 0.93 kg N m 2. Both SOC and TN densities were concentrated in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and fell exponentially as soil depth increased. Additionally, the four typical vegetation types located in the northwest of the study area were selected to examine the relationship between SOC and environmental factors (temperature and precipitation). The results indicate that SOC density has a negative relationship with temperature and a positive relationship with precipitation diminishing with soil depth. It was concluded that SOC was concentrated in the topsoil, and that SOC density correlates well with BGB. SOC was predominantly influenced by SM, and to a much lower extent by temperature and precipitation. This study provided a new insight in understanding the control of SOC and TN density in the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB Processes that occur both within and between hosts can influence the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of symbionts, a broad term that includes parasitic and disease-causing organisms. Metacommunity theory can integrate these local- and regional-scale dynamics to explore symbiont community composition patterns across space. In this article I emphasize that symbionts should be incorporated into the metacommunity concept. I highlight the utility of metacommunity theory by discussing practical and general benefits that emerge from considering symbionts in a metacommunity framework. Specifically, investigating the local and regional drivers of symbiont community and metacommunity structure will lead to a more holistic understanding of symbiont ecology and evolution and could reveal novel insights into the roles of symbiont communities in mediating host health.

AB Estimates of hybrid fitness have been used as either a platform for testing the potential role of natural hybridization in the evolution of species and species complexes or, alternatively, as a rationale for dismissing hybridization events as being of any evolutionary significance. From the time of Darwin's publication of The Origin, through the neo-Darwinian synthesis, to the present day, the observation of variability in hybrid fitness has remained a challenge for some models of speciation. Yet, Darwin and others have reported the elevated fitness of hybrid genotypes under certain environmental conditions. In modern scientific terminology, this observation reflects the fact that hybrid genotypes can demonstrate genotype x environment interactions. In the current review, we illustrate the development of one plant species complex, namely the Louisiana Irises, into a 'model system' for investigating hybrid fitness and the role of genetic exchange in adaptive evolution and diversification. In particular, we will argue that a multitude of approaches, involving both experimental and natural environments, and incorporating both manipulative analyses and surveys of natural populations, are necessary to adequately test for the evolutionary significance of introgressive hybridization. An appreciation of the variability of hybrid fitness leads to the conclusion that certain genetic signatures reflect adaptive evolution. Furthermore, tests of the frequency of allopatric versus sympatric/parapatric divergence (that is, divergence with ongoing gene flow) support hybrid genotypes as a mechanism of evolutionary diversification in numerous species complexes.

AB Silicon is a non-essential element for plant growth. Nevertheless, it affects plant stress resistance and in some plants, such as grasses, it may substitute carbon (C) compounds in cell walls, thereby influencing C allocation patterns and biomass production. How variation in silicon supply over a narrow range affects nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake by plants has also been investigated in some detail. However, little is known about effects on the stoichiometric relationships between C, N and P when silicon supply varies over a broader range. Here, we assessed the effect of silicon on aboveground biomass production and C:N:P stoichiometry of common reed, Phragmites australis, in a pot experiment in which three widely differing levels of silicon were supplied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that elevated silicon supply promoted silica deposition in the epidermis of Phragmites leaves. This resulted in altered N:P ratios, whereas C:N ratios changed only slightly. Plant growth was slightly (but not significantly) enhanced at intermediate silicon supply levels but significantly decreased at high levels. These findings point to the potential of silicon to impact plant growth and elemental stoichiometry and, by extension, to affect biogeochemical cycles in ecosystems dominated by Phragmites and other grasses and sedges.

AB Animal 'personality' describes consistent individual differences in suites of behaviors, a phenomenon exhibited in diverse animal taxa and shown to be under natural and sexual selection. It has been suggested that variation in personality reflects underlying physiological variation; however there is limited empirical evidence to test this hypothesis in wild animals. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is hypothesized to play a central role in personality variation. Here we tested whether in great tits Parus major variation in personality traits is related to plasma concentrations of corticosterone (CORT). Using a capture-restraint protocol we examined baseline and stress-induced COAT levels in two captive experimental groups: (1) birds selected for divergent personalities ('fast-bold' and 'slow-shy' explorers); and (2) non-selected offspring of wild parents. We first tested for differences in CORT between selection lines, and second examined the relationship between responses in a canonical personality test and CURT concentrations in non-selected birds. We found support for our prediction that the slow-shy line would exhibit a higher acute stress response than the fast-bold line, indicating a genetic correlation between exploratory behavior and stress physiology. We did not, however, find that continuous variation in exploratory behavior co-varies with CURT concentrations in non-selected birds. While our results provide support for the idea that personality emerges as a result of correlated selection on behavior and underlying physiological mechanisms, they also indicate that this link may be particularly evident when composite personality traits are the target of selection.

AB An individual's prior experience of sexual signals can result in variation in mate preferences, with important consequences for the course of sexual selection. We test two hypotheses about the evolution of experience-mediated plasticity in mate preferences: mating assurance and mismating avoidance. We exposed female Enchenopa binotata treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to treatments that varied their experience of signal frequency, the most divergent sexual signal trait in the E. binotata species complex. Treatments consisted of (1) signals matching the preferred frequency, (23) signals deviating either 100 Hz above or 100 Hz below the preferred frequency, and (4) no signals. Females experiencing preferred signals showed the greatest selectivity. However, experience had no effect on peak preference. These results support the hypothesis that selection has favored plasticity in mate preferences that ensures that mating takes place when preferred mates are rare or absent, while ensuring choice of preferred types when those are present. We consider how experience-mediated plasticity may influence selection on sexual advertisement signals, patterns of reproductive isolation, and the maintenance of genetic variation. We suggest that the plasticity we describe may increase the likelihood of successful colonization of a novel environment, where preferred mating types may be rare.

AB Rapid evolution challenges the assumption that evolution is too slow to impact short-term ecological dynamics. This insight motivates the study of 'Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics' or how evolution and ecological processes reciprocally interact on short time scales. We tested how rapid evolution impacts concurrent population dynamics using an aphid (Myzus persicae) and an undomesticated host (Hirschfeldia incana) in replicated wild populations. We manipulated evolvability by creating non-evolving (single clone) and potentially evolving (two-clone) aphid populations that contained genetic variation in intrinsic growth rate. We observed significant evolution in two-clone populations whether or not they were exposed to predators and competitors. Evolving populations grew up to 42% faster and attained up to 67% higher density, compared with non-evolving control populations but only in treatments exposed to competitors and predators. Increased density also correlates with relative fitness of competing clones suggesting a full eco-evolutionary dynamic cycle defined as reciprocal interactions between evolution and density.

AB Animal behavior is unique in influencing both components of the process of transmission of disease: exposure to infectious agents, and susceptibility to infection once exposed. To date, the influence of behavior on exposure versus susceptibility has largely been considered separately. Here, we ask whether these two key mechanisms act in concert in natural populations, whereby individuals who are most exposed to infectious agents or have the most contact with conspecifics are also the most susceptible or infectious. We propose three mechanisms that can generate covariation between these two key elements of the transmission of disease within and among hosts, and we provide empirical examples of each. We then use a mathematical model to examine the effect of this covariation on the dynamics of disease at the population level. First, we show that the empirical mechanisms generating covariation between behavioral and physiological components of disease transmission are widespread and include endocrine mediators of behavior, mate choice, group size, sickness behaviors, and behavioral avoidance of infectious conspecifics. The diversity of these empirical mechanisms underscores the potential importance and breadth of covariation in the disease process. Second, we show mathematically that the variability in hosts' exposure to infectious agents and susceptibility or infectiousness, and how tightly they are coupled, strongly influences the ability of a disease to invade a host population. Overall, we propose that covariation between behavioral and physiological components of transmission is likely widespread in natural populations, and can have important consequences for the dynamics of disease at the population level as well as for our understanding of sexual selection, social behavior, and animal communication.

AB Linear and heterogeneous habitat makes headwater stream networks an ideal ecosystem in which to test the influence of environmental factors on spatial genetic patterns of obligatory aquatic species. We investigated fine-scale population structure and influence of stream habitat on individual-level genetic differentiation in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) by genotyping eight microsatellite loci in 740 individuals in two headwater channel networks (7.7 and 4.4 km) in Connecticut, USA. A weak but statistically significant isolation-by-distance pattern was common in both sites. In the field, many tagged individuals were recaptured in the same 50-m reaches within a single field season (summer to fall). One study site was characterized with a hierarchical population structure, where seasonal barriers (natural falls of 1.5-2.5 m in height during summer base-flow condition) greatly reduced gene flow and perceptible spatial patterns emerged because of the presence of tributaries, each with a group of genetically distinguishable individuals. Genetic differentiation increased when pairs of individuals were separated by high stream gradient (steep channel slope) or warm stream temperature in this site, although the evidence of their influence was equivocal. In a second site, evidence for genetic clusters was weak at best, but genetic differentiation between individuals was positively correlated with number of tributary confluences. We concluded that the population-level movement of brook trout was limited in the study headwater stream networks, resulting in the fine-scale population structure (genetic clusters and clines) even at distances of a few kilometres, and gene flow was mitigated by 'riverscape' variables, particularly by physical barriers, waterway distance (i.e. isolation-by-distance) and the presence of tributaries.

AB 1. At the heart of the body of research on biodiversity effects on ecosystem function is the debate over whether different species tend to be functionally singular or redundant. When we consider ecosystem multi-function, the provision of multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously, we may find that seemingly redundant species may in fact play unique roles in ecosystems.
   2. Over the last few decades, the significance of biological soil crusts (BSCs) as ecological boundaries and ecosystem engineers, and their multi-functional nature, has become increasingly well documented. We compiled 'functional profiles' of the organisms in this understudied community, to determine whether functional singularity emerges when multiple ecosystem functions are considered.
   3. In two data sets, one representing multiple sites around the semi-arid regions of Spain (regional scale), and another from a single site in central Spain (local scale), we examined correlations between the abundance or frequency of BSC species in a community, and multiple surrogates of ecosystem functioning. There was a wide array of apparent effects of species on specific functions.
   4. Notably, in gypsiferous soils and at regional scale, we found that indicators of carbon (C) and phosphorus cycling were apparently suppressed and promoted by the lichens Diploschistes diacapsis and Squamarina lentigera, respectively. The moss Pleurochaete squarrosa appears to promote C cycling in calcareous soils at this spatial scale. At the local scale in gypsiferous soils, D. diacapsis positively correlated with carbon cycling, but negatively with nitrogen cycling, whereas numerous lichens exhibited the opposite profile.
   5. We found a high degree of functional singularity, i.e. that species were highly individualistic in their effects on multiple functions. Many functional attributes were not easily predictable from existing functional grouping systems based primarily on morphology.
   6. Our results suggest that maintaining species-rich BSC communities is crucial to maintain the overall functionality of ecosystems dominated by these organisms, and that dominance and the outcome of competition could be highly influential in the determination of such functionality.

AB Critical to the mitigation of parasitic vector-borne diseases is the development of accurate spatial predictions that integrate environmental conditions conducive to pathogen proliferation. Species of Plasmodium and Trypanosoma readily infect humans, and are also common in birds. Here, we develop predictive spatial models for the prevalence of these blood parasites in the olive sunbird (Cyanomitra olivacea). Since this species exhibits high natural parasite prevalence and occupies diverse habitats in tropical Africa, it represents a distinctive ecological model system for studying vector-borne pathogens. We used PCR and microscopy to screen for haematozoa from 28 sites in Central and West Africa. Species distribution models were constructed to associate ground-based and remotely sensed environmental variables with parasite presence. We then used machine-learning algorithm models to identify relationships between parasite prevalence and environmental predictors. Finally, predictive maps were generated by projecting model outputs to geographically unsampled areas. Results indicate that for Plasmodium spp., the maximum temperature of the warmest month was most important in predicting prevalence. For Trypanosoma spp., seasonal canopy moisture variability was the most important predictor. The models presented here visualize gradients of disease prevalence, identify pathogen hotspots and will be instrumental in studying the effects of ecological change on these and other pathogens.

AB Plants must precisely time flowering to capitalize on favorable conditions. Although we know a great deal about the genetic basis of flowering phenology in model species under controlled conditions, the genetic architecture of this ecologically important trait is poorly understood in nonmodel organisms. Here, we evaluated the transition from vegetative growth to flowering in Boechera stricta, a perennial relative of Arabidopsis thaliana. We examined flowering time QTLs using 7920 recombinant inbred individuals, across seven laboratory and field environments differing in vernalization, temperature, and photoperiod. Genetic and environmental factors strongly influenced the transition to reproduction. We found directional selection for earlier flowering in the field. In the growth chamber experiment, longer winters accelerated flowering, whereas elevated ambient temperatures delayed flowering. Our analyses identified one large effect QTL (nFT), which influenced flowering time in the laboratory and the probability of flowering in the field. In Montana, homozygotes for the native allele at nFT showed a selective advantage of 6.6%. Nevertheless, we found relatively low correlations between flowering times in the field and the growth chambers. Additionally, we detected flowering-related QTLs in the field that were absent across the full range of laboratory conditions, thus emphasizing the need to conduct experiments in natural environments.

AB Two prominent mechanisms proposed to structure biodiversity are niche-based ecological filtering and chance arrival of propagules from the species pool. Seed arrival is hypothesized to play a particularly strong role in high-diversity plant communities with large potential species pools and many rare species, but few studies have explored how seed arrival and local ecological filters interactively assemble species-rich communities in space and time. We experimentally manipulated seed arrival and multiple ecological filters in high-diversity, herbaceous-dominated groundcover communities in longleaf pine savannas, which contain the highest small-scale species richness in North America (up to >40 species/m(2)). We tested three hypotheses: (1) local communities constitute relatively open-membership assemblages, in which increased seed arrival from the species pool strongly increases species richness; (2) ecological filters imposed by local fire intensity and soil moisture influence recruitment and richness of immigrating species; and (3) ecological filters increase similarity in the composition of immigrating species. In a two-year factorial field experiment, we manipulated local fire intensity by increasing pre-fire fuel loads, soil moisture using rain shelters and irrigation, and seed arrival by adding seeds from the local species pool. Seed arrival increased species richness regardless of fire intensity and soil moisture but interacted with both ecological filters to influence community assembly. High-intensity fire decreased richness of resident species, suggesting an important abiotic filter. In contrast, high-intensity fire increased recruitment and richness of immigrating species, presumably by decreasing effects of other ecological filters (competition and resource limitation) in postfire environments. Drought decreased recruitment and richness of immigrating species, whereas wet soil conditions increased recruitment but decreased or had little effect on richness. Moreover, some ecological filters (wet soil conditions and, to a lesser extent, high-intensity fire) increased similarity in the composition of immigrating species, illustrating conditions that influence deterministic community assembly in species-rich communities. Our experiment provides insights into how dispersal-assembly mechanisms may interact with niche-assembly mechanisms in space (spatial variation in disturbance) and time (temporal variation in resource availability) to structure high-diversity communities and can help guide conservation of threatened longleaf pine ecosystems in the face of habitat fragmentation and environmental change.

AB Quantifying landscape dynamics is a central goal of landscape ecology, and numerous metrics have been developed to measure the influence of human activities on natural landscapes. Composite scores that characterize human modifications to landscapes have gained widespread use. A parsimonious alternative is to estimate the proportion of a cover type (i.e. natural) within a spatial neighborhood to characterize both compositional and structural aspects of natural landscapes. Here I extend this approach into a multi-scale, integrated metric and apply it to national datasets on land cover, housing density, road existence, and highway traffic volume to measure the dynamics of natural landscapes in the conterminous US. Roughly one-third of the conterminous US (2.6 million km(2)) in 1992 was classified as human-dominated. By 2001 this expanded by 80,800 km(2), and forecasted residential growth by 2030 will potentially lead to an additional loss of up to 92,200 km(2). Wetland cover types were particularly affected. The natural landscapes metric developed here provides a simple, robust measure of landscape dynamics that has a direct physical interpretation related to proportion of natural habitat affected at a location, represents landscapes as a gradient of conditions rather predicated on patch/matrix definition, and measures the spatial context of natural areas.

AB We present a theory extending the source-sink concept with an ecosystem perspective. We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source-sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net direction of nutrient flows between two ecosystems of contrasted productivities. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient flows on source and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In meta-ecosystems, the source-sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the source to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem ecology.

AB Most amphibian species have biphasic life histories and undergo an ontogenetic shift from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. In deforested landscapes, streams and forest fragments are frequently disjunct, jeopardizing the life cycle of forest-associated amphibians with aquatic larvae. We tested the impact of habitat split-defined as human-induced disconnection between habitats used by different life-history stages of a species-on four forest-associated amphibian species in a severely fragmented landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We surveyed amphibians in forest fragments with and without streams (referred to as wet and dry fragments, respectively), including the adjacent grass-field matrix. Our comparison of capture rates in dry fragments and nearby streams in the matrix allowed us to evaluate the number of individuals that engaged in high-risk migrations through nonforested habitats. Adult amphibians moved from dry fragments to matrix streams at the beginning of the rainy season, reproduced, and returned at the end of the breeding period. Juveniles of the year moved to dry fragments along with adults. These risky reproductive migrations through nonforested habitats that expose individuals to dehydration, predation, and other hazards may cause population declines in dry fragments. Indeed, capture rates were significantly lower in dry fragments compared with wet fragments. Declining amphibians would strongly benefit from investments in the conservation and restoration of riparian vegetation and corridors linking breeding and nonbreeding areas.

ID WIND FARMS; CONSERVATION; CONCLUSIONS; FISHERIES; ECOLOGY; BASE
AB The wind power industry has grown rapidly in the UK to meet EU targets of sourcing 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. Although wind power is a renewable energy source, there are environmental concerns over increasing numbers of wind farm proposals and associated cumulative impacts. Individually, a wind farm, or indeed any action, may have minor effects on the environment, but collectively these may be significant, potentially greater than the sum of the individual parts acting alone. EU and UK legislation requires a cumulative impact assessment (CIA) as part of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). However, in the absence of detailed guidance and definitions, such assessments within EIA are rarely adequate, restricting the acquisition of basic knowledge about the cumulative impacts of wind farms on bird populations. Here we propose a conceptual framework to promote transparency in CIA through the explicit definition of impacts, actions and scales within an assessment. our framework requires improved legislative guidance on the actions to include in assessments, and advice on the appropriate baselines against which to assess impacts. Cumulative impacts are currently considered on restricted scales (spatial and temporal) relating to individual development EIAs. We propose that benefits would be gained from elevating CIA to a strategic level, as a component of spatially explicit planning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim
   Montane tropics are areas of high endemism, and mechanisms driving this endemism have been receiving increasing attention at a global scale. A general trend is that climatic factors do not explain the species richness of species with small to medium-sized geographic ranges, suggesting that geological and evolutionary processes must be considered. On the African continent, several hypotheses including both refugial and geographic uplift models have been advanced to explain avian speciation and diversity in the lowland forest and montane regions of central and eastern Africa; montane regions in particular are recognized as hotspots of vertebrate endemism. Here, we examine the possible role of these models in driving speciation in a clade of African forest robins.
   Location
   Africa.
   Methods
   We constructed the first robustly supported molecular phylogenetic hypothesis of forest robins. On this phylogeny, we reconstructed habitat-based distributions and geographic distributions relative to the Albertine Rift. We also estimated the timing of lineage divergences via a molecular clock.
   Results
   Robust estimates of phylogenetic relationships and clock-based divergences reject Miocene tectonic uplift and Pleistocene forest refugia as primary drivers of speciation in forest robins. Instead, our data suggest that most forest robin speciation took place in the Late Pliocene, from 3.2 to 2.2 Ma. Distributional patterns are complex, with the Albertine Rift region serving as a general east-west break across the group. Montane distributions are inferred to have evolved four times.
   Main conclusions
   Phylogenetic divergence dates coincide with a single period of lowland forest retraction in the late Pliocene, suggesting that most montane speciation resulted from the rapid isolation of populations in montane areas, rather than montane areas themselves being drivers of speciation. This conclusion provides additional evidence that Pliocene climate change was a major driver of speciation in broadly distributed African animal lineages. We further show that lowland forest robins are no older than their montane relatives, suggesting that lowland areas are not museums which house 'ancient' taxa; rather, for forest robins, montane areas should be viewed as living museums of a late Pliocene diversification event. A forest refugial pattern is operating in Africa, but it is not constrained to the Pleistocene.

AB Urban environments have become an increasingly important part of the world's ecosystems, and the characteristics that enable animals to live there are not fully understood. A typical urban characteristic is the high level of ambient noise, which presents difficulties for animals that use vocal communication. Urban noise is most intense at lower frequencies, and, therefore, species vocalizing at higher frequencies may be less affected and thus better able to inhabit urban environments. We tested this hypothesis with within-genera comparisons of the vocalization frequency of 529 bird species from 103 genera. We found that species occurring in urban environments generally vocalize at higher dominant frequency than strictly nonurban congeneric species, without differing in body size or in the vegetation density of their natural habitats. In most passerine genera with low-frequency songs, which are more subject to masking by noise, minimum song frequency was also higher for urban species. These results suggest that species using high frequencies are preadapted to inhabit urban environments and that reducing noise pollution in urban areas may contribute to restore more diverse avian communities.

AB In the multi-use landscape of southern Norway, the distribution of lynx is likely to be determined both by the abundance of their favoured prey - the roe deer - and the risk associated with the presence of humans because most lynx mortalities are caused by humans (recreational harvest, poaching, vehicle collisions). We described the distribution of the reproductive portion of the lynx population based on snow-track observations of females with dependent kittens collected over 10 yr (1997-2006) in southern Norway. We used the ecological-niche factor analysis to examine how lynx distribution was influenced by roe deer, human activity, habitat type, environmental productivity and elevation. Our first prediction that lynx should be found in areas of relatively high roe deer abundance was supported. However, our second prediction that lynx should avoid human activity was rejected, and lynx instead occupied areas more disturbed in average than those available (with the exception of the most densely occupied areas). Lynx, however, avoided the most disturbed areas and our third prediction of a trade-off between abundance of prey and avoidance of human activity was supported. On the one hand, roe deer in the most disturbed areas benefit to a large extent from current human land use practices, potentially allowing them to escape predation from lynx. On the other hand, the situation is not so favourable for the predators who are restricted in competition refuges with medium to low prey densities. The consequence is that lynx conservation will have to be achieved in a human modifed environment where the potential for a range of conflicts and high human-caused mortality will remain a constant threat.

AB Frequent and continuous time series is required for the detection of plant phenology and vegetation succession. The launch of novel remote sensor MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) provided us with an opportunity to make a new trial of studying the rapid vegetation succession in estuarine wetlands. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover and tidal flat elevation along a transect (covering 6 pixels of MODIS) of an estuarine wetland at Dongtan, Chongming Island, in Yangtze River estuary, China were investigated to assess its rapid vegetation succession and physical conditions. By combining the field data collected, the time series of MODIS-based VIs (vegetation indices), including NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), EVI (enhanced vegetation index) and MSAVI (modified soil adjusted vegetation index), and a water index, LSWI (land surface water index) were utilized to characterize the rapid vegetation succession between 2001 and 2006. We found that NDVI, EVI and MSAVI exhibited significant spatial and temporal correlations with vegetation succession, while LSWI behaved in a positive manner with surface water and soil moisture along with the successional stages. In order to take the advantages of both VIs and water index, a composite index of VWR (vegetation water ratio) combining LSWI and EVI or MSAVI was proposed in this paper. This index facilitates the identification of vegetation succession by simply comparing the values of VWR at different stages, and therefore it could track vegetation succession and estimate community spread rate. Additionally, this study presented an attempt of using MODIS datasets to monitor the change of tidal flat elevation, which demonstrated a potential remote sensing application in geodesy of coastal and estuarine areas.

AB Translocations are becoming increasingly popular as appropriate management strategies for the genetic restoration of endangered species and populations. Although a few studies have shown that the introduction of novel alleles has reversed the detrimental effects of inbreeding over the short-term (i.e., genetic rescue), it is not clear how effective such translocations are for both maintaining neutral variation that may be adaptive in the future (i.e., genetic restoration) and increasing population viability over the long-term. In addition, scientists have expressed concerns regarding the potential genetic swamping of locally adapted populations, which may eliminate significant components of genetic diversity through the replacement of the target population by the source individuals used for translocations. Here we show that bird translocations into a wild population of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) in southeastern Illinois were effective in both removing detrimental variation associated with inbreeding depression as well as restoring neutral genetic variation to historical levels. Furthermore, we found that although translocations resulted in immediate increases in fitness, the demographic recovery and long-term viability of the population appears to be limited by the availability of suitable habitat. Our results demonstrate that although translocations can be effective management tools for the genetic restoration of wild populations on the verge of extinction, their long-term viability may not be guaranteed unless the initial conditions that led to most species declines (e.g., habitat loss) are reversed.

AB P>The tropical intertidal ecosystem is defined by trees - mangroves - which are adapted to an extreme and extremely variable environment. The genetic basis underlying these adaptations is, however, virtually unknown. Based on advances in pyrosequencing, we present here the first transcriptome analysis for plants for which no prior genomic information was available. We selected the mangroves Rhizophora mangle (Rhizophoraceae) and Heritiera littoralis (Malvaceae) as ecologically important extremophiles employing markedly different physiological and life-history strategies for survival and dominance in this extreme environment.
   For maximal representation of conditional transcripts, mRNA was obtained from a variety of developmental stages, tissues types, and habitats. For each species, a normalized cDNA library of pooled mRNAs was analysed using GSFLX pyrosequencing.
   A total of 537 635 sequences were assembled de novo and annotated as > 13 000 distinct gene models for each species. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology annotations highlighted remarkable similarities in the mangrove transcriptome profiles, which differed substantially from the model plants Arabidopsis and Populus.
   Similarities in the two species suggest a unique mangrove lifestyle overarching the effects of transcriptome size, habitat, tissue type, developmental stage, and biogeographic and phylogenetic differences between them.

AB 1. Current views in ecology emphasise that community structure is the sum of multiple processes, with imprints of both regional and local drivers. However, the degree to which stream insect assemblages are structured by spatial configuration (complying with the dispersal-based neutral hypothesis) and local environmental features (complying with the niche-based species sorting hypothesis) has not been rigorously examined based on surveys in multiple years.
   2. Stream sites in a boreal drainage system were surveyed during three consecutive years and the relative contribution of spatial configuration and local environmental variables to aquatic insect assemblage structure (characterised by both abundance and presence-absence data) was assessed. Separate analyses were conducted for mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), and non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) in each year.
   3. There were no relationships between the spatial location and local environmental features of streams in Mantel tests, facilitating exploration of their independent effects on assemblage structure. The study found virtually no effects of spatial location on stream insect assemblages across the study drainage system, as evidenced by Mantel tests and canonical correspondence analyses (CCA). The environmental variables were also rather weakly associated with assemblage structure, with the total amount of explained variation ranging from 9.8% to 31.7% in the CCAs. There were no appreciable differences in the amount of environment-related explained variation in assemblage structure between mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, and midges, but some between-year differences were noticeable in most insect groups. The environmental variables that were significantly related to assemblage structure exhibited some between-group and between-year variability. In General, patterns shown by abundance and presence-absence data were highly similar.
   4. It appears that stream insect assemblages comply with the niche-based species sorting hypothesis in the context of metacommunity ecology. In contrast, the absence of spatial structuring suggests that stream insect assemblages do not comply with the neutral hypothesis, being not strongly dispersal limited at the within-drainage basin scale.

AB Spatial structures strongly influence ecological processes. Connectivity is known to positively influence metapopulation demography and genetics by increasing the rescue effect and thus favoring individual and gene flow between populations. This result has not been tested in the special case of dendritic networks, which encompass stream and cave ecosystem for instance. We propose a first approach using an individual based model to explore the population demography and genetics in various dendritic networks. To do so, we first generate a large number of different networks, and we analyze the relationship between their hydrographical characteristics and connectivity. We show that connectivity mean and variance of connectivity are strongly correlated in dendritic networks. Connectivity segregates two types of networks: Hortonian and non-Hortonian networks. We then simulate the population dynamics for a simple life cycle in each of the generated networks, and we analyze persistence time as well as populations structure at quasi-stationary state. Our main results show that connectivity in dendritic networks can promote local extinction and genetic isolation by distance at low dispersal and diminish the size of the metapopulation at high dispersal. We discuss these unexpected findings in the light of connectivity spatial distribution in dendritic networks in the case of our model.

AB Ancient DNA analyses of historical, archaeological and paleontological remains can contribute important information for the conservation of populations and species that cannot be obtained any other way. In addition to ancient DNA analyses involving a single or few individuals, population level studies are now possible. Biases inherent in estimating population parameters and history from modern genetic diversity are exaggerated when populations are small or have been heavily impacted by recent events, as is common for many endangered species. Going directly back in time to study past populations removes many of the assumptions that undermine conclusions based only on recent populations. Accurate characterization of historic population size, levels of gene flow and relationships with other populations are fundamental to developing appropriate conservation and management plans. The incorporation of ancient DNA into conservation genetics holds a lot of potential, if it is employed responsibly.

AB Gene duplication is the predominant mechanism for the evolution of new genes. Major existing models of this process assume that duplicate genes are redundant; degenerative mutations in one copy can therefore accumulate close to neutrally, usually leading to loss from the genome. When gene products dimerize or interact with other molecules for their functions, however, degenerative mutations in one copy may produce repressor alleles that inhibit the function of the other and are therefore exposed to selection. Here, we describe the evolution of a duplicate repressor by simple degenerative mutations in the steroid hormone receptors (SRs), a biologically crucial vertebrate gene family. We isolated and characterized the SRs of the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae, which diverged from other chordates just after duplication of the ancestral SR. The B. floridae genome contains two SRs: BfER, an ortholog of the vertebrate estrogen receptors, and BfSR, an ortholog of the vertebrate receptors for androgens, progestins, and corticosteroids. BfSR is specifically activated by estrogens and recognizes estrogen response elements (EREs) in DNA; BfER does not activate transcription in response to steroid hormones but binds EREs, where it competitively represses BfSR. The two genes are partially coexpressed, particularly in ovary and testis, suggesting an ancient role in germ cell development. These results corroborate previous findings that the ancestral steroid receptor was estrogen-sensitive and indicate that, after duplication, BfSR retained the ancestral function, while BfER evolved the capacity to negatively regulate BfSR. Either of two historical mutations that occurred during BfER evolution is sufficient to generate a competitive repressor. Our findings suggest that after duplication of genes whose functions depend on specific molecular interactions, high-probability degenerative mutations can yield novel functions, which are then exposed to positive or negative selection; in either case, the probability of neofunctionalization relative to gene loss is increased compared to existing models.

AB 1. Over 5000 trees were grown in plots of differing diversity levels (1, 3 and 6 species) in a plantation established in Panama. Four and five years after establishment, we analysed parameters related to the productivity of this tropical plantation (tree survival, height and biomass as well as plot basal area) to test for the presence of biodiversity effects. The relative importance of environmental heterogeneity (such as soil, topography, and drainage) and biodiversity on tree growth and mortality was determined using partial redundancy analysis.
   2. Hierarchical clustering revealed nine different soil clusters based on soil quality and drainage. By chance, the six-species plots were apparently established on more variable soils then on the other diversity levels. We found little evidence for spatial autocorrelation between subplots, with the exception of four subplots located on a ridge that extends on the North-South axis of the plantation and corresponds to a zone of higher productivity.
   3. The redundancy analysis indicated that environmental heterogeneity and biodiversity together explained around 50% of the variation in subplot productivity and tree mortality. Environment explained 35-57% of the variation in productivity and mortality, respectively, whereas diversity explained an additional 23-30%.
   4. Our simulation model revealed a significant positive effect of biodiversity on growth but no effect of biodiversity on mortality. The standardized effect sizes that we used to detect over- or under-yielding or no effect in comparison with monoculture were highly variable and the variability was largely explained by traits related to site topography.
   5. Synthesis. In our tropical tree plantation, we detected biodiversity effects at a scale relevant to conservation and quantified the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and diversity on tree growth and mortality. Our results support the idea that environmental factors could act as hidden sources of variability in biodiversity experiments. Environmental and spatial heterogeneity induced variable responses to biodiversity and amplified the differences between three- and six-species plots. Species identity explained more variation in productivity than did the species diversity. One species, Cedrela odorata, was associated with increased productivity.

AB The intensity of competition among forest tree seedlings is poorly understood, but has important ramifications for their recruitment and for the maintenance of species diversity. Intense competition among seedlings could allow competitively dominant species to exclude subordinate species. Alternatively, the low density and small stature of forest tree seedlings could preclude intense interseedling competition. In this case, other processes, such as size-asymmetric competition with adults, interactions with consumers, or neutral dynamics would prevail as those structuring the forest understory. We tested the intensity of, and potential for, intraspecific competition among tree seedlings of three species (Brosimum alicastrum, Matisia cordata, and Pouteria reticulata) in two Neotropical rain forests. We reduced stem densities by up to 90 percent and monitored individual growth and survival rates for up to 24 mo. Individual growth and survival rates were generally unrelated to stem density. Contrary to the predicted behavior of intensely competing plant populations, the distribution of individual heights did not become more left-skewed with time for any species, regardless of plot density; i.e., excesses of short, suppressed individuals did not accumulate in high-density plots. We further measured the overlap of zones of influence (ZOIs) to assess the potential for resource competition. Seedling ZOIs overlapped only slightly in extremely dense monodominant plots, and even less in ambient-density plots of mixed composition. Our results thus suggest that interseedling competition was weak. Given the low density of tree seedlings in Neotropical forests, we infer that resource competition among seedlings may be irrelevant to their recruitment.

AB Regular spatial patterns of sharply bounded ridges and hollows are frequently observed in peatlands and ask for an explanation in terms of underlying structuring processes. Simulation models suggest that spatial regularity of peatland patterns could be driven by an evapotranspiration-induced scale-dependent feedback (locally positive, longer-range negative) between ridge vegetation and nutrient availability. The sharp boundaries between ridges and hollows could be induced by a positive feedback between net rate of peat formation and acrotelm thickness. Theory also predicts how scale-dependent and positive feedbacks drive underlying patterns in nutrients, hydrology, and hydrochemistry, but these predictions have not yet been tested empirically. The aim of this study was to provide an empirical test for the theoretical predictions; therefore, we measured underlying patterns in nutrients, hydrology, and hydrochemistry across a maze-patterned peatland in the Great Vasyugan Bog, Siberia. The field data corroborated predicted patterns as induced by scale-dependent feedback; nutrient concentrations were higher on ridges than in hollows. Moreover, diurnal dynamics in water table level clearly corresponded to evapotranspiration and showed that water levels in two ridges were lower than in the hollow in between. Also, the data on hydrochemistry suggested that evapotranspiration rates were higher on ridges. The bimodal frequency distribution in acrotelm thickness indicated sharp boundaries between ridges and hollows, supporting the occurrence of a positive feedback. Moreover, nutrient content in plant tissue was most strongly associated with acrotelm thickness, supporting the view that positive feedback further amplifies ridge-hollow differences in nutrient status. Our measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that the combination of scale-dependent and positive feedback induces peatland patterning.

AB Antipredator defenses are expected to decrease toward higher latitudes because predation rates are predicted to decrease with latitude. However, latitudinal variation in predator avoidance and defense mechanisms has seldom been studied. We studied tadpole antipredator defenses in seven Rana temporaria populations collected along a 1500-km latitudinal gradient across Sweden, along which previous studies have found increasing tadpole growth and development rates. In a laboratory common garden experiment, we measured behavioral and morphological defenses by raising tadpoles in the presence and absence of a predator (Aeshna dragonfly larva) in two temperature treatments. We also estimated tadpole survival in the presence of free-ranging predators and compared predator densities between R. temporaria breeding ponds situated at low and high latitudes. Activity and foraging were generally positively correlated with latitude in the common garden experiment. While all populations responded to predator presence by decreasing activity and foraging, high-latitude populations maintained higher activity levels in the presence of the predator. All populations exhibited defensive morphology in body and tail shape. However, whereas tail depth tended to increase with latitude in the presence of predator, it did not change with latitude in the absence of the predator. Predator presence generally increased larval period and decreased growth rate. In the southern populations, predator presence tended to have a negative effect on metamorphic size, whereas in the northern populations predators had little or a positive effect on size. Latitude of origin had a strong effect on survival in the presence of a free-ranging predator, with high-latitude tadpoles experiencing higher mortality than those from the low latitudes. In the wild, predator densities were significantly lower in high-latitude than in mid-latitude breeding ponds. Although the higher activity level in the northern populations seems to confer a significant survival disadvantage under predation risk, it is probably needed to maintain the high growth and development rates. However, the occurrence of R. temporaria at high latitudes may be facilitated by the lower predator densities in the north.

Avoiding deforestation - a controversial carbon reduction option now under climate policy discussion - shows promise though for both forest conservation and poverty alleviation among indigenous forest peoples.

   experiments
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE

ID MATTER; FEEDBACK; CLIMATE; SAMPLES
AB The Rothamsted long-term field experiments, started more than 150 years ago, provide unique material for the study of carbon turnover in subsoils. Total organic C, C-14 and C-13 were measured on soil profiles taken from these experiments, before and after the thermonuclear bomb tests of the mid-20th century. Four contrasting systems of land management were sampled: land cultivated every year for winter wheat; regenerating woodland on acid soil; regenerating woodland on calcareous soil; and old grassland. The mean radiocarbon ages of all the pre-bomb samples from cultivated land were 1210 years (0-23 cm), 2040 years (23-46 cm), 3610 years (46-69 cm) and 5520 years (69-92 cm). Bomb radiocarbon derived from thermonuclear tests was present throughout the profile in all the post-bomb samples, although below 23 cm the amounts were small and the pre- and post-bomb radiocarbon measurements were often not significantly different. Values of delta C-13 increased down the profile, from -26.3 parts per thousand (0-23 cm layer, mean of all measurements) to -25.2 parts per thousand for the 69-92 cm layer. The C/N ratios decreased with depth in virtually all of the profiles sampled. Excluding the surface (0-23 cm) soils from the old grassland, the hyperbola m = 152.1 - 2341/(1 + 0.264n) gave a close fit to the radiocarbon data from all depths, all sampling times and all sites, where n is the organic C content of the soil, in t ha(-1), and m is the radiocarbon content of the soil, in Delta C-14 units, corrected for expansion or contraction of soil layers with time. The aberrant grassland soils almost certainly contained coal: one of them was shown by C-13-NMR to contain 0.82% coal C. In Part 2 (this issue) of this pair of papers, these radiocarbon and total C measurements are used to develop and test a new model for the turnover of organic C in subsoils.

AB We investigated changes in soil carbon (C) cycling with reforestation across a long-term, replicated chronosequence of tropical secondary forests regrowing on abandoned pastures. We applied CP MAS C-13 NMR spectroscopy and radiocarbon modeling to soil density fractions from the top 10 cm to track changes in C chemistry and turnover during secondary forest establishment on former pastures. Our results showed that inter-aggregate, unattached, particulate organic C (free light fraction) and particulate C located inside soil aggregates (occluded light fraction) represent distinct soil C pools with different chemical composition and turnover rates. The signal intensity of the O-alkyl region, primarily representing carbohydrates, decreased, and alkyl C, attributed to recalcitrant waxy compounds and microbially resynthesized lipids, increased from plant litter to soil organic matter and with incorporation into soil aggregates. The alkyl/O-alkyl ratio, a common index of humification, was higher in the occluded than in the free light fraction. Greater variability in the chemical makeup of the occluded light fraction suggests that it represents material in varied stages of decomposition. Mean residence times (14 C-based) of the free light fraction were significantly shorter (4 I years) than for the heavy fraction. We report two scenarios for the occluded light fraction, one fast-cycling in which the occluded and free light fractions have similar turnover rates, and one slow-cycling, in which the occluded light fraction resembles the heavy fraction. Mean residence times of the occluded light fraction and heavy fraction in active pastures and 10-year old secondary forests in the earliest stage of succession were longer than in older secondary forests and primary forests. This is likely due to a preferential loss of physically unprotected C of more labile composition in the pastures and in the youngest successional forests, resulting in an increase in the dominance of slow-cycling C pools. Soil carbon turnover rates of the mineral-associated C in secondary forests recovering from abandoned pasture resembled those of primary forests in as little as 20 years of succession.

AB Soil moisture content and leaf area index (LAI) are properties that will be particularly important in mediating whole system responses to the combined effects of elevated atmospheric [CO2], warming and altered precipitation. Warming and drying will likely reduce soil moisture, and this effect may be exacerbated when these factors are combined. However, elevated [CO2] may increase soil moisture contents and when combined with warming and drying may partially compensate for their effects. The response of LAI to elevated [CO2] and warming will be closely tied to soil moisture status and may mitigate or exacerbate the effects of global change on soil moisture. Using open-top chambers (4-m diameter), the interactive effects of elevated [CO2], warming, and differential irrigation on soil moisture availability were examined in the OCCAM (Old-Field Community Climate and Atmospheric Manipulation) experiment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee. Warming consistently reduced soil moisture contents and this effect was exacerbated by reduced irrigation. However, elevated [CO2] mitigated the effects of warming and drying on soil moisture. LAI was determined using an AccuPAR ceptometer and both the leaf area duration (LAD) and canopy size were increased by irrigation and elevated [CO2]. Changes in LAI were closely linked to soil moisture status. The climate of the southeastern United States is predicted to be warmer and drier in the future, and this research suggests that although elevated [CO2] will ameliorate the effects of warming and drying, losses of soil moisture will cause declines in the LAI of old field ecosystems in the future.

AB Cannibalistic and asymmetrical behavioral interactions between stages are common within stage-structured predator populations. Such direct interactions between predator stages can result in density- and trait-mediated indirect interactions between a predator and its prey. A set of structured predator-prey models is used to explore how such indirect interactions affect the dynamics and structure of communities. Analyses of the separate and combined effects of stage-structured cannibalism and behavior-mediated avoidance of cannibals under different ecological scenarios show that both cannibalism and behavioral avoidance of cannibalism can result in short- and long-term positive indirect connections between predator stages and the prey, including "apparent mutualism." These positive interactions alter the strength of trophic cascades such that the system's dynamics are determined by the interaction between bottom-up and top-down effects. Contrary to the expectation of simpler models, enrichment increases both predator and prey abundance in systems with cannibalism or behavioral avoidance of cannibalism. The effect of behavioral avoidance of cannibalism, however, depends on how strongly it affects the maturation rate of the predator. Behavioral interactions between predator stages reduce the short-term positive effect of cannibalism on the prey density, but can enhance its positive long-term effects. Both interaction types reduce the destabilizing effect of enrichment. These results suggest that inconsistencies between data and simple models can be resolved by accounting for stage-structured interactions within and among species.

AB 1. In many vertebrates, reproductive performance increases with advancing age but mechanisms involved in such a pattern remain poorly studied. One potential mechanism may be the hormonal stress response, which shifts energy investment away from reproduction and redirects it towards survival. In birds, this stress response is achieved through a release of corticosterone and is also accompanied by a decrease in circulating prolactin, a hormone involved widely in regulating parental cares.
   2. It has been predicted that, when the value of the current reproduction is high relative to the value of future reproduction and survival, as it is expected to be in older adults, the stress response should be attenuated to ensure that reproduction is not inhibited.
   3. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the corticosterone and prolactin responses of known-age (8-36 years old) incubating snow petrels (Pagadroma nivea) to a standardized capture/handling stress protocol. We also investigated whether an attenuation of the stress responses will correlate with a lower occurrence of egg neglect, a frequently observed behaviour in snow petrels.
   4. The probability of successfully fledging a chick increased from 6 years to 12 years before stabilizing after 12 years of age. Corticosterone response to stress was unaffected by age. Prolactin response to stress, however, was influenced clearly by age: in both sexes older breeders had higher stress-induced prolactin levels than younger ones. This was due to an increasing attenuation of the prolactin response to stress with advancing age in females, and in males this was due to a probably higher intrinsic capacity of older males to secrete prolactin. Moreover, higher stress-induced prolactin levels were correlated with a lower probability of neglecting the egg.
   5. In young breeders, the combination of a robust corticosterone increase with a lower ability to maintain prolactin secretion during acute stress is probably one of the functional causes of their lower incubation commitment. We suggest that the ability to maintain a threshold level of prolactin during a stressful situation may be an important physiological mechanism involved in the improvement of reproductive performance with advancing age in long-lived birds.

AB Functional characters have the potential to act as indicators of species turnover between local communities. Null models provide a powerful statistical approach to test for patterns using functional character information. A combined null model/functional character approach provides the ability to distinguish between the effect of competition and environmental filtering on species turnover. We measured 13 functional characters relating directly to resource use for the fish species found in French lakes. We combined this functional character data with a null model approach to test whether co-occurring species overlapped more or less than expected at random for four primary niche axes. We used an environmentally constrained null model approach to determine if the same mechanisms were responsible for species turnover at different sections of the altitudinal gradient. Functional diversity indices were used to examine the variation in functional character diversity with altitude, as a test of the hypothesis that competitive intensity decreases with increasing environmental adversity. The unconstrained null model showed that environmental filtering was the dominant influence on species turnover between lakes. In the constrained null model, there was much less evidence for environmental filtering, emphasising the strong effect of altitude on turnover in functional character values between local communities. Different results were obtained for low-altitude and high-altitude lake subsets, with more evidence for the effect of environmental filtering being found in the high-altitude lakes. This demonstrates that different processes may influence species turnover throughout an environmental gradient. Functional diversity values showed a slight decrease with altitude, indicating that there was only weak evidence that competitive intensity decreased with increasing altitude. Variation resource availability and environmental stress probably cause the observed turnover in functional characters along the altitudinal gradient, though the effects of dispersal limitation and species introductions in high-altitude lakes cannot be ruled out.

AB Predator and prey spatial distributions have important population and community level consequences. However, little is known either theoretically or empirically about behavioral mechanisms that underlie the spatial patterns that emerge when predators and prey freely interact. We examined the joint space use and behavioral rules governing movement of freely interacting groups of odonate (dragonfly) predators and two size classes of anuran (tadpole) prey in arenas containing two patches with different levels of the prey's resource. Predator and prey movement and space use was quantified both when they were apart and together. When apart from predators, large tadpoles strongly preferred the high resource patch. When apart from prey, dragonflies weakly preferred the high resource patch. When together, large prey shifted to a uniform distribution, while predators strongly preferred the high resource patch. These patterns qualitatively fit the predictions of several three trophic level, ideal free distribution models. In contrast, the space use of small prey and predators did not deviate from uniform. Three measures of joint space use ( spatial correlations, overlap, and co-occurrence) concurred in suggesting that prey avoidance of predators was more important than predator attraction to prey in determining overall spatial patterns. To gain additional insight into behavioral mechanisms, we used a model selection approach to identify behavioral movement rules that can potentially explain the observed, emergent patterns of space use. Prey were more likely to leave patches with more predators and more conspecific competitors; resources had relatively weak effects on prey movements. In contrast, predators were more likely to leave patches with low resources (that they do not consume) and more competing predators; prey had relatively little effect on predator movements. These results highlight the importance of investigating freely interacting predators and prey, the potential for simple game theory models to predict joint spatial distributions, and the utility of using model choice methods to identify potential key factors that govern movement.

AB On exposed rocky shores in northwestern Spain there is a striking polymorphism of Littorina saxatilis that has been claimed as an example of a putative, sympatric ecological speciation process. Two ecotypes of this species have evolved that are adapted to diflerent shore levels and habitats, although they, meet and hybridize on the mid shore where their two habitats overlap. As a by-product of adaptation these ecotypes have evolved in incomplete premating reproductive isolation where they meet oil the mid shore. Although they are not yet true species, and the final outcome of the process cannot be predicted, the ecological mechanisms responsible for this polymorphism could cause sympatric speciation in similar situations. Here, I review all data in support of these claims and discuss the interest of such a model system in microevolutionary studies.

AB We employ a comparative phylogenetic analysis to gain insight into the recent evolutionary history of Macaca fascicularis, the longtailed macaque. Mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal topologies both show that, in general, the deepest intraspecific bifurcations separate Indochinese and Sundaic forms of this species. Sumatran populations, however, are an exception: they carry one Y-chromosomal lineage that clusters with continental populations, and another that clusters with insular stocks. This discovery provides insight into two events in the history of M. J fascicularis. First, the presence of the 'continental' Y-lineage on Sumatra is one of the strongest lines of evidence to date for recent (Late Pleistocene) gene flow between Indochinese and Sundaic populations. Second, since Sumatra is the only region known to carry 'continental' YDNA and 'insular' mtDNA, it is considered the most likely source of the Mauritian macaques-an important biomedical research stock that appears to carry this mtDNA/YDNA combination exclusively.

AB The Point Conception, California, USA region (hereafter PC) is one of the most important biogeographic and oceanographic discontinuities on the US west coast. Here we address how mesoscale oceanographic variability in the region around PC affects the growth of the competitively dominant species in the rocky intertidal assemblage: the mussel Mytilus californianus. Strong upwelling and high wave exposure dominate the California coast north of PC, and weak, seasonal upwelling and warmer water temperatures are characteristic of the region south/east of PC. We hypothesized that the oceanographic gradients in temperature, upwelling, wave exposure and productivity around PC would exert strong bottom-up influences on growth rates of mussels, potentially underlying large-scale differences in community structure around the PC region. We evaluated these predictions by measuring mussel growth rates across the PC region both in the intertidal and offshore on moorings. Intertidal mussels grew at much higher rates at sites south relative to north of PC and growth rates decreased in a gradient from south to north. The gradient in intertidal mussel growth around PC was uncorrelated with inshore concentrations of chlorophyll-a, and was most strongly correlated with the alongshore gradient in wave exposure and intertidal temperature. Mussels on moorings offshore from the intertidal sites grew at much higher rates than those in the corresponding intertidal areas, and mussel growth rates did not differ significantly among moored locations around PC. The gradient of increasing temperature from north to south among mooring sites was correlated with a decreasing gradient in productivity in the same direction, potentially contributing to equal and opposite effects on mussel growth at offshore moorings. This study suggests that environmental factors such as cold temperatures and high wave exposure contribute to the spatial pattern of decreasing mussel growth rates from south to north around PC, underlying large-scale patterns of community structure in this region.

AB Aim We quantify the elevational patterns of species richness for all vascular plants and some functional and taxonomic groups on a regional scale on a tropical mountain and discuss some possible causes for the observed patterns.
   Location Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Borneo.
   Methods A data base containing elevational information on more than 28,000 specimens was analysed for vascular plant distribution, taking into account sampling effort. The total species richness pattern was estimated per 300-m elevational interval by rarefaction analyses. The same methods were also applied to quantify species richness patterns of trees, epiphytes, and ferns.
   Results Total species richness has a humped relationship with elevation, and a maximum species richness in the interval between 900 and 1200 m. For ferns and epiphytes the maximum species richness is found at slightly higher elevations, whereas tree species did not have a statistically significant peak in richness above the lowest interval analysed.
   Main conclusions For the first time a rigorous estimate of an elevational pattern in species richness of the whole vascular plant flora of a tropical mountain has been quantified. The pattern observed depends on the group studied. We discuss the differences between the groups and compare the results with previous studies of elevational patterns of species richness from other tropical areas. We also discuss the methods used to quantify the richness pattern and conclude that rarefaction gives an appropriate estimate of the species richness pattern.

AB The Cucurbitales are a clade of rosids with a worldwide distribution and a striking heterogeneity in species diversity among its seven family members: the Anisophylleaceae (29-40 species), Begoniaceae (1400 spp.), Coriariaccae (15 spp.), Corynocarpaceae (6 spp.), Cucurbitaccae (800 spp.), Datiscaceae (2 spp.). and Tetramelaceae (2 spp.). Most Cucurbitales have unisexual flowers, and species are monoecious, dioecious, andromonoecious, or androdioecious. To resolve interfamilial relation ships within the order and to polarize morphological character evolution, especially of flower sexual systems, we sequenced nine plastids (atpB, matK, ndhF, rbcL, the trnL-F region, and the rp/20-rps12 spacer), nuclear (18S and 26S rDNA), and mitochondrial (nad1 b/c intron) genes (together similar to 12,000 bp) of 26 representatives of the seven families plus eight outgroup taxa from six other orders of the Eurosids I. Cucurbitales are strongly supported as monophyletic and are closest to Fagales, albeit with moderate support; both together are sister to Rosales. The deepest split in the Cueurbitales is that between the Anisophylleaceae and the remaining families; next is a clade of Corynocarpaceae and Coriariaceae, followed by Cucurbitaceae, which are sister to a clade of Begoniaceae, Datiscaceae, and Tetramelaceae. Based on this topology, stipulate leaves, inferior ovaries, parietal placentation, and one-seeded fruits are inferred as ancestral in Cucurbitales; exstipulate leaves, superior ovaries, apical placentation, and many-seeded fruits evolved within the order. Bisexual flowers are reconstructed as ancestral, but dioecy appears to have evolved already in the common ancestor of Begoniaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Datiscaceae, and Tetramelaceae, and then to have been lost repeatedly in Begoniaceae and Cucurbitaceae. Both instances of androdioecy (Datisca glomerata and Schizopep,on bryoniifolius) evolved from dioecious ancestors, corroborating recent hypotheses about androdioecy often evolving from dioecy.

AB Traditionally, researchers have used measurements of carbon stable isotopes to infer the composition of consumers' diets. However, since consumer's tissues may process carbon isotopes differently, particularly following a diet shift, it is possible to use measurements of carbon isotopes in multiple tissues to determine not only the composition of an individual's diet, but also the temporal dynamics thereof. This study examined how stable isotopes of carbon (C-13/C-12, expressed as delta(13)C) changed in different adult tissues of two predacious beetles, Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). In the laboratory, we switched ladybeetles from a C3-based diet (soybean aphids, Aphis glycines) to a C4-based one (corn leaf aphids, Rhopalosiphum maidis). The delta(13)C of metabolically active tissues such as the body fat and reproductive organs changed rapidly (<= 5 days) following the diet shift. Tissues expected to be more metabolically inert, such as wings, changed more slowly over the same period. Although these general patterns were largely similar between males and females, females had more rapid changes in delta(13)C in fat and reproductive tissues. However, females showed a significant depletion in delta(13)C after 10 days, while males' delta(13)C continued to increase. Given the results of this experiment, it is now possible to distinguish between ladybeetles eating a mixed diet (beetles with multiple tissues at similar, intermediate, equilibrial delta(13)C signatures) from those that have shifted diets (beetles with different tissues at distinctly different delta(13)C values). Thus, this approach can be used broadly to infer not only what constitutes the diet of a consumer, but also the temporal history of dietary intake.

AB Conservation scientists recognize the urgency of incorporating opportunity costs into conservation planning. Despite this, applications to date have been limited, perhaps partly because of the difficulty in determining costs in regions with limited data on land prices and ownership. We present methods for estimating opportunity costs of land preservation in landscapes or ecoregions that are a changing mix of agriculture and natural habitat. Our approach derives from the literature on estimating land values as opportunity costs of alternate land uses and takes advantage of general availability of necessary data, even in relatively data-poor regions. The methods integrate probabilities of habitat conversion with region-wide estimates of economic benefits from agricultural land uses and estimate land values with a discount rate to convert annual values into net present values. We applied our method in a landscape undergoing agricultural conversion in Paraguay. Our model of opportunity costs predicted an independent data set of land values and was consistent with implicit discount rates of 15-25%. Model-generated land values were strongly correlated with actual land values even after correcting for the effect of property size and proportion of property that was forested. We used the model to produce a map of opportunity costs and to estimate the costs of conserving forest within two proposed corridors in the landscape. This method can be applied to conservation planning in situations where natural habitat is currently being converted to market-oriented land uses. Incorporating not only biological attributes but also socioeconomic data can help in the design of efficient networks of protected areas that represent biodiversity at minimum costs.

AB Ants are prominent components of most terrestrial arthropod food webs, yet due to their highly variable diet, the role ants play in arthropod communities can be difficult to resolve. Stable isotope analysis is a promising method for determining the dietary history of an organism, and has the potential to advance our understanding of the food web ecology of social insects. However, some unique characteristics of eusocial organisms can complicate the application of this technique to the study of their trophic ecology. Using stable isotopes of N and C, we investigated levels of intraspecific variation both within and among colonies. We also examined the effect of a common preservation technique on delta N-15 and delta C-13 values. We discuss the implications of our results on experimental design and sampling methods for studies using stable isotopes to investigate the trophic ecology of social insects.

AB The paper reviews how we can learn from the past about climate-human-environment interactions at the present time, and in the future. It focuses on data sources for environmental change at local/regional and regional/global spatial scales, and shows the scope and limitations of each. It reviews alternative methods for learning from the past, including the increasing use of simulation models. The use of multiple records (observational, palaeoenvironmental, archaeological, documentary) in local case-studies is exemplified in a study from China, where independent records help unravel the complexity of interactions and provide a basis for assessing the resilience and sustainability of the landscape system. Holocene global records for Natural Forcings (e.g. climate and tectonics), Human Society and Ecosystems are reviewed, and the problems of reconstructing global records of processes that are only recorded at local scales examined. Existing regional/global records are used to speculate about the veracity of anthropogenic forcing of global climate, with specific consideration of the Ruddiman theory. The paper concludes that a full understanding of causes of earth system change through ( at least) the Holocene can come only through the most rigorous reconstructions of climate, human activities and earth processes, and importantly their interactions, at all locations and at all scales. It follows that we need to promote inter-scale learning: regionalisation and generalisation of existing data would be useful first steps. There is now a need to develop long-term simulation models that can help anticipate complex ecosystem behaviour and environmental processes in the face of global environmental change - and resolving our past is an essential element in that endeavour.

AB To better understand changes in the distribution and diversity within plant functional types along an elevational gradient and the potential mechanisms driving such changes, we studied species richness of ferns at six elevations along a forested elevational gradient in Costa Rica, from La Selva Biological Station at 30 m a.s.l. up the slopes of Volcan Barva to 2960 m a.s.l. Among the samples from all the sites combined, we found 264 species from 60 genera. Sixty-nine species were terrestrial, 113 were canopy epiphytes, and 121 were low-trunk epiphytes. Only one species occupied both canopy and terrestrial habitats at any of the study sites. Overlap of canopy and low-trunk species composition was relatively low (18%), and lower still was the overlap of terrestrial and low-trunk species (12%). Total species richness peaked at the 1000-m site for canopy and low-trunk epiphytic species. In contrast, the richness of terrestrial species rose to a mid-elevation maximum and remained relatively constant at higher elevations. In an effort to explain elevational patterns of species richness, we examined mean annual rainfall and temperature, light intensities in the canopy and at ground level, and the mid-domain effect. Of the explanatory factors examined, the mid-domain effect accounted for most of the elevational pattern. We found little evidence that environmental gradients drive patterns of fern species richness on this spatial scale.

AB The aims of this study are to compare cross-shelf variation in diversity and community composition of four benthic taxa (sea urchins, sponges, corals and foraminifera) in the reefs of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, and relate this variation to cross-shelf environmental parameters, i.e. distance offshore, depth and exposure to oceanic currents. Rarefied species richness and Shannon's H' varied unimodally with the distance offshore and depth for all taxa (except sea urchins) and were highest at intermediate distances offshore and depths. There was no significant association between evenness and distance offshore. Evenness did, however, vary with depth and exposure. Overall, models using distance offshore, depth and exposure explained most of the variation in sponge and coral diversity but substantially less variation in foraminifera diversity. Variation in composition depended on distance offshore, depth and exposure although the relative importance of these variables differed among taxa. Depth was the most important parameter for sponges, corals and foraminifera but not for sea urchins. Sponge and coral assemblages differed markedly from in-to-off-shore but there was relatively little variation in foraminifera assemblages with most foraminifera species having broad cross-shelf distributions. Foraminifera assemblages on the contrary differed markedly between exposed and sheltered reef environments; species in exposed reef environments, for example, consisted of species with distinct strategies for coping with the increased hydrodynamic energy. In summary, this study shows that benthic taxa in the Spermonde are distributed along continuous gradients (in-to-off-shore and shallow-to-deep) in addition to occupying discrete habitats related to reef exposure.

AB Aim This paper examines the importance of regional processes in determining the patterns of distribution and diversity of lower Mesoamerican freshwater fishes.
   Location We focused our analyses on the lower Mesoamerican region, which we define to include all the rivers of Panama and Costa Rica. The geographic boundaries are the Colombian Choco to the south and Lake Nicaragua to the north.
   Methods We described the biogeographical provinces of lower Mesoamerica (LMA) using presence/absence data of primary and secondary LMA freshwater fishes. We conducted subsequent analyses at the spatial resolution of the biogeographical provinces and described patterns of community composition, species richness, endemism, range size, and the permeability of dispersal barriers between biogeographical provinces.
   Results This study represents the first attempt since that of W. A. Bussing in 1976 to investigate the biogeographical regions of Mesoamerica, and our analyses demonstrate increased regional complexity in biodiversity patterns relative to previous studies. Changes in community composition across LMA clearly highlight the importance of both extrinsic geological processes and intrinsic biological differences among freshwater fish species in shaping the dispersal and diversification histories of the LMA freshwater fish fauna. The influence of biology and geology is also exemplified by patterns of endemism and turnover between biogeographical provinces, which suggests that the relative importance of regional speciation and dispersal varies spatially across the LMA landscape. Finally, it would seem to follow that secondary freshwater fishes will have larger range sizes than primary fishes as a result of the increased salinity tolerance posited for the former group, and thus the increased probability of dispersal along coastlines. We did not, however, find a significant difference between the average range size of primary and secondary freshwater fishes, indicating that the putative differences in physiological tolerance to seawater between the two groups are not reflected in their distribution patterns at the scale of LMA. The geometric distribution of range size of LMA freshwater fishes suggests that dispersal of both primary and secondary freshwater fishes along coastlines must be infrequent.
   Main conclusion The observation that regional processes exerted a strong influence on the assembly and maintenance of LMA freshwater fish communities has important consequences for both theory and conservation. We suggest that large-scale biogeographical analyses are required to illuminate the backdrop upon which local interactions play themselves out, supporting a top-down approach to the study of biological diversity. Our results also identify areas of high conservation priority, providing a baseline for informing conservation strategies for freshwater fishes in LMA. We conclude by calling for conservation planning and action that acknowledges the importance that regional processes play in determining patterns of organismal diversity, and that incorporates these processes in strategies to conserve remnant biological diversity.

AB In male baboons, social instability is known to increase concentrations of glucocorticoids (GCs), a class of steroid hormones associated with the vertebrate stress response. The stress response may be particularly marked among male chacma baboons, whose social groups often demonstrate a strong mating skew and high rates of infanticide. Here we test this prediction and explore additional correlates of variation in concentrations of GCs measured in faeces. We collected 482 faecal samples from 13 males over 14 months. Changes in the male hierarchy were the major source of GC variation. Such instability occurred as the result of a new immigrant male's take-over of the alpha position, a resident male's rise to the alpha position, and the rise in rank of a young natal male. All three events were correlated with elevated GCs among all males and higher rates of male-male aggression than were found during periods of stability. The interaction between rank and instability had a significant effect on GC concentrations; low-ranking males had higher GCs during stable periods, whereas high-ranking males had higher GCs during unstable periods. Males that dispersed had elevated GCs in the month following immigration but not at other times, including the month preceding emigration. Finally, entering into a sexual consortship led to a temporary increase in a male's GC measures. By contrast, seasonal changes and a male's age were unrelated to GCs. GC variation in chacma males was primarily explained by temporary elevations following events that relate to reproductive fitness. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While local processes (e.g., competition, predation, and disturbance) presumably cause species exclusion and thus limit diversity in individual communities, regional processes (e.g., historical events, immigration, and speciation) are assumed to provide a source of species to colonize and thus enrich local communities. Ecologists have attempted to distinguish between these two sets of processes using graphical evidence for local assemblage saturation. However, such efforts have been controversial and are antithetical to the fact that local diversity bears an imprint of both. We examine the local-regional species richness relationship from the perspective of the theory of island biogeography and develop a model that can produce the full range of observed local-regional richness relationships from linear to curvilinear. Importantly, unlike previous models, we do not require species interactions to produce the curvilinear pattern. Curvilinear relationships arise if per-species stochastic extinction rates are substantially higher than colonization rates, while linear relationships result if colonization rates are higher than extinction rates. Because we also show that merely changing the sampling scale can make local-regional relationships appear either saturated or unsaturated, an inference of ecological processes, derived solely from local-regional relationships, is unwarranted.

AB Temporal and spatial dynamics of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were examined using genes encoding 16S rRNA and ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (AmoA) in Monterey Bay, Calif. Samples were collected from three depths in the water column on four dates at one mid-bay station. Diversity estimators for the two genes showed a strong positive correlation, indicating that overlapping bacterial populations had been sampled by both sets of clone libraries. Some samples that were separated by only 15 m in depth had less genetic similarity than samples that were collected from the same depth months apart. Clone libraries from the Monterey Bay AOB community were dominated by Nitrosospira-like sequences and clearly differentiated from the adjacent AOB community in Elkhorn Slough. Many Monterey Bay clones clustered with previously identified 16S rRNA and amoA groups composed entirely of marine sequences, supporting the hypothesis that these groups are specific to the marine environment and are dominant marine AOB. In addition, novel, phylogenetically distinct groups of AOB sequences were identified and compared to sequences in the database. Only one cluster of gammaproteobacterial AOB was detected using 16S rRNA genes. Although significant genetic variation was detected in AOB populations from both vertical and temporal samples, no significant correlation was detected between diversity and environmental variables or the rate of nitrification.

AB To better understand patterns of spatial variability in soil properties of created wetlands (CWs), restored wetlands (RWs), and natural wetlands (NWs), we sampled four CW or RW-NW pairs in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina using a spatially explicit design. The site pairs spanned a range of hydrogeomorphic (HGM) settings common in the Coastal Plain. We hypothesized that: (i) spatial variability of soil properties in riverine wetlands would be structured along gradients running perpendicular to streams, while spatial variability of soil properties in nonriverine wetlands would be structured in patches related to local factors (microtopography, vegetation); and (ii) soil properties of CWs and RWs would exhibit less spatial variability than soil properties of NWs as prior land-use and mitigation activities tend to homogenize soil properties. Trend surface analysis revealed that even in plots selected for homogeneous topography, linear and nonlinear trends were present in CWs, RWs. and NWs across all subclasses. Moran's I analysis indicated that fine-scale variability for bulk density (D,), soil organic matter (SOM), and pH was more prevalent in NWs than in paired CWs or RWs. At certain sites, prior land-use and mitigation activities reduced spatial variability of soil properties such as sand content, while at other sites, they increased or had no effect on variability of soil properties such as SOM. Thus, patterns of variability were complex and differed among soil properties, sites, and HGM subclasses. A better understanding of this phenomenon will help us to incorporate appropriate variability into wetland mitigation design and construction, improving creation and restoration of functional wetlands.

AB Mycorrhizal fungi play a critical role in nutrient cycling and ecosystem function. They improve plant growth and survival through a mutualistic relationship in which photosynthates are exchanged for increased access to water and nutrients. Because the benefits realized are not equal among different plant-fungal species combinations, mycorrhizal fungi may help govern plant community structure and successional trajectories. In fact, both plant productivity and plant diversity have been shown to increase with increasing diversity of mycorrhizal fungi. The diversity and species composition of plant communities also exert a reciprocal influence on associated mycorrhizal communities, although edaphic factors may also play a role. Given this inherent bi-directionality of mycorrhizal relationships, the potential exists for positive feedback mechanisms which may promote and maintain both plant and mycorrhizal fungal diversity. This review considers recent literature on both arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungal-plant community relationships within a variety of environments, including artificially constructed systems and naturally occurring grasslands and forests.

AB Seed mass is considered to be an important attribute for the establishment success of plant species being linked with their seed production, establishment, and survival. This meta-analysis shows that seed mass is also closely correlated to growth-related species attributes of the established phase of rain forest tree species, and that the strength of this relationship varies with light conditions. Seed mass is an especially good predictor of species traits under high-light conditions, when the species attain their full growth potential. At high irradiance (>20% of full light) seed mass is negatively correlated with RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and LMF. At low irradiance (<5% of full light), seed mass is only negatively correlated with LAR and SLA. Correlations between seed mass and morphological traits are therefore strongest at low irradiance where light interception is important. Conversely, correlations between seed mass and a physiological trait are strongest at high irradiance, where maximisation of photosynthetic rates is important. The strength of the correlation between growth parameters and seed mass declines over time, and disappears after 1-4 years. Seed mass appears to be a good proxy for the shade tolerance of tropical tree species, especially at the younger stages of the life cycle.

AB Complete sequencing of the mitochondrial control region was used to describe phylogenetic relationships of brown trout populations (Salmo trutta) in the Mediterranean river basins of Iberia and to review the historical biogeography of trout from the Mediterranean regions. Phylogenetic relationships among trout lineages suggested that the Danubian one is the most ancestral, in accordance with the eastern origin of most of the European freshwater fish species. Nested-clade and mismatch analyses suggested that the present distribution of haplotypes of the Adriatic and Mediterranean lineages resulted from population expansions originated, respectively, from central and western Europe, which favoured extensive secondary contacts between lineages. Reduced diversity detected within 50% of the analysed populations and large intrabasin differentiation indicated restricted gene flow in post-glacial periods. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Aim To test the potential of two contrasting biogeographical hypotheses ('Indian/Pacific Ocean Basin' vs. 'Wallace's Line') to explain the distribution of genetic diversity among populations of a marine fish in Southeast Asia.
   Location The marine waters of Asia and Southeast Asia: from India to Japan, and east to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and Flores.
   Methods We sequenced a 696 base pair fragment of cytochrome b DNA of 100 individuals of Hippocampus trimaculatus Leach 1814 (three-spot seahorse), obtained from across its range. We tested our hypotheses using phylogenetic reconstructions and analyses of molecular variance.
   Results Significant genetic divergence was observed among the specimens. Two distinct lineages emerged that diverged by an average of 2.9%. The genetic split was geographically associated, but surprisingly it indicated a major east-west division similar to the terrestrial Wallace's Line (Phi(ST) = 0.662, P < 0.001) rather than one consistent with an Indian-Pacific ocean basin separation hypothesis (Phi(ST) = 0.023, P = 0.153). Samples from east of Wallace's Line, when analysed separately, however, were consistent with an Indian/Pacific Ocean separation (Phi(ST) = 0.461, P = 0.005). The degree of genetic and geographical structure within each lineage also varied. Lineage A, to the west, was evolutionarily shallow (star-like), and the haplotypes it contained often occurred over a wide area. Lineage B to the east had greater genetic structure, and there was also some evidence of geographical localization of sublineages within B.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate that the genetic diversity of marine organisms in Southeast Asia may reflect a more complex history than the simple division between two major ocean basins that has been proposed by previous authors. In particular, the east-west genetic division observed here is novel among marine organisms examined to date. The high haplotype, but low nucleotide diversity to the west of Wallace's Line is consistent with post-glacial colonization of the Sunda Shelf. Additional data are needed to test the generality of these patterns.

AB Inshore marine areas host key habitats for the biological cycle of many marine populations, but are subject to strong anthropogenic pressure. Uses of inshore areas are multiple and often give rise to conflicting interests. In this context. marine protected areas (MPAs) and artificial reefs (ARs) are increasingly regarded as interesting management measures, in that they contribute to ecosystem conservation, fisheries sustainability, and because they can be helpful in zoning coastal areas in order to reduce conflicts between users. Beyond these expected benefits, it is important to appraise whether MPAs and ARs meet managers' objectives. This review focuses on the interaction between ecological sciences and management in the purpose of establishing or monitoring MPAs and ARs. We first study how objectives have to be formalized through management plans, and which kinds of information need to be collected in this respect. We then report management objectives related to MPAs and ARs, and list corresponding observed effects. Finally, we discuss the present role of monitoring and scientific research in the management process and propose a few perspectives for scientific research.

AB We investigated the quantitative genetics of plasticity in resource allocation between survival, growth and reproductive effort in Crassostrea gigas when food abundance varies spatially. Resource allocation shifted from survival to growth and reproductive effort as food abundance increased. An optimality model suggests that this plastic shift may be adaptive. Reproductive effort plasticity and mean survival were highly heritable, whereas for growth, both mean and plasticity had low heritability. The genetic correlations between reproductive effort and both survival and growth were negative in poor treatments, suggesting trade-offs, but positive in rich ones. These sign reversals may reflect genetic variability in resource acquisition, which would only be expressed when food is abundant. Finally, we found positive genetic correlations between reproductive effort plasticity and both growth and survival means. The latter may reflect adaptation of C. gigas to differential sensitivity of fitness to survival, such that genetic variability in survival mean might support genetic variability in reproductive effort plasticity.

AB As is true for many fish and invertebrate fisheries, stock-recruitment relationships remain poorly understood for most commercially important species of lobsters and crabs. This paper gives a critical overview of advances in assessing the relative importance of pre- and post-settlement processes to the recruitment of 14 commercially and/or ecologically important lobsters and crabs. Three case studies (western rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus, blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the American lobster, Homarus americanus) are used to illustrate where standard fishery survey methods, combined with field experiments, have provided insights into the form of stock-recruit relationships and the ecological processes that influence them. It is notable that larval supply-dominated cases, such as that of P. cygnus, may be less common than those dominated by post-settlement processes, such as C sapidus, in which strong compensatory processes lead to non-linear spawner-to-recruit or juvenile-to-recruit relationships. In other cases, such as H. americanus, the influence of post-settlement controls remains controversial. Significant settler or juvenile-to-recruit linkages have been reported more often than spawner-to-recruit relationships, most likely because pre-settlement processes often mask the latter. Innovative field experiments, early life stage monitoring and spatial modeling have improved our understanding of the influence of competition, predation, cannibalism, sociality and movements to the demography of some of these species. Field experiments have been more widely used by American and Australian than European investigators. Ecological experiments are not a panacea, though, and can lead to misinterpretation. especially of the relative importance of mortality and emigration. Uncertainties about age and the relevant spatial scale at which to evaluate stock-recruitment relationships have posed further challenges. This review underscores the need to design ecological studies at a geographic scale that will better reveal the stock-recruitment relationship. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The addition of nitrogen via deposition alters the carbon balance of temperate forest ecosystems by affecting both production and decomposition rates. The effects of 20 years of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus and potassium (PK) additions were studied in a 40-year-old pine stand in northern Sweden. Carbon fluxes of the forest floor were reconstructed using a combination of data on soil C-14, tree growth, and litter decomposition. N-only additions caused an increase in needle litterfall, whereas both N and PK additions reduced long-term decomposition rates. Soil respiration measurements showed a 40% reduction in soil respiration for treated compared to control plots. The average age of forest floor carbon was 17 years. Predictions of future soil carbon storage indicate an increase of around 100% in the next 100 years for the N plots and 200% for the NPK plots. As much as 70% of the increase in soil carbon was attributed to the decreased decomposition rate, whereas only 20% was attributable to increased litter production. A reduction in decomposition was observed at a rate of N addition of 30 kg C ha(-1) y(-1), which is not an uncommon rate of N deposition in central Europe. A model based on the continuous-quality decomposition theory was applied to interpret decomposer and substrate parameters. The most likely explanations for the decreased decomposition rate were a fertilizer-induced increase in decomposer efficiency (production-to-assimilation ratio), a more rapid rate of decrease in litter quality, and a decrease in decomposer basic growth rate.

AB We tested the view that few generalizations are possible about the structure of subtidal algae assemblages and that the situation worsens or does not change as more sites are examined. We quantified the percentage cover of 4 morphological groups of benthic algae (encrusting and articulated coralline algae, and foliose and turfing algae) under canopies of kelp Ecklonia radiata and in areas without kelp (macroalgae >4 cm high). This was repeated over 4 spatial scales ranging from quadrats (separated by 10s of m), sites (separated by km), locations (separated by 100s of km) to regions (separated by 1000s of km) across the southern coastline of Australia: Western Australia (WA), Southern Australia (SA) and Eastern Australia (EA). The key result was that while comparison among sites revealed substantial and often inconsistent variation in abundance of benthic algae between habitats (kelp vs open), clear patterns emerged when locations and regions were compared. In EA, where grazers are effective in maintaining extensive areas of encrusting corallines, patterns of algal cover between habitats (kelp vs open) were generally reversed to WA and SA, where grazers are substantially less effective. These results indicate a large distinction in the ecology of these regions (WA = SA not equal EA) and how lack of understanding of this pattern at the regional scale tends to suggest overwhelming variation when single studies are compared among regions. These differences also highlight that comparisons of studies done at small scales, even if done at several sites in a locality, provide a difficult basis to understand the generality of pattern in algal assemblage structure due to large variation at this scale. While we acknowledge that these broad patterns were not possible to validate at the scale of sites, it was possible to increase the scale of observation to encompass broader patterns that might be organized around a relatively simple set of ecological predictions.

ID TURNOVER; CARBON; DELTA-C-13; GROWTH; DIET
AB Time lags associated with changes in stable isotope ratios are essential information for quantitatively analyzing shifts of food habits and habitats. To investigate time lags associated with fish growth in a natural setting, we monitored the change in delta N-15 in the muscle tissue of a fluvial-lacustrine amphidromous goby, Rhinogobius sp. (the orange form), in the Lake Biwa water system. Because delta N-15 is distinct between lacustrine and fluvial ecosystems, the delta N-15 of age-0+ fish drastically decreased after their upstream migration from the lake. About 80% of the change in delta N-15 was attributed to growth. Nitrogen was replaced at the rate of 5-20%.month(-1) by metabolic turnover. The half-change period for delta N-15 was estimated as being longer than 1 month with the contribution of growth and metabolic turnover in the field. These results from the field show that growth is primarily responsible for isotopic changes in fish muscle and highlight the need to examine the role of metabolic turnover using slow-growing fish.

AB The functional response is a key element in all predator-prey interactions. Although functional responses are traditionally modelled as being a function of prey density only, evidence is accumulating that predator density also has an important effect. However, much of the evidence comes from artificial experimental arenas under conditions not necessarily representative of the natural system, and neglecting the temporal dynamics of the organism (in particular the effects of prey depletion on the estimated functional response). Here we present a method that removes these limitations' by reconstructing the functional response non-parametrically from predator-prey time-series data. This method is applied to data on a protozoan predator-prey interaction, and we obtain significant evidence of predator dependence in the functional response. A crucial element in this analysis is to include time-lags in the prey and predator reproduction rates, and we show that these delays improve the fit of the model significantly. Finally, we compare the non-parametrically reconstructed functional response to parametric forms, and suggest that a modified version of the Hassell-Varley predator interference model provides a simple and flexible function for theoretical investigation and applied modelling.

AB Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural soils influence soil quality and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Land use, management practices, soil characteristics, and climate influence such changes. Using the Century model we estimated the rate of SOC change in agricultural soils of Canada for the period 1970 to 2010. This estimation was based on the estimated SOC change for 15% of the 1250 agriculturally designated soil landscape of Canada (SLC) polygons. Simulations were carried out for two to five crop rotations and for conventional and no-tillage. The results indicate that the agricultural soils in Canada, whose SOC are currently very close to equilibrium, will stop being a net source of CO2 and will become a sink by the year 2000. Rates of carbon change for the years 1970, 1990, and 2010 were estimated to be -67, -39, and 11 kgC ha(-1) The rate of decline in the carbon content of agricultural soils in Canada has slowed considerably in the 1990s as a result of an increase in the adoption of no-tillage management, a reduction in the use of summer fallowing, and an increase in fertilizer application. We estimate that the proportion of agricultural land storing SOC will have increased from 17% in 1990 to 53% by the year 2000.

AB Many Salmo trutta populations consist of non-anadromous (freshwater-resident) brown trout and anadromous (sea-run migratory) sea trout. Although adult brown trout and sea trout can usually be identified using differences in size and body colouration, it is not possible to easily identify eggs/alevins as the progeny of brown trout or sea trout. In this study we show that delta(13)C and delta(15)N, measured using a continuous how isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS), can accurately identify fish eggs as the progeny of freshwater-resident (delta(13)C(egg) = -25.7 +/- 1.9 parts per thousand, delta(15)N(egg) = 9.2 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand) or migratory (delta(13)C(egg) = -19.9 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand, delta(15)N(egg)= 14.3 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand) adult female Salmo trutta, Case studies show that stable isotope analysis is a more reliable technique for distinguishing anadromous adult fish than differentiation using morphological characteristics. For example, stable isotope analysis of brown trout from Loch Eck, Scotland, revealed that some individuals possessed delta(13)C and delta(15)N signatures indicative of marine feeding despite visual identification as freshwater-resident fish, It is most likely that these fish are misidentified sea trout although it possible that these fish mag be brown trout that have adopted an estuarine feeding strategy to avoid interspecific competition for food within Loch Eck with salmon, powan and Arctic charr. Most stable isotope studies of fish ecology use terminal tissue sampling to provide sufficient biological material for isotopic analysis; however, our study suggests that adipose fin tissue could provide a comparable measure of delta(13)C and delta(15)N. Such a strategy would be invaluable when studying the trophic ecology or migration patterns of fish of high conservation value. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley &; Sons, Ltd.

AB 1 The morphological plasticity of sun and shade branches of Pinus sylvestris growing at the edge of a 'tree-patch' created in 1989, when surrounding trees were removed, was compared with that of branches of trees growing in the centre of the patch.
   2 In 1992, we selected 10-year-old branches. Yearly growth increments (long-shoots) and emerging buds were individually marked, architectural parameters measured, the branch topology mapped, and the number of male and female cones counted. In 1993, the survival of growth increments and buds was recorded and the branches were harvested to determine dry mass of growth increments and needles.
   3 The size of growth increments produced after 1989, i.e. their length, total dry mass and needle dry mass, decreased in the order sun branches of edge trees > branches of centre trees > shade branches of edge trees. Thus, the growth increments produced on the shade branches of trees that also had branches in the sun were consistently smaller than the growth increments on the branches of centre trees growing completely in the shade.
   4 The number of new growth increments produced after 1989 was highest in sun branches and lowest in shade branches of edge trees. Survival of growth increments and buds was higher in edge than in centre trees; no difference was found between sun and shade branches of edge trees.
   5 In shade branches of edge trees, branching angles between first- and second-order growth increments were highest and increased from older to younger growth increments. This was interpreted as 'bending' towards the edge of the patch.
   6 Production of female cones was almost totally restricted to edge trees and higher in sun than in shade branches.
   7 One prediction of an optimal foraging strategy, i.e. the production of more growth increments and buds in higher light, was supported by the data, whereas the other prediction, i.e. decreased length of growth increments, could only be supported when it was expressed per unit dry mass. Thus, the hypothesis of an adaptive foraging strategy in plants was rejected in favour of a 'passive' growth null hypothesis.
   8 The results suggest that both growth increments within branches and branches within trees are physiologically integrated and their 'foraging behaviour' can only partly be understood in terms of their local environment. We interpreted the observed differences between shade branches of edge and centre trees as correlative growth inhibition.

AB Coral-reef systems are conspicuously multi-scalar, with scales set by reef-fish biology, by ecological processes that act upon them and by the architectural patchiness of the coral-reef environment in which they reside. Empirical ecological studies cannot be executed in a way that is independent of spatial scale, and results are inextricably scale-dependent. Further, although the question asked and the measurements planned will suggest appropriate scales, it is often the case in these multi-scalar systems that there is no single correct scale at which to sample. Instead, there must be a process of compromise in designing projects, an awareness of scale in implementing them and careful consideration of the scale-dependence of the results. Some useful principles are presented to help with the process of project design and interpretation.

AB The hydrological balance and nutrient inputs in water were measured in a lower montane rain forest (1200 m) in Panama. Rainfall and throughfall were measured daily between July 1988 and July 1989 using a standard rain gauge and 50 longitudinal PVC collectors, respectively. Stemflow was measured daily between November 1990 and December 1991 in nine trees varying from 16 to 54 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), using tygon collars. Rainfall and throughfall water samples were collected every 15 days between January and October 1989 for chemical analyses (pH, conductivity, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, PO43-, SO42-, Ca2+, Cl-, Mg2+, K+, Mn, Fe and Si). Bulk precipitation was 3510 mm. Interception was 37.2%, net precipitation was 62.8%, of which, throughfall was 62.4% and stemflow was 0.4%. The probability distribution of throughfall as a proportion of bulk precipitation, showed that 82% of the total variability is lower than a bulk precipitation value of 1.0 and that there are higher values in this mountain forest than in a lowland rain forest in Brazil were this value was also calculated, suggesting that the canopy of this montane forest is more heterogeneous, In only 6 of 140 of the rain events, was net precipitation higher than bulk precipitation, suggesting that direct inputs of cloud water by fog interception, is not an important water source for this forest. Interception at Fortuna is the highest value yet reported for a tropical montane rain forest; it maybe attributed to a very tall canopy (20-30 m) and abundant epiphyte load. Nutrient inputs in water varied from 0.70 kg ha(-1) per year of PO4-P to 34.5 kg ha(-1) per year of Cl. Leaching varied from 1.45 kg ha(-1) per year for PO4-P to 49.71 kg ha(-1) per year of K. Net absorption by the canopy was measured for S (-7.0 kg ha(-1) per year SO4-S) while for N the total annual input was about the same as the annual throughfall. Annual fluxes of calcium, sodium and potassium in bulk precipitation in the Fortuna forest were in the upper range of values reported for other tropical montane sites, perhaps owing to the proximity to the Caribbean Sea, Nutrient inputs of N, P and K in throughfall are consistent with inputs of throughfall relative to other nutrient pathways in tropical and temperate forests.

AB Forest plantations in the world total approximately 130 x 10(6) ha, and annual rates of establishment are about 10.5 x 10(6) ha. A total of 124 countries throughout the high, middle, and low latitudes of the world establish new plantations each year. In addition to supplying an array of goods and services, plantations contribute to carbon (C) storage. This analysis integrates information across latitudes to evaluate the potential of forest plantations to achieve these goals. For example, mean carbon storage (MCS) in above- and below-ground phytomass of artificially established plantations generally increases from high to low latitudes ranging from 47 to 81 t C ha(-1). Over a 50-year period, harvests from these plantations are credited with storing C at 10, 34, 15, and 37 t C ha(-1) in wood products in the high, middle, low-dry, and low-moist latitudes, respectively. Using today's distribution of plantations among the four zones of latitude and C storage values from this analysis, the world's plantations can be credited with storing an area-weighted average of 91 t C ha(-1) including MCS and durable-wood products. Based upon these estimates, the world total C storage in forest plantations today is approximately 11.8 Pg C with an annual increase of 0.178 Pg C year(-1).

AB We used quantitative genetic analyses to test the hypothesis of a trade-off between locomotor speed and endurance in a population of the European lizard Lacerta vivipara, which is the subject of long-term demographic studies. We estimated the heritability of maximal sprint speed treadmill endurance and tail length, a morphometric trait that may affect locomotor performance, as well as phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations between these traits. Gravid females were captured in the field and held in the laboratory under standardized conditions until giving birth; traits were then measured on their offspring. Prior to ge genetic analyses, we used multiple regressions to remove the effects of such covariates as body size (mass and snout-vent length), dam age, and length of time dams were held in captivity prior to parturition. When we examined the residual characters, heritability was low and statistically nonsignificant for speed but relatively high for both endurance (0.46) and tail length (0.51). None of the phenotypic, genetic, or environmental correlations between traits was statistically significant Thus, we found no evidence for a trade-off between speed and endurance; these results are consistent with those reported in two previous studies of squamate reptiles (the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis and the fence lizard Sceloporus occidentalis). The lack of a negative genetic correlation between speed and endurance suggests that these aspects of locomotor abilities are relatively free to evolve independently, such that natural selection could increase both speed and endurance. However, the species studied to date have low to moderate capacities for speed and endurance, as compared with other squamates. Physiologically based trade-offs-for example, those caused by the composition of muscle fiber types-should be more likely to exist in species that heave high capacities for speed and/or endurance.

AB The relationship between physical factors (principally temperature) and biological factors (herbivory) in structuring mid and low shore communities were investigated on a moderately-exposed tropical rocky shore. Physical stress, as measured by rock surface temperature and evaporation of distilled water, was greatest higher on the shore as a result of increased exposure time. Exclusion of herbivores (by caging) and alteration of physical factors (by shading) caused little visible change in community structure in the mid shore. There was also no difference in community structure between open rock areas and control treatments for experimental manipulations at either shore level. Chlorophyll levels increased in rock chips from treatments at both shore levels that excluded herbivores, but still allowed access to sunlight, indicating a developing biofilm. In the low shore, however, treatments that provided refuge from herbivores and direct sunlight were colonized by barnacles (Balanus amphitrite) and an encrusting alga, Hildenbrandia. There appeared to be an interaction between these factors in structuring the community; removal of herbivores allowed the settlement of barnacles which was greatest in shaded treatments. On Hong Kong shores during the summer months biological interactions are important low on the shore in combination with physical factors. In the mid shore, however, physical factors appear the major structuring agent. Community structure on Hong Kong shores is dictated by seasonal variation in physical factors which mediate the effect of biological factors' such as herbivory.

AB Ecology has joined a world of big data. Two complementary frameworks define big data: data that exceed the analytical capacities of individuals or disciplines or the "Four Vs" axes of volume, variety, veracity, and velocity. Variety predominates in ecoinformatics and limits the scalability of ecological science. Volume varies widely. Ecological velocity is low but growing as data throughput and societal needs increase. Ecological big-data systems include in situ and remote sensors, community data resources, biodiversity databases, citizen science, and permanent stations. Technological solutions include the development of open code-and data-sharing platforms, flexible statistical models that can handle heterogeneous data and sources of uncertainty, and cloud-computing delivery of high-velocity computing to large-volume analytics. Cultural solutions include training targeted to early and current scientific workforce and strengthening collaborations among ecologists and data scientists. The broader goal is to maximize the power, scalability, and timeliness of ecological insights and forecasting.

AB The aim of this letter is to raise some critical concerns and gaps in the booming literature on Smart Cities; concerns that we think deserve greater attention from scientists, policy makers and urban planners. Using an urban ecology lens, we provide some reflections that need to forgo any wider-scale implementation of the Smart City-model with the goal to enhance urban sustainability. We discuss that the Smart City literature must better include analysis around social sustainability issues for city dwellers. Focus here should start on health issues and more critical analysis about whom the Smart City is for. Also, the literature must address issues of resilience and cyber security, including how Smart City solutions may affect the autonomy of urban governance, personal integrity and how it may affect the resilience of infrastructures that provide inhabitants with basic needs, such as food, energy and water security. A third major gap in this literature is how smart city developments may change human-nature relations. Focus here should start on how Smart City technologies may hinder or support children's learning towards a stronger psychological connection with nature. Discussions are also needed on how the Smart City model may affect pro-environmental behavior more broadly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many decision-makers are looking to science to clarify how nature supports human well-being. Scientists' responses have typically focused on empirical models of the provision of ecosystem services (ES) and resulting decision-support tools. Although such tools have captured some of the complexities of ES, they can be difficult to adapt to new situations. Globally useful tools that predict the provision of multiple ES under different decision scenarios have proven challenging to develop. Questions from decision-makers and limitations of existing decision-support tools indicate three crucial research frontiers for incorporating cutting-edge ES science into decision-support tools: (1) understanding the complex dynamics of ES in space and time, (2) linking ES provision to human well-being, and (3) determining the potential for technology to substitute for or enhance ES. We explore these frontiers in-depth, explaining why each is important and how existing knowledge at their cutting edges can be incorporated to improve ES decision-making tools.

AB Subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests (EBLFs) inhabit large areas of East Asia. Although paleovegetation reconstructions have revealed that the subtropical EBLFs existed in Southwest China during the Miocene, the historical construction of these forests remains poorly known. Here, we used the tea family (Theaceae), a characteristic component of the subtropical EBLFs, to gain new insights into the assembly of this important biome.
   Using a robust phylogenetic framework of Theaceae based on plastome and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence data, the temporal history of the family was reconstructed. Data from other characteristic components of subtropical EBLFs, including Fagaceae, Lauraceae and Magnoliaceae, were also integrated.
   Most of the essential elements of the subtropical EBLFs appear to have originated around the Oligocene-Miocene (O-M) boundary. However, small woody lineages (e.g. Camellia, Hartia) from Theaceae were dated to the late Miocene. Accelerated net diversification rates within Theaceae were also detected near the O-M transition period and the late Miocene.
   Our results suggest that two independent intensifications of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) around the O-M boundary and the late Miocene may have facilitated the historical assembly of the subtropical EBLFs in East Asia.

AB The main elemental constituents (H, C, N, O, and S) of bio-organic material have different stable isotopes (H-2, H-1; C-13,C-12; N-15,N-14; O-18,O-17,O-16; S-36, S-34, S-33, and S-32). Isotopic ratios can be measured precisely and accurately using dedicated analytical techniques such as isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Analysis of these ratios shows potential for assessing the authenticity of food of animal origin. In this review, IRMS analysis of food of animal origin and variability factors related to stable isotope ratios in animals are described. The study also lists examples of application of stable isotope ratio analysis to meat, dairy products, fish, and shellfish and emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of the technique. Geographical, climatic, pedological, geological, botanical, and agricultural factors affect the stable isotope ratios (SIR) of bio-elements, and SIR variations are ultimately incorporated into animal tissue through eating, drinking, breathing, and exchange with the environment, being recorded in the resulting foods. SIR analysis was capable of determining geographical origin, animal diet, and the production system (such as organic/conventional or wild/farmed) for pork, beef, lamb, poultry, milk, butter, cheese, fish, and shellfish. In the case of the hard PDO (protected designations of origin) cheeses Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano it is also used in real-life situations to assess the authenticity of grated and shredded cheese on the market.

AB Cropland soil organic carbon (SOC) is undergoing substantial alterations due to both environmental and anthropogenic changes. Although numerous case studies have been conducted, there remains a lack of quantification of the consequences of such environmental and anthropogenic changes on the SOC sequestration across global agricultural systems. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of SOC changes under different fertilizer managements, namely unbalanced application of chemical fertilizers (UCF), balanced application of chemical fertilizers (CF), chemical fertilizers with straw application (CFS), and chemical fertilizers with manure application (CFM). We show that topsoil organic carbon (C) increased by 0.9 (0.7-1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI)) g kg(-1) (10.0%, relative change, hereafter the same), 1.7 (1.2-2.3) g kg(-1) (15.4%), 2.0 (1.9-2.2) g kg(-1) (19.5%) and 3.5 (3.2-3.8) g kg(-1) (36.2%) under UCF, CF, CFS and CFM, respectively. The C sequestration durations were estimated as 28-73 years under CFS and 26-117 years under CFM but with high variability across climatic regions. At least 2.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) C input is needed to maintain the SOC in similar to 85% cases. We highlight a great C sequestration potential of applying CF, and adopting CFS and CFM is highly important for either improving or maintaining current SOC stocks across all agro-ecosystems.

AB Phytoplankton are key components of aquatic ecosystems, fixing CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and supporting secondary production, yet relatively little is known about how future global warming might alter their biodiversity and associated ecosystem functioning. Here, we explore how the structure, function, and biodiversity of a planktonic metacommunity was altered after five years of experimental warming. Our outdoor mesocosm experiment was open to natural dispersal from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Warming of 4 degrees C led to a 67% increase in the species richness of the phytoplankton, more evenly-distributed abundance, and higher rates of gross primary productivity. Warming elevated productivity indirectly, by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the local phytoplankton communities. Warming also systematically shifted the taxonomic and functional trait composition of the phytoplankton, favoring large, colonial, inedible phytoplankton taxa, suggesting stronger top-down control, mediated by zooplankton grazing played an important role. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can modulate species coexistence, and through such mechanisms, global warming could, in some cases, increase the species richness and productivity of phytoplankton communities.

AB Interacting with nature is widely recognised as providing many health and well-being benefits. As people live increasingly urbanised lifestyles, the provision of food for garden birds may create a vital link for connecting people to nature and enabling them to access these benefits. However, it is not clear which factors determine the pleasure that people receive from watching birds at their feeders. These may be dependent on the species that are present, the abundance of individuals and the species richness of birds around the feeders. We quantitatively surveyed urban households from towns in southern England to determine the factors that influence the likeability of 14 common garden bird species, and to assess whether people prefer to see a greater abundance of individuals or increased species richness at their feeders. There was substantial variation in likeability across species, with songbirds being preferred over non-songbirds. Species likeability increased for people who fed birds regularly and who could name the species. We found a strong correlation between the number of species that a person could correctly identify and how connected to nature they felt when they watched garden birds. Species richness was preferred over a greater number of individuals of the same species. Although we do not show causation this study suggests that it is possible to increase the well-being benefits that people gain from watching birds at their feeders. This could be done first through a human to bird approach by encouraging regular interactions between people and their garden birds, such as through learning the species names and providing food. Second, it could be achieved through a bird to human approach by increasing garden songbird diversity because the pleasure that a person receives from watching an individual bird at a feeder is dependent not only on its species but also on the diversity of birds at the feeder.

ID STREAM TEMPERATURE
AB Water temperature controls many biochemical and ecological processes in rivers, and theoretically depends on multiple factors. Here we formulate a model to predict daily averaged river water temperature as a function of air temperature and discharge, with the latter variable being more relevant in some specific cases (e.g., snowmelt-fed rivers, rivers impacted by hydropower production). The model uses a hybrid formulation characterized by a physically based structure associated with a stochastic calibration of the parameters. The interpretation of the parameter values allows for better understanding of river thermal dynamics and the identification of the most relevant factors affecting it. The satisfactory agreement of different versions of the model with measurements in three different rivers (root mean square error smaller than 1 degrees C, at a daily timescale) suggests that the proposed model can represent a useful tool to synthetically describe medium- and long-term behavior, and capture the changes induced by varying external conditions.

AB Ecosystem services (ES) approaches to biodiversity conservation are currently high on the ecological research and policy agendas. However, despite a wealth of studies into biodiversity's role inmaintaining ES (B-ES relationships) across landscapes, we still lack generalities in the nature and strengths of these linkages. Reasons for this are manifold, but can largely be attributed to (i) a lack of adherence to definitions and thus a confusion between final ES and the ecosystem functions (EFs) underpinning them, (ii) a focus on uninformative biodiversity indices and singular hypotheses and (iii) top-down analyses across large spatial scales and overlooking of context-dependency. The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) field provides an alternate context for examining biodiversity's mechanistic role in shaping ES, focusing on species' characteristics that may drive EFs via multiple mechanisms across contexts. Despite acknowledgements of a need for B-ES research to look towards underlying B-EF linkages, the connections between these areas of research remains weak. With this review, we pull together recent B-EF findings to identify key areas for future developments in B-ES research. We highlight a means by which B-ES research may begin to identify how and when multiple underlying B-EF relationships may scale to final ES delivery and trade-offs.

AB AimBeta diversity describes the variation in species composition between sites and can be used to infer why different species occupy different parts of the globe. It can be viewed in a number of ways. First, it can be partitioned into two distinct patterns: turnover and nestedness. Second, it can be investigated from either a species identity or a functional-trait point of view. We aim to document for the first time how these two aspects of beta diversity vary in response to a large environmental gradient.
   LocationMaloti-Drakensberg Mountains, southern Africa.
   MethodsWe sampled ant assemblages along an extensive elevational gradient (900-3000m a.s.l.) twice yearly for 7years, and collected functional-trait information related to the species' dietary and habitat-structure preferences. We used recently developed methods to partition species and functional beta diversity into their turnover and nestedness components. A series of null models were used to test whether the observed beta diversity patterns differed from random expectations.
   ResultsSpecies beta diversity was driven by turnover, but functional beta diversity was composed of both turnover and nestedness patterns at different parts of the gradient. Null models revealed that deterministic processes were likely to be responsible for the species patterns but that the functional changes were indistinguishable from stochasticity.
   Main conclusionsDifferent ant species are found with increasing elevation, but they tend to represent an increasingly nested subset of the available functional strategies. This finding is unique and narrows down the list of possible factors that control ant existence across elevation. We conclude that diet and habitat preferences have little role in structuring ant assemblages in montane environments and that some other factor must be driving the non-random patterns of species turnover. This finding also highlights the importance of distinguishing between different kinds of beta diversity.

AB The protection and sustainable management of forest carbon stocks, particularly in the tropics, is a key factor in the mitigation of global change effects. However, our knowledge of how land use and elevation affect carbon stocks in tropical ecosystems is very limited. We compared aboveground biomass of trees, shrubs and herbs for eleven natural and human-influenced habitat types occurring over a wide elevation gradient (866-4550 m) at the world's highest solitary mountain, Mount Kilimanjaro. Thanks to the enormous elevation gradient, we covered important natural habitat types, e.g., savanna woodlands, montane rainforest and afro-alpine vegetation, as well as important land-use types such as maize fields, grasslands, traditional home gardens, coffee plantations and selectively logged forest. To assess tree and shrub biomass with pantropical allometric equations, we measured tree height, diameter at breast height and wood density and to assess herbaceous biomass, we sampled destructively. Among natural habitats, tree biomass was highest at intermediate elevation in the montane zone (340 Mg ha(-1)), shrub biomass declined linearly from 7 Mg ha(-1) at 900 m to zero above 4000 m, and, inverse to tree biomass, herbaceous biomass was lower at mid-elevations (1 Mg ha(-1)) than in savannas (900 m, 3 Mg ha(-1)) or alpine vegetation (above 4000 m, 6 Mg ha(-1)). While the various land-use types dramatically decreased woody biomass at all elevations, though to various degrees, herbaceous biomass was typically increased. Our study highlights tropical montane forest biomass as important aboveground carbon stock and quantifies the extent of the strong aboveground biomass reductions by the major land-use types, common to East Africa. Further, it shows that elevation and land use differently affect different vegetation strata, and thus the matrix for other organisms.

AB The use of Local Environmental Knowledge has been considered as an important strategy for adaptive management in the face of Global Environmental Change. However, the unprecedented rates at which global change occurs may pose a challenge to the adaptive capacity of local knowledge systems. In this paper, we use the concept of the shifting baseline syndrome to examine the limits in the adaptive capacity of the local knowledge of an indigenous society facing rapid ecosystem change. We conducted semi-structured interviews regarding perceptions of change in wildlife populations and in intergenerational transmission of knowledge amongst the Tsimane', a group of hunter-gatherers of Bolivian Amazonia (n = 300 adults in 13 villages). We found that the natural baseline against which the Tsimane' measure ecosystem changes might be shifting with every generation as a result of (a) age-related differences in the perception of change and (b) a decrease in the intergenerational sharing of environmental knowledge. Such findings suggest that local knowledge systems might not change at a rate quick enough to adapt to conditions of rapid ecosystem change, hence potentially compromising the adaptive success of the entire social-ecological system. With the current pace of Global Environmental Change, widening the gap between the temporal rates of on-going ecosystem change and the timescale needed for local knowledge systems to adjust to change, efforts to tackle the shifting baseline syndrome are urgent and critical for those who aim to use Local Environmental Knowledge as a tool for adaptive management.

AB Ecosystems provide life-sustaining services upon which human civilization depends, but their degradation largely continues unabated. Spatially explicit information on ecosystem services (ES) provision is required to better guide decision making, particularly for mountain systems, which are characterized by vertical gradients and isolation with high topographic complexity, making them particularly sensitive to global change. But while spatially explicit ES quantification and valuation allows the identification of areas of abundant or limited supply of and demand for ES, the accuracy and usefulness of the information varies considerably depending on the scale and methods used. Using four case studies from mountainous regions in Europe and the U.S., we quantify information gains and losses when mapping five ES -carbon sequestration, flood regulation, agricultural production, timber harvest, and scenic beauty - at coarse and fine resolution (250 m vs. 25 m in Europe and 300 m vs. 30 m in the U.S.). We analyze the effects of scale on ES estimates and their spatial pattern and show how these effects are related to different ES, terrain structure and model properties. ES estimates differ substantially between the fine and coarse resolution analyses in all case studies and across all services. This scale effect is not equally strong for all ES. We show that spatially explicit information about non-clustered, isolated ES tends to be lost at coarse resolution and against expectation, mainly in less rugged terrain, which calls for finer resolution assessments in such contexts. The effect of terrain ruggedness is also related to model properties such as dependency on land use-land cover data. We close with recommendations for mapping ES to make the resulting maps more comparable, and suggest a four-step approach to address the issue of scale when mapping ES that can deliver information to support ES-based decision making with greater accuracy and reliability.

AB A combinatory approach using metabolomics and gut microbiome analysis techniques was performed to unravel the nature and specificity of metabolic profiles related to gut ecology in obesity. This study focused on gut and liver metabolomics of two different mouse strains, the C57BL/6J (C57J) and the C57BL/6N (C57N) fed with high-fat diet (HFD) for 3 weeks, causing diet-induced obesity in C57N, but not in C57J mice. Furthermore, a 16S-ribosomal RNA comparative sequence analysis using 454 pyrosequencing detected significant differences between the microbiome of the two strains on phylum level for Firmicutes, Deferribacteres and Proteobacteria that propose an essential role of the microbiome in obesity susceptibility. Gut microbial and liver metabolomics were followed by a combinatory approach using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and ultra performance liquid chromatography time of tlight MS/MS with subsequent multivariate statistical analysis, revealing distinctive host and microbial metabolome patterns between the C57J and the C57N strain. Many taurine-conjugated bile acids (TBAs) were significantly elevated in the cecum and decreased in liver samples from the C57J phenotype likely displaying different energy utilization behavior by the bacterial community and the host. Furthermore, several metabolite groups could specifically be associated with the C57N phenotype involving fatty acids, eicosanoids and urobilinoids. The mass differences based metabolite network approach enabled to extend the range of known metabolites to important bile acids (BAs) and novel taurine conjugates specific for both strains. In summary, our study showed clear alterations of the metabolome in the gastrointestinal tract and liver within a HFD-induced obesity mouse model in relation to the host-microbial nutritional adaptation.

TI Pattern formation at multiple spatial scales drives the resilience of
   mussel bed ecosystems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

DT Article
ID SELF-ORGANIZATION; TRADE-OFFS; DYNAMICS; MODEL
AB Self-organized complexity at multiple spatial scales is a distinctive characteristic of biological systems. Yet, little is known about how different self-organizing processes operating at different spatial scales interact to determine ecosystem functioning. Here we show that the interplay between self-organizing processes at individual and ecosystem level is a key determinant of the functioning and resilience of mussel beds. In mussel beds, self-organization generates spatial patterns at two characteristic spatial scales: small-scale net-shaped patterns due to behavioural aggregation of individuals, and large-scale banded patterns due to the interplay of between-mussel facilitation and resource depletion. Model analysis reveals that the interaction between these behavioural and ecosystem-level mechanisms increases mussel bed resilience, enables persistence under deteriorating conditions and makes them less prone to catastrophic collapse. Our analysis highlights that interactions between different forms of self-organization at multiple spatial scales may enhance the intrinsic ability of ecosystems to withstand both natural and human-induced disturbances.

AB Human driven selection during domestication and subsequent breed formation and breeding has left detectable signatures within the genome of livestock breeds. The elucidation of these signatures of selection is of interest from the perspective of evolutionary biology and for identifying selected genes that ultimately may help to further genetically improve these economically important species. Genome-wide screenings based on population techniques provide analytical tools to detect these signatures in relation to the act of selection. This review outlines a nonmathematical treatment of the theories and approaches available to scan the genome for evidence of positive selection and is intended for readers who are little or not familiar with population genetics theory. We discuss the genetics underlying phenotypic variation and adaptation and highlight molecular pattern that positive selection leaves behind along with the statistical approaches that are developed to detect such signatures. We describe some of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different strategies and also the challenges with identifying signatures of selection. Ascertainment bias with widely used SNP arrays is also a topic of interest. Finally we review approaches to assess the statistical significance of a signal at a particular locus or window and discuss factors affecting the statistical power to detect selective sweeps.

AB Alpine dwarf shrub communities are phenologically linked with snowmelt timing, so early spring exposure may increase risk of freezing damage during early development, and consequently reduce seasonal growth. We examined whether environmental factors (duration of snow cover, elevation) influenced size and the vulnerability of shrubs to spring freezing along elevational gradients and snow microhabitats by modelling the past frequency of spring freezing events. We sampled biomass and measured the size of Salix herbacea, Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium uliginosum and Loiseleuria procumbens in late spring. Leaves were exposed to freezing temperatures to determine the temperature at which 50 % of specimens are killed for each species and sampling site. By linking site snowmelt and temperatures to long-term climate measurements, we extrapolated the frequency of spring freezing events at each elevation, snow microhabitat and per species over 37 years. Snowmelt timing was significantly driven by microhabitat effects, but was independent of elevation. Shrub growth was neither enhanced nor reduced by earlier snowmelt, but decreased with elevation. Freezing resistance was strongly species dependent, and did not differ along the elevation or snowmelt gradient. Microclimate extrapolation suggested that potentially lethal freezing events (in May and June) occurred for three of the four species examined. Freezing events never occurred on late snow beds, and increased in frequency with earlier snowmelt and higher elevation. Extrapolated freezing events showed a slight, non-significant increase over the 37-year record. We suggest that earlier snowmelt does not enhance growth in four dominant alpine shrubs, but increases the risk of lethal spring freezing exposure for less freezing-resistant species.

AB Similar to other infectious diseases, the prevalence of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) has been seen to exhibit marked seasonal variation. However, mechanisms driving this variation in wild birds have yet to be tested. We investigated the validity of three previously suggested drivers for the seasonal dynamics in LPAIV infections in wild birds: (i) host density, (ii) immunologically naive young and (iii) increased susceptibility in migrants. To address these questions, we sampled a key LPAIV host species, the mallard Anas platyrhynchos, on a small spatial scale, comprehensively throughout a complete annual cycle, measuring both current and past infection (i.e. viral and seroprevalence, respectively). We demonstrate a minor peak in LPAIV prevalence in summer, a dominant peak in autumn, during which half of the sampled population was infected, and no infections in spring. Seroprevalence of antibodies to a conserved gene segment of avian influenza virus (AIV) peaked in winter and again in spring. The summer peak of LPAIV prevalence coincided with the entrance of unfledged naive young in the population. Moreover, juveniles were more likely to be infected, shed higher quantities of virus and were less likely to have detectable antibodies to AIV than adult birds. The arrival of migratory birds, as identified by stable hydrogen isotope analysis, appeared to drive the autumn peak in LPAIV infection, with both temporal coincidence and higher infection prevalence in migrants. Remarkably, seroprevalence in migrants was substantially lower than viral prevalence throughout autumn migration, further indicating that each wave of migrants amplified local AIV circulation. Finally, while host abundance increased throughout autumn, it peaked in winter, showing no direct correspondence with either of the LPAIV infection peaks. At an epidemiologically relevant spatial scale, we provide strong evidence for the role of migratory birds as key drivers for seasonal epizootics of LPAIV, regardless of their role as vectors of these viruses. This study exemplifies the importance of understanding host demography and migratory behaviour when examining seasonal drivers of infection in wildlife populations.

AB The impacts of plant invasions are of great concern in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycling. However, the consequences of plant invasions for soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on SOC pool and its fractions by comparing with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis soils and bare flat in a coastal wetland of Eastern China for one year. Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasions could enhance SOC sequestration possibly due to large amounts of litter biomass input but lower proportion of soil labile organic carbon pool fractions and mineralizable carbon in per unit SOC. Plant invasions could change the quantity and quality of the SOC pool and thus, have potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and global C cycling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying the spatiotemporal pattern of urbanization is necessary to understand urban morphology and its impacts on biodiversity and ecological processes, and thus can provide essential information for improving landscape and urban planning. Recent studies have suggested that, as cities evolve, certain general patterns emerge along the urban-rural gradient although individual cities always differ in details. To help better understand these generalities and idiosyncrasies in urbanization patterns, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Shanghai metropolitan area from 1989 to 2005, based on landscape metrics and remote sensing data. Specifically, the main objectives of our study were to quantitatively characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in Shanghai in recent decades, identify possible spatial signatures of different land use types, and test the diffusion coalescence hypotheses of urban growth. We found that, similar to numerous cities around the world reported in previous studies, urbanization increased the diversity, fragmentation, and configurational complexity of the urban landscape of Shanghai. In the same time, however, the urban-rural patterns of several land use types in Shanghai seem unique-quite different from previously reported patterns. For most land use types, each showed a distinctive spatial pattern along a rural-urban transect, as indicated by landscape metrics. Furthermore, the urban expansion of Shanghai exhibited an outward wave-like pattern. Our results suggest that the urbanization of Shanghai followed a complex diffusion-coalescence pattern along the rural-urban transect and in time.

AB Dispersal is a key process in metacommunity dynamics, allowing the maintenance of diversity in complex community networks. Geographic distance is usually used as a surrogate for connectivity implying that communities that are closely located are considered more prone to exchange individuals than distant communities. However, in some natural systems, organisms may be subjected to directional dispersal (air or water flows, particular landscape configuration), possibly leading close communities to be isolated from each other and distant communities to be connected. Using geographic distance as a proxy for realised connectivity may then yield misleading results regarding the role of dispersal in structuring communities in such systems. Here, we quantified the relative importance of flow connectivity, geographic distance, and environmental gradients to explain polychaete metacommunity structure along the coasts of the Gulf of Lions (northwest Mediterranean Sea). Flow connectivity was estimated by Lagrangian particle dispersal simulations. Our results revealed that this metacommunity is strongly structured by the environment at large spatial scales, and that both flow connectivity and geographic distance play an important role within homogeneous environments at smaller spatial scales. We thus strongly advocate for a wider use of connectivity measures, in addition to geographic distance, to study spatial patterns of biological diversity (e.g. distance decay) and to infer the processes behind these patterns at different spatial scales. Synthesis Everything is connected, but connections are seldom accurately quantified. Biological communities are often studied separately, using observations, experiments and models to unravel local dynamics of organisms interacting with each other. However, regional processes such as dispersal through ocean and air circulation, likely to connect distant communities and influence their local dynamics, are not always accounted for, or, at best, used as an homogeneous and distance-related factor. Ocean models have being extensively developed and validated during the past decades with the increasing availability of accurate meteorological data. Using such model outputs, precise quantifi cation of exchange rates of organisms between communities was performed in a marine Mediterranean coastal area. Jointly with local environmental and biological data, these results were used to quantify the effects of realistic connectivity on local and regional polychaete community structure, and revealed that the environmental gradient, geographic distance, and connectivity were responsible for community structure at different spatial scales.

AB Background: Snake venom is shaped by the ecology and evolution of venomous species, and signals of positive selection in toxins have been consistently documented, reflecting the role of venoms as an ecologically critical phenotype. New World coral snakes (Elapidae) are represented by three genera and over 120 species and subspecies that are capable of causing significant human morbidity and mortality, yet coral-snake venom composition is poorly understood in comparison to that of Old World elapids. High-throughput sequencing is capable of identifying thousands of loci, while providing characterizations of expression patterns and the molecular evolutionary forces acting within the venom gland.
   Results: We describe the de novo assembly and analysis of the venom-gland transcriptome of the eastern coral snake (Micrurus fulvius). We identified 1,950 nontoxin transcripts and 116 toxin transcripts. These transcripts accounted for 57.1% of the total reads, with toxins accounting for 45.8% of the total reads. Phospholipases A(2) and three-finger toxins dominated expression, accounting for 86.0% of the toxin reads. A total of 15 toxin families were identified, revealing venom complexity previously unknown from New World coral snakes. Toxins exhibited high levels of heterozygosity relative to nontoxins, and overdominance may favor gene duplication leading to the fixation of advantageous alleles. Phospholipase A(2) expression was uniformly distributed throughout the class while three-finger toxin expression was dominated by a handful of transcripts, and phylogenetic analyses indicate that toxin divergence may have occurred following speciation. Positive selection was detected in three of the four most diverse toxin classes, suggesting that venom diversification is driven by recurrent directional selection.
   Conclusions: We describe the most complete characterization of an elapid venom gland to date. Toxin gene duplication may be driven by heterozygote advantage, as the frequency of polymorphic toxin loci was significantly higher than that of nontoxins. Diversification among toxins appeared to follow speciation reflecting species-specific adaptation, and this divergence may be directly related to dietary shifts and is suggestive of a coevolutionary arms race.

AB Background: The woody biomass residence time ((w)) of an ecosystem is an important variable for accurately simulating its biomass stocks.
   Methods and results: We reviewed published data from 177 forest plots across the tropics and found a six-fold variation (23129 years) in (w) across our dataset, with a median (w) of ca. 50 years. This value is similar to the median default value across 21 vegetation models for tropical forests, although the range of values used in models is large (20 to 200 years).
   Conclusions: The notion of a constant (w) across all tropical forests may be of limited utility, given the large observed variation in (w). We found that while there was little relationship between climate variables and (w), there was evidence that edaphic factors exerted a strong influence on (w). In both the Neotropics and the Paleotropics, (w) was highest in heavily weathered soils, suggesting that low soil fertility and/or non-limiting soil physical conditions exert a critical influence on (w). There is considerable uncertainty in how (w) will be affected by global environmental change, especially by increased atmospheric CO2. Even small changes in (w) could significantly reduce the future tropical forest carbon sink predicted by many vegetation models.

AB Increasing evidence has accumulated within the last decade that individuals of different animal species show consistent behavior both across various contexts and through time, that is, they do have personality. However, little is known in how far the environment an individual is facing may influence the personality of insects, whereas it is well established that the environment can have profound influences on performance parameters. The development of personality may be closely linked to different expectations in future fitness leading to contrasting life-history strategies. We investigated in how far the environmental food conditions experienced during lifetime influence the life-history and shape the personality of the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, a pest of crucifers. Beetles reared on low-quality food developed slower and gained lower body masses than insects reared on high-quality food. By performing behavioral tests analogous to vertebrate assays repeatedly during adult life, we identified 3 personality dimensions, boldness, activity, and nontargeted explorativeness. Comparing food-dependent differences of the personality dimensions with state-dependent differences of the expected future prospects, we found that beetles feeding low-quality food were bolder, thereby potentially increasing their capabilities to succeed in foraging. In contrast, animals feeding high-quality food were more active. Changes in boldness may be highly adaptive to increase future reproductive output, whereas activity is likely constrained by the energy uptake. Our results demonstrate that the environment does not only affect life-history traits but has also a consistent impact on an individual's behavior, which is likely highly adaptive.

AB Invasions of Ponto-Caspian gobiid fishes are suspected to cause regime shifts in freshwater ecosystems. This study compared the trophic niche differentiations of Neogobius melanostomus and Ponticola kessleri in the upper Danube River using stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15), gut content analyses and morphometric analyses of the digestive tract. Both species were identified as predacious omnivores with high dietary overlap and a generalistic feeding strategy. Amphipods (especially invasive Dikerogammarus spp.) contributed 2/3 to the index of food importance. delta N-15-signatures of N. melanostomus revealed an ontogenetic diet shift and significantly exceeded those in P. kessleri by similar to 1.5aEuro degrees, indicating a niche separation of half a trophic level. P. kessleri had shorter uncoiled intestinal tracts than N. melanostomus, indicating a narrower niche and adaptation to animal food. Trophic niches in both species expanded during the growth period with increasing intraguild predation and cannibalism in P. kessleri and increasing molluscivory in N. melanostomus. P. kessleri showed a higher degree of specialization and more stable feeding patterns across seasons, whereas N. melanostomus adapted its diet according to the natural prey availability. The feeding patterns of both species observed in the upper Danube River strongly differ from those in their native ranges, underlining their great plasticity. Both goby species consumed mainly other non-native species (similar to 92% of gut contents) and seemed to benefit from previous invasions of prey species like Dikerogammarus villosus. The invasive success of gobies and their prey mirror fundamental ecological changes in large European freshwater ecosystems.

AB The future spread and impact of an introduced species will depend on how it adapts to the abiotic and biotic conditions encountered in its new range, so the potential for rapid evolution subsequent to species introduction is a critical, evolutionary dimension of invasion biology. Using a resurrection approach, we provide a direct test for change over time within populations in a species' introduced range, in the Asian shade annual Polygonum cespitosum. We document, over an 11-year period, the evolution of increased reproductive output as well as greater physiological and root-allocational plasticity in response to the more open, sunny conditions found in the North American range in which the species has become invasive. These findings show that extremely rapid adaptive modifications to ecologically-important traits and plastic expression patterns can evolve subsequent to a species' introduction, within populations established in its introduced range. This study is one of the first to directly document evolutionary change in adaptive plasticity. Such rapid evolutionary changes can facilitate the spread of introduced species into novel habitats and hence contribute to their invasive success in a new range. The data also reveal how evolutionary trajectories can differ among populations in ways that can influence invasion dynamics.

AB Assisted colonisation has received considerable attention recently, and the risks and benefits of introducing taxa to sites beyond their historical range have been vigorously debated. The debate has primarily focused on using assisted colonization to enhance the persistence of taxa that would otherwise be stranded in unsuitable habitat as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change and habitat fragmentation. However, a complementary motivation for assisted colonisation could be to relocate taxa to restore declining ecosystem processes that support biodiversity in recipient sites. We compare the benefits and risks of species introductions motivated by either goal, which we respectively term 'push' versus 'pull' strategies for introductions to preserve single species or for restoration of ecological processes. We highlight that, by focusing on push and neglecting pull options, ecologists have greatly under-estimated potential benefits and risks that may result from assisted colonisation. Assisted colonisation may receive higher priority in climate change adaptation strategies if relocated taxa perform valuable ecological functions (pull) rather than have little collateral benefit (push). Potential roles include enhancing resistance to invasion by undesired species, supporting co-dependent species, performing keystone functions, providing temporally critical resources, replacing taxa of low ecological redundancy, and avoiding time lags in the provisioning of desired functions.

AB This is a regional study of the landscape, stream, and channel factors that control summer stream temperatures in the Pacific Northwest. The study focusses on two characteristics of stream temperature: the thermal regime, defined as the pattern of seasonal and spatial stream temperature variation in a stream, and the thermal sensitivity, considered here to be the slope of the stream-air temperature relationship. The baseflow index, or degree of groundwater influence in a stream, is hypothesized to be an important regional control of both thermal regime and thermal sensitivity. Weekly stream temperatures were calculated and evaluated at 104 primarily unregulated sites that were geographically distributed across the region. Air temperature and streamflow explained an average of 94% of the variance in annual thermal regimes and 68% of the variance in August thermal regimes at individual sites. Regression results showed that thermal sensitivity to increasing air temperatures was less in summer than at other times of the year. Future climate projections of summer stream temperature, based on thermal sensitivities, are small in comparison to the range of summer stream temperatures that exist across the region. This observation highlights the need to understand summer thermal regimes as well as summer thermal sensitivities when assessing climate change impacts to regional stream temperatures. Multiple regression analysis identified several landscape factors and stream characteristics that explained summer stream temperatures and thermal sensitivities regionally. Two of the most important factors were baseflow index and stream channel slope. Lastly, the summer stream/air temperature ratio of a stream may be useful in assessing existing or expected stream temperature conditions at a site in relation to these factors or in identifying unique environmental conditions or potential restoration needs at a site.

AB Territorial user rights for fisheries have been advocated as a way to achieve sustainable resource management. However, few researchers have empirically assessed their potential as ancillary marine conservation instruments by comparing them to no-take marine protected areas. In kelp (Lessonia trabeculata) forests of central Chile, we compared species richness, density, and biomass of macroinvertebrates and reef fishes among territorial-user-right areas with low-level and high-level enforcement, no-take marine protected areas, and open-access areas in 42 100-m subtidal transects. We also assessed structural complexity of the kelp forest and substratum composition. Multivariate randomized permutation tests indicated macroinvertebrate and reef fish communities associated with the different access regimes differed significantly. Substratum composition and structural complexity of kelp forest did not differ among access regimes. Univariate analyses showed species richness, biomass, and density of macroinvertebrates and reef fishes were greater in highly enforced territorial-user-right areas and no-take marine protected areas than in open-access areas. Densities of macroinvertebrates and reef fishes of economic importance were not significantly different between highly enforced territorial-user-right and no-take marine protected areas. Densities of economically important macroinvertebrates in areas with low-level enforcement were significantly lower than those in areas with high-level enforcement and no-take marine protected areas but were significantly higher than in areas with open access. Territorial-user-right areas could be important ancillary conservation instruments if they are well enforced.

AB The ongoing biodiversity crisis is pushing ecologists and conservation biologists to develop models to foretell the effects of human-induced transformation of natural resources on the distribution of species, although ecology and biogeography still lacks a paradigmatic body of theory to fully understand the drivers of biodiversity patterns. Two decades of research on ecological niche models and species distributions have been characterized by technical development and discussions on a plethora of methods or algorithms to infer and predict species distributions. Here we suggest a metaphorical classification scheme for some of the most popular models based on their complexity, interpretability and suitability for specific applications in ecology and conservation biology. Our purpose is not to compare methods by their capacity to accurately predict the observed distribution of species, nor to criticize how they are commonly used in applied studies. Instead, we believe that a simple classification scheme can potentially highlight how some methods are more suited for specific applications in ecology and conservation biology. Envelope and distance-based models are grouped into the "fish bowl" category, for their transparency and simplicity. Statistical models are classified as "turbine" models, because of their hidden complexity and general applicability. Finally, machine-learning models are classified as "vault" models, for their high complexity and lack of interpretability of fit parameters. We conclude that the diversity of species distribution models used today is expected for a young research field, but the choice of modeling strategy depends on the purpose of the study. We provide some general guidelines for choosing models for studies of conservation planning and climate change mitigation and suggest models of intermediate complexity for conservation planning and forecast of climate change effects on biodiversity as they provide a good balance between interpretability, predictive power and robustness to model over-fit.

AB Aim We test the prediction that beta diversity (species turnover) and the decay of community similarity with distance depend on spatial resolution (grain). We also study whether patterns of beta diversity are related to variability in climate, land cover or geographic distance and how the independent effects of these variables depend on the spatial grain of the data. Location Europe, Great Britain, Finland and Catalonia. Methods We used data on European birds, plants, butterflies, amphibians and reptiles, and data on British plants, Catalonian birds and Finnish butterflies. We fitted two or three nested grids of varying resolutions to each of these datasets. For each grid we calculated differences in climate, differences in land-cover composition (CORINE) and beta diversity (beta sim, beta Jaccard) between all pairs of grid cells. In a separate analysis we looked specifically at pairs of adjacent grid cells (the first distance class). We then used variation partitioning to identify the magnitude of independent statistical associations (i.e. independent effects in the statistical sense) of climate, land cover and geographic distance with spatial patterns of beta diversity. Results Beta diversity between grid cells at any given distance decreased with increasing grain. Geographic distance was always the most important predictor of beta diversity for all pairwise comparisons at the extent of Europe. Climate and land cover had weaker but distinct and grain-dependent effects. Climate was more important at relatively coarse grains, whereas land-cover effects were stronger at finer grains. In the country-wide analyses, climate and land cover were more important than geographic distance. Climatic and land-cover models performed poorly and showed no systematic grain dependence for beta diversity between adjacent grid cells. Main conclusions We found that relationships between geographic distance and beta diversity, as well as the environmental correlates of beta diversity, are systematically grain dependent. The strong independent effect of distance indicates that, contrary to the current belief, a substantial fraction of species are missing from areas with a suitable environment. Moreover, the effects of geographic distance (at continental extents) and land cover (at fine grains) indicate that any species distribution modelling should take both environment and dispersal limitation into account.

AB Patterns in biodiversity and species coexistence are the result of multiple interacting processes including evolutionary history, trait variation, species interactions, dispersal, environmental variation, and landscape heterogeneity. Exploring patterns of biodiversity across space is perhaps the best integrative method (in contrast to the scarcity of temporal data) to interpret the influence of these multiple and interactive effects in determining community assembly, but it is still underdeveloped. Two emerging fields, metacommunity ecology and community phylogenetics, have been making relevant, though rather independent, progress toward understanding how communities are assembled in space. Our main goals were twofold. First, we described a heuristical framework to merge these two fields into "metacommunity phylogenetics.'' The main goal of this framework is to provide a way to think about how niche properties of species arranged across the environment and different spatial scales influence the process of community assembly. Second, we developed an analytical framework to link niche properties based on trait and phylogenetics to environmental and spatial variation. In order to assess the performance of the framework, we used extensive computer simulations of community assembly to show that the procedure is robust under a variety of scenarios.

AB The unsustainable exploitation of nature by humanity has pushed many of the earth's ecological systems to the brink of collapse. To help bring about the societal changes needed to reverse this trend, conservation biologists need to be more proactive, provocative, and purposeful in increasing environmental literacy. In this essay, we highlight different ways that scientists can engage various sectors of society and argue that passion, enthusiasm, and an understanding of the culture of human belief systems can help us to communicate effectively with a wider audience.

AB The sedge family (Cyperaceae: Poales; ca. 5600 spp.) is a hyperdiverse cosmopolitan group with centres of species diversity in Africa, Australia, eastern Asia, North America, and the Neotropics. Carex, with ca. 40% of the species in the family, is one of the most species-rich angiosperm genera and the most diverse in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, making it atypical among plants in that it inverts the latitudinal gradient of species richness. moreover, Carex exhibits high rates of chromosome rearrangement via fission, fusion, and translocation, which distinguishes it from the rest of the Cyperaceae. Here, we use a phylogenetic framework to examine how the onset of contemporary temperate climates and the processes of chromosome evolution have influenced the diversification dynamics of Carex. We provide estimates of diversification rates and map chromosome transitions across the evolutionary history of the main four clades of Carex. We demonstrate that Carex underwent a shift in diversification rates sometime between the Late Eocene and the Oligocene, during a global cooling period, which fits with a transition in diploid chromosome number. We suggest that adaptive radiation to novel temperate climates, aided by a shift in the mode of chromosome evolution, may explain the large-scale radiation of Carex and its latitudinal pattern of species richness.

AB Earth's land cover has been extensively transformed over time due to both human activities and natural causes. Previous global studies have focused on developing spatial and temporal patterns of dominant human land-use activities (e. g., cropland, pastureland, urban land, wood harvest). Process-based modeling studies adopt different strategies to estimate the changes in land cover by using these land-use data sets in combination with a potential vegetation map, and subsequently use this information for impact assessments. However, due to unaccounted changes in land cover (resulting from both indirect anthropogenic and natural causes), heterogeneity in land-use/cover (LUC) conversions among grid cells, even for the same land use activity, and uncertainty associated with potential vegetation mapping and historical estimates of human land use result in land cover estimates that are substantially different compared to results acquired from remote sensing observations. Here, we present a method to implicitly account for the differences arising from these uncertainties in order to provide historical estimates of land cover that are consistent with satellite estimates for recent years. Due to uncertainty in historical agricultural land use, we use three widely accepted global estimates of cropland and pastureland in combination with common wood harvest and urban land data sets to generate three distinct estimates of historical land-cover change and underlying LUC conversions. Hence, these distinct historical reconstructions offer a wide range of plausible regional estimates of uncertainty and the extent to which different ecosystems have undergone changes. The annual land cover maps and LUC conversion maps are reported at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution and describe the area of 28 land-cover types and respective underlying land-use transitions. The reconstructed data sets are relevant for studies addressing the impact of land-cover change on biogeophysics, biogeochemistry, water cycle, and global climate.

AB In this paper spatial dynamics of the Beddington-DeAngelis predator-prey model is investigated. We analyze the linear stability and obtain the condition of Turing instability of this model. Moreover, we deduce the amplitude equations and determine the stability of different patterns. In Turing space, we found that this model has coexistence of H-0 hexagon patterns and stripe patterns, H-pi hexagon patterns, and H-0 hexagon patterns. To better describe the real ecosystem, we consider the ecosystem as an open system and take the environmental noise into account. It is found that noise can decrease the number of the patterns and make the patterns more regular. What is more, noise can induce two kinds of typical pattern transitions. One is from the H-pi hexagon patterns to the regular stripe patterns, and the other is from the coexistence of H-0 hexagon patterns and stripe patterns to the regular stripe patterns. The obtained results enrich the finding in the Beddington-DeAngelis predator-prey model well.

AB Environmental measures that are designed to facilitate changes in opportunities for active school transport (AST) do not often account for individuals' interpretations of the built environment (BE) in different urban contexts. The Built Environment and Active School Transport (BEAT) project was undertaken to explore the ways in which the transport-BE interface gives rise to the use of active or non-active travel modes as the primary travel mode for school trips. We wanted to know how children experienced and understood the transport-built environment relationship. We selected four Toronto elementary school sites in areas that differed with respect to socio-economic status and built environment. We conducted photovoice interviews with 41 children, 21 who walked to/from school, and 20 who were driven. Adopting a thematic analytic approach, this paper examines the similarities and differences in the visual narratives of children's transport geographies and discusses some of the benefits of using photovoice with children in a study of the transport-built environment relationship.

AB Aim This study explores the relationship between orchid species richness along elevational gradients in the central and eastern Himalaya. Specifically, we aimed to test predictions of maximum richness at different elevational levels for orchid species geographically restricted to central and eastern Himalaya (endemics), and total orchid richness, including different life forms. We then compared and assessed climatic factors together with area as causal explanations for the observed patterns.
   Location Nepal (100-5200 m a.s.l.), Bhutan (100-5200 m a.s.l.), and adjacent regions of India, i.e. Sikkim and Darjeeling.
   Methods We used published data on the distribution of orchids to interpolate presence between maximum and minimum recorded elevations in 100-m elevational zones. These patterns were compared with previously published patterns for other plant groups, which were derived in the same way. Descriptive regressions with metres above sea level (m a.s.l.) as the independent variable were performed using nonparametric generalized additive models (GAMs), whereas tests of the diversity models were carried out using parametric generalized linear models (GLMs).
   Results A hump-shaped relationship between orchid species richness and elevation was observed in Nepal and Bhutan, with maximum richness at 1600 m a.s.l. corresponding to c. 16 degrees C mean annual temperature. The richness of orchid species that are endemic to central and eastern Himalaya showed a bimodal pattern. Richness of endemic epiphytes peaked at elevation zones similar to those for total richness, but the peak in numbers of endemic terrestrial species occurred at a higher elevation.
   Main conclusions This study shows that climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) provide a good potential explanation for orchid species richness along the Himalayan elevational gradient, even when the effect of area is considered. The principal elevational peak in richness of central and eastern Himalayan endemics was consistent with the peak in total orchid richness, but maximum terrestrial endemic richness occurred at higher elevations.

AB Knowing the distribution of marine animals is central to understanding climatic and other environmental influences on population ecology. This information has proven difficult to gain through capture-based methods biased by capture location. Here we show that marine location can be inferred from animal tissues. As the carbon isotope composition of animal tissues varies with sea surface temperature, marine location can be identified by matching time series of carbon isotopes measured in tissues to sea surface temperature records. Applying this technique to populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) produces isotopically-derived maps of oceanic feeding grounds, consistent with the current understanding of salmon migrations, that additionally reveal geographic segregation in feeding grounds between individual philopatric populations and age-classes. Carbon isotope ratios can be used to identify the location of open ocean feeding grounds for any pelagic animals for which tissue archives and matching records of sea surface temperature are available.

AB Background: Free-living microorganisms have long been assumed to have ubiquitous distributions with little biogeographic signature because they typically exhibit high dispersal potential and large population sizes. However, molecular data provide contrasting results and it is far from clear to what extent dispersal limitation determines geographic structuring of microbial populations. We aimed to determine biogeographical patterns of the bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. Being widely distributed on a global scale but patchily on a regional scale, this prokaryote is an ideal model organism to study microbial dispersal and biogeography.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The phylogeography of M. aeruginosa was studied based on a dataset of 311 rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences sampled from six continents. Richness of ITS sequences was high (239 ITS types were detected). Genetic divergence among ITS types averaged 4% (maximum pairwise divergence was 13%). Preliminary analyses revealed nearly completely unresolved phylogenetic relationships and a lack of genetic structure among all sequences due to extensive homoplasy at multiple hypervariable sites. After correcting for this, still no clear phylogeographic structure was detected, and no pattern of isolation by distance was found on a global scale. Concomitantly, genetic differentiation among continents was marginal, whereas variation within continents was high and was mostly shared with all other continents. Similarly, no genetic structure across climate zones was detected.
   Conclusions/Significance: The high overall diversity and wide global distribution of common ITS types in combination with the lack of phylogeographic structure suggest that intercontinental dispersal of M. aeruginosa ITS types is not rare, and that this species might have a truly cosmopolitan distribution.

AB P>1. Competition theory predicts that community structure may be shaped by resource partitioning between co-occurring species. As such, quantifying the degree of resource partitioning (i.e., niche overlap) is a key component of studies examining community structure and species coexistence.
   2. For many organisms, multiple resource axes quantify niche space. Each axis may be described by a different type of data (e.g. categorical, continuous, count or binary data, as well as electivity scores), with different data types requiring different statistical treatments. Therefore, incorporating multiple axes into a single measure of niche space is problematic.
   3. Here, we propose general methods for combining multiple niche axes, each characterized by different data types, within a unified analysis of niche overlap. Using appropriate transformations and probability models, we show that each data type can give rise to directly comparable measures of niche overlap, with the overlap statistic between two species defined as the overlapping area between the distributions for each species.
   4. Measurements derived from different types of data can be combined into a single unified analysis of niche overlap by averaging over multiple axes.
   5. We then describe null model permutation tests that assess statistical differences in niche overlap, which can address questions commonly posed by population ecologists (e.g. do two species occupy different niche space?) and community ecologists (e.g. are multiple species evenly distributed across niche space?).
   6. To illustrate the use of these newly devised indices, we use an example from reef fishes that combines ratio, categorical and electivity data, and an example from alpine plants that combines continuous and ratio data.
   7. The methods described in this article are relevant to a wide variety of ecological projects, including the investigation of invasive species, relative abundance distributions, global change, species coexistence and evolutionary diversification.

AB Coupled biological and physical oceanographic models are powerful tools for studying connectivity among marine populations because they simulate the movement of larvae based on ocean currents and larval characteristics. However, while the models themselves have been parameterized and verified with physical empirical data, the simulated patterns of connectivity have rarely been compared to field observations. We demonstrate a framework for testing biological-physical oceanographic models by using them to generate simulated spatial genetic patterns through a simple population genetic model, and then testing these predictions with empirical genetic data. Both agreement and mismatches between predicted and observed genetic patterns can provide insights into mechanisms influencing larval connectivity in the coastal ocean. We use a high-resolution ROMS-CoSINE biological-physical model for Monterey Bay, California specifically modified to simulate dispersal of the acorn barnacle, Balanus glandula. Predicted spatial genetic patterns generated from both seasonal and annual connectivity matrices did not match an observed genetic cline in this species at either a mitochondrial or nuclear gene. However, information from this mismatch generated hypotheses testable with our modelling framework that including natural selection, larval input from a southern direction and/or increased nearshore larval retention might provide a better fit between predicted and observed patterns. Indeed, moderate selection and a range of combined larval retention and southern input values dramatically improve the fit between simulated and observed spatial genetic patterns. Our results suggest that integrating population genetic models with coupled biological-physical oceanographic models can provide new insights and a new means of verifying model predictions.

AB The Earth is experiencing historically unprecedented rates of warming, with surface temperatures projected to increase by 3-5 degrees C globally, and up to 7.5 degrees C in high latitudes, within the next century. Knowledge of how this will affect biological systems is still largely restricted to the lower levels of organization (e.g. species range shifts), rather than at the community, food web or ecosystem level, where responses cannot be predicted from studying single species in isolation. Further, many correlational studies are confounded with time and/or space, whereas experiments have been mostly confined to laboratory microcosms that cannot capture the true complexity of natural ecosystems. We used a 'natural experiment' in an attempt to circumvent these shortcomings, by characterizing community structure and trophic interactions in 15 geothermal Icelandic streams ranging in temperature from 5 degrees C to 45 degrees C. Even modest temperature increases had dramatic effects across multiple levels of organization, from changes in the mean body size of the top predators, to unimodal responses of species populations, turnover in community composition, and lengthening of food chains. Our results reveal that the rates of warming predicted for the next century have serious implications for the structure and functioning of these fragile 'sentinel' ecosystems across multiple levels of organization.

AB Coevolutionary studies on plants and plant-feeding insects have significantly improved our understanding of the role of niche shifts in the generation of new species. Evolving plant lineages essentially constitute moving islands and archipelagoes in resource space, and host shifts by insects are usually preceded by colonizations of novel resources. Critical to hypotheses concerning ecological speciation is what happens immediately before and after colonization attempts: if an available plant is too similar to the current host(s), it simply will be incorporated into the existing diet, but if it is too different, it will not be colonized in the first place. It thus seems that the probability of speciation is maximized when alternative hosts are at an 'intermediate' distance in resource space. In this review, I wish to highlight the possibility that resource similarity and, thus, the definition of 'intermediate', are subjective concepts that depend on the herbivore lineage's tolerance to dietary variation. This subjectivity of similarity means that changes in tolerance can either decrease or increase speciation probabilities depending on the distribution of plants in resource space: insect lineages with narrow tolerances are likely to speciate by 'island-hopping' on young, species-rich plant groups, whereas more generalized lineages could speciate by shifting among resource archipelagoes formed by higher plant taxa. Repeated and convergent origins of traits known to broaden or to restrict host-plant use in multiple different insect groups provide opportunities for studying how tolerance and resource heterogeneity may interact to determine speciation rates.

AB The process of speciation begins with genomically-localised barriers to gene exchange associated with loci for local adaptation, intrinsic incompatibility or assortative mating. The barrier then spreads until reproductive isolation influences the whole genome. The population genomics approach can be used to identify regions of reduced gene flow by detecting loci with greater differentiation than expected from the average across many loci. Recently, this approach has been used in several systems. I review these studies, concentrating on the robustness of the approach and the methods available to go beyond the simple identification of differentiated markers. Population genomics has already contributed significantly to understanding the balance between gene flow and selection during the evolution of reproductive isolation and has great future potential both in genome species and in non-model organisms.

AB We examined bird diversity in relation to land use and socioeconomic indicators in Leipzig, Germany. We used neighborhood diversity (ND) and bivariate correlation to show that the potential to experience biodiversity in a city is associated with population density, household income, unemployment, and urban green space. People living in urban districts with high socioeconomic status experience the highest species richness around their homes, whereas lower social status increases the chance of living in species-poor neighborhoods. High-status districts are located along forests, parks, and rivers that have a high quantity and quality of green space. However, green space in general does not guarantee high bird diversity. We conclude that bird diversity mirrors land use and socioeconomic patterns within the compact European city of Leipzig. Therefore, urban planning should focus on decreasing these patterns and protecting the remaining species-rich green spaces.

TI A native dasyurid predator (common planigale, Planigale maculata)
   rapidly learns to avoid a toxic invader

AB Interactions between invasive species and native fauna afford a unique opportunity to examine interspecific encounters as they first occur, without the complications introduced by coevolution. In northern Australia, the continuing invasion of the highly toxic cane toad Bufo marinus poses a threat to many frog-eating predators. Can predators learn to distinguish the novel toxic prey item from native prey (and thus, avoid being poisoned), or are longer-term genetically based changes to attack behaviour needed before predators can coexist with toads? To predict the short-term impact of cane toads on native predators, we need to know the proportion of individuals that will attack toads, the proportion surviving the encounter, and whether surviving predators learn to avoid toads. We quantified these traits in a dasyurid (common planigale, Planigale maculata) that inhabits tropical floodplains across northern Australia. Although 90% of naive planigales attacked cane toads, 83% of these animals survived because they either rejected the toad unharmed, or killed and consumed the prey snout-first (thereby avoiding the toxin-laden parotoid glands). Most planigales showed one-trial learning and subsequently refused to attack cane toads for long time periods (up to 28 days). Toad-exposed planigales also avoided native frogs for up to 9 days, thereby providing an immediate benefit to native anurans. However, the predators gradually learnt to use chemical cues to discriminate between frogs and toads. Collectively, our results suggest that generalist predators can learn to distinguish and avoid novel toxic prey very rapidly - and hence, that small dasyurid predators can rapidly adapt to the cane toad invasion. Indeed, it may be feasible to teach especially vulnerable predators to avoid cane toads before the toads invade, by deploying low-toxicity baits that stimulate taste-aversion learning.

AB Niche construction can generate ecological and evolutionary feedbacks that have been underinvestigated so far. We present an eco-evolutionary model that incorporates the process of niche construction to reveal its effects on the ecology and evolution of the niche-constructing agent. We consider a simple plant-soil nutrient ecosystem in which plants have the ability to increase the input of inorganic nutrient as an example of positive niche construction. On an ecological time scale, the model shows that niche construction allows the persistence of plants under infertile soil conditions that would otherwise lead to their extinction. This expansion of plants' niche, however, requires a high enough rate of niche construction and a high enough initial plant biomass to fuel the positive ecological feedback between plants and their soil environment. On an evolutionary time scale, we consider that the rates of niche construction and nutrient uptake coevolve in plants while a trade-off constrains their values. Different evolutionary outcomes are possible depending on the shape of the trade-off. We show that niche construction results in an evolutionary feedback between plants and their soil environment such that plants partially regulate soil nutrient content. The direct benefit accruing to plants, however, plays a crucial role in the evolutionary advantage of niche construction.

AB The high biodiversity of tropical marine hotspots has long intrigued evolutionary biologists and biogeographers. The genus Haemulon (grunts) is one of the most important (numerically, ecologically, and economically) reef fish groups in the New World and an excellent candidate to test hypotheses of speciation and diversity generation in the Greater Caribbean, the richest Atlantic biodiversity hotspot, as well as the eastern Pacific. To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among the species of Haemulon, we obtained a combined total of 2639 base pairs from two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase 1), and two nuclear genes (TMO-4C4 and RAG2) from all nominal species. Parsimony, Maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses resulted in a well-resolved phylogeny with almost identical topologies. Previous phylogenetic hypotheses based on adult morphology, such as the close relationship among H. aurolineatum, H. boschmae, and H. striatum were not supported, whereas others using developmental characters, such as the relationship between H. plumieri and H. sciurus, were confirmed Our data. also indicate that the populations of the nominal H. steindachneri from the two sides of the Isthmus of Panama are genetically divergent at the species level in each ocean, and that the boga, Inermia vittata (family Inermiidae), belongs in the genus Haemulon. This evidence implies that there are 21 valid species of Haemulon, two more than previously recognized. The Amazon barrier and the Isthmus of Panama seem to have played roles in allopatric speciation of Haemulon. However, the majority of sister species pairs have completely overlapping distributions, indicating that vicariance is not the only process driving speciation in this genus. We conclude that both vicariance between biogeographic provinces, and ecological mechanisms of speciation within provinces contribute to species richness in the genus Haemulon. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Ecologists know relatively little about the manner in which disturbance affects the likelihood of alternative community stable states and how the history of community assembly affects the relationship between disturbance and species diversity. Using microbial communities comprising bacterivorous ciliated protists assembled in laboratory microcosms, we experimentally investigated these questions by independently manipulating the intensity of disturbance (in the form of density-independent mortality) and community assembly history (including a control treatment with simultaneous species introduction and five sequential assembly treatments). Species diversity patterns consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis emerged in the controls, as several species showed responses indicative of a tradeoff between competitive ability and ability to recover from disturbance. Species diversity in communities with sequential assembly, however, generally declined with disturbance, owing to the increased extinction risk of later colonizers at the intermediate level of disturbance. Similarities among communities subjected to different assembly histories increased with disturbance, a result due possibly to increasing disturbance reducing the importance of competition and hence priority effects. This finding is most consistent with the idea that increasing disturbance tends to reduce the likelihood of alternative stable states. Collectively, these results indicate the strong interactive effects of disturbance and assembly history on the structure of ecological communities.

AB The pine-oak woodlands of the Mexican highlands harbour significant biological diversity, yet little is known about the evolutionary history of organisms inhabiting this region. We assessed genetic and phenotypic differentiation in 482 individuals representing 27 populations of the Mexican jay (Aphelocoma ultramarina) - a widespread bird species of the Mexican highlands - to test whether populations in the central and northern Mexican sierras display discrete breaks between groups, which would be consistent with a role for the different mountain chains in divergence and speciation. We found abrupt breaks in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; ND2 and control region) delineating four major genetic groups found in the Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, southern Central Plateau (Bajio), and Transvolcanic Belt. These mtDNA groups were largely corroborated by data from nuclear microsatellites and phenotypic data, except that clades from the Central Plateau and Sierra Madre Oriental showed clinal change in these data sets. Uncertainty about the mutation rate for our mitochondrial markers warrants considerable caution with regard to estimating divergence times, but the major genetic groups appear to have split before the most extreme period of glacial cycling that marked the last 0.7 million years and after Mexico's period of major mountain formation. The fact that some genetic breaks do not coincide with well-known geographic barriers suggests a role for ecology in divergence and speciation, and we discuss implications for taxonomy and conservation.

AB Forging stronger linkages between geomorphology and ecosystem ecology depends, in part, upon developing common conceptualizations of an ecosystem. Because most ecosystem processes are scale dependent, the choice of boundaries is of profound importance to the conceptualization of an ecosystem and to the scope and validity of questions being asked within that ecosystem. Indeed, any conceptualization of an ecosystem requires constraining the spatial and temporal scales of analysis. Thus, it is of particular importance to match the ecosystem boundaries to the question being asked or to the processes being studied and, to facilitate better communication among disciplines, to be explicit in the definitions adopted for an ecosystem.
   Defining an ecosystem can be problematic when the processes of interest operate at potentially different scales, and little research exists comparing scales of geomorphic processes with those of ecological processes. Here we will discuss the importance of scale in geomorphic and ecological research, and compare and contrast disciplinary biases and inclinations. To highlight the problem of conflicting spatial scales, we will draw on recent attempts to link the structure of food webs to measures of ecosystem size. In particular, problems arise where little or no strong association exists among community membership, resource supply, and physical boundaries. Similar problems arise when trying to link geomorphologic and ecological processes that can operate at different, but variable, temporal scales. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate delimitation of species boundaries is especially important in cryptic taxa where one or more character sources are uninformative or are in conflict. Rather than relying on a single marker to delimit species, integrative taxonomy uses multiple lines of evidence such as molecular, morphological, behavioural and geographic characters to test species limits. We examine the effectiveness of this approach by testing the delimitation of two cryptic Nearctic species of Dioryctria (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) using three independent molecular markers [cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), second internal transcribed spacer unit (ITS2), and elongation factor la (EF1 alpha)], forewing variation and larval host plant association. Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes do not form reciprocally monophyletic clades, restricted gene flow between COI haplotype groups, and concordance with ITS2 genotypes, forewing variation and host plant associations support delimitation of two Nearctic species: eastern Dioryctria reniculelloides and western Dioryctria pseudotsugella. Conversely, EF1 alpha genotype variation was incongruent with the two previous markers. A case of discordance between COI and ITS2 was detected, suggesting either introgression due to hybridization or retained ancestral polymorphism due to incomplete coalescence. This study is consistent with other similar literature where molecular loci in closely related species progress from shared to fixed haplotypes/alleles, and from polyphyletic to reciprocally monophyletic relationships, although loci may vary in these characteristics despite maintenance of genomic integrity between distinct species. In particular, mtDNA in other studies generally showed a lower rate of fixation of differences than did X-linked or autosomal loci, reinforcing the need to use an integrative approach for delimiting species.

AB Freshwater populations of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in northern Germany are found as distinct lake and river ecotypes. Adaptation to habitat-specific parasites might influence immune capabilities of stickleback ecotypes. Here, naive laboratory-bred sticklebacks from lake and river populations were exposed reciprocally to parasite environments in a lake and a river habitat. Sticklebacks exposed to lake conditions were infected with higher numbers of parasite species when compared with the river. River sticklebacks in the lake had higher parasite loads than lake sticklebacks in the same habitat. Respiratory burst, granulocyte counts and lymphocyte proliferation of head kidney leucocytes were increased in river sticklebacks exposed to lake when compared with river conditions. Although river sticklebacks exposed to lake conditions showed elevated activation of their immune system, parasites could not be diminished as effectively as by lake sticklebacks in their native habitat. River sticklebacks seem to have reduced their immune-competence potential due to lower parasite diversity in rivers.

AB Many complex networks such as computer and social networks exhibit modular structures, where links between nodes are much denser within modules than between modules. It is widely believed that cellular networks are also modular, reflecting the relative independence and coherence of different functional units in a cell. While many authors have claimed that observations from the yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) network support the above hypothesis, the observed structural modularity may be an artifact because the current PPI data include interactions inferred from protein complexes through approaches that create modules (e. g., assigning pairwise interactions among all proteins in a complex). Here we analyze the yeast PPI network including protein complexes (PIC network) and excluding complexes (PEC network). We find that both PIC and PEC networks show a significantly greater structural modularity than that of randomly rewired networks. Nonetheless, there is little evidence that the structural modules correspond to functional units, particularly in the PEC network. More disturbingly, there is no evolutionary conservation among yeast, fly, and nematode modules at either the whole-module or protein-pair level. Neither is there a correlation between the evolutionary or phylogenetic conservation of a protein and the extent of its participation in various modules. Using computer simulation, we demonstrate that a higher-than-expected modularity can arise during network growth through a simple model of gene duplication, without natural selection for modularity. Taken together, our results suggest the intriguing possibility that the structural modules in the PPI network originated as an evolutionary by product without biological significance.

AB Anthropogenic activities have weakened biogeographical barriers to dispersal resulting in the global spread and establishment of an increasing number of non-native species. We examine the broad-scale consequences of this phenomenon based on an analysis of compositional similarity across urban floras in the northeastern United States and Europe. We test the prediction that homogenization of species composition is uniquely defined within vs. between continents based on the time and place of origin of non-native species. In this case, for archaeophytes and neophytes in Europe (introduced before and after AD 1500, respectively) and non-native species originating from within and outside the United States. More species in urban floras were shared within than between continents. Within Europe, archaeophytes shared more species across urban floras compared with neophytes; strong associations were not observed for non-native species across US urban floras. Between the two continents, non-native species in the United States that originated from outside the United States shared species primarily with archaeophytes but also with European natives and neophytes. These results suggest that the direction of biotic interchange was unidirectional with species moving primarily from Europe to the United States with archaeophytes playing a primary and non-native species originating from outside the two continents a secondary role as a homogenizing source. Archaeophytes, based on combination of biogeographical, evolutionary, and ecological factors in association with a long history of anthropogenic influence, appear to have played a prominent role in the continental and intercontinental homogenization of species composition. This suggests that the uniform homogenization of the Earth's biota is not imminent and is presently directed by a combination of biogeographically defined anthropogenic and historical factors.

AB Environmental change is not likely to act on biodiversity in a random manner, but rather according to species traits that affect assembly processes, thus, having potentially serious consequences on ecological functions. We investigated the effects of anthropogenic land use on functional richness of local hoverfly communities of 24 agricultural landscapes across temperate Europe. A multivariate ordination separated seven functional groups based on resource use, niche characteristics and response type. Intensive land use reduced functional richness, but each functional group responded in a unique way. Species richness of generalist groups was nearly unaffected. Local habitat quality mainly affected specialist groups, while land use affected intermediate groups of rather common species. We infer that high species richness within functional groups alone is no guarantee for maintaining functional richness. Thus, it is not species richness per se that improves insurance of functional diversity against environmental pressures but the degree of dissimilarity within each functional group.

AB Questions: Does grazing have the same effect on plant species richness at different spatial scales? Does the effect of spatial scale vary under different climatic conditions and vegetation types? Does the slope of the species-area curve change with grazing intensity similarly under different climatic conditions and vegetation types?
   Location: Pastures along a climatic gradient in northeastern Spain.
   Methods: In zones under different regimes of sheep grazing (high-, low-pressure, abandonment), plant species richness was measured in different plot sizes (from 0.01 to 100 m(2)) and the slope of the species-area curves was calculated. The study was replicated in five different locations along a climatic gradient from lowland semi-arid rangelands to upland moist grasslands.
   Results: Species richness tended to increase with grazing intensity at all spatial scales in the moist upland locations. On the contrary, in the most and locations, richness tended to decrease, or remain unchanged, with grazing due to increased bare soil. Grazing differentially affected the slope (z) of the species-area curve (power function S = c A(z)) in different climatic conditions: z tended to increase with grazing in arid areas and decrease in moist-upland ones. beta-diversity followed similar pattern as z.
   Conclusions: Results confirm that the impact of grazing on plant species richness are spatial-scale dependent. However, the effects on the species-area relationship vary under different climatic conditions. This offers a novel insight on the patterns behind the different effects of grazing on diversity in moist vs. and conditions reported in the literature. It is argued that the effect of spatial scale varies because of the different interaction between grazing and the intrinsic spatial structure of the vegetation. Variations in species-area curves with grazing along moisture gradients suggest also a different balance of spatial components of diversity (i.e. alpha- and beta-diversity).

AB Temperate grasslands represent about 32% of the earth's land area and cover approximately 56% of the area of Ireland; yet their role as sources/sinks of atmospheric CO2 is not well quantified. We used an eddy covariance (EC) system to measure the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at a managed grassland site in southern Ireland for 2 years. Rainfall in 2002 and 2003 was 1785 and 1185 mm, respectively, compared to an annual average of 1470 turn. The EC measured NEE was less in the wet year (-193 +/- 50 g C m(-2), uptake) than in the dry year (-258 +/- 50 g C m(-2), uptake). Combining NEE measurements with estimates of the components of the farm scale carbon (C) balance we estimated the amount of C fixed to the soil as -24 +/- 62 g C m(-2) for 2002 and -89 +/- 62 g C m(-2) for 2003, indicating that this ecosystem was a small sink for carbon. For the same months in different years, we found that the NEE was similar, although their soil moisture status was very different. This was due to the fact that the soil moisture status in this region, even in dry periods, was always well above the wilting point which resulted in no moisture stress on the vegetation at any time over the 2 years. We concluded that the NEE for this humid grassland ecosystem was not very sensitive to the variation in precipitation over the 2 years. We found that herbage harvesting had a direct effect of reducing the NEE in the month of harvest. We conclude that the interannual variation in NEE of 65 g C m(-2) is of the order of uncertainty of the EC measurements. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rapoport's rule applied to an elevation gradient predicts a positive correlation between elevation ranges and elevation. This is supposed to be caused by the increasing magnitude of the climatic extremes at higher elevations, and thus, it is deduced that species richness should decrease with increasing elevation. The distribution of 614 tree species was used to test Rapoport's elevational rule along a gradient from 100 to 4300 m a.s.l., in the Nepalese Himalaya. The relationship between species richness and elevation was analysed by using generalized linear models (GLM). Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to examine the relationship between elevational range and the elevational mid-point of a species along the gradient. The widest elevation ranges are observed at mid-elevations, and narrow elevation ranges are observed at both ends of the gradient. This does not support Rapoport's elevation rule, as proposed by Stevens. There is a peak in species richness between 900 and 1000 m, and not in the tropical lowland as projected by Rapoport's elevation rule.

ID INDIVIDUAL FITNESS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; AGE; POPULATION; EXPERIENCE;

AB Longevity is the main factor influencing individual fitness of long-lived, iteroparous species. Theories of life history evolution suggest this is because increased longevity allows individuals to (i) have more breeding attempts (time component), (ii) accumulate experience so as to become better able to rear offspring (experience component) or (iii) because individuals reaching old age have above-average quality (quality component). We assess empirically the relative influences of time, experience and quality on the relationship between longevity and individual fitness among female reindeer. Fitness increased with longevity due to all three processes. All females increased in success with age up to their penultimate year of life (experience component), the success of the terminal-breeding occasion was strongly dependent on longevity. Long-lived females had more successful breeding attempts during their life (time component), and had higher reproductive success at all ages, especially during the last year of life (individual quality component) than short-lived females. Our study reveals a more complex relationship between longevity and fitness in large mammals than the simple increase of the number of reproductive attempts when living longer.

AB During fall migration many songbirds switch from consuming primarily insects to consuming mostly fruit. Fruits with more carbohydrates and less protein may be sufficient to rebuild expended fat stores, but such fruits may be inadequate to replace catabolized protein. We manipulated the concentrations and isotopic signatures of macronutrients in diets fed to birds to study the effects of diet quality on metabolic routing of dietary nutrients. We estimated that approximately 45% and 75%, respectively, of the carbon in proteinaceous tissue of birds switched to high- or low-protein diets came from nonprotein dietary sources. In contrast, we estimated that approximately 100% and 20%-80%, respectively, of the nitrogen in proteinaceous tissues of birds switched to high- or low-protein diets was attributable to dietary protein. Thus, the routing and assimilation of dietary carbon and nitrogen differed depending on diet composition. As a result, delta N-15 of tissues collected from wild animals that consume high- quality diets may reliably indicate the dietary protein source, whereas delta C-13 of these same tissues is likely the product of metabolic routing of carbon from several macronutrients. These results have implications for how isotopic discrimination is best estimated and how we can study macronutrient routing in wild animals.

AB Although homoploid hybridization is increasingly recognized as an important phenomenon in plant evolution, its evolutionary genetic mechanisms are poorly documented and understood. Pinus densata, a pine native to the Tibetan Plateau, represents a good example of a homoploid hybrid speciation facilitated by adaptation to extreme environment and ecological isolation from the parents. Its ecologically and reproductively stabilized nature offers excellent opportunity for studying genetic processes associated with hybrid speciation. In this study, we investigated the levels and patterns of nucleotide variation in P. densata and its putative parents. Haplotype composition, gene genealogies, and the levels and patterns of nucleotide variation gave further support to the hybrid nature of P. densata. Allelic history, as revealed by our data, suggests the ancient nature of the hybrid preceding elevation of the Tibetan Plateau. We detected more deviations from neutrality in P. densata than in the parental species. Thus, at least some of the evolutionary forces that have shaped the genetic variation in P. densata are likely to be different from those acting upon parental species. We speculate that when populations of P. densata invaded new territories, they had elevated rates of response to selection in order to develop traits that help them to survive and adapt in the new environments.

AB Ecologists often consider how environmental factors limit a species' geographic range. However, recent models suggest that geographic distribution also may be determined by a species' ability to adapt to novel environmental conditions. In this study, we empirically tested whether further evolution would be necessary for northern expansion of the weedy annual cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) in its native North American range. We transplanted seedlings beyond the northern border and photoperiodically manipulated reproductive timing, a trait important for adaptation to shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes within the range, to determine whether further evolution of this trait would result in a phenotype viable beyond the range. Earlier reproductive induction enabled plants to produce mature seeds beyond the range and to achieve a reproductive output similar to those grown within the range. Therefore, evolution of earlier reproduction in marginal populations would be necessary for northward range expansion. This study is the first to empirically show that evolution in an ecologically important trait would enable a species to survive and reproduce beyond its current range. These results suggest that relatively few traits may limit a species' range and that identifying evolutionary constraints on such traits could be important for predicting geographic distribution.

AB Pelagic crustacean zooplankton were collected from 336 Norwegian lakes covering a wide range of latitude, altitude, lake area, mean depth, production (as chlorophyll a), and fish community structure. Mean zooplankton species richness during the ice-free season was generally low at high latitudes and altitudes. Further, lower species richness was recorded in western lakes, possibly reflecting constraints on migration and dispersal. However, despite obvious spatial limitations, geographic boundaries were only weak predictors of mean zooplankton richness. Similarly, lake surface area did not contribute positively to mean richness such as seen in other ecosystem surveys. Rather, intrinsic factors such as primary production and fish community (planktivore) structure were identified by regression analysis as the major predictors of zooplankton diversity, while a positive correlation was observed between species richness and total zooplankton biomass. However, in spite of a large number of variables included in this study, the predictive power of multiple regression models was modest (< 50% variance explained), pointing to a major role for within-lake properties, as yet unidentified intrinsic forces, stochasticity, or dispersal as constraints on zooplankton diversity in these lakes.

AB Theory predicts that species diversity can enhance stability of community-level biomass while simultaneously decreasing population-level stability. Enrichment can theoretically destabilize communities but effects may become weaker with increasing diversity because of the inclusion of consumer-resistant prey. Few experiments using direct manipulations of species diversity have tested these predictions. We used laboratory-based aquatic food webs to examine the effects of species composition, diversity and enrichment on temporal variability of population- and community-level biomass. We found weak effects of enrichment on population- and community-level stability. However, diversity enhanced community-level stability while species composition had no influence. In contrast, composition effects outweighed diversity effects when stability was measured at the population level. We found no negative effects of diversity on population-level stability, in opposition to theory. Our results indicate that diversity can enhance stability in multitrophic systems, but effects vary with the scale of biological organization at which stability is measured.

AB Aim We describe the changes in species richness, rarity and composition with altitude, and explore whether the differences in Scarabaeinae dung beetle composition along five altitudinal transects of the same mountain range are related to altitude or if there are interregional differences in these altitudinal gradients.
   Location Field work was carried out on the eastern slope of the eastern Cordillera, Colombian Andes, between Tama Peak to the north, in the Tama National Park (07 degrees 23' N, 72 degrees 23' W) and the San Miguel River (00 degrees 28' N, 77 degrees 17' W) to the south.
   Methods Sampling was carried out between February 1997 and November 1999 in five regions spanning elevation gradients. In each gradient, six sites were chosen at 250 m intervals between 1000 and 2250 m a.s.l.
   Results We found a curvilinear relationship between altitude and mean species richness, with a peak in richness at middle elevations. However, the diversity of dung beetle assemblages does not seem to be related to the interregional differences in environmental conditions. The number of geographically restricted species is negatively and significantly related to altitude, with geographically restricted species more frequent at low altitude sites. Ordination delimited the two main groups according to altitude: one with all the highest sites (1750-2250 m a.s.l.) and a second group with the remaining sites (< 1750 m a.s.l.). Analysis of species co-occurrence shows that these dung beetle assemblages seem to be spatially structured when all sites have the same probability of being chosen. In contrast, the spatial structure of species assemblages seems to be random when the probability of choosing any site is proportional to its altitude.
   Main conclusions The altitude of sites is the main factor that influences the diversity of these dung beetle assemblages. The peak in species richness at middle elevations, the higher number of geographically restricted species at lower altitudinal levels, and the compositional differences along these mountain gradients seem to result from the mixing at these altitudes of dung beetle assemblages that have different environmental adaptations and, probably, different origins. The relevance of altitude in these assemblages is related to the limited role of these Neotropical high altitude environments as centres of refuge and vicariance for a monophyletic group of warm-adapted species, for which the vertical colonization of these high mountain environments by lineages distributed at lower altitudes would have been very difficult.

AB Recent advances in analytical methods and exploration of regional diversity patterns in greater depth than simple whole-fauna patterns may change our understanding of the determinants of latitudinal gradients in species richness. Using a comprehensive database on the geographical distributions of the large fauna of endemic shorefishes from the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), we delineated latitudinal diversity gradients (LDGs) of species with different range sizes and assessed how the mid-domain effect, energy supply, environmental variability, and habitat availability predicted the various LDGs. We used statistical methods that account for spatial autocorrelation within each variable and consider collinearity among them. We found marked variation in LDGs among species with different range sizes: species with large ranges contributed the most to the convex form of the entire-fauna LDG while species with small ranges generated most deviations from that form. The mid-domain effect was the strongest determinant for the entire-fauna LDG, largely due to the strength of its effect on widespread species. Habitat variables were the best predictors for LDGs of small-range species but had no significant effects on the entire-fauna pattern. We found that any relationship between energy supply and LDGs likely is spurious and arises from statistical effects of (1) the marked spatial autocorrelation of the residuals in those relationships and (2) strong covariation between energy supply and the mid-domain effect, two factors that have never been analyzed together in marine studies (and seldom in terrestrial studies). There was no indication that environmental stability was an important LDG determinant at any level within the fauna. We found that latitudinal (Rapoport) trends in range size in this fauna arise as corollaries of the mid-domain effect. The disparate contributions of species with different range sizes to diversity patterns demonstrate the failure of traditional, whole-fauna LDGs to adequately represent all faunal components and their determinants, particularly those of small-range (and more threatened) species. We argue that, just as analyses of whole-fauna patterns within a region obscure variation in determinants among faunal components, analyses of patterns at transoceanic (multiregional) scales are likely to conceal important regional variation in determinants of diversity gradients.

AB Although it is widely believed that an important function of protected areas is to conserve species that are unable to survive elsewhere, there are very few empirical studies in which a comparison is made between biodiversity of protected areas and that of the cultivated landscape surrounding them. We examined the diversity of trees, birds, and macrofungi at 58 sites in three land-use types in a tree-covered landscape in Kodagu district in the Western Ghats of India. Ten forest reserve sites in the formal protected area, and 25 sacred groves and 23 coffee plantations in the neighboring cultivated landscape were sampled. A total of 215 tree, 86 bird, and 163 macrofungus species were recorded. The forest reserve had a large number of trees that were restricted in their distribution, and the sacred groves had a large number of macrofungi. We observed that deciduous trees and non-forest-dwelling birds increased, and evergreen trees and forest-dwelling birds decreased with increasing intensity of land management. We found that trees having non-timber uses and macrofungi useful to the local people, as well as those with medicinal properties, were abundant in sacred groves. We found no significant differences in the distribution of endemic and threatened birds across the three land-use types. Although endemic trees were more abundant in the forest reserve than in sacred groves, threatened trees were more abundant in sacred groves than in the forest reserve. We attribute the high diversity in sacred groves to the native tree cover in shade coffee plantations. We conclude that informal protected areas are as important as formal ones for biodiversity conservation in Kodagu. We recommend that a conservation strategy that recognizes informal protection traditions is essential for successful biodiversity conservation in regions where formal reserves are surrounded by a matrix of cultivated land.

AB In Europe research and policy debates point to the need to increase efforts to rehabilitate or restore habitat structure and function at the expense of the traditional recreational fisheries management approach to intensively stock fish. Against this background it is paramount to understand and explain the management preferences of anglers. No research has empirically examined key factors explaining whether anglers prefer various forms of habitat management (HM) over stocking. By means of a telephone survey, we investigated the management preferences of a nationwide random sample of anglers in Germany to fund either HM or fish stocking, Management strategies potentially restricting the own activity were, on average, opposed, Anglers with high pro-ecological and low traditional management beliefs, negative stocking and positive HM attitudes, satisfied with the previous angling year, less catch orientated, successful (catch) and committed, fishing most frequently in natural water bodies, and living in more rural areas exhibited the preference to fund HM as opposed to stocking. Basic human characteristics such as beliefs, attitudes and the angler's consumptive orientation were more meaningful predictor variables than typical angler variables such as demographics, angler experience or angler preferences (e.g. species preference), Angler catch and satisfaction emerged as the only near-term managerially manipulable variables that could be addressed to increase support for HM. Traditional management approaches without effort limitation will probably fail to initiate this shift. Anglers should be increasingly involved personally in designing and implementing management programs to facilitate their "education" about the outcomes and risks of various management actions, (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Positive interspecific interactions are commonplace, and in recent years ecologists have begun to realize how important they can be in determining community and ecosystem dynamics. It has been predicted that net positive interactions are likely to occur in environments characterized by high abiotic stress. Although empirical field studies have started to support these predictions, little theoretical work has been carried out on the dynamic nature of these effects and their consequences for community structure. We use a simple patch-occupancy model to simulate the dynamics of a pair of species living on an environmental gradient. Each of the species can exist as either a mutualist or a cheater. The results confirm the prediction: a band of mutualists tends to occur in environmental conditions beyond the limits of the cheaters. The region between mutualists and cheaters is interesting: population density here is low. Mutualists periodically occupy this area, but are displaced by cheaters, who themselves go extinct in the absence of the mutualists. Furthermore, the existence of mutualists extends the area occupied by the cheaters, essentially increasing their realized niche. Our approach has considerable potential for improving our understanding of the balance between positive and negative interspecific interactions and for predicting the probable impacts of habitat loss and, climate change on communities dominated by positive interspecific interactions.

AB This study describes how early and late successional plant species affect soil microorganisms in alpine ecosystems. We quantify the relative importance of plant species and soil properties as determinants of belowground microbial communities. Sixteen plant species were selected from six successional stages (4-14-20-43-75-135 years) within the foreland of the Rotmoosferner glacier, Austria, and at one (reference) site outside the foreland. The size, composition and function of the communities of microorganism in the bulk soil and the rhizosphere were characterized by ninhydrin-reactive nitrogen, phospholipid fatty acids and enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, leucine aminopeptidase, acid phosphatase, sulphatase). The results show that the microbial data could be grouped according to early (up to 43 years) and late-colonizing plant species (75 or more years). In early succession, no plant species or soil age effect was detected on the microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acids, or enzyme activity. The rhizosphere microbial community was similar to that in the bulk soil, which in turn was determined by the abiotic environmental conditions. In late succession, improved soil conditions probably mediated plant species effects on the belowground microbial community. The most pronounced rhizosphere effects were attributed to plant species of the 75-and 135-year-old sites. The microbial colonization (size, composition, activity) of the bulk soil predominantly followed changes in vegetation cover, plant life forms and soil organic matter. In summary, the observed successional pattern of the above- and belowground communities provides an example of the facilitation models of primary succession. (c) 2005 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB We used estimates of autotrophic respiration (R-A), net primary productivity (NPP) and soil CO2 evolution (S-ff), to develop component carbon budgets for 12-year-old loblolly pine plantations during the fifth year of a fertilization and irrigation experiment. Annual carbon use in R-A was 7.5, 9.0, 15.0, and 15.1 Mg C ha(-1) in control (C), irrigated (I), fertilized (F) and irrigated and fertilized (IF) treatments, respectively. Foliage, fine root and perennial woody tissue (stem, branch, coarse and taproot) respiration accounted for, respectively, 37%, 24%, and 39% of R-A in C and I treatments and 38%, 12% and 50% of R-A in F and IF treatments. Annual gross primary production (GPP=NPP+R-A) ranged from 13.1 to 26.6 Mg C ha(-1). The I, F, and IF treatments resulted in a 21, 94, and 103% increase in GPP, respectively, compared to the C treatment. Despite large treatment differences in NPP, R-A, and carbon allocation, carbon use efficiency (CUE=NPP/GPP) averaged 0.42 and was unaffected by manipulating site resources.
   Ecosystem respiration (R-E), the sum of S-ff, and above ground R-A, ranged from 12.8 to 20.2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). S-ff contributed the largest proportion of R-E, but the relative importance of S-ff decreased from 0.63 in C treatments to 0.47 in IF treatments because of increased aboveground R-A. Aboveground woody tissue R-A was 15% of R-E in C and I treatments compared to 25% of R-E in F and IF treatments. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP=GPP-R-E) was roughly 0 in the C and I treatments and 6.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in F and IF treatments, indicating that non-fertilized treatments were neither a source nor a sink for atmospheric carbon while fertilized treatments were carbon sinks. In these young stands, NEP is tightly linked to NPP; increased ecosystem carbon storage results mainly from an increase in foliage and perennial woody biomass.

AB Research conducted in several Mediterranean areas indicates that most populations of steppe birds are currently experiencing population declines associated with intensification of traditional agricultural practices. By using habitat suitability modeling (HSM), our aim was to use available environmental data sets, including land use and relief, to model the current distribution of nine steppe bird species in the agriculture dominated areas of the Catalan Ebro basin ( northeast Iberia). We then employ HSM to quantitatively assess the future impact of land use changes on the potential distribution range of these species under two scenarios following irrigation of present extensive cereal steppes in the area. HSM analyses showed a close association between steppe bird distribution and the extent of extensive cereal agriculture in flat areas. Although the sensitivity to planned irrigation schemes was species specific, we estimated significant decreases in distribution after irrigation for seven of the nine species examined, i.e. the Little bustard, the Montagu's harrier, the Roller and the Calandra lark, the species predicted to be more severely affected by predicted decreases in area exceeding 50%. Overall, core steppe habitats where most valuable steppe species may co-occur are expected to be mostly impacted and decrease by 74 to 81% after irrigation of only 28 to 36% of the cereal cropland in the region. Future maintenance and survival of viable populations of steppe birds will rely on our ability to enlarge the network of protected areas and to implement agri-environmental measures targeting current species core habitats in low-intensity farmland.

AB This study analyses trophic interactions between soil fungi, micro- and mesofauna in microcosm experiments. The trophic shift of N-15 and fatty acids (FAs) was investigated in different food chains, which comprised either two (fungi and grazers) or three (fungi, nematodes and Collembola) levels. Contrary to the widely accepted assumption of N-15 enrichment in trophic cascades the experiments revealed enrichment, depletion or no change in N-15 of consumers compared to their diet. Factors responsible for this pattern were suggested to be: (1) the main metabolic pathway used for N excretion in ammonotelic nematodes to be similar or depleted in the heavier isotope, and uricotelic Collembola mostly enriched in the heavier isotope; (2) a higher shift in N-15 with a high-protein diet (e.g. for predators); (3) compensation due to low-quality food altering the fractionation of N-15. Analysis of the lipid composition showed phospholipids to be generally unaffected and neutral lipids closely related to the FA pattern of the food source. Dietary routing of FAs into neutral lipids occurred, as evidenced by corresponding frequencies of FAs in host and consumer profiles. Additionally, several FAs were only detected in the grazer when present in the food source. Oleic acid showed a shift over three trophic levels, from fungi to nematodes to Collembola. The assimilation of dietary FAs resulted in a more diverse neutral lipid profile, i.e. animals higher in the food chain contained more individual FAs compared to animals lower in the food chain. The results indicate that monoenoic C18 and monoenoic C20 FAs have the potential to act as tools for the bioindication of feeding strategies in belowground systems. We suggest that primary consumers will have no or only trace amounts of monoenoic C20 acids in their neutral lipid profile, whereas consumers feeding on a eukaryote diet will show a considerably higher frequency.

AB Soil respiration (r(s)), soil temperature (T-s) and volumetric soil water content were measured in a balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) ecosystem from 1998 to 2001. Seasonal variation in root and microbial respiration, and covariation in abiotic factors confounded interpretation of the effects of T-s and soil water potential (Psi(s)) on r(s). To minimize the confounding effect of temperature, we analyzed the effect of Psi(s) on r(s) during the summers of 1998-2000 when changes in T-s were slight. Soil respiration declined 25-50% in response to modest water stress (minimum Psi(s) of -0.6 to -0.2 MPa), and between years, there was substantial variation in the relationship between r(s) and Psi(s). In the summer of 2000, 2-m(2) plots were subjected to drought for 1 month and other plots were irrigated. The relationship between summertime r(s) and Psi(s) in the experimental plots was similar to that estimated from the survey data obtained during the same summer. In late spring and early autumn of 2001, 2-m(2) trenched and untrenched plots were subjected to drought or exposed to rainfall. It was dry in the early autumn and there was severe soil drying (Psi(s) of -10 MPa in untrenched plots and -2 MPa in trenched plots). In spring, r(s) in untrenched plots responded more to modest water stress than rs in trenched plots, indicating that root respiration is more sensitive than microbial respiration to water stress at this time of year. The response to abiotic factors differed significantly between spring and autumn in untrenched plots but not in trenched plots, indicating that root activity was greater in early autumn than in late spring, and that roots acclimated to the sustained, severe water stress experienced before and during the autumn.

AB Flagship species are charismatic species that serve as a symbol and rallying point to stimulate conservation awareness and action but are often used synonymously as de facto umbrella species to delineate reserve boundaries. We tested the extent to which the presence of a flagship species would protect other 'background species' at the local scale at which practical decisions about small reserves are often made. Using long term sightings, we identified four 1 km(2) Sites that are frequently visited by jaguars and by tapirs (flagship species), and by white-lipped peccaries and spider monkeys (non-flagship species) in neotropical rainforest in Belize. We then made inventories of five vertebrate taxonomic groups at each site. We found no consistent differences in species richness or abundances of frogs, phyllostomid bats, terrestrial mammals, scansorial mammals or birds across the four sites, except that frog diversity and abundance was higher close to a river at the flagship site where tapirs were found. Since these classic Latin American flagship species fail to encompass particularly high numbers or abundances of vertebrate species at a local scale, they appear to be a poor conservation tool when co-opted as umbrella species for delineating the location of very small reserves in the neotropics.

AB Aim To examine the richness of breeding bird species in relation to elevation, primary productivity and urbanization.
   Location The island of Taiwan (120degrees-122degrees E, 22degrees-25degrees N).
   Methods We arranged bird species richness (BSR) data from 288 bird censuses undertaken in Taiwan into a 2 x 2 km quadrat system and calculated average values of elevation, primary productivity [surrogated by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)], and urbanization (surrogated by road density and percentage of built area) for each 2 x 2 km quadrat.
   Results Bird species richness showed a hump-shaped relationship with elevation. It increased with elevation from sea level (10-64 species per 2 x 2 km quadrat), peaked around 2000 m (43-76 species), and then decreased with elevation towards its minimum at the highest elevation. Road density and percentage of built area decreased with elevation, and NDVI showed a hump-shaped relationship with elevation and inverse relationships with road density and percentage of built area. BSR increased with NDVI and decreased with road density and percentage of built area. Linear and cubic terms of elevation together explained 31.3% of the variance in BSR, and road density explained additional 3.4%. The explanatory power of NDVI on BSR was insignificant after the effects of elevation and road density had been justified.
   Main conclusions We argue that urbanization plays an important role in the BSR of Taiwan. Urbanization might indirectly decrease BSR through decreasing primary productivity and therefore change the hypothetical inverse relationship between BSR and elevation into a hump-shaped relationship. We also propose a time hypothesis that the biotic communities in the mid-elevation zone of Taiwan had relatively longer periods of existence during the Pleistocene glacial cycles, which might be one underlying process of the observed hump-shaped relationship between species diversity and elevation.

AB We conducted a meta-analysis to elucidate the role of experimental scale in field trials exploring the role of habitat diversifications on herbivore and predator abundance. Literature from a period of 18 years from 6 journals yielded a total of 25 predator and 41 herbivore abundance observations in experimental treatments with higher plant diversity compared to a control. These were divided into three size bins based on reported plot size. A clear pattern emerged for herbivore abundance whereby diversification experiments performed in small plots yielded a large negative effect on herbivores, intermediate sized plots showed an intermediate effect, and the largest plots exhibited a negligible effect. Predators were more abundant in medium sized diversified plots than in small ones, but, again, no effect could be discerned in the largest plots. These results suggest that past literature reviews and meta-analyses illustrating general trends of herbivore declines associated with increased vegetation diversity may be misleading. In particular, the effects of diversification appear to vary widely as a function of the spatial scale of vegetation plots. We speculate that effects of vegetation diversification may be enhanced when insects can move uninhibited among control and treatment plots in small scale experiments. In smaller plots herbivores may aggregate in the control plots that present a more concentrated resource, and generalist predators move to the more diverse habitat. At larger scales the ability of insects to "choose" between simple and diverse plots is diminished.

AB Selection experiments in the wild have greatly aided our understanding of how selection shapes phenotypic diversity in natural populations. However, these experiments have been hindered by the fact that the traits most important to adaptation and speciation may be fixed within populations. Experimental hybridization offers a means to circumvent this problem since crosses can be made between populations or species that differ for the trait of interest. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach, review results from published studies, and suggest strategies for future experiments. Advantages associated with this approach include the ability to "generate" variation for traits of interest, as well as the increased sensitivity of selection assays because of the wider range of trait values characteristic of segregating hybrids. Moreover, experimental hybridization can be extended to crosses between near-isogenic lines, allowing the effects of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to be dissected in a well-defined genetic background. Limitations include widespread linkage disequilibrium created by hybridization, possible cosegregation of hybrid incompatibilities, and the large number of variable traits likely to affect hybrid fitnesses. Even with these limitations, this basic approach has been remarkably successful. We now know, for example, that many morphological differences between divergent populations or species are under selection and that the selection gradients may be surprisingly large. Also, small genetic changes in premating barriers may have large effects on assortative mating. With respect to discussions about the role of hybridization in evolution, experiments indicate that some hybrid trait combinations may be advantageous, particularly when the hybrid populations are placed in a new environment. Future studies seem likely to combine selection measurements with genetic mapping of the QTLs underlying the selected traits. Natural hybrid zones hold particular promise for these kinds of studies because the only experimental manipulation required is, the removal of small amounts of tissue for genotyping.

ID AREA; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; STRATEGIES; GRADIENTS
AB Regularities in species richness are widely observed but controversy continues over its mechanistic explanation. Because richness patterns are usually a compound measure derived from taxonomically diverse species with different ecological requirements, these analyses may confound diverse causes of species numbers. Here we investigate species richness in the aquatic beetle fauna of Europe, separating major taxonomic groups and two major ecological types, species occurring in standing and running water bodies. We collated species distributions for 800 + species of water beetles in 15 regions across western Europe. Species number in any of these regions was related to three variables: total area size, geographic connectedness of the area, and latitude. Pooled species numbers were accurately predicted, but correlations were different for species associated with either running or standing water. The former were mostly correlated with latitude, while the latter were only correlated with the measure of connectedness or with area size. These differences were generally also observed in each of the four phylogenetically independent lineages of aquatic Coleoptera when analysed separately. We propose that effects of habitat, in this case possibly mediated by different long term persistence of running and standing water bodies, impose constraints at the population or local level which, if effective over larger temporal and spatial scales, determine global patterns of species richness.

AB The phytophagous insects that damage crops are often polyphagous, feeding on several types of crop and on weeds. The refuges constituted by noncrop host plants may be useful in managing the evolution in pest species of resistance to the Bacillus thuringiensis toxins produced by transgenic crops. However, the benefits of these refuges may be limited because host-plant diversity may drive genetic divergence and possibly even host-plant-mediated sympatric speciation. The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilatis Hubner (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is the main pest of maize in Europe and North America, where it was introduced early in the 20th century. It has a wide host range but feeds principally on mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). O. nubilalis is found on mugwort only in the northern part of France, whereas it is found on maize throughout France. The extent of genetic variation at allozyme markers was investigated in populations collected from the two host plants over the entire geographical distribution of the European corn borer on mugwort in France. Allelic differentiation between pairs of populations and hierarchical analyses of pools of samples from each host plant indicate that the group of populations feeding on maize differed from the group of populations feeding on mugwort. Our results suggest (1) host-plant-related divergent selection at the genomic region surrounding the Mpi locus and (2) limited gene flow between the populations feeding on mugwort and those infesting maize fields. These data indicate that adults emerging from mugwort would not be useful for managing the evolution of resistance to the B. thuringiensis toxins in European corn borer populations.

AB Recent studies suggest that black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and three-toed woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) might decrease in abundance because of habitat loss from fire suppression and short-rotation logging in landscapes managed for forestry. We examined black-backed and three-toed woodpecker occupancy of stands in a 2-year post-fire forest, mature and old-growth spruce and pine forests, and six post-fire coniferous forests of different ages. Three-toeds were detected in old stands and in the 2-year-old burn, and their probability of occupancy of burned forests decreased between 3 and 8 years post-fire. Within 50 km of the 2-year-old burn, black-backs were only detected in the burn and not in old-growth or mature conifer stands. However, they did occupy old coniferous stands located 75 and 150 km from the recent burn. They had a similar probability of occupying stands in the 3-, 4-, and 8-year-old burns but were not detected in the 16-year-old burn. The persistence of three-toed woodpeckers in boreal Alberta will likely depend on the presence of both old-growth and recently burned coniferous forests or forests with old-growth structural characteristics. Black-backed woodpeckers appear to be more burn dependent than three-toeds, and their long-term persistence may depend on the frequency of recently burned forests within their dispersal range.

AB The consequences for food-web structure of protecting marine communities from trawling have been little explored. We investigated the Gulf of Castellam-mare, northwest Sicily, where a trawl ban initiated in 1989 has led to great increases in the biomass of some target species. Using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, our objectives were to see if mean trophic level and omnivory had increased after the ban in three of the most common fishery-target species, namely, the anglerfish Lophius budegassa, Mediterranean hake Merluccius merluccius, and red mullet Mullus barbatus. We compared size data from before and after the fishery closure, but we also compared recently derived data from outside and inside the closed area. In all three species delta(13)C and delta(15)N were found to differ markedly depending on fish size. delta(13)C was found to decrease in L. budegassa and Merluccius merluccius but increase in Mullus barbatus with increasing fish length. delta(15)N increased in all three species, and this was thought to reflect feeding at increasingly higher trophic levels during the animals' lives. Mean length, and therefore delta(15)N-derived trophic level, increased after the trawl ban only in the anglertish L. budegassa. Based on delta(13)C and delta(15)N data, none of the species became more or less omnivorous after the ban. After 9 years of no trawling, increases in numerical abundance were not accompanied by substantial size-related trophodynamic shifts in any of the three species of fish studied.

AB This article overviews recent advances in studies of landscape-water quality relationships using remote sensing techniques. With the increasing feasibility of using remotely-sensed data, landscape-water quality studies can now be more easily performed on regional, multi-state scales. The traditional method of relating land use and land cover to water quality has been extended to include landscape pattern and other landscape information derived from satellite data. Three items are focused on in this article: 1) the increasing recognition of the importance of larger-scale studies of regional water quality that require a landscape perspective; 2) the increasing importance of remotely sensed data, such as the imagery-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and vegetation phenological metrics derived from time-series NDVI data; and 3) landscape pattern. In some studies, using landscape pattern metrics explained some of the variation in water quality not explained by land use/cover. However, in some other studies, the NDVI metrics were even more highly correlated to certain water quality parameters than either landscape pattern metrics or land use/cover proportions. Although studies relating landscape pattern metrics to water quality have had mixed results, this recent body of work applying these landscape measures and satellite-derived metrics to water quality analysis has demonstrated their potential usefulness in monitoring watershed conditions across large regions.

AB The evolution of primates is usually approached from the standpoint of adaptation and interspecific competition. However, climatic and eustatic changes associated with periodic glaciations have had a profound influence on their geographical distribution, favouring the intervention of contingency in evolution. This paper deals with the role of chance and competition in the dispersal and stocking of macaques in the islands of south-east Asia. The genus Macaca is unique among non-human primates for the range of habitats colonized, from continents to islands. We first review current knowledge about the zoogeography of macaques in Sundaland. We point out the inconsistencies present in the hypotheses thus far proposed to account for the colonization of shallow- and deep-water islands. We then propose a new perspective of macaque dispersal through the Indonesian archipelago, which takes into account sea-level changes, as well as latitudinal and altitudinal rainforest shifts following climatic cycles during the Quaternary. We envision three steps: (i) dispersal and partial disappearance of the first radiation of macaques; (ii) primary mainland recolonization by pigtailed and longtailed macaques; and (iii) secondary sea-rafting colonization by longtailed macaques. This model implies that liontailed, Sulawesi and Mentawai macaques stemmed from pre-glacial remnant populations, whereas pigtailed macaques originated in post-glacial populations that diverged later on. The model accounts for the distribution of long-tailed macaques throughout the Indonesian archipelago. The riverine habits of this species would have favoured its dispersal by sea rafting, which was otherwise extremely rare for other primate species. Stocking would have been successful for longtailed macaques only in islands where no other macaque competitors were already present.

AB Understanding the distribution and function of Arctic and boreal ecosystems under current conditions and their vulnerability to altered forcing is crucial to our assessment of future global environmental change. Such efforts can be facilitated by the development and application of ecological models that simulate realistic patterns of vegetation change at high latitudes. This paper reviews three classes of ecological models that have been implemented to extrapolate vegetation information in space (e.g. across the Arctic and adjacent domains) and over historical and future periods (e.g. under altered climate and other forcings). These are: (i) equilibrium biogeographical models; (ii) frame-based transient ecosystem models, and (iii) dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). The equilibrium response of high-latitude vegetation to scenarios of increased surface air temperatures projected by equilibrium biogeographical models is for tundra to be replaced by a northward shift of boreal woodland and forests. A frame-based model (ALFRESCO) indicates the same directional changes, but illustrates how response time depends on rate of temperature increase and concomitant changes in moisture regime and fire disturbance return period. Key disadvantages of the equilibrium models are that they do not simulate time-dependent responses of vegetation and the role of disturbance is omitted or highly generalized. Disadvantages of the frame-based models are that vegetation type is modelled as a set unit as opposed to an association of individually simulated plant functional types and that the role of ecosystem biogeochemistry in succession is not explicitly considered. DGVMs explicitly model disturbance (e.g. fire), operate on plant functional types, and incorporate constraints of nutrient availability on biomass production in the simulation of vegetation dynamics. Under changing climate, DGVMs detail conversion of tundra to tree-dominated boreal landscapes along with time-dependent responses of biomass, net primary production, and soil organic matter turnover-which all increase with warming. Key improvements to DGVMs that are needed to portray behaviour of arctic and boreal ecosystems adequately are the inclusion of anaerobic soil processes for inundated landscapes, permafrost dynamics, and moss-lichen layer biogeochemistry, as well as broader explicit accounting of disturbance regimes (including insect outbreaks and land management). Transient simulation of these landscapes can be further tailored to high-latitude processes and issues by spatially interactive, gridded application of arctic/boreal frame-based models and development of dynamic regional vegetation models (DRVMs) utilizing plant functional type schemes that capture the variety of high-latitude environments.

AB It has been suggested that the keystone-species concept should be dropped from ecology and conservation, primarily because the concept is poorly defined. This prompted Power et al. (1996) to refine the definition: keystone species have large effects on community structure or ecosystem function (i.e., high overall importance), and this effect should be large relative to abundance (ie., high community importance). Using prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) as an example, I review operational and conceptual difficulties encountered in applying this definition. As applied to prairie dogs, the implicit assumption that overall importance is a linear function of abundance is invalid. In addition, community importance is sensitive to abundance levels, the definition of community, and sampling scale. These problems arise largely from the equation for community importance, as used in conjunction with removal experiments at single abundance levels. I suggest that we shift from the current emphasis on the dualism between keystone and nonkeystone species and instead examine how overall and community importance vary (1) with abundance (2) across spatial and temporal scales, and (3) under diverse ecological conditions. In addition, I propose that a third criterion be incorporated into the definition: keystone species perform roles not performed by other species or processes. Examination of how these factors vary among populations of keystone species should help identify the factors contributing to, or limiting, keystone-level functions, thereby increasing the usefulness of the keystone-species concept in ecology and conservation. Although the quantitative framework of Power et al. falls short of being fully operational, my conceptual guidelines may improve the usefulness of the keystone-species concept. Careful attention to the factors that limit keystone function will help avoid misplaced emphasis on keystone species at the expense of other species.

AB Species responses to disturbance (mortality of dominant individuals within a community) influence many aspects of that ecological community. To trace the responses of vegetation to one particular type of disturbance, I sampled vegetation in 250 canopy gaps in 1976/1977, 1983, and 1990/1991. These gaps were located in three sites in the southern Appalachians of eastern North America: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Walker Cove Research Natural Area, and Joyce Kilmer Wilderness Area. Each gap was sampled thrice for sapling composition (stems greater than or equal to 1 cm in diameter at breast height). Additional measurements included the extension growth of border trees into the gap, recent mortality rates of border trees, deterioration rates of gas makers that had been standing dead in earlier samples, and the composition of understory plots.
   The mean extension (branch) growth of border trees was 12 cm/yr, with slower growth by longer branches. Gap makers that had been tall stumps tended to deteriorate, although 35% stayed intact over the 14 yr of the study. Border-tree mortality averaged 0.60%/yr, with higher rates for larger stems and with much interspecific variation.
   Stem density of saplings in gaps increased during the first sampling interval and decreased during the second as self-thinning counteracted increased establishment. Basal area increased during both sampling intervals. The death of border trees increased basal area per unit gap area.
   The four main species (Acer saccharum, Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia, and Halesia carolina) showed different patterns of correlation to gap size and age. Species in general showed more correlations with gap age for the first sample than afterwards; gap size was more consistently related to species importance. Species patterns also were affected by the presence or absence of border-tree mortality. The stands studied seem nearly at equilibrium. Some small changes are likely to occur, but the species present dominated all size classes: gap saplings, border trees, other canopy trees not related to gaps, and understory saplings. Species differed in their relative growth rates in the understory and in gaps of different sizes. Species also differed in their survival rates in the understory and in the canopy.

AB In the temperate zone, permanent-resident birds and mammals that do not hibernate must survive harsh winter conditions of low ambient temperature, long nights, and reduced food levels. To understand the energy management strategy of food-hoarding birds, it has been hypothesized that such birds respond to increased starvation risk by increasing the number of their hoards rather than by increasing their fat reserves and that they cache early in the day and retrieve their caches later to achieve fat reserves necessary to survive the night. We tested these hypotheses by observing the responses in captivity of a caching bird, the tufted titmouse (Parus bicolor), to the combined influences of reduced predictability of food and naturally occurring ambient temperature and photoperiod. When the food supply was unpredictable, birds significantly increased both internal fat reserves at dusk and external food caches. Initially leaner birds tended to increase their fat reserves to a greater extent and initially fatter birds tended to cache more food and to fly significantly less. Half the birds also increased their dawn and mean daily body mass. All birds tended to forage, gain body mass, and cache food at significantly lower rates in the morning and at significantly higher rates in the evening. Cache retrieval showed the opposite trend, with birds retrieving most of their caches in the morning. Our results do not support the hypothesis that caching birds increase caching rate but not body mass under an unpredictable food regime. Instead fat reserves and food caches are both important complementary sources of energy in food-hoarding birds. Energy management by wintering birds occurs in response to a number of biotic and abiotic factors acting simultaneously; thus future models must incorporate independent variables in addition to the state of the food supply and time of day.

AB 1 The relationship between short-term reproductive costs (indicated by changes in body mass, body condition and daily energy expenditure) and brood provisioning rates is explored using simple models and field observations and experiments on 10 bird species.
   2 Where sample sizes were large, energy expenditure could usually be shown to increase with higher rates of nest visiting. No significant trends were found in relation to the number of young in the brood.
   3 Energy expenditure was a linear function of brood provisioning rates in house martins, an accelerating function in blue-throated bee-eaters and perhaps a decelerating function in a third species, the pied kingfisher.
   4 The relationship between energy expenditure, mass changes and provisioning rates differed between the three main study species.
   5 Estimates of energy expenditure alone will usually be inadequate to indicate prospects for parental survival.

AB Ecologists have long studied patterns, directions and tempos of change, but there is a pressing need to extend current understanding to empirical observations of abrupt changes as climate warming accelerates. Abrupt changes in ecological systems (ACES)-changes that are fast in time or fast relative to their drivers-are ubiquitous and increasing in frequency. Powerful theoretical frameworks exist, yet applications in real-world landscapes to detect, explain and anticipate ACES have lagged. We highlight five insights emerging from empirical studies of ACES across diverse ecosystems: (i) ecological systems show ACES in some dimensions but not others; (ii) climate extremes may be more important than mean climate in generating ACES; (iii) interactions among multiple drivers often produce ACES; (iv) contingencies, such as ecological memory, frequency and sequence of disturbances, and spatial context are important; and (v) tipping points are often (but not always) associated with ACES. We suggest research priorities to advance understanding of ACES in the face of climate change. Progress in understanding ACES requires strong integration of scientific approaches (theory, observations, experiments and process-based models) and high-quality empirical data drawn from a diverse array of ecosystems. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'

AB Mycorrhizal fungi are critical members of the plant microbiome, forming a symbiosis with the roots of most plants on Earth. Most plant species partner with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi, and these symbioses are thought to represent plant adaptations to fast and slow soil nutrient cycling rates. This generates a second hypothesis, that arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal plant species traits complement and reinforce these fungal strategies, resulting in nutrient acquisitive vs. conservative plant trait profiles. Here we analyzed 17,764 species level trait observations from 2,940 woody plant species to show that mycorrhizal plants differ systematically in nitrogen and phosphorus economic traits. Differences were clearest in temperate latitudes, where ectomycorrhizal plant species are more nitrogen use- and phosphorus use-conservative than arbuscular mycorrhizal species. This difference is reflected in both aboveground and belowground plant traits and is robust to controlling for evolutionary history, nitrogen fixation ability, deciduousness, latitude, and species climate niche. Furthermore, mycorrhizal effects are large and frequently similar to or greater in magnitude than the influence of plant nitrogen fixation ability or deciduous vs. evergreen leaf habit. Ectomycorrhizal plants are also more nitrogen conservative than arbuscular plants in boreal and tropical ecosystems, although differences in phosphorus use are less apparent outside temperate latitudes. Our findings bolster current theories of ecosystems rooted in mycorrhizal ecology and support the hypothesis that plant mycorrhizal association is linked to the evolution of plant nutrient economic strategies.

AB Ecological niches reflect not only adaptation to local circumstances but also the tendency of related lineages to share environmental tolerances. As a result, information on phylogenetic relationships has underappreciated potential to inform ecological niche modeling. Here we review three strategies for incorporating evolutionary information into niche models: splitting lineages into subunits, lumping across lineages, and partial pooling of lineages into a common statistical framework that implicitly or explicitly accounts for evolutionary relationships. We challenge the default practice of modeling at the species level, which ignores the process of niche evolution and erroneously assumes that the species is always the appropriate level for niche estimation. Progress in the field requires reexamination of how we assess models of niches versus models of distributions.

AB Marine microbes have tremendous diversity, but a fundamental question remains unanswered: why are there so many microbial species in the sea? The idea of functional redundancy for microbial communities has long been assumed, so that the high level of richness is often explained by the presence of different taxa that are able to conduct the exact same set of metabolic processes and that can readily replace each other. Here, we refute the hypothesis of functional redundancy for marine microbial communities by showing that a shift in the community composition altered the overall functional attributes of communities across different temporal and spatial scales. Our metagenomic monitoring of a coastal northwestern Mediterranean site also revealed that diverse microbial communities harbor a high diversity of potential proteins. Working with all information given by the metagenomes (all reads) rather than relying only on known genes (annotated orthologous genes) was essential for revealing the similarity between taxonomic and functional community compositions. Our finding does not exclude the possibility for a partial redundancy where organisms that share some specific function can coexist when they differ in other ecological requirements. It demonstrates, however, that marine microbial diversity reflects a tremendous diversity of microbial metabolism and highlights the genetic potential yet to be discovered in an ocean of microbes.

AB The evolutionary relationships among the apicomplexan blood pathogens known as the malaria parasites (order Haemosporida), some of which infect nearly 200 million humans each year, has remained a vexing phylogenetic problem due to limitations in taxon sampling, character sampling and the extreme nucleotide base composition biases that are characteristic of this clade. Previous phylogenetic work on the malaria parasites has often lacked sufficient representation of the broad taxonomic diversity within the Haemosporida or the multi-locus sequence data needed to resolve deep evolutionary relationships, rendering our understanding of haemosporidian life-history evolution and the origin of the human malaria parasites incomplete. Here we present the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the malaria parasites conducted to date, using samples from a broad diversity of vertebrate hosts that includes numerous enigmatic and poorly known haemosporidian lineages in addition to genome-wide multi-locus sequence data. We find that if base composition differences were corrected for during phylogenetic analysis, we recovered a well-supported topology indicating that the evolutionary history of the malaria parasites was characterized by a complex series of transitions in life-history strategies and host usage. Notably we find that Plasmodium, the malaria parasite genus that includes the species of human medical concern, is polyphyletic with the life-history traits characteristic of this genus having evolved in a dynamic manner across the phylogeny. We find support for multiple instances of gain and loss of asexual proliferation in host blood cells and production of haemozoin pigment, two traits that have been used for taxonomic classification as well as considered to be important factors for parasite virulence and used as drug targets. Lastly, our analysis illustrates the need for a widespread reassessment of malaria parasite taxonomy.

AB Wildland fire is a critical process in forests of the western United States (US). Variation in fire behavior, which is heavily influenced by fuel loading, terrain, weather, and vegetation type, leads to heterogeneity in fire severity across landscapes. The relative influence of these factors in driving fire severity, however, is poorly understood. Here, we explore the drivers of high-severity fire for forested ecoregions in the western US over the period 2002-2015. Fire severity was quantified using a satellite-inferred index of severity, the relativized burn ratio. For each ecoregion, we used boosted regression trees to model high-severity fire as a function of live fuel, topography, climate, and fire weather. We found that live fuel, on average, was the most important factor driving high-severity fire among ecoregions (average relative influence = 53.1%) and was the most important factor in 14 of 19 ecoregions. Fire weather was the second most important factor among ecoregions (average relative influence = 22.9%) and was the most important factor in five ecoregions. Climate (13.7%) and topography (10.3%) were less influential. We also predicted the probability of high-severity fire, were a fire to occur, using recent (2016) satellite imagery to characterize live fuel for a subset of ecoregions in which the model skill was deemed acceptable (n = 13). These 'wall-to-wall' gridded ecoregional maps provide relevant and up-to-date information for scientists and managers who are tasked with managing fuel and wildland fire. Lastly, we provide an example of the predicted likelihood of high-severity fire under moderate and extreme fire weather before and after fuel reduction treatments, thereby demonstrating how our framework and model predictions can potentially serve as a performance metric for land management agencies tasked with reducing hazardous fuel across large landscapes.

AB Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef (GBR) continues to suffer from repeated impacts of cyclones, coral bleaching, and outbreaks of the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), losing much of its coral cover in the process. This raises the question of the ecosystem's systemic resilience and its ability to rebound after large-scale population loss. Here, we reveal that around 100 reefs of the GBR, or around 3%, have the ideal properties to facilitate recovery of disturbed areas, thereby imparting a level of systemic resilience and aiding its continued recovery. These reefs (1) are highly connected by ocean currents to the wider reef network, (2) have a relatively low risk of exposure to disturbances so that they are likely to provide replenishment when other reefs are depleted, and (3) have an ability to promote recovery of desirable species but are unlikely to either experience or spread COTS outbreaks. The great replenishment potential of these 'robust source reefs', which may supply 47% of the ecosystem in a single dispersal event, emerges from the interaction between oceanographic conditions and geographic location, a process that is likely to be repeated in other reef systems. Such natural resilience of reef systems will become increasingly important as the frequency of disturbances accelerates under climate change.

AB Aichi Target 11 (AT11), adopted by 193 Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010, states that protected areas (PAs) must be equitably managed by 2020. However, significant challenges remain in terms of actual implementation of equitable management in PAs. These challenges include, among others, the lack of a standardized approach to assess and monitor social equity and the difficulty of reducing social equity to a series of metrics. This perspective addresses these challenges and it proposes a minimum set of ten indicators for assessing and monitoring the three dimensions of social equity in protected areas: recognition, procedure and distribution. The indicators target information on social equity regarding cultural identity, statutory and customary rights, knowledge diversity; free, prior and informed consent mechanisms, full participation and transparency in decision-making, access to justice, accountability over decisions, distribution of conservation burdens, and sharing of conservation benefits. The proposed indicator system is a first step in advancing an approach to facilitate our understanding of how the different dimensions of social equity are denied or recognized in PAs globally. The proposed system would be used by practitioners to mainstream social equity indicators in PM assessments at the site level and to report to the CBD on the 'equitably managed' element of AT11.

AB We test the limits of the spider superfamily Araneoidea and reconstruct its interfamilial relationships using standard molecular markers. The taxon sample (363 terminals) comprises for the first time representatives of all araneoid families, including the first molecular data of the family Synaphridae. We use the resulting phylogenetic framework to study web evolution in araneoids. Araneoidea is monophyletic and sister to Nicodamoidea rank. n. Orbiculariae are not monophyletic and also include the RTA clade, Oecobiidae and Hersiliidae. Deinopoidea is paraphyletic with respect to a lineage that includes the RTA clade, Hersiliidae and Oecobiidae. The cribellate orb-weaving family Uloboridae is monophyletic and is sister group to a lineage that includes the RTA Clade, Hersiliidae and Oecobiidae. The monophyly of most Araneoidea families is well supported, with a few exceptions. Anapidae includes holarchaeids but the family remains diphyletic even if Holarchaea is considered an anapid. The orb-web is ancient, having evolved by the early Jurassic; a single origin of the orb with multiple losses is implied by our analyses. By the late Jurassic, the orb-web had already been transformed into different architectures, but the ancestors of the RTA clade probably built orb-webs. We also find further support for a single origin of the cribellum and multiple independent losses. The following taxonomic and nomenclatural changes are proposed: the cribellate and ecribellate nicodamids are grouped in the superfamily Nicodamoidea rank n. (Megadictynidae rank res. and Nicodamidae stat. n.). Araneoidea includes 17 families with the following changes: Araneidae is re-circumscribed to include nephilines, Nephilinae rank res., Arkyidae rank n., Physoglenidae rank n., Synotaxidae is limited to the genus Synotaxus, Pararchaeidae is a junior synonym of Malkaridae (syn. n.), Holarchaeidae of Anapidae (syn. n.) and Sinopimoidae of Linyphiidae (syn. n.).

AB Abrupt shifts in natural resources and their markets are a ubiquitous challenge to human communities. Building resilient social-ecological systems requires approaches that are robust to uncertainty and to regime shifts. Harvesting diverse portfolios of natural resources and adapting portfolios in response to change could stabilize economies reliant on natural resources and their markets, both of which are prone to unpredictable shifts. Here we use fisheries catch and revenue data from Alaskan fishing communities over 34 years to test whether diversification and turnover in the composition of fishing opportunities increased economic stability during major ocean and market regime shifts in 1989. More than 85% of communities show reduced fishing revenues following these regime shifts. However, communities with the highest portfolio diversity and those that could opportunistically shift the composition of resources they harvest, experienced negligible or even positive changes in revenue. Maintaining diversity in economic opportunities and enabling turnover facilitates sustainability of communities reliant on renewable resources facing uncertain futures.

AB Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives-either economic or social norms, or both-can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.

AB Synopsis When predicting the response of organisms to global change, models use measures of climate at a coarse resolution from general circulation models or from downscaled regional models. Organisms, however, do not experience climate at such large scales. The climate heterogeneity over a landscape and how much of that landscape an organism can sample will determine ultimately the microclimates experienced by organisms. This past few decades has seen an important increase in the number of studies reporting microclimatic patterns at small scales. This synthesis intends to unify studies reporting microclimatic heterogeneity (mostly temperature) at various spatial scales, to infer any emerging trends, and to discuss the causes and consequences of such heterogeneity for organismal performance and with respect to changing land use patterns and climate. First, we identify the environmental drivers of heterogeneity across the various spatial scales that are pertinent to ectotherms. The thermal heterogeneity at the local and micro-scales is mostly generated by the architecture or the geometrical features of the microhabitat. Then, the thermal heterogeneity experienced by individuals is modulated by behavior. Second, we survey the literature to quantify thermal heterogeneity from the micro-scale up to the scale of a landscape in natural habitats. Despite difficulties in compiling studies that differ much in their design and aims, we found that there is as much thermal heterogeneity across micro-, local and landscape scales, and that the temperature range is large in general (>9 degrees C on average, and up to 26 degrees C). Third, we examine the extent to which urban habitats can be used to infer the microclimatic patterns of the future. Urban areas generate globally drier and warmer microclimatic patterns and recent evidence suggest that thermal traits of ectotherms are adapted to them. Fourth, we explore the interplay between microclimate heterogeneity and the behavioral thermoregulatory abilities of ectotherms in setting their overall performance. We used a random walk framework to show that the thermal heterogeneity allows a more precise behavioral thermoregulation and a narrower temperature distribution of the ectotherm compared to less heterogeneous microhabitats. Finally, we discuss the potential impacts of global change on the fine scale mosaics of microclimates. The amplitude of change may differ between spatial scales. In heterogeneous microhabitats, the amplitude of change at micro-scale, caused by atmospheric warming, can be substantial while it can be limited at the local and landscape scales. We suggest that the warming signal will influence species performance and biotic interactions by modulating the mosaic of microclimates.

AB Humans are altering the distribution of species by changing the climate and disrupting biotic interactions and dispersal. A fundamental hypothesis in spatial ecology suggests that these effects are scale dependent; biotic interactions should shape distributions at local scales, whereas climate should dominate at regional scales. If so, common single-scale analyses might misestimate the impacts of anthropogenic modifications on biodiversity and the environment. However, large-scale datasets necessary to test these hypotheses have not been available until recently. Here we conduct a cross-continental, cross-scale (almost five orders of magnitude) analysis of the influence of biotic and abiotic processes and human population density on the distribution of three emerging pathogens: the amphibian chytrid fungus implicated in worldwide amphibian declines and West Nile virus and the bacterium that causes Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), which are responsible for ongoing human health crises. In all three systems, we show that biotic factors were significant predictors of pathogen distributions in multiple regression models only at local scales (similar to 10(2)-10(3) km(2)), whereas climate and human population density always were significant only at relatively larger, regional scales (usually > 10(4) km(2)). Spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed that biotic factors were more variable at smaller scales, whereas climatic factors were more variable at larger scales, as is consistent with the prediction that factors should be important at the scales at which they vary the most. Finally, no single scale could detect the importance of all three categories of processes. These results highlight that common single-scale analyses can misrepresent the true impact of anthropogenic modifications on biodiversity and the environment.

AB Aim To develop a standardized, quantitative method for mapping cumulative impacts of invasive alien species on marine ecosystems.
   Location The methodology is applied in the Mediterranean Sea but is widely applicable.
   Methods A conservative additive model was developed to account for the Cumulative IMPacts of invasive ALien species (CIMPAL) on marine ecosystems. According to this model, cumulative impact scores are estimated on the basis of the distributions of invasive species and ecosystems, and both the reported magnitude of ecological impacts and the strength of such evidence. In the Mediterranean Sea case study, the magnitude of impact was estimated for every combination of 60 invasive species and 13 habitats, for every 10 x 10 km cell of the basin. Invasive species were ranked based on their contribution to the cumulative impact score across the Mediterranean.
   Results The CIMPAL index showed strong spatial heterogeneity. Spatial patterns varied depending on the pathway of initial introduction of the invasive species in the Mediterranean Sea. Species introduced by shipping gave the highest impact scores and impacted a much larger area than those introduced by aquaculture and the Suez Canal. Overall, invasive macroalgae had the highest impact among all taxonomic groups. These results represent the current best estimate of the spatial variation in impacts of invasive alien species on ecosystems, in the Mediterranean Sea.
   Main Conclusions A framework for mapping cumulative impacts of invasive alien species was developed. The application of this framework in the Mediterranean Sea provided a baseline that can be built upon with future improved information. Such analysis allows the identification of hotspots of highly impacted areas, and prioritization of sites, pathways and species for management actions.

AB AimSpecies distribution modelling typically relies completely or partially on climatic variables as predictors, overlooking the fact that these are themselves predictions with associated uncertainties. This is particularly critical when such predictors are interpolated between sparse station data, such as in the tropics. The goal of this study is to provide a new set of satellite-based climatic predictor data and to evaluate its potential to improve modelled species-climate associations and transferability to novel geographical regions.
   LocationRain forests areas of Central Africa, the Western Ghats of India and South America.
   MethodsWe compared models calibrated on the widely used WorldClim station-interpolated climatic data with models where either temperature or precipitation data from WorldClim were replaced by data from CRU, MODIS, TRMM and CHIRPS. Each predictor set was used to model 451 plant species distributions. To test for chance associations, we devised a null model with which to compare the accuracy metric obtained for every species.
   ResultsFewer than half of the studied rain forest species distributions matched the climatic pattern better than did random distributions. The inclusion of MODIS temperature and CHIRPS precipitation estimates derived from remote sensing each allowed for a better than random fit for respectively 40% and 22% more species than models calibrated on WorldClim. Furthermore, their inclusion was positively related to a better transferability of models to novel regions.
   Main conclusionsWe provide a newly assembled dataset of ecologically meaningful variables derived from MODIS and CHIRPS for download, and provide a basis for choosing among the plethora of available climate datasets. We emphasize the need to consider the method used in the production of climate data when working on a region with sparse meteorological station data. In this context, remote sensing data should be the preferred choice, particularly when model transferability to novel climates or inferences on causality are invoked.

AB Soils are self-organized ecological systems within which organisms interact within a nested suite of discrete scales. Microorganisms form communities and physical structures at the smallest scale (microns), followed by the community of their predators organized in microfoodwebs (tens of microns), the functional domains built by ecosystem engineers (centimeters to meters), ecosystems, and landscapes. Ecosystem engineers, principally plant roots, earthworms, termites, and ants, play key roles in creating habitats for other organisms and controlling their activities through physical and biochemical processes. The biogenic, organic, and organomineral structures that they produce accumulate in the soil space to form three-dimensional mosaics of functional domains, inhabited by specific communities of smaller organisms (microfauna and mesofauna, microorganisms) that drive soil processes through specific pathways. Ecosystem engineers also produce signaling and energy-rich molecules that act as ecological mediators of biological engineering processes. Energy-rich ecological mediators may selectively activate microbial populations and trigger priming effects, resulting in the degradation, synthesis, and sequestration of specific organic substrates. Signaling molecules inform soil organisms of their producers' respective presences and change physiologies by modifying gene expression and through eliciting hormonal responses. Protection of plants against pests and diseases is largely achieved via these processes. At the highest scales, the delivery of ecosystem services emerges through the functioning of self-organized systems nested within each other. The integrity of the different subsystems at each scale and the quality of their interconnections are a precondition for an optimum and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services. Lastly, we present seven general research questions whose resolution will provide a firmer base for the proposed conceptual framework while offering new insights for sustainable use of the soil resource.

AB Sensitive and cost-effective indicators of aquatic ecosystem condition in Amazon streams are necessary to assess the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on those systems in a viable and ecologically meaningful manner. We conducted the present study in the municipality of Paragominas, state of Para, northern Brazil, where we sampled adult dragonflies in 50 100-m-long wadeable stream sites in 2011. We collected 1769 specimens represented by 11 families, 41 genera and 97 species. The suborder Zygoptera contributed 961 individuals and Anisoptera 808. Among the 97 recorded species, nine were classified as useful indicators of ecological condition, with four species being associated with more degraded streams (three Anisoptera, one Zygoptera) and five with more preserved streams (all were Zygoptera). Anisoptera (dragonflies) tend to provide more useful indicators of more degraded environments because they have more efficient homeostatic mechanisms and are more mobile, enabling them to tolerate a wider range of environmental conditions. By contrast, Zygoptera (damselflies) tend to provide a more useful role as indicators of more preserved environments and high levels of environmental heterogeneity because of their smaller body sizes and home ranges and greater ecophysiological restrictions. We conclude from our assessment of this low-order Amazonian stream system that (i) the occurrence of specific odonate species is strongly associated with the configuration of riparian vegetation, (ii) agricultural activities appear to be the main factor determining changes in the composition of odonate assemblages and (iii) these insects can act as useful indicators of the ecological consequences of riparian habitat loss and disturbance. Because generalist species invade moderately degraded areas, those areas may have high species richness but host few species of Zygoptera. Therefore, preserving dense riparian vegetation is necessary to maintain aquatic ecological condition, and that condition can be rehabilitated by planting new trees. Both require enforcing existing environmental regulations, various types of incentives and educating local communities.

AB The distribution of genomic variation across landscapes can provide insights into the complex interactions between the environment and the genome that influence the distribution of species, and mediate phenotypic adaptation to local conditions. High throughput sequencing technologies now offer unprecedented power to explore these interactions, allowing powerful inferences about historical processes of colonization, gene flow and divergence, as well as the identification of loci that mediate local adaptation. These landscape genomic' approaches have been validated in model species and are now being applied to nonmodel organisms, including foundation species that have substantial effects on ecosystem processes. Here we review the growing field of landscape genomics from a very broad perspective. In particular, we describe the inferential power that is gained by taking a genome-wide view of genetic variation, strategies for study design to best capture adaptive variation, and how to apply this information to practical challenges, such as restoration.

AB Plants interact with a diversity of microorganisms, and there is often concordance in their community structures. Because most community-level studies are observational, it is unclear if such concordance arises because of host specificity, in which microorganisms or plants limit each other's occurrence. Using a reciprocal transplant experiment, we tested the hypothesis that host specificity between trees and ectomycorrhizal fungi determines patterns of tree and fungal soil specialisation. Seedlings of 13 dipterocarp species with contrasting soil specialisationswereseeded into plots crossing soil type and canopy openness. Ectomycorrhizalcolonists were identified by DNA sequencing. After 2.5years, we found no evidence of host specificity. Rather, soil environment was the primary determinant of ectomycorrhizal diversity and composition on seedlings. Despite their close symbiosis, our results show that ectomycorrhizal fungi and tree communities in this Bornean rain forest assembleindependently of host-specific interactions, raising questions about howmutualism shapes the realised niche.

AB Various remote sensing-based terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) models have been developed during the past four decades. These models vary in conceptual and mathematical representations of the physics, consequently leading to different performances. Examination of uncertainties associated with limitations in model physics will be useful for model selection and improvement. Here, three dual-source remote sensing ET models (i. e., the Hybrid dual-source scheme and Trapezoid framework-based ET Model (HTEM), the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, and the MOD16 ET algorithm) using ASTER images were compared during the MUSOEXE-12 campaign in the Heihe River Basin in Northwest China, aiming to better understand the differences in model physics that potentially lead to differences in model performance. Model results were first compared against observations from a dense network of eddy covariance towers and isotope-based evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) partitioning. Results show that HTEM outperformed the other two models in simulating ET and its partitioning, whereas MOD16 performed worst (i. e., ET root-mean-square errors are 42.3 W/m(2) (HTEM), 49.8 W/m(2) (TSEB), and 95.3 W/m(2) (MOD16)). On to model limitations, HTEM tends to underestimate ET under high advection due mostly to the underestimation of temperatures for the wet edge in its trapezoidal space. For TSEB, large uncertainties occur in determining the initial Priestley-Taylor coefficient and the iteration procedure for ET partitioning, leading to overestimation/underestimation of T/E in most cases, particularly over sparse vegetation. Primary use of meteorological data for MOD16 does not effectively capture the soil moisture restriction on ET, and therefore results in unreasonable spatial ET patterns.

Although stand-level fire behavior models suggest that bark beetle-induced tree mortality increases flammability of stands by changing canopy and forest floor fuels, the actual effect of an MPB outbreak on subsequent wildfire activity remains widely debated. To address this knowledge gap, we superimposed areas burned on areas infested by MPBs for the three peak years of wildfire activity since 2002 across the western United States. Here, we show that the observed effect of MPB infestation on the area burned in years of extreme fire appears negligible at broad spatial extents. Contrary to the expectation of increased wildfire activity in recently infested red-stage stands, we found no difference between observed area and expected area burned in red-stage or subsequent gray-stage stands during three peak years of wildfire activity, which account for 46% of area burned during the 2002-2013 period. Although MPB infestation and fire activity both independently increased in conjunction with recent warming, our results demonstrate that the annual area burned in the western United States has not increased in direct response to bark beetle activity. Therefore, policy discussions should focus on societal adaptation to the effects of recent increases in wildfire activity related to increased drought severity.

TI Effects of Spring Temperatures on the Strength of Selection on Timing of

AB Climate change has differentially affected the timing of seasonal events for interacting trophic levels, and this has often led to increased selection on seasonal timing. Yet, the environmental variables driving this selection have rarely been identified, limiting our ability to predict future ecological impacts of climate change. Using a dataset spanning 31 years from a natural population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), we show that directional selection on timing of reproduction intensified in the first two decades (1980-2000) but weakened during the last decade (2001-2010). Against expectation, this pattern could not be explained by the temporal variation in the phenological mismatch with food abundance. We therefore explored an alternative hypothesis that selection on timing was affected by conditions individuals experience when arriving in spring at the breeding grounds: arriving early in cold conditions may reduce survival. First, we show that in female recruits, spring arrival date in the first breeding year correlates positively with hatch date; hence, early-hatched individuals experience colder conditions at arrival than late-hatched individuals. Second, we show that when temperatures at arrival in the recruitment year were high, early-hatched young had a higher recruitment probability than when temperatures were low. We interpret this as a potential cost of arriving early in colder years, and climate warming may have reduced this cost. We thus show that higher temperatures in the arrival year of recruits were associated with stronger selection for early reproduction in the years these birds were born. As arrival temperatures in the beginning of the study increased, but recently declined again, directional selection on timing of reproduction showed a nonlinear change. We demonstrate that environmental conditions with a lag of up to two years can alter selection on phenological traits in natural populations, something that has important implications for our understanding of how climate can alter patterns of selection in natural populations.

AB AimAlthough all five of the major mediterranean-climate ecosystems (MCEs) of the world are recognized as loci of high plant species diversity and endemism, they show considerable variation in regional-scale richness. Here, we assess the role of stable Pleistocene climate and Cenozoic topography in explaining variation in regional richness of the globe's MCEs. We hypothesize that older, more climatically stable MCEs would support more species, because they have had more time for species to accumulate than MCEs that were historically subject to greater topographic upheavals and fluctuating climates.
   LocationSouth-western Africa (Cape), south-western Australia, California, central Chile and the eastern (Greece) and western (Spain) Mediterranean Basin.
   MethodsWe estimated plant diversity for each MCE as the intercepts of species-area curves that are homogeneous in slope across all regions. We used two down-scaled global circulation models of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to quantify climate stability by comparing the change in the location of MCEs between the LGM and present. We quantified the Cenozoic topographic stability of each MCE by comparing contemporary topographic profiles with those present in the late Oligocene and the early Pliocene.
   ResultsThe most diverse MCEs - Cape and Australia - had the highest Cenozoic environmental stability, and the least diverse - Chile and California - had the lowest stability.
   Main conclusionsVariation in plant diversity in MCEs is likely to be a consequence not of differences in diversification rates, but rather the persistence of numerous pre-Pliocene clades in the more stable MCEs. The extraordinary plant diversity of the Cape is a consequence of the combined effects of both mature and recent radiations, the latter associated with increased habitat heterogeneity produced by mild tectonic uplift in the Neogene.

AB Life history varies across latitudes, with the pace of life' being slower' in tropical regions. Because life history is coupled to energy metabolism via allocation tradeoffs and links between performance capacity and energy use, low metabolic intensity is expected in tropical animals. Low metabolism has been reported for lowland tropical birds, but it is unclear if this is due to slow' life history or to a warm, stable environment. We measured basal metabolic rates (BMR) of 253 bird species across a 26km altitude gradient in Peru. We predicted higher BMR at high altitude due to lower temperatures leading to elevated thermoregulatory costs. We also tested for BMR differences between widely separated tropical regions (Peru and Panama), and between tropical- and temperate-breeding birds. We found no effect of altitude on BMR in Peruvian species and no difference in BMR between Peruvian and Panamanian birds, suggesting that BMR in Neotropical birds is consistent and independent of environmental temperature. In a data set encompassing more than 500 species, tropical birds had significantly lower BMR than temperate-breeding birds. In contrast to several recent analyses, we found higher BMR in passerine birds than in non-passerines, independent of breeding latitude. Breeding latitude affects BMR, but diversity in avian life history within and between temperate and tropical regions may explain some of the residual variation in BMR after accounting for body mass and breeding latitude. Future studies of links between life history, metabolism and environmental factors might benefit from examining these variables within individual species as well as across broad geographic contrasts.

AB The carbon storage potential of terrestrial ecosystems depends in part on how atmospheric conditions influence the type and amount of surface radiation available for photosynthesis. Diffuse light, resulting from interactions between incident solar radiation and atmospheric aerosols and clouds, has been postulated to increase carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the magnitude of the diffuse light effect is unclear because existing studies use different methods to derive above-canopy diffuse light conditions. We used site-based, above-canopy measurements of diffuse light and gross primary productivity (GPP) from 10 temperate ecosystems (including mixed conifer forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, and croplands) to quantify the GPP variation explained by diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and to calculate increases in GPP as a function of diffuse light. Our analyses show that diffuse PAR explained up to 41% of variation in GPP in croplands and up to 17% in forests, independent of direct light levels. Carbon enhancement rates in response to diffuse PAR (calculated after accounting for vapor pressure deficit and air temperature) were also higher in croplands (0.011-0.050 mu mol CO2 per kmol photons of diffuse PAR) than in forests (0.003-0.018 mu mol CO2 per kmol photons of diffuse PAR). The amount of variation in GPP and carbon enhancement rate both differed with solar zenith angle and across sites for the same plant functional type. At crop sites, diffuse PAR had the strongest influence and the largest carbon enhancement rate during early mornings and late afternoons when zenith angles were large, with greater enhancement in the afternoons. In forests, diffuse PAR had the strongest influence at small zenith angles, but the largest carbon enhancement rate at large zenith angles, with a trend in ecosystem-specific responses. These results highlight the influence of zenith angle and the role of plant community composition in modifying diffuse light enhancement in terrestrial ecosystems, which will be important in scaling this effect from individual sites to the globe.

AB There is an urgent need to understand species and community responses to climatic and ecological changes to predict biodiversity patterns given anticipated global change. The current distribution of species and the environment provide a limited perspective to study and predict ecological responses; therefore, biodiversitv responses to past environmental changes must be examined The rapid development of ecological niche models (ENMs) and their use in reconstructing past species distributions has facilitated inclusion of past observations into predictive models. Paleodata offer an opportunity to test the predictive ability of ENMs and their underlying assumptions. However, paleodata remain underutilized despite the rapidly growing field of paleoinformatics. New modeling methods that incorporate species associations, coupled with paleodata, provide more robust approaches to studying species and community responses, especially given the predicted emergence of no-analog climates and communities in the future.

AB Current carbon cycle-climate models predict that future soil carbon storage will be determined by the balance between CO2 fertilization and warming. However, it is uncertain whether greater carbon inputs to soils with elevated CO2 will be sequestered, particularly since warming hastens soil carbon decomposition rates, and may alter the response of soils to new plant inputs. We studied the effects of elevated CO2 and warming on microbial soil carbon decomposition processes using laboratory manipulations of carbon inputs and soil temperature. We incubated soils from the Aspen Free Air CO2 Enrichment experiment, where no accumulation of soil carbon has been observed despite a decade of increased carbon inputs to soils under elevated CO2. We added isotopically-labeled sucrose to these soils in the laboratory to mimic and trace the effects of increased carbon inputs on soil organic carbon decomposition and its temperature sensitivity. Sucrose additions caused a positive priming of soil organic carbon decomposition, demonstrated by increased respiration derived from soil carbon, increased microbial abundance, and a shift in the microbial community towards faster growing microorganisms. Similar patterns were observed for elevated CO2 soils, suggesting that the priming effect was responsible for reductions in soil carbon accumulation at the site. Laboratory warming accelerated the rate of the priming effect, but the magnitude of the priming effect was not different amongst temperatures, suggesting that the priming effect was limited by substrate availability, not soil temperature. No changes in substrate use efficiency were observed with elevated CO2 or warming. The stimulatory effects of warming on the priming effect suggest that increased belowground carbon inputs from CO2 fertilization are not likely to be stored in mineral soils. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Theoretical models predict strong influences of habitat loss and fragmentation on species distributions and demography, but empirical studies have shown relatively inconsistent support across species and systems. We argue that species' responses to landscape-scale habitat loss and fragmentation are likely to appear less idiosyncratic if it is recognized that species perceive the same landscapes in different ways. We present a new quantitative approach that uses species distribution models (SDMs) to measure landscapes (e. g. patch size, isolation, matrix amount) from the perspective of individual species. First, we briefly summarize the few efforts to date demonstrating that once differences in habitat distributions are controlled, consistencies in species' responses to landscape structure emerge. Second, we present a detailed example providing step-by-step methods for application of a species-centered approach using freely available land-cover data and recent statistical modeling approaches. Third, we discuss pitfalls in current applications of the approach and recommend avenues for future developments. We conclude that the species-centered approach offers considerable promise as a means to test whether sensitivity to habitat loss and fragmentation is mediated by phylogenetic, ecological, and life-history traits. Cross-species generalities in responses to habitat loss and fragmentation will be challenging to uncover unless landscape mosaics are defined using models that reflect differing species-specific distributions, functional connectivity, and domains of scale. The emergence of such generalities would not only enhance scientific understanding of biotic processes driving fragmentation effects, but would allow managers to estimate species sensitivities in new regions.

AB This paper scrutinises the use of ecosystem service valuation for marine planning. Lessons are drawn from the development and use of environmental valuation and cost-benefit analysis for policy-making in the US and the UK. Current approaches to marine planning in both countries are presented and the role that ecosystem service valuation could play in this context is outlined. This includes highlighting the steps in the marine planning process where valuation can inform marine planning and policy-making as well as a discussion of methodological challenges to ecosystem service valuation techniques in the context of marine planning. Recommendations to overcome existing barriers are offered based on the synergies and the thinking in the two countries regarding the application of ecosystem service valuation to marine planning.

AB Questions
   How have the historical frequency and severity of natural disturbances in primary Picea abies forests varied at the forest stand and landscape level during recent centuries? Is there a relationship between physiographic attributes and historical patterns of disturbance severity in this system?
   Location
   Primary P.abies forests of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains, Romania; a region thought to hold the largest concentration of primary P.abies forests in Europe's temperate zone.
   Methods
   We used dendrochronological methods applied to many plots over a large area (132 plots representing six stands in two landscapes), thereby providing information at both stand and landscape levels. Evidence of past canopy disturbance was derived from two patterns of radial growth: (1) abrupt, sustained increases in growth (releases) and (2) rapid early growth rates (gap recruitment). These methods were augmented with non-metric multidimensional scaling to facilitate the interpretation of factors influencing past disturbance.
   Results
   Of the two growth pattern criteria used to assess past disturbance, gap recruitment was the most common, representing 80% of disturbance evidence overall. Disturbance severities varied over the landscape, including stand-replacing events, as well as low- and intermediate-severity disturbances. More than half of the study plots experienced extreme-severity disturbances at the plot level, although they were not always synchronized across stands and landscapes. Plots indicating high-severity disturbances were often spatially clustered (indicating disturbances up to 20ha), while this tendency was less clear for low- and moderate-severity disturbances. Physiographic attributes such as altitude and land form were only weakly correlated with disturbance severity. Historical documents suggest windstorms as the primary disturbance agent, while the role of bark beetles (Ips typographus) remains unclear.
   Conclusions
   The historical disturbance regime revealed in this multi-scale study is characterized by considerable spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which could be seen among plots within stands, among stands within landscapes and between the two landscapes. When the disturbance regime was evaluated at these larger scales, the entire range of disturbance severity was revealed within this landscape.

AB Global change presents risks and opportunities for social-ecological systems worldwide. Key challenges for sustainability science are to identify plausible future changes in social-ecological systems and find ways to reach socially and environmentally desirable conditions. In this context, regional-scale studies are important, but to date, many such studies have focused on a narrow set of issues or applied a narrow set of tools. Here, we present a holistic approach to work through the complexity posed by cross-scale interactions, spatial heterogeneity, and multiple uncertainties facing regional social-ecological systems. Our approach is spatially explicit and involves assessments of social conditions and natural capital bundles, social-ecological system dynamics, and current development trends. The resulting understanding is used in combination with scenario planning to map how current development trends might be amplified or dampened in the future. We illustrate this approach via a detailed case study in southern Transylvania, Romania, one of Europe's most significant biocultural refugia. Our goal was to understand current social-ecological dynamics and assess risks and opportunities for sustainable development. Our findings show that historical events have strongly shaped current conditions and current development trends in southern Transylvania. Moreover, although external drivers (including EU policies) set the general direction of regional development trajectories, local factors, including education, leadership, and the presence of bridging organizations, can enhance or counteract their effects. Our holistic approach was useful for generating an in-depth understanding of a regional social-ecological system and could be transferred to other parts of the world.

AB In forest ecosystems, plant communities shape soil fungal communities through the provisioning of carbon. Although the variation in forest composition with latitude is well established, little is known about how soil fungal communities vary with latitude. We collected soil samples from 17 forests, along a latitudinal transect in western China. Forest types covered included boreal, temperate, subtropical and tropical forests. We used 454 pyrosequencing techniques to analyze the soil communities. These data were correlated with abiotic and biotic variables to determine which factors most strongly influenced fungal community composition. Our results indicated that temperature, latitude, and plant diversity most strongly influence soil fungal community composition. Fungal diversity patterns were unimodal, with temperate forests (mid latitude) exhibiting the greatest diversity. Furthermore, these diversity patterns indicate that fungal diversity was highest in the forest systems with the lowest tree diversity (temperate forests). Different forest systems were dominated by different fungal subgroups, ectomycorrhizal fungi dominated in boreal and temperate forests; endomycorrhizal fungi dominated in the tropical rainforests, and non-mycorrhizal fungi were best represented in subtropical forests. Our results suggest that soil fungal communities are strongly dependent on vegetation type, with fungal diversity displaying an inverse relationship to plant diversity.

AB Relationships among multilocus genetic variation, geography, and environment can reveal how evolutionary processes affect genomes. We examined the evolution of an Australian bird, the eastern yellow robin Eopsaltria australis, using mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (nDNA) genetic markers, and bioclimatic variables. In southeastern Australia, two divergent mtDNA lineages occur east and west of the Great Dividing Range, perpendicular to latitudinal nDNA structure. We evaluated alternative scenarios to explain this striking discordance in landscape genetic patterning. Stochastic mtDNA lineage sorting can be rejected because the mtDNA lineages are essentially distinct geographically for > 1500 km. Vicariance is unlikely: the Great Dividing Range is neither a current barrier nor was it at the Last Glacial Maximum according to species distribution modeling; nuclear gene flow inferred from coalescent analysis affirms this. Female philopatry contradicts known female-biased dispersal. Contrasting mtDNA and nDNA demographies indicate their evolutionary histories are decoupled. Distance-based redundancy analysis, in which environmental temperatures explain mtDNA variance above that explained by geographic position and isolation-by-distance, favors a nonneutral explanation for mitochondrial phylogeographic patterning. Thus, observed mito-nuclear discordance accords with environmental selection on a female-linked trait, such as mtDNA, mtDNA-nDNA interactions or genes on W-chromosome, driving mitochondrial divergence in the presence of nuclear gene flow.

ID PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT;
   RESPONSES; ECOLOGY
AB Conservation efforts to better understand how wildlife populations respond to environmental change and anthropogenic disturbance has led to a proliferation of research examining physiological indicators of stress response in wildlife. Glucocorticoid stress hormones (GCs), typically cortisol and corticosterone, are among the most frequently measured indicators of the vertebrate stress response. To review the current state of research on stress physiology of free-ranging animals and its application to conservation, we canvassed more than 1000 articles on GC measures in wildlife published since 1969. For 454 studies published since 1990, we assessed the most commonly analysed correlates and disturbances and conducted a meta-analysis on commonly studied species. We noted a prominent divide in the legacies of fish-related analyses and those of higher order vertebrates and the need and opportunity to transfer knowledge between fields. Fish studies most frequently measured physiological indicators, condition, and the relationship between stress and mortality, whereas other vertebrate studies most frequently measured reproduction, condition, and environmental correlates. Correlates that significantly influenced GC levels across all vertebrate groups and are thus important to control for in study design and analyses include density and dispersal of conspecifics, season, reproductive status, and social status. Consistent trends across commonly studied species included positive GC response to capture and handling, reduced GC response related to acclimation, and a lack of correlation between condition and baseline GC levels. Our synthesis within and across diverse taxonomic orders reveals substantial research coverage but a lack of depth in multivariate analyses and a disparity in how correlates are controlled. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of correlates and disturbances that influence GC measures and, as such, has useful applications to assist conservation physiologists in study design, analysis, and interpretation.

TI Occluded C in rice phytoliths: implications to biogeochemical carbon
   sequestration
SO PLANT AND SOIL
LA English
DT Article

ID SILICON; CHINA; OPAL; IMPACT; LAND
AB Carbon (C) bio-sequestration within the phytoliths of plants, a mechanism of long-term biogeochemical C sequestration, may play a major role in the global C cycle and climate change. In this study, we explored the potential of C bio-sequestration within phytoliths produced in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), a well known silicon accumulator.
   The rice phytolith extraction was undertaken with microwave digestion procedures and the determination of occluded C in phytoliths was based on dissolution methods of phytolith-Si.
   Chemical analysis indicates that the phytolith-occluded C (PhytOC) contents of the different organs (leaf, stem, sheath and grains) on a dry weight basis in 5 rice cultivars range from 0.4 mg g(-1) to 2.8 mg g(-1), and the C content of phytoliths from grains is much lower than that of leaf, stem and sheath. The data also show that the PhytOC content of rice depends on both the content of phytoliths and the efficiency of C occlusion within phytoliths during rice growth. The biogeochemical C sequestration flux of phytoliths in 5 rice cultivars is approximately 0.03-0.13 Mg of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents (Mg-e-CO2) ha(-1) year(-1). From 1950 to 2010, about 2.37 x 10(8) Mg of CO2 equivalents might have been sequestrated within the rice phytoliths in China. Assuming a maximum phytoliths C bio-sequestration flux of 0.13 Mg-e-CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), the global annual potential rate of CO2 sequestrated in rice phytoliths would approximately be 1.94 x 10(7) Mg.
   Therefore rice crops may play a significant role in long-term C sequestration through the formation of PhytOC.

AB Climate change poses significant threats to biodiversity, but some species may be able to escape its effects in small locations with unusual and stable climates (microrefugia). However, there are still great uncertainties about where microrefugia are located, and the exact role that moisture plays in buffering extreme temperatures. In this study we quantified the effects of moisture on the distribution and variability of near-surface soil and air temperatures. We collected hourly 1 cm soil and 5 cm air temperatures and humidities at 111 sites from May 2011 to March 2012. Sites were diverse in terms of elevation (2-1428 m), distance from coast (180 m-403 km), canopy cover (0-100%), topographic exposure, and susceptibility to cold air drainage. We found that variability (diurnal range) of both soil and air temperatures decreased under moister conditions. While air temperatures were related more strongly to humidity, soil temperatures were related more to vapour pressure deficit (VPD). That is, both high temperature and low humidity were required before the VPD was sufficient to dry out the soil and allow soil temperatures to vary. We then used a regional regression approach to model the spatial distribution of minimum and maximum air and soil temperatures for each day over the 10 months in terms of latitude, elevation, canopy cover, distance to coast, cold air drainage potential, and topographic exposure to the south and northwest. We found that elevation was the dominant factor explaining the distribution of soil and air temperatures under moist conditions. Other factors, such as canopy cover and topographic exposure, had a stronger influence on air temperatures whenever humidity was low. However, these factors only affected soil temperatures at times when higher temperatures combined with low humidity to produce higher VPD. Our results provide new insights into how moisture influences the spatial distribution of near-surface soil and air temperatures. Microrefugia will be more apparent under drier conditions, but climate change may affect refugia for soil and air temperatures differently. Higher temperatures will cause VPD to increase more than would be expected by any change in humidity, and refugia in terms of soil temperatures may therefore become increasingly apparent.

AB Green space is an important component of the urban landscape, providing ecosystem services for city dwellers and supporting biodiversity. In many Gities, green space is concentrated in large areas, while the rest is dispersed in small patches like pocket parks, gardens or street trees. Such small-scale green space is often the target of greening initiatives but little is known about their value for supporting and conserving biodiversity. To assess the value of such initiatives for biodiversity, we used birds as an indicator. We examined bird communities at small greening projects (n = 12), nearby randomly chosen urban sites (n = 12), and large parks (n = 6) in Boston, MA, in relationship to underlying landscape patterns. Our results show that large parks harbor a distinct and rich bird community. The other sites, regardless of the presence of greening projects, were very similar to each other. However, most sites with greening projects had higher species richness than the random urban site in their vicinity. The main factor associated with this appears to be the patch size of green space and to a lesser extent, tree cavities. Even small increases of a few hundred square meters were associated with an increase in bird richness. Having more trees with cavities was also beneficial for species richness. Small greening projects appear to be most valuable for urban biodiversity if they target preserving, increasing and connecting existing green space. This may represent a tradeoff with environmental justice criteria for new green space. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, likelihood-based approaches have been used with increasing frequency to evaluate macroevolutionary hypotheses of phenotypic evolution under distinct evolutionary processes in a phylogenetic context (e.g., Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, etc.), and to compare one or more evolutionary rates for the same phenotypic trait along a phylogeny. It is also of interest to determine whether one trait evolves at a faster rate than another trait. However, to date no study has compared phylogenetic evolutionary rates between traits using likelihood, because a formal approach has not yet been proposed. In this article, I describe a new likelihood procedure for comparing evolutionary rates for two or more phenotypic traits on a phylogeny. This approach compares the likelihood of a model where each trait evolves at a distinct evolutionary rate to the likelihood of a model where all traits are constrained to evolve at a common evolutionary rate. The method can also account for within-species measurement error and within-species trait covariation if available. Simulations revealed that the method has appropriate Type I error rates and statistical power. Importantly, when compared with existing approaches based on phylogenetically independent contrasts and methods that compare confidence intervals for model parameters, the likelihood method displays preferable statistical properties for a wide range of simulated conditions. Thus, this likelihood-based method extends the phylogenetic comparative biology toolkit and provides evolutionary biologists with a more powerful means of determining when evolutionary rates differ between phenotypic traits. Finally, I provide an empirical example illustrating the approach by comparing rates of evolution for several phenotypic traits in Plethodon salamanders.

AB To understand how researchers are tackling globally important issues, it is crucial to identify whether current research is comprehensive enough to make substantive predictions about general responses. We examined how research on climate change affecting insects is being assessed, what factors are being tested and the localities of studies, from 1703 papers published between 1985 and August 2012. Most published research (64%) is generated from Europe and North America and being dedicated to core data analysis, with 29% of the studies analysed dedicated to Lepidoptera and 22% Diptera: which are well above their contribution to the currently identified insect species richness (estimated at 13% and 17% respectively). Research publications on Coleoptera fall well short of their proportional contribution (19% of publications but 39% of insect species identified), and to a lesser extent so do Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera. Species specific responses to changes in temperature by assessing distribution/range shifts or changes in abundance were the most commonly used methods of assessing the impact of climate change on insects. Research on insects and climate change to date is dominated by manuscripts assessing butterflies in Europe, insects of economic and/or environmental concern in forestry, agriculture, and model organisms. The research on understanding how insects will respond to a rapidly changing climate is still in its infancy, but the current trends of publications give a good basis for how we are attempting to assess insect responses. In particular, there is a crucial need for broader studies of ecological, behavioural, physiological and life history responses to be addressed across a greater range of geographic locations, particularly Asia, Africa and Australasia, and in areas of high human population growth and habitat modification. It is still too early in our understanding of taxa responses to climate change to know if charismatic taxa, such as butterflies, or disease vectors, including Diptera, can be used as keystone taxa to generalise other insect responses to climate change. This is critical as the basic biology of most species is still poorly known, and dominant, well studied taxa may show variable responses to climate change across their distribution due to regional biotic and abiotic influences. Indeed identifying if insect responses to climate change can be generalised using phylogeny, functional traits, or functional groups, or will populations and species exhibit idiosyncratic responses, should be a key priority for future research.

ID COMMUNITY RESILIENCE
AB Vulnerability studies have evolved significantly in recent decades. Although not overly theoretical compared with some other fields of science, some important conceptual progress has been made. At the practical level, vulnerability indicators have been used either at a generic level or for particular hazard contexts. However, these indicators are often predictably too narrow in their coverage of aspects of vulnerability. An important need remains to produce more conceptually informed vulnerability indicators or parameters and more satisfactory operational tools to assess weaknesses and resilience in coping with natural risks. In this paper, we present the methodology developed in the context of a recently concluded EU funded project, ENSURE (Enhancing resilience of communities and territories facing natural and na-tech hazards). The resulting vulnerability and resilience assessment framework tool adopts a systemic approach embedding and integrating as much as possible the multifaceted and articulated nature of concepts such as vulnerability and resilience. The tool guides evaluators towards a comprehensive and context-related understanding of strengths and fragilities of a given territory and community with respect to natural extremes. In this paper, both the framework tool and its application to Sondrio in Italy, which is exposed to flash floods, are presented and discussed. The merits and demerits of the new tool are discussed, and the results of the application to Sondrio indicate where data are currently missing, suggesting the kind of data, which will need to be gathered in future to achieve more complete assessments. The results also suggest vulnerability reduction policies and actions and further ways of revising the existing framework tool in the future.

AB A detailed understanding of the influence of temperature on soil microbial activity is critical to predict future atmospheric CO2 concentrations and feedbacks to anthropogenic warming. We investigated soils exposed to 3-4 years of continuous 5 degrees C-warming in a field experiment in a temperate forest. We found that an index for the temperature adaptation of the microbial community, T-min for bacterial growth, increased by 0.19 degrees C per 1 degrees C rise in temperature, showing a community shift towards one adapted to higher temperature with a higher temperature sensitivity (Q(10(5-15 degrees C)) increased by 0.08 units per 1 degrees C). Using continuously measured temperature data from the field experiment we modelled in situ bacterial growth. Assuming that warming did not affect resource availability, bacterial growth was modelled to become 60% higher in warmed compared to the control plots, with the effect of temperature adaptation of the community only having a small effect on overall bacterial growth (<5%). However, 3 years of warming decreased bacterial growth, most likely due to substrate depletion because of the initially higher growth in warmed plots. When this was factored in, the result was similar rates of modelled in situ bacterial growth in warmed and control plots after 3 years, despite the temperature difference. We conclude that although temperature adaptation for bacterial growth to higher temperatures was detectable, its influence on annual bacterial growth was minor, and overshadowed by the direct temperature effect on growth rates.

AB Plant invasions can have substantial consequences for the soil ecosystem, altering microbial community structure and nutrient cycling. However, relatively little is known about what drives these changes, making it difficult to predict the effects of future invasions. In addition, because most studies compare soils from uninvaded areas to long-established dense invasions, little is known about the temporal dependence of invasion impacts. We experimentally manipulated forest understory vegetation in replicated sites dominated either by exotic Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii), native Viburnums, or native Vacciniums, so that each vegetation type was present in each site-type. We compared the short-term effect of vegetation changes to the lingering legacy effects of the previous vegetation type by measuring soil microbial community structure (phospholipid fatty acids) and function (extracellular enzymes and nitrogen mineralization). We also replaced the aboveground litter in half of each plot with an inert substitute to determine if changes in the soil microbial community were driven by aboveground or belowground plant inputs. We found that after 2 years, the microbial community structure and function was largely determined by the legacy effect of the previous vegetation type, and was not affected by the current vegetation. Aboveground litter removal had only weak effects, suggesting that changes in the soil microbial community and nutrient cycling were driven largely by belowground processes. These results suggest that changes in the soil following either invasion or restoration do not occur quickly, but rather exhibit long-lasting legacy effects from previous belowground plant inputs.

AB Intentional or accidental introduction of species to new locations is predicted to result in loss of genetic variation and increase the likelihood of inbreeding, thus reducing population viability and evolutionary potential. However, multiple introductions and large founder numbers can prevent loss of genetic diversity and may therefore facilitate establishment success and range expansion. Based on a meta-analysis of 119 introductions of 85 species of plants and animals, we here show a quantitative effect of founding history on genetic diversity in introduced populations. Both introduction of large number of individuals and multiple introduction events significantly contribute to maintaining or even increasing genetic diversity in introduced populations. The most consistent loss of genetic diversity is seen in insects and mammals, whereas introduced plant populations tend to have higher genetic variation than native populations. However, loss or gain of genetic diversity does not explain variation in the extent to which plant or animal populations become invasive outside of their native range. These results provide strong support for predictions from population genetics theory with respect to patterns of genetic diversity in introduced populations, but suggest that invasiveness is not limited by genetic bottlenecks.

AB During sexual imprinting, offspring learn parental phenotypes and then select mates who are similar to their parents. Imprinting has been thought to contribute to the process of speciation in only a few rare cases; this is despite imprinting's potential to generate assortative mating and solve the problem of recombination in ecological speciation. If offspring imprint on parental traits under divergent selection, these traits will then be involved in both adaptation and mate preference. Such 'magic traits' easily generate sexual isolation and facilitate speciation. In this study, we show that imprinting occurs in two ecologically divergent stickleback species (benthics and limnetics: Gasterosteus spp.). Cross-fostered females preferred mates of their foster father's species. Furthermore, imprinting is essential for sexual isolation between species; isolation was reduced when females were raised without fathers. Daughters imprinted on father odour and colour during a critical period early in development. These traits have diverged between the species owing to differences in ecology. Therefore, we provide the first evidence that imprinting links ecological adaptation to sexual isolation between species. Our results suggest that imprinting may facilitate the evolution of sexual isolation during ecological speciation, may be especially important in cases of rapid diversification, and thus play an integral role in the generation of biodiversity.

AB The use of measurements of naturally occurring stable isotopes of the light elements C, N, H, O, S in avian tissues and their associated foodwebs has grown tremendously during the last 30 years. Three primary applications of this approach have been (1) the delineation of diets or trophic relationships and sources of nutrients to individuals or populations, (2) the assessment of the relative contributions of endogenously and exogenously derived nutrients to reproduction in birds that travel to breed, and, more recently, (3) the assignment to origin of migratory individuals. This paper will briefly summarize the roots of these theme areas and highlight the benefits of an isotope perspective. However, the primary focus of this paper is on key assumptions, misunderstandings, information gaps and the path ahead. Specific recommendations for future research are outlined for all of these theme areas. Finally, a plea is made for more constructive criticism in the field of isotopic applications to animal ecological studies, especially those involving birds.

AB Pleistocene glacial oscillations and associated tectonic processes are believed to have influenced the historical abundances and distribution of organisms in the Asia Northwest Pacific (ANP). Accumulating evidence indicates that factors shaping tempo-spatial population dynamics and distribution patterns of marine taxa vary with biogeographical latitude, pelagic behaviour and oceanographic regimes. To detect what kinds of historical and contemporary factors affected genetic connectivity, phylogeographic profiles of littoral macroalga Sargassum horneri in the ANP were analysed based on mitochondrial (Cox3) and chloroplast (rbcL) data sets. Five distinct clades were recovered. A strong signature of biogeographical structure was revealed (Phi(CT) = 0.487, P < 0.0001) derived from remarkable differentiation in clade distribution, as clade I is restricted to Chinese marginal seas (Yellow-Bohai Sea, East China Sea and South China Sea), whereas clades II-V are discontinuously scattered around the main Islands of Japan. Furthermore, two secondary contact regions were identified along the south Japan-Pacific coastline. This significant differentiation between the two basins may reflect historical glacial isolation in the northwestern Pacific, which is congruent with the estimates of clade divergence and demographic expansion during the late Quaternary low sea levels. Analysis of molecular variance and the population-pair statistic F-ST also revealed significant genetic structural differences between Chinese marginal seas and the Japanese basin. This exceptional phylogeographic architecture in S. horneri, initially shaped by historical geographic isolation during the late Pleistocene ice age and physical biogeographical barriers, can be complicated by oceanographic regimes (ocean surface currents) and relocating behaviour such as oceanic drifting.

AB Croplands mainly act as net sources of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as nitrogen oxide (NO), a precursor of troposheric ozone. We determined the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) balance of a four-year crop rotation, including maize, wheat, barley and mustard, to provide a base for exploring mitigation options of net emissions. The crop rotation had a positive net ecosystem production (NEP) of 4.4 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) but represented a net source of carbon with a net biome production (NBP) of -1.3 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). The nitrogen balance of the rotation was correlated with the carbon balance and resulted in net loss (-24 +/- 28 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). The main nitrogen losses were nitrate leaching (-11.7 +/- 1.0 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and ammonia volatilization (-9 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Dry and wet depositions were 6.7 +/- 3.0 and 5.9 +/- 0.1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Fluxes of nitrous (N2O) and nitric (NO) oxides did not contribute significantly to the N budget (N2O: -1.8 +/- 0.04; NO: -0.7 +/- 0.04 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) but N2O fluxes equaled 16% of the total greenhouse gas balance. The link between the carbon and nitrogen balances are discussed. Longer term experiments would be necessary to capture the trends in the carbon and nitrogen budgets within the variability of agricultural ecosystems.

AB Natural history collections (NHCs) are an important source of the long-term data needed to understand how biota respond to ongoing anthropogenic climate change. These include taxon occurrence data for ecological modeling, as well as information that can be used to reconstruct mechanisms through which biota respond to changing climates. The full potential of NHCs for climate change research cannot be fully realized until high-quality data sets are conveniently accessible for research, but this requires that higher priority be placed on digitizing the holdings most useful for climate change research (e.g., whole-biota studies, time series, records of intensively sampled common taxa). Natural history collections must not neglect the proliferation of new information from efforts to understand how present-day ecosystems are responding to environmental change. These new directions require a strategic realignment for many NHC holders to complement their existing focus on taxonomy and systematics. To set these new priorities, we need strong partnerships between NHC holders and global change biologists.

AB This essay sheds new light on the meaning and measurement of compactness-one of the most intriguing and least-understood properties of geographic shapes. We articulate a unified theoretical foundation for the study of shape compactness that rests on two simple observations: First, that the circle is the most compact of shapes. And second, that there are 10-and possibly more-distinct geometrical properties of the circle that make it the most compact of shapes. We introduce these 10 properties, illustrate them with real-world examples and define indices associated with these properties that can be calculated using a geographic information system.Cet essai apporte une perspective nouvelle a la signification et a la mesure de la compacite spatiale - une des proprietes parmi les plus fascinantes et les moins comprises des formes geographiques. Nous developpons les fondations d'une theorie unifiee pour l'etude de la compacite geographique des formes qui reposent sur deux observations simples : premierement, que le cercle est la plus compacte des formes, et deuxiemement, qu'il y a au moins dix proprietes geometriques distinctes du cercle qui font de celui-ci la forme la plus compacte. Nous decrivons ces dix proprietes, nous les illustrons par des exemples du monde reel et nous definissons des index associes a ces proprietes qui peuvent etre calcules en utilisant un logiciel de SIG (Systeme d'information geographique).

AB Aim
   Nearly 150 years ago, T. H. Huxley modified Wallace's Line, including the island of Palawan as a component of the Asian biogeographic realm and separating it from the oceanic Philippines. Although Huxley recognized some characteristics of a transition between the regions, Palawan has since been regarded primarily as a peripheral component of the Sunda Shelf. However, several recent phylogenetic studies of Southeast Asian lineages document populations on Palawan to be closely related to taxa from the oceanic Philippines, apparently contradicting the biogeographic association of Palawan with the Sunda Shelf. In the light of recent evidence, we evaluate taxonomic and phylogenetic data in an attempt to identify the origin(s) of Palawan's terrestrial vertebrate fauna.
   Location
   The Sunda Shelf and the Philippines.
   Methods
   We review distributional and phylogenetic data for populations of terrestrial vertebrates from Palawan. Using taxonomic data, we compare the number of Palawan taxa (species and genera) shared with the Sunda Shelf and oceanic Philippines. Among widespread lineages, we use phylogenetic data to identify the number of Palawan taxa with sister relationships to populations or species from the Sunda Shelf or oceanic Philippines.
   Results
   Although many terrestrial vertebrate taxa are shared between Palawan and the Sunda Shelf, an increasing number of species and populations are now recognized as close relatives of lineages from the oceanic Philippines. Among the 39 putative lineages included in molecular phylogenetic studies with sampling from the Sunda Shelf, Palawan and the oceanic Philippines, 17 of them reveal sister relationships between lineages from Palawan and the oceanic Philippines.
   Main conclusions
   Rather than a simple nested subset of Sunda Shelf populations, Palawan is best viewed as having played multiple biogeographic roles, including a young and old extension of the Sunda Shelf, a springboard to diversification in the oceanic Philippines, and a biogeographic component of the Philippine archipelago. Palawan has a long, complex geological history, which may explain this variation in pattern. Huxley originally noted transitional elements in Palawan's fauna; we therefore suggest that his modification of Wallace's Line should be recognized as a filter zone, reflecting both his original intent and available taxonomic and molecular evidence.

AB Soil respiration (SR) is highly sensitive to future climate change, and particularly to global warming. However, considerable uncertainties remain associated with the temperature sensitivity of SR and its controlling processes. Using 384 field measurement data from 114 published papers and one book, this study quantifies the variation in the seasonal Q(10) values of soil respiration, the multiplier by which respiration rates increase for a 10 degrees C increase in temperature, and its drivers across different sites. No significant correlation between Q(10) and mean annual temperature or mean annual precipitation is found when statistically controlling seasonal changes in vegetation activity, deduced from satellite vegetation greenness index observations (normalized difference vegetation index, or NDVI). In contrast, the seasonal amplitude of NDVI is significantly and positively correlated with the apparent Q(10) of SR. This result indicates that the variations of seasonal vegetation activity exert dominant control over the variations of the apparent Q(10) of SR across different sites, highlighting the ecological linkage between plant physiological processes and soil processes. It further implies that the seasonal variation of vegetation activity may thus dominate the apparent seasonal temperature sensitivity. We conclude that the apparent Q(10) value of SR estimated from field measurements is generally larger than the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition, and thus cautions should be taken when applying apparent Q(10) values directly in ecosystem models. Our regression analysis further shows that when the amplitude of NDVI variation approximates 0 (and thus when the seasonality in vegetation activity is marginal), the residual Q(10) of SR for soil temperature measured at 5 cm depth is about 1.5.

AB Advances in spring blooming of wildflowers have been associated with climate change; however, the majority of long-term community-level studies have been conducted in humid-temperate regions. Less is known about phenological changes in herbaceous, semi-arid plant communities. We recorded first-bloom date of common spring wildflowers in a semi-arid grassland in the Rocky Mountains, USA from 1995 through 2008 and analyzed these data along with mean monthly temperature and precipitation. Advanced flowering predominated; 75% of the 32 species displayed a negative linear regression slope, and this trend was strong for nine species (slope < 1.0,p < 0.10). Only one species showed a strong trend for later flowering. Mean advance for all 32 species was 0.61 days/year and mean advance for the nine species displaying a strong tendency to flower earlier was 1.6 days/year. Species flowering early showed stronger trends toward advanced flowering than later species. Average March temperature and January plus December precipitation, falling mainly as snow, were explanatory variables in the best multiple linear regression model for mean first-flowering date of strongly advanced species. Our results suggest that flowering phenology may be changing faster and precipitation may play a more important role in semi-arid grasslands than in humid-temperate systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB P>1. The cycling of nutrients in litterfall is considered a key mechanism in the maintenance of tropical forest fertility but its importance has rarely been quantified experimentally.
   2. We carried out a long-term (5 years), large-scale litter manipulation experiment in lowland semi-evergreen tropical forest to determine how changes in litterfall affect forest nutrient cycling. We hypothesized that: (i) long-term litter removal would decrease the forest's nutrient supply; (ii) litter addition would increase the forest's nutrient supply; (iii) soil and foliar nutrient concentrations would change in response to litter manipulation and would eventually affect above-ground productivity.
   3. To test our hypotheses, we measured trunk growth, litterfall, and nutrient concentrations in live leaves, litter and soil in plots where litter was removed once a month (L-), litter was added once a month (L+) and controls (CT).
   4. After 5 years, the concentration of nitrate in the soil and soil stocks of inorganic nitrogen were higher in the L+ plots and lower in the L- plots compared to the controls. Ammonium concentrations in the soil were also lower in the L- plots. Nitrogen in leaves and litter and the annual nitrogen return by litter were higher in the L+ plots, while potassium return was lower in the L- plots. Surprisingly, our treatments had little effect on phosphorus in soil, leaves or litter, even though lowland tropical forests are generally thought to be largely phosphorus limited.
   5. Trunk growth of large trees was not affected by litter manipulation but rainy season litterfall from 2003 to 2008 was 13% higher in the L+ plots compared to the controls.
   6. Synthesis. Litter removal affected forest nutrient cycling and productivity less than expected, probably because the soil at our site is moderately fertile. However, litter addition increased litterfall indicating that some limitation of forest production was removed by litter addition. We expected strong effects of litter manipulation on phosphorus cycling; instead, we found a stronger effect on nitrogen cycling. Our results suggest that litter is an important source of nutrients, in particular nitrogen, to trees in this lowland semi-evergreen tropical forest.

AB Aim
   We perform a phylogeographical study of an endemic Patagonian herbaceous plant to assess whether geographical patterns of genetic variation correspond to in situ Pleistocene survival or to glacial retreat and post-glacial expansion. We also seek to determine the locations of potential glacial refugia and post-glacial colonization routes.
   Location
   Southern Andes and Patagonian steppe.
   Methods
   We used Calceolaria polyrhiza, a widely distributed Patagonian herbaceous plant that occurs mainly in the understorey of Nothofagus rain forests and in the arid Patagonian steppe, as our model system. The chloroplast intergenic spacer trnH-psbA was sequenced for 590 individuals from 68 populations. Sequence data were analysed using phylogenetic (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) and population genetic (spatial analyses of molecular variance, mismatch distributions and neutrality tests) methods. Nested clade phylogeographic analyses, and divergence time estimates using a calibrated molecular clock, were also conducted.
   Results
   A total of 27 haplotypes identified in the present study clustered into four primary genealogical lineages, revealing three significant latitudinal phylogeographical breaks. The two high Andean lineages probably split first, during the late Miocene, and the Patagonian lineage split around 4 Ma, coincident with the establishment of the Patagonian steppe. Within each haplogroup, major diversification occurred in the Pleistocene. The Patagonian groups show a pattern consistent with a rapid post-glacial expansion and colonization of the Andean flanks, achieved independently by four lineages. The highest haplotype diversity was found along a longitudinal transect that is remarkably congruent with the limit of the ice-sheet extension during the Greatest Patagonian Glaciation. A north-east expansion is evident, which is probably associated with the 'Arid Diagonal' fluctuations.
   Main conclusions
   Glacial climate fluctuations had a substantial impact on the diversification, distribution and demography of the study species. A scenario of multiple periglacial Pleistocene refugia and subsequent multiple recolonization routes, from eastern Patagonia to the Andean flanks, may explain the phylogeographical patterns observed. However, current genetic structure also preserves the imprints of older events that probably occurred in the Miocene and Pliocene, providing evidence that multiple processes, operating at different spatial and temporal scales, have moulded biodiversity in Patagonia.

AB A central tenet of life-history theory is that investment in reproduction compromises survival. We tested for costs of reproduction in wild brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) by eliminating reproductive investment via surgical ovariectomy and/or removal of oviductal eggs Anoles are unusual among lizards in that females lay single-egg clutches at frequent intervals throughout a lengthy reproductive season. This evolutionary reduction in clutch size is thought to decrease the physical burden of reproduction, but our results show that even a single egg significantly impairs stamina and sprint speed. Reproductive females also suffered a reduction in growth, suggesting that the cumulative energetic cost of successive clutches constrains the allocation of energy to other important functions. Finally, in each of two separate years, elimination of reproductive investment increased breeding-season survival by 56%, overwinter survival by 96%, and interannual survival by 200% relative to reproductive controls. This extreme fitness cost of reproduction may reflect a combination of intrinsic (i.e., reduced allocation of energy to maintenance) and extrinsic (i.e., increased susceptibility to predators) sources of mortality. Our results provide clear experimental support for a central tenet of life-history theory and show that costs of reproduction persist in anoles despite the evolution of a single-egg clutch.

AB A massive decline of biodiversity is caused by land-use changes. Efforts must therefore be made to better understand the factors that govern organismal distribution, especially for countries where traditional management is about to be intensified such as in Romania. We here document the spatial distribution of amphibians from a Romanian rural landscape where land-use is still largely traditional. We related the occurrence of nine amphibian species and species richness to measures of composition and configuration of the landscape surrounding 54 ponds at three spatial scales: circular areas of 400, 600 and 800 m radii. Busy roads most severely impacted single species and amphibian richness whereas landscape composition measures, such as cover of urban areas, agricultural areas, pastures, forests and wetlands were of little importance. We suggest that the relative unimportance of landscape compositional measures on amphibians is a consequence of the traditional management of these landscapes that keep the environmental conditions favorable for most species.

AB Evolutionary biologists have long endeavored to document how many species exist on Earth, to understand the processes by which biodiversity waxes and wanes, to document and interpret spatial patterns of biodiversity, and to infer evolutionary relationships. Despite the great potential of this knowledge to improve biodiversity science, conservation, and policy, evolutionary biologists have generally devoted limited attention to these broader implications. Likewise, many workers in biodiversity science have underappreciated the fundamental relevance of evolutionary biology. The aim of this article is to summarize and illustrate some ways in which evolutionary biology is directly relevant We do so in the context of four broad areas: (1) discovering and documenting biodiversity, (2) understanding the causes of diversification, (3) evaluating evolutionary responses to human disturbances, and (4) implications for ecological communities, ecosystems, and humans We also introduce bioGENESIS, a new project within DIVERSITAS launched to explore the potential practical contributions of evolutionary biology In addition to fostering the integration of evolutionary thinking into biodiversity science, bioGENESIS provides practical recommendations to policy makers for incorporating evolutionary perspectives into biodiversity agendas and conservation. We solicit your involvement in developing innovative ways of using evolutionary biology to better comprehend and stem the loss of biodiversity.

TI The Five AhMTP1 Zinc Transporters Undergo Different Evolutionary Fates

AB Gene duplication is a major mechanism facilitating adaptation to changing environments. From recent genomic analyses, the acquisition of zinc hypertolerance and hyperaccumulation characters discriminating Arabidopsis halleri from its zinc sensitive/non-accumulator closest relatives Arabidopsis lyrata and Arabidopsis thaliana was proposed to rely on duplication of genes controlling zinc transport or zinc tolerance. Metal Tolerance Protein 1 (MTP1) is one of these genes. It encodes a Zn2+/H+ antiporter involved in cytoplasmic zinc detoxification and thus in zinc tolerance. MTP1 was proposed to be triplicated in A. halleri, while it is present in single copy in A. thaliana and A. lyrata. Two of the three AhMTP1 paralogues were shown to co-segregate with zinc tolerance in a BC1 progeny from a cross between A. halleri and A. lyrata. In this work, the MTP1 family was characterized at both the genomic and functional levels in A. halleri. Five MTP1 paralogues were found to be present in A. halleri, AhMTP1-A1, -A2, -B, -C, and -D. Interestingly, one of the two newly identified AhMTP1 paralogues was not fixed at least in one A. halleri population. All MTP1s were expressed, but transcript accumulation of the paralogues co-segregating with zinc tolerance in the A. halleri X A. lyrata BC1 progeny was markedly higher than that of the other paralogues. All MTP1s displayed the ability to functionally complement a Saccharomyces cerevisae zinc hypersensitive mutant. However, the paralogue showing the least complementation of the yeast mutant phenotype was one of the paralogues co-segregating with zinc tolerance. From our results, the hypothesis that pentaplication of MTP1 could be a major basis of the zinc tolerance character in A. halleri is strongly counter-balanced by the fact that members of the MTP1 family are likely to experience different evolutionary fates, some of which not concurring to increase zinc tolerance.

AB To characterize the environmental factors affecting seabird population trends in the central portion of the California current system (CCS), we analyzed standardized vessel-based surveys collected during the late spring (May-June) upwelling season over 22 yr (1985-2006) We tested the working hypothesis that population trends are related to species-specific foraging ecology, and predicted that temporal variation in population size should be most extreme in diving species with higher energy expenditure during foraging We related variation in individual species abundance (number km(-2)) to seasonally lagged (late winter, early spring, late spring) and concurrent ocean conditions, and to long-term trends (using a proxy variable: year) during a multi-decadal period of major fluctuations in the El Nino-Southern oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) We considered both remote (Multivariate ENSO Index, PDO) and local (coastal upwelling indices and sea-surface temperature) environmental variables as proxies for ocean productivity and prey availability We also related seabird trends to those of potentially major trophic competitors, humpback (Megaptera novaeanghae) and blue (Balaenoprera musculus) whales. which increased in number 4-5-fold midway during our study. Cyclical oscillations in seabird abundance were apparent in the black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes), and decreasing trends were documented for ashy storm-petrel (Oceanodroma homochroa), pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columbus), rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), and western gull (Lams occidentalis); the sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus), exhibited a marked decline before signs of recovery at the end of the study period. The abundance of nine other focal species varied with ocean conditions, but without decadal or long-term trends Six of these species have the largest global populations in the CCS, and four are highly energetic, diving foragers. Furthermore, three of the diving species trends were negatively correlated with the abundance of humpback whales in the study area, a direct competitor for the same prey Therefore, on the basis of literature reviewed, we hypothesize that the seabirds were affected by the decreasing carrying capacity of the CCS, over-exploitation of some prey stocks and interference competition from the previously exploited, but now increasing, baleen whale populations Overall, our study highlights the complexity of the ecological factors driving seabird population trends in the highly variable and rapidly changing CCS ecosystem (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Sacred forests represent an important long-held tradition of conserving specific land areas that have cultural, and often religious, significance. India, with its diversity of cultures and traditions, has over 100 000 sacred forests. Many of these groves are forest fragments in agricultural landscapes. In most cases, community members are at least aware of these fragments, if not actively involved in their protection and management. This review focuses on the Western Ghats in southern India and Meghalaya state in northeastern India, both international biodiversity hotspots. In addition to the cultural significance of sacred forests, a number of studies have suggested that they are important refuges for conservation of biological diversity, including medicinal plants, within highly anthropogenic landscapes. Whilst sacred groves have been successful conservation areas, current threats to these forests are numerous, ranging from pressures for use of timber and other forest products to clearing for agriculture or general changes in cultural traditions. A variety of arrangements exist for ownership and management of sacred forests, making it necessary to identify solutions on a case-by-case basis. Support for the continued practice of the tradition of sacred forest protection is needed in order to provide a culturally sensitive model for community-based natural resource management.

AB Bivalves, crabs, fishes, seawater, and sediment collected from the inner part of Tokyo Bay, Japan, were measured for 20 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and 5 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. To determine the trophic levels of the organisms, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were also measured. Bioconcentration factors of PBDE and PCB congeners increased as the octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow) rose to log K-ow = 7, above which they decreased again. Biomagnification of PCBs and several PBDE congeners (BDE47, 99, 100, 153 and 154) up the trophic ladder was confirmed by a positive correlation between their concentrations and delta N-15. Other PBDE congeners showed a negative or no correlation, suggesting their biotransformation through metabolism. The more hydrophobic congeners of both PBDEs (Br = 2-6) and PCBs (Cl = 6-9) were biomagnified more. It thus appears that PBDEs are less biomagnified than PCBs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biological invasions usually start with a small number of founder individuals. These founders are likely to represent a small fraction of the total genetic diversity found in the source population. Our study set out to trace genetically the geographical origin of the horse-chestnut leafminer, Cameraria ohridella, an invasive microlepidopteran whose area of origin is still unkown. Since its discovery in Macedonia 25 years ago, this insect has experienced an explosive westward range expansion, progressively colonizing all of Central and Western Europe. We used cytochrome oxidase I sequences (DNA barcode fragment) and a set of six polymorphic microsatellites to assess the genetic variability of C. ohridella populations, and to test the hypothesis that C. ohridella derives from the southern Balkans (Albania, Macedonia and Greece). Analysis of mtDNA of 486 individuals from 88 localities allowed us to identify 25 geographically structured haplotypes. In addition, 480 individuals from 16 populations from Europe and the southern Balkans were genotyped for 6 polymorphic microsatellite loci. High haplotype diversity and low measures of nucleotide diversities including a significantly negative Tajima's D indicate that C. ohridella has experienced rapid population expansion during its dispersal across Europe. Both mtDNA and microsatellites show a reduction in genetic diversity of C. ohridella populations sampled from artificial habitats (e.g. planted trees in public parks, gardens, along roads in urban or sub-urban areas) across Europe compared with C. ohridella sampled in natural stands of horse-chestnuts in the southern Balkans. These findings suggest that European populations of C. ohridella may indeed derive from the southern Balkans.

AB Freshwater prawns of the genus Macrobrachium are free-living decapod crustaceans that are commonly encountered in tropical streams and lakes. We present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the diverse Southeast and East Asian fauna based on >3 kb sequence data from three nuclear and two mitochondrial markers for almost 50% of the described fauna. We reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships and track the evolution of key life history traits. Our tree suggests that the last common ancestor of the Asian Macrobrachium laid numerous small eggs and had prolonged larval development ("PLD") in saline coastal waters after which the adults matured in freshwater habitats. We also argue for five independent losses of the marine larval phase to yield five clades of species that develop entirely in freshwater and have fewer and larger eggs than the species with PLD. These species have either semi-abbreviated (two origins) with at least one free-swimming stage or abbreviated larval development ("ALD": three origins) which lack free-swimming larvae. A Shimodaira-Hasegawa test rejects all trees that would imply a single loss of the marine larval phase, but alternative and equally parsimonious optimizations exist that imply a smaller number of losses. However, these scenarios would require the re-acquisition of free-swimming larvae. A concentrated-change test supports Pereira and Garcia's [Pereira, G.A., Garcia, J.V., 1995. Larval development of Macrobrachium reyesi Pereira (Decapoda, Palaemonidae), with a discussion on the origin of abbreviated development in palaemonids. J. Crust. Biol. 15, 117-133] hypothesis of a significant correlation between living in freshwater and the origin of semi-abbreviated and abbreviated larval development. Our phylogenetic tree also reveals that Asian Macrobrachium have independently become cavernicolous at least twice, and invaded the highly acidic waters of freshwater and peat swamps two or three times.

AB We used molecular data to answer the following questions: (1) Is morphology-based (and to some extent, geography-based) classification of the freshwater crab family Potamidae congruent with a molecular phylogeny? (2) What historical biogeographical event could have shaped this phylogeny?
   Material from the entire geographical range of the family Potamidae was analysed, including specimens from East Asia (China, Taiwan, the Ryukyus), Southeast Asia, South Asia (northern India, the Middle East and Near East), North Africa, and southern Europe.
   Mitochondrial DNA sequences encoding 503 base pairs (excluding the variable regions) of the large subunit rRNA (16S rRNA) gene were obtained from 72 species belonging to 49 potamid genera, representing 51% of all known genera in this species-rich family. Sequences were compared by means of phylogenetic analyses (minimum evolution, Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony) and Bayesian relaxed molecular clock estimates.
   The family Potamidae was found to be monophyletic with two major lineages, and there was support for the recognition of two mostly allopatric subfamilies, Potaminae and Potamiscinae. This is largely consistent with the current classification proposed. The 'Potamiscinae' clade comprised three subclades: (1) a well-supported 'eastern Asia' subclade that included species from the eastern part of the range (China, Taiwan, the Ryukyus, the Philippines, Indochina, Malay Peninsula, northern India and Myanmar/Burma); (2) a weakly supported 'Sunda Shelf islands' subclade that included species from the larger Southeast Asian islands on the Sunda Shelf (Borneo, Sumatra and Java); and (3) a 'Socotra' subclade that comprised only Socotrapotamon from Socotra Island, off the north-east coast of Africa.
   The discrete distribution of the two subfamilies in Europe/Asia is hypothesized to be the result of vicariance due to the collision of the Indian tectonic plate with the Asian continent, and the orogeny that caused the separation of the two freshwater crab lineages around 22.8 Ma. Within the Potamiscinae, the 'Sunda Shelf islands' subclade separated from other potamiscines around 21.1 Ma; and the endemic fauna of the East Asian islands (Taiwan, the Ryukyus and mainland Japan) was isolated from the Asian continent c. 8.4 Ma, following the opening of the Okinawa Trough. The 'Socotra' subclade diverged from the 'eastern Asia' subclade at 19.1 Ma during the Miocene. Its taxonomic position, however, remains unclear as the members of this clade possess the key potamine character of a transverse ridge on thoracic sternite 8, suggesting that this may in fact be a relict potamid group.

AB Conditions experienced during early life can have profound effects on individual development and condition in adulthood. Differences in nutritional provisioning in birds during the first month of life can lead to differences in growth, reproductive success and survival. Yet, under natural conditions shorter periods of nutritional stress will be more prevalent. Individuals may respond differently, depending on the period of development during which nutritional stress was experienced. Such differences may surface specifically when poor environmental conditions challenge individuals again as adults. Here, we investigated long term consequences of differences in nutritional conditions experienced during different periods of early development by female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) on measures of management and acquisition of body reserves. As nestlings or fledglings, subjects were raised under different nutritional conditions, a low or high quality diet. After subjects reached sexual maturity, we measured their sensitivity to periods of food restriction, their exploration and foraging behaviour as well as adult resting metabolic rate (RMR). During a short period of food restriction, subjects from the poor nutritional conditions had a higher body mass loss than those raised under qualitatively superior nutritional conditions. Moreover, subjects that were raised under poor nutritional conditions were faster to engage in exploratory and foraging behaviour. But RMR did not differ among treatments. These results reveal that early nutritional conditions affect adult exploratory behaviour, a representative personality trait, foraging and adult's physiological condition. As early nutritional conditions are reflected in adult phenotypic plasticity specifically when stressful situations reappear, the results suggest that costs for poor developmental conditions are paid when environmental conditions deteriorate.

AB The present study was conducted using secondary database, remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS) and multivariate analysis tools in order to develop Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models that could be able to predict level of water quality variables using compositional and spatial attributes of land cover in the river basins. The study encompasses 21 river basins with 32 000 Km(2) area, located in the Chugoku district in West Japan. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Suspended Solid (SS), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP) were considered as water quality variables of the stream. Satellite data was used to generate the land cover map of the study area. MLR models were developed using the compositional (%) and spatial attributes (landscape metrics) of the land cover at watershed and class levels for representing the land cover-stream water quality linkage. The results of the MLR modeling using the land cover data at the class level revealed that 92%, 74% and 62% of the total variations in concentration of DO, pH and TP were explained by changes in the measure of the spatial attributes of the land cover at the class level in the study area. These models can help local and regional land managers to understand the relationships between the compositional attribute (%) and the spatial features of the land cover and river water quality and would be applied in formulating plan for watershed-level management.

AB Forest harvesting in eastern North America has been occurring for centuries but its effect on soil carbon storage and dynamics below 20 cm is not well known. This paper investigates age-related variations in carbon storage and dynamics in the organic layer and 6 depth strata in the top 50 cm of the mineral soil during ecologically important stages of post-harvest succession in a first rotation red spruce forest chronosequence that includes one of the largest old growth reference stands in northeastern North America. Storage of carbon reached a minimum 32 years post-harvest, at which time stores were approximately 50% of the intact forest. However, storage approached the range of the intact forest approximately 100 years post-harvest. Examination of age-related variations with depth revealed that concentrations of carbon below 20 cm may be driving the temporal trends in whole soil storage in these forests. Corresponding carbon isotope data were consistent with increased isotopic fractionation attributable to increased rates of mineralization post-harvest. Based on these results, we suggest that a greater emphasis should be placed upon examining storage of carbon below 20 cm in the mineral soil when evaluating the sequestration potential of intensive forest management, specifically rotation length.

AB Nested clade phylogeographical analysis (NCPA) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have been used to test phylogeographical hypotheses. Multilocus NCPA tests null hypotheses, whereas ABC discriminates among a finite set of alternatives. The interpretive criteria of NCPA are explicit and allow complex models to be built from simple components. The interpretive criteria of ABC are ad hoc and require the specification of a complete phylogeographical model. The conclusions from ABC are often influenced by implicit assumptions arising from the many parameters needed to specify a complex model. These complex models confound many assumptions so that biological interpretations are difficult. Sampling error is accounted for in NCPA, but ABC ignores important sources of sampling error that creates pseudo-statistical power. NCPA generates the full sampling distribution of its statistics, but ABC only yields local probabilities, which in turn make it impossible to distinguish between a good fitting model, a non-informative model, and an over-determined model. Both NCPA and ABC use approximations, but convergences of the approximations used in NCPA are well defined whereas those in ABC are not. NCPA can analyse a large number of locations, but ABC cannot. Finally, the dimensionality of tested hypothesis is known in NCPA, but not for ABC. As a consequence, the 'probabilities' generated by ABC are not true probabilities and are statistically non-interpretable. Accordingly, ABC should not be used for hypothesis testing, but simulation approaches are valuable when used in conjunction with NCPA or other methods that do not rely on highly parameterized models.

AB The vast number of studies in both human and animals confirm the inhibiting role of different stressors in the hormonal function of the testicles, decreasing the testosterone (T) level in the blood. However, there also are data suggesting that stress does not invariably inhibit the activity of the testicles. Moreover, the T level in blood may be increased at initial stages of acute stress. Some researchers believe that the last phenomenon is prevalent in organisms that have (i) greater experience in winning in agonistic competitions and/or (ii) dominant status in a population hierarchy. Taking these data into consideration, we ask: what causes different patterns of hormone shifts in dominant and subordinate animals and humans? Does the concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH) determine the blood level of T?
   Considering that increase of T level is not invariably combined with increased LH, we suggest that the reason for the temporary increase of T concentration in the blood in the initial phase of stress, especially when the level of LH is relatively stable, is due to the increased sensitivity of testicles to LH. It is known that the sympathetic stimulation increases testicles' sensitivity to the gonadotropic hormones. It is also known that the dominants are characterized with predominantly noradrenergic response to stress. So, it seems clear why dominants respond to stress with increased blood T more frequently than others. However, the sympathetic stimulation during stress does not always induce rise of T in the blood of the dominants. We think that the factors which contribute to the transitory increase of the blood T level in the initial stage of stress are the following: absence of chronic stress; dominant status of an animal; more or less stable social relations in a population; some behavioral characteristics, particularly an ability to manage stress situation and respond adequately to frustration; emotions resulting from a winning in agonistic contest; and and noradrenergic type of stress reactivity.

AB Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) predation on army ants (Dorylus, subgenus Anomma) is an impressive example of skillful use of elementary technology, and it has been suggested to reflect Cultural differences among chimpanzee communities. Alternatively, the observed geographic diversity in army-ant-eating may represent local behavioral responses of the chimpanzees to the anti-predator traits of the army ant species present at the different sites. We examined assemblages of available prey species, their behavior and morphology, consumption by chimpanzees, techniques employed, and tool lengths at 14 sites in eastern. central, and western Africa. Where army ants are eaten, tool length and concomitant technique are a function of prey type. Epigaeically foraging species with aggressive workers that inflict painful bites are harvested with longer tools and usually by the "pull-through" technique; species foraging in leaf-litter with less aggressive workers that inflict less painful bites are harvested with short tools and by the "direct-mouthing" technique. However, prey species characteristics do not explain several differences in army-ant-eating between Bossou (Guinea) and Tai (Ivory Coast), where the same suite of prey species is available and is consumed. Moreover, the absence of army-ant-eating at five sites cannot be explained by the identity of available prey species, as all the species found at these sites are eaten elsewhere. We conclude that some of the observed variation in the predator-prey relationship of chimpanzees and army ants reflects environmental influences driven by the prey, while other variation is not linked to prey characteristics and may be solely sociocultural.

AB The theory of species coexistence predicts avoidance between species that compete for similar resources. Recent studies, however, have suggested that facilitation is also possible if competitor density provides information about resources. Optimal solution to trade-off between competition and facilitation is predicted to occur at intermediate competitor densities. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally creating a density range of resident tit species (Parus spp.), and measured the response of a competitively subordinate migratory bird, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) in terms of habitat preference (settlement order and density), offspring investment (clutch size and primary sex ratio of offspring), and reproductive success (number and condition of nestlings). We show that most habitat choice and investment decisions of flycatchers were unimodally related to tit density, whereas reproductive success decreased linearly with increasing density. Flycatchers thus made mismatched investment decisions at the artificial tit densities because manipulation disassociated the natural correlation between habitat quality and population density. Apparently low and high tit densities were perceived as indication of poor quality habitat in terms of low amount or quality of resources/high mortality risk and high costs of competition, respectively. This demonstrates that competitor density can be used in assessing overall habitat quality in habitat selection and offspring investment decisions, integrating information on resources and competition.

AB Carbon dioxide fluxes were examined over the growing seasons of 2002 and 2003 from 14 different sites in Upper Midwest (USA) to assess spatial variability of ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange. These sites were exposed to similar temperature/precipitation regimes and spanned a range of vegetation types typical of the region (northern hardwood, mixed forest, red pine, jack pine, pine barrens and shrub wetland). The hardwood and red pine sites also spanned a range of stand ages (young, intermediate, mature). While seasonal changes in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and photosynthetic parameters were coherent across the 2 years at most sites, changes in ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) were not. Canopy height and vegetation type were important variables for explaining spatial variability of CO2 fluxes across the region. Light-use efficiency (LUE) was not as strongly correlated to GEP as maximum assimilation capacity (Amax). A bottom-up multi-tower land cover aggregated scaling of CO2 flux to a 2000 km(2) regional flux estimate found June to August 2003 NEE, ER and GEP to be -290 +/- 89, 408 +/- 48, and 698 +/- 73 gC m(-2), respectively. Aggregated NEE, ER and GEP were 280% larger, 32% smaller and 3% larger, respectively, than that observed from a regionally integrating 447 m tall flux tower. However, when the tall tower fluxes were decomposed using a footprint-weighted influence function and then re-aggregated to a regional estimate, the resulting NEE, ER and GEP were within 11% of the multi-tower aggregation. Excluding wetland and young stand age sites from the aggregation worsened the comparison to observed fluxes. These results provide insight on the range of spatial sampling, replication, measurement error and land cover accuracy needed for multi-tiered bottom-up scaling of CO2 fluxes in heterogeneous regions such as the Upper Midwest, USA.

AB When fitness benefits of investment in sons and daughters differ, animals are predicted to manipulate the sex ratio of their offspring. Sex ratio manipulation occurs in many taxa, but the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon in vertebrates remain largely unknown. Factors favoring skewed sex ratios, such as reduced maternal condition or food availability, also induce elevated corticosteroids. Recent experimental studies support a causal relationship between corticosteroids and sex ratio. Evidence of a natural correlation between maternal corticosteroids and offspring sex ratio has been lacking, however. Without such evidence, the importance of corticosteroids in influencing sex ratios in natural populations was unknown. We measured baseline corticosteroids in 19 free-ranging female white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) and the sex ratios of their offspring. Females with high corticosteroids produced more daughters than females with low hormone levels. We then conducted a controlled, fieldbased experiment investigating the effects of moderately increased maternal corticosteroids on offspring sex ratios to determine if the observed correlation reflects a causal relationship between maternal corticosteroids and offspring sex ratio. Hormone-implanted females produced more female embryos than control females. These findings provide the first evidence of a natural correlation between maternal corticosteroids and offspring sex ratios in free-ranging birds, and the first experimental evidence of a causal link between moderate increases in corticosteroids and biased primary sex ratios.

AB Experimental work has provided evidence for extrinsic post-zygotic isolation, a phenomenon unique to ecological speciation. The role that ecological components to reduced hybrid fitness play in promoting speciation and maintaining species integrity in the wild, however, is not as well understood. We addressed this problem by testing for selection against naturally occurring hybrids in two sympatric species pairs of benthic and limnetic threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). If post-zygotic isolation is a significant reproductive barrier, the relative frequency of hybrids within a population should decline significantly across the life-cycle. Such a trend in a natural population would give independent support to experimental evidence for extrinsic, rather than intrinsic, post-zygotic isolation in this system. Indeed, tracing mean individual hybridity (genetic intermediateness) across three life-history stages spanning four generations revealed just such a decline. This provides compelling evidence that extrinsic selection plays an important role in maintaining species divergence and supports a role for ecological speciation in sticklebacks.

AB Climatic changes in the Northern Hemisphere have led to remarkable environmental changes in the Arctic Ocean, which is surrounded by permafrost. These changes include significant shrinking of sea-ice cover in summer, increased time between sea-ice break-up and freeze-up, and Arctic surface water freshening and warming associated with melting sea-ice, thawing permafrost, and increased runoff. These changes are commonly attributed to the greenhouse effect resulting from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and other non-CO2 radiatively active gases (methane, nitrous oxide). The greenhouse effect should be most pronounced in the Arctic where the largest air CO2 concentrations and winter-summer variations in the world for a clean background environment were detected. However, the air-land-shelf interaction in the Arctic has a substantial impact on the composition of the overlying atmosphere; as the permafrost thaws, a significant amount of old terrestrial carbon becomes available for biogeochemical cycling and oxidation to CO2. The Arctic Ocean's role in determining regional CO2 balance has been ignored, because of its small size (only similar to 4% of the world ocean area) and because its continuous sea-ice cover is considered to impede gaseous exchange with the atmosphere so efficiently that no global climate models include CO2 exchange over sea-ice. In this paper we show that: (1) the Arctic shelf seas (the Laptev and East-Siberian seas) may become a strong source of atmospheric CO2 because of oxidation of bio-available eroded terrestrial carbon and river transport; (2) the Chukchi Sea shelf exhibits the strong uptake of atmospheric CO2; (3) the sea-ice melt ponds and open brine channels form an important spring/surnmer air CO2 sink that also must be included in any Arctic regional CO2 budget. Both the direction and amount Of CO2 transfer between air and sea during open water season may be different from transfer during freezing and thawing, or during winter when CO2 accumulates beneath Arctic sea-ice; (4) direct measurements beneath the sea ice gave two initial results. First, a drastic pCO(2) decrease from 410 patin to 288 gatm, which was recorded in February-March beneath the fast ice near Barrow using the SAMI-CO2 sensor, may reflect increased photosynthetic activity beneath sea-ice just after polar sunrise. Second, new measurements made in summer 2005 beneath the sea ice in the Central Basin show relatively high values of PCO2 ranging between 425 mu atm and 475 mu atm, values, which are larger than the mean atmospheric value in the Arctic in summertime. The sources of those high values are supposed to be: high rates of bacterial respiration, import of the Upper Halocline Water (UHW) from the Chukchi Sea (CS) where values Of PCO2 range between 400 and 600 mu atm, a contribution from the Lena river plume, or any combination of these sources.

AB Dolphins of the genus Sotalia are found along the Caribbean and Atlantic coasts of Central and South America and in the Amazon River and most of its tributaries. At present, the taxonomy of these dolphins remains unresolved. Although five species were described in the late 1800s, only one species is recognized currently (Sotalia fluviatilis) with two ecotypes or subspecies, the coastal subspecies (Sotalia fluviatilis guianensis) and the riverine subspecies (Sotalia fluviatilis fluviatilis). Recent morphometric analyses, as well as mitochondrial DNA analysis, suggested recognition of each subspecies as separate species. Here we review the history of the classification of this genus and present new genetic evidence from ten nuclear and three mitochondrial genes supporting the elevation of each subspecies to the species level under the Genealogical/Lineage Concordance Species Concept and the criterion of irreversible divergence. We also review additional evidence for this taxonomic revision from previously published and unpublished genetic, morphological, and ecological studies. We propose the common name "costero" for the coastal species, Sotalia guianensis (Van Beneden 1864), and accept the previously proposed "tucuxi" dolphin, Sotalia fluviatilis (Gervais, 1853), for the riverine species.

AB Biodiversity provides insurance against the uncertain provision of ecosystem services which are being used by risk-averse economic agents. I present a conceptual ecological-economic model that combines (i) current results from ecology about the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem services with (ii) economic methods to study decision-making under uncertainty. In this framework I (1) determine the insurance value of biodiversity, (2) study the optimal allocation of funds in the trade-off between investing into biodiversity protection and the purchase of financial insurance, and (3) analyze the effect of different institutional regimes in the market for financial insurance on biodiversity protection. I conclude that biodiversity acts as a form of natural insurance for risk-averse ecosystem managers against the over- or under-provision with ecosystem services. Therefore, biodiversity has an insurance value, which is a value component in addition to the usual value arguments, such as direct or indirect use or non-use values. In this respect, biodiversity and financial insurance are substitutes. Hence, the availability, and exact institutional design; of financial insurance influence the level of biodiversity protection.

AB A promising route for understanding the origin and diversification of organismal form is through studies at the intersection of evolution and development (evo-devo). While much has been learned over the last two decades concerning macroevolutionary patterns of developmental change, a fundamental gap in the evo-devo synthesis is the integration of mathematical population and quantitative genetics with studies of how genetic variation in natural populations affects developmental processes. This micro-evo-devo synthesis requires model organisms with which to ask empirical questions. Threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), long a model for studying behavior, ecology and evolution, is emerging as a prominent model micro-evo-devo system. Research on stickleback over the last decade has begun to address the genetic basis of morphological variation and sex determination, and much of this work has important implications for understanding the genetics of speciation. In this paper we review recent threespine stickleback micro-evo-devo results, and outline the resources that have been developed to make this synthesis possible. The prospects for stickleback research to speed the micro-(and macro-) evo-devo syntheses are great, and this workhorse model system is well situated to continue contributing to our understanding of the generation of diversity in organismal form for many more decades.

AB The relative importance of bay habitats, consisting of mangrove creeks and channel, seagrass beds, and mud and sand flats, as feeding grounds for a number of fish species was studied in Chwaka Bay, Zanzibar, Tanzania, using gut content analysis and stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen. Gut content analysis revealed that within fish species almost the same food items were consumed regardless of the different habitats in which they were caught. Crustaceans (mainly copepods, crabs and shrimps) were the preferred food for most zoobenthivores and omnivores, while fishes and algae were the preferred food for piscivores and herbivores, respectively. The mean delta C-13 values of fishes and food items from the mangrove habitats were significantly depleted to those from the seagrass habitats by 6.9 and 9.7 parts per thousand for fishes and food items, respectively, and to those from the mud and sand flats by 3.5 and 5.8 parts per thousand, respectively. Fishes and food items from the mud and sand flats were significantly depleted as compared to those of the seagrass habitats by 3.4 and 3.9 parts per thousand, for fishes and food, respectively. Similar to other studies done in different geographical locations, the importance of mangrove and seagrass themselves as a primary source of carbon to higher trophic levels is limited. The different bay habitats were all used as feeding grounds by different fish species. Individuals of the species Gerres filamentosus, Gerres oyena, Lethrinus lentjan, Lutjanus fulviflamma, Pelates quadrilineatus and Siganus sutor appeared to show a connectivity with respect to feeding between different habitats by having delta C-13 values which were in-between those of food items from two neighbouring habitats. This connectivity could be a result of either daily tidal migrations or recent ontogenetic migration. (c) 2006 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2006 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB We used a 10-year record of the CO2 flux by an old growth boreal forest in central Manitoba (the Northern Old Black Spruce Site (NOBS)), a similar to 150-year-old Picea mariana [Mill.] stand) to determine whether and how whole-forest CO2 flux is related to tree ring width. We compared a 37-year ring width chronology collected at NOBS to a second chronology that was collected at a nearby Black Spruce stand with a different disturbance history, and also to three measures of annual whole-forest photosynthesis [gross ecosystem production (GEP)], two measures of annual respiration (R), and one measure of annual carbon balance [net ecosystem production (NEP)]. The year-to-year ring width fluctuations were well correlated between the two sites; increasing our confidence in the NOBS chronology and implying that ring width variation is driven and synchronized by the physical environment. Both chronologies exhibited serial correlation, with a fluctuation in ring width that had an apparent periodicity of similar to 7 years. Neither chronology was correlated with variation in annual precipitation or temperature. Ring width and NEP increased, while R decreased from 1995 to 2004. GEP either remained constant or decreased from 1995 to 2004, depending on which measure was considered. The lack of relationship between ring width and GEP may indicate that ring growth is controlled almost entirely by something other than carbon uptake. Alternative explanations for the ring width chronologies include the possibility that wood production varies as a result of shifts in respiration, or that an unidentified aspect of the environment, rather than the balance between GEP and respiration, controls wood production. The serial correlation in ring width may be related to increases and decreases in carbohydrate pools, or to gradual changes in nutrient availability, pathogens, herbivores, soil frost or soil water table. The cause or causes of serial correlation, and the controls on the allocation of photosynthate to wood production, emerge as critical uncertainties for efforts in predicting the carbon balance of boreal ecosystems and inferring past climate from tree rings.

AB Emissions of CO2 from soils make up one of the largest fluxes in the global C cycle, thus small changes in soil respiration may have large impacts on global C cycling. Anthropogenic additions of CO2 to the atmosphere are expected to alter soil carbon cycling, an important component of the global carbon budget. As part of the Duke Forest Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment, we examined how forest growth at elevated (+200 ppmv) atmospheric CO2 concentration affects soil CO2 dynamics over 7 years of continuous enrichment. Soil respiration, soil CO2 concentrations, and the isotopic signature of soil CO2 were measured monthly throughout the 7 years of treatment. Estimated annual rates of soil CO2 efflux have been significantly higher in the elevated plots in every year of the study, but over the last 5 years the magnitude of the CO2 enrichment effect on soil CO2 efflux has declined. Gas well samples indicate that over 7 years fumigation has led to sustained increases in soil CO2 concentrations and depletion in the delta C-13 of soil CO2 at all but the shallowest soil depths.

AB The natural abundance of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes was analysed in plankton and intertidal benthos at coastal sites of Galicia (NW Spain) to determine the relative importance of phytoplankton versus benthic macrophytes, and marine versus anthropogenic nutrients, in supporting littoral food webs in this upwelling ecosystem. Phytoplankton was significantly less enriched in heavy isotopes than most macrophytes (seagrasses and 3 classes of macroalgae). Nitrogen isotopes showed significant enrichment of primary consumers (zooplankton, benthic suspension feeders and deposit feeders) relative to primary producers. The average enrichment between trophic levels, however, was low (Delta delta C-13 = +0.1 parts per thousand, Delta 8 delta N-15 = +1.4 parts per thousand), suggesting the prevalence of omnivory. The use of marine nitrogen was inferred from the low nitrogen isotope abundance values of phytoplankton and rhodophycea. In contrast, phaeophycea and chlorophycea displayed high nitrogen isotope enrichment, particularly at sheltered sites, suggesting the influence of anthropogenic nitrogen. The diets of benthic consumers reflected the local diversity of available sources, with a large influence of phytoplankton and marine nitrogen at open sea sites. Average contributions of phytoplankton to diet always exceeded 40% in the case of suspension feeders but were generally < 20% for deposit feeders. Estuarine macrophytes were generally < 10% of diet for both groups. Carbon isotopes indicated a significant contribution of macrophytes (77%) to sinking particles. In contrast, most of the nitrogen of sinking particles and consumers was provided by marine sources. These results confirm the dominant role of marine nitrogen and phytoplankton in supporting littoral food webs in the Galician upwelling ecosystem, despite local inputs of anthropogenic nutrients.

AB We compared effects of different sample preparation techniques on the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of fish muscle, whole crustaceans and particulate organic matter (POM). Comparisons were also made to untreated (i.e. dried and homogenised) samples. Relatively carbonate-rich samples treated with weak acid (0.1 N HCl), either by quickly wetting or acid dampening, were on average 1.3 parts per thousand. more enriched in C-13 than duplicates soaked in 2 N HCl for 5 min, indicating incomplete carbonate removal with the weaker acid. In comparison, no differences in 615 N values were found between acid treatments, and a following water rinse had no effect on the 8 13C or 6 15 N values. Chloroform-methanol (2:1 by volume) extraction overnight removed less lipids than Soxhlet extraction with 7% methanol in dichloromethane for 2 h, resulting in similar to 1.2 parts per thousand difference in delta C-13 values between treatments of lipid-rich duplicates. Different lipid-extraction methods did not lead to consistent differences in delta N-15 values, however. Depending on the lipid and carbonate content, untreated samples were depleted in C-13 by 0.8 to 4.4 parts per thousand and in N-15 by 0.6 to 1.4 parts per thousand compared to treated duplicates. We conclude that delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of samples with low lipid and carbonate content are highly comparable among studies regardless of pre-treatment methods, whereas the VC values of relatively lipid- and/or carbonate-rich samples must be carefully considered based on the pretreatment applied to samples. In comparison, delta N-15 values are relatively robust to differences in carbonate and lipid-removal methods, and delta N-15 values of untreated vs. carbonate- and lipid-treated samples are comparable within 1.0 parts per thousand.

AB Contemporary patterns of genetic variation in crops reflect historical processes associated with domestication, such as the geographic origin(s) of cultivated populations. Although significant progress has been made in identifying several global centers of domestication, few studies have addressed the issue of multiple origins of cultivated plant populations from different geographic regions within a domestication center. This study investigates the domestication history of jocote (Spondias purpurea), a Mesoamerican cultivated fruit tree. Sequences of the chloroplast spacer trnG-trnS were obtained for cultivated and wild S. purpurea trees, two sympatric taxa (Spondias mombin var. mombin and Spondias radlkoferi), and two outgroups (S. mombin var. globosa and Spondias testudinus). A phylogeographic approach was used and statistically significant associations of clades and geographical location were tested with a nested clade analysis. The sequences confirm that wild populations of S. purpurea are the likely progenitors of cultivated jocote trees. This study provides phylogeographic evidence of multiple domestications of this Mesoamerican cultivated fruit tree. Haplotypes detected in S. purpurea trees form two clusters, each of which includes alleles recovered in both cultivated and wild populations from distinct geographic regions. Cultivated S. purpurea populations have fewer unique trnG-trnS alleles than wild populations; however, five haplotypes were absent in the wild. The presence of unique alleles in cultivation may reflect contemporary extinction of the tropical dry forests of Mesoamerica. These data indicate that some agricultural habitats may be functioning as reservoirs of genetic variation in S. purpurea.

AB Quantitative tests of historical hypotheses are necessary to advance our understanding of biogeographic patterns of species distributions, but direct tests are often hampered by incomplete fossil or historical records. Here we present an alternative approach in which we develop a dynamic model that allows us to test hypotheses about regional rates of taxon origination, extinction, and dispersal using information on ages and current distributions of taxa. With this model, we test two assumptions traditionally made in the context of identifying regions as "centers of origin" - that regions with high origination rates will have high diversity and high endemism. We find that these assumptions are not necessarily valid. We also develop expressions for the regional age distributions of extant taxa and show that these may yield better insight into regional evolutionary rates. We then apply our model to data on the biogeography and ages of extant genera of marine bivalves and conclude that diversity in polar regions predominantly reflects dispersal of taxa that evolved elsewhere rather than in situ origination-extinction dynamics.

AB The study of interactions between small invertebrates and their larger plant and animal hosts has a long tradition. One persistent theme within this literature is that spatially-segregated populations of terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates commonly adapt to local hosts across their geographic ranges. Marine examples are rare, which leaves the impression that marine populations are less likely to adapt to locally abundant hosts and more likely to evolve generalized or phenotypically-plastic strategies. Here, I review a short but growing list of marine invertebrates that appear to display local adaptation in host use. As expected, most of the marine examples are brooded animals with weak dispersal potential. However, some species with pelagically dispersed larvae have apparently adapted to local hosts. This surprising result is consistent with recent evidence that pelagically-dispersed larvae are not always broadly dispersed, that strong selective pressures maintain local differences in host use, or both. The presence of host-mediated adaptation in the sea alters predictions on how marine communities respond to disturbance, supports the notion that marine consumer-prey interactions can coevolve, and indicates that hosts play fundamental roles in the differentiation and perhaps speciation of small marine invertebrates.

AB 1. It is theoretically well established that body mass in birds is the consequence of a trade-off between starvation risk and predation risk. There are, however, no studies of mass variation from sufficiently large wild populations to model in detail the range of diurnal and seasonal mass change patterns in natural populations and how these are linked to the complex environmental and biological variables that may affect the trade-off.
   2. This study used data on 17 000 individual blackbirds Turdus merula to model how mass changes diurnally and seasonally over the whole year and over a wide geographical area. Mass change was modelled in respect of temperature, rainfall, day length, geographical location, time of day and time of year and the results show how these mass changes vary with individual size, age and sex.
   3. The hypothesis that seasonal mass is optimized over the year and changes in line with predictors of foraging uncertainty was tested. As theory predicts, reduced day length and reduced temperature result in increased mass and the expected seasonal peak of mass in midwinter.
   4. The hypothesis that diurnal mass gain is optimized in terms of starvation-predation risk trade-off theory was also tested. The results provide the first empirical evidence for intraspecies seasonal changes in diurnal mass gain patterns. These changes are consistent with shifts in the relative importance of starvation risk and predation risk and with the theory of mass-dependent predation risk.
   5. In winter most mass was gained in the morning, consistent with reducing starvation risk. In contrast, during the August-November non-breeding period a bimodal pattern of mass gain, with increases just after dawn and before dusk, was adopted and the majority of mass gain occurred at the end of the day consistent with reducing mass-dependent predation risk.

AB We examined the principal effects of different information network topologies for local adaptive management of natural resources. We used computerized agents with adaptive decision algorithms with the following three fundamental constraints: (1) Complete understanding of the processes maintaining the natural resource can never be achieved, (2) agents can only learn by experimentation and information sharing, and (3) memory is limited. The agents were given the task to manage a system that had two states: one that provided high utility returns (desired) and one that provided low returns (undesired). In addition, the threshold between the states was close to the optimal return of the desired state. We found that networks of low to moderate link densities significantly increased the resilience of the utility returns. Networks of high link densities contributed to highly synchronized behavior among the agents, which caused occasional large-scale ecological crises between periods of stable and high utility returns. A constructed network involving a small set of experimenting agents was capable of combining high utility returns with high resilience, conforming to theories underlying the concept of adaptive comanagement. We conclude that (1) the ability to manage for resilience (i.e., to stay clear of the threshold leading to the undesired state as well as the ability to re-enter the desired state following a collapse) resides in the network structure and (2) in a coupled social-ecological system, the system-wide state transition occurs not because the ecological system flips into the undesired state, but because managers lose their capacity to reorganize back to the desired state.

AB Although it is widely acknowledged that our understanding of environmental systems cannot be reduced to single predictions and unique explanations, determinism remains a common strategy in physical geography. This paper argues for explicit assessments of uncertainty in environmental data and models as a necessary, although not a sufficient, condition for balancing uncertain scientific arguments against uncertain social, ethical, moral and legal arguments in managing environmental systems. In particular, this paper aims to: (1) demonstrate the importance of assessing uncertainty within a realist research framework; (2) consider the nature of scientific uncertainty as the basis for developing methodologies that question belief; and (3) explore some important aspects of a methodology for evaluating uncertainties in environmental research.

AB 1. Predictions about how species will respond to climate warming are based commonly on eco-physiological models or niche models. One critique of this practice is that it ignores interspecific interactions.
   2. We examined how resource competition affects the responses of two ciliate species, Colpidium striatum Stein and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn, to warming in laboratory microcosms.
   3. We found that warming had a negative effect on Colpidium abundance and a negligible effect on Paramecium abundance in the absence of interspecific competition. When Colpidium and Paramecium competed, however, Paramecium coexisted with Colpidium at low and high temperatures, and was competitively excluded at intermediate temperatures.
   4. Temperature-dependent strength of the interaction between Colpidium and Paramecium may explain the unexpected responses of Paramecium, which were inconsistent with its response to temperature in the absence of Colpidium.
   5. Our results provide further support for the important role of species interactions in understanding how species respond to environmental warming, and suggest that the complex interplay between species interactions and climate may make it extremely difficult to predict accurately how species embedded in complex communities will respond to climate warming.

AB More research is required to validate and refine natural abundance stable isotope ratio techniques as a tool. for the investigation of the feeding ecology of soil animals and trophic relations in soil food webs. Isotope ratios of C (delta(13)C) and N (delta(15)N) were measured in herbivorous and detritivorous invertebrate groups, namely lumbricid earthworms (7 species), enchytraeid worms (3 species), slugs Q taxa), and their potential food sources in an arable system. Intrapopulation delta(15)N variation in the slug Deroceras reticulatum (n = 52) was large (range 4.2%.), possibly reflecting spatial variability in the food sources. Significant correlations between C:N ratios and isotope ratios in earthworms suggest that factors other than feeding may influence isotopic patterns. One enchytraeid species, Enchytraeus buchholzi, was enriched in C-13 and strongly depleted in N-15 compared to all other groups. Invertebrates formed a continuum when considered in relation to C and N separately, but fell. into two distinct groups on the basis of combined C and N isotope ratios. The less enriched group represents herbivorous and titter-feeding species, while the more enriched group represents soil feeders. It is concluded that delta(13)C measurements could provide a means of assigning separate baseline delta(15)N values to primary and secondary decomposers, which in turn could improve the inference of higher trophic levels, omnivory and intraguild predation.

AB It has been argued that spatially explicit population models (SEPMs) cannot provide reliable guidance for conservation biology because of the difficulty of obtaining direct estimates for their demographic and dispersal parameters and because of error propagation. We argue that appropriate model calibration procedures can access additional sources of information, compensating the lack of direct parameter estimates. Our objective is to show how model calibration using population-level data can facilitate the construction of SEPMs that produce reliable predictions for conservation even when direct parameter estimates are inadequate. We constructed a spatially explicit and individual-based population model for the dynamics of brown bears (Ursus arctos) after a reintroduction program in Austria. To calibrate the model we developed a procedure that compared the simulated population dynamics with distinct features of the known population dynamics (= patterns). This procedure detected model parameterizations that did not reproduce the known dynamics. Global sensitivity analysis of the uncalibrated model revealed high uncertainty in most model predictions due to large parameter uncertainties (coefficients of variation CV approximate to 0.8). However, the calibrated model yielded predictions with considerably reduced uncertainty (CV approximate to 0.2). A pattern or a combination of various patterns that embed information on the entire model dynamics can reduce the uncertainty in model predictions, and the application of different patterns with high information content yields the same model predictions. In contrast, a pattern that does not embed information on the entire population dynamics (e.g., bear observations taken from sub-areas of the study area) does not reduce uncertainty in model predictions. Because population-level data for defining ( multiple) patterns are often available, our approach could be applied widely.

AB Contrary to large areas in Amazonia of tropical moist forests with a pronounced dry season, tropical wet forests in Costa Rica do not depend on deep roots to maintain an evergreen forest canopy through the year. At our Costa Rican tropical wet forest sites, we found a large carbon stock in the subsoil of deeply weathered Oxisols, even though only 0.04-0.2% of the measured root biomass (>2 mm diameter) to 3 m depth was below 2 m. In addition, we demonstrate that 20% or more of this deep soil carbon (depending on soil type) can be mobilized after forest clearing for pasture establishment. Microbial activity between 0.3 and 3 m depth contributed about 50% to the microbial activity in these soils, confirming the importance of the subsoil in C cycling. Depending on soil type, forest clearing for pasture establishment led from no change to a slight addition of carbon in the topsoil (0-0.3 m depth). However, this effect was countered by a substantial loss of C stocks in the subsoil (1-3 m depth). Our results show that large stocks of relatively labile carbon are not limited to areas with a prolonged dry season, but can also be found in deeply weathered soils below tropical wet forests. Forest clearing in such areas may produce unexpectedly high C losses from the subsoil.

Compared with the control, the 35% cut did not change transmitted light to the under story (<20% of full light), while the 50, 65, and 100% cuttings transmitted 30, 48, and 90% of full light, respectively, during the first summer. Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) suckering increased with percent basal area removal (p < 0.001). After 5 years, the 35 and 50% cuttings limited growth and survival of suckers (<1000 stems/ha, of which 5% are >1 m high), but the 65 and 100% cuttings favoured their development (8000 and 11 000 stems/ha, respectively, of which 29 and 38%, respectively, are >2 m high). Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) responded well to canopy opening alone with a maximal recruitment (31 000 seedlings/ha) in the 50% cut. Spruces (white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, and red spruce, Picea rubens Sarg.) establish following scarification only, with a better response in the 65% cut (32 000 seedlings/ha) than in the 50 (15 000), 35 (10 000), and 0% (8000) cuttings.

TI Landscape connectivity as a function of scale and organism vagility in a
   real forested landscape
SO CONSERVATION ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PATTERN; MARTEN; SIZE
AB Landscape connectivity is considered a vital element of landscape structure because of its importance to population survival. The difficulty surrounding the notion of landscape connectivity is that it must be assessed at the scale of the interaction between an organism and the landscape. We present a unique method for measuring connectivity between patches as a function of organism vagility. We used this approach to assess connectivity between harvest, old-growth, and recent wildfire patches in a real forested landscape in southeast British Columbia. By varying a distance criterion, habitat patches were considered connected and formed habitat clusters if they fell within this critical distance. The amount of area and distance to edge within clusters at each critical distance formed the basis of connectivity between patches. We then assessed landscape connectivity relative to old-growth associates within our study area based on species' dispersal abilities. Connectivity was greatest between harvest patches, followed by old-growth, and then wildfire patches. In old-growth patches, we found significant trends between increased connectivity and increased total habitat amount, and between decreased connectivity and increased old-growth harvesting. Highly vagile old-growth associates, such as carnivorous birds, perceive this landscape as connected and are able to access all patches. Smaller, less vagile species, such as woodpeckers, chickadees, and nuthatches, may be affected by a lack of landscape connectivity at the scale of their interaction with old-growth patches. Of particular concern is the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), which we predict is limited in this landscape due to relatively weak dispersal abilities.

AB Nested Glade analysis was applied to cytochrome b restriction site data previously obtained on 20 natural populations of the European rabbit across the Iberian Peninsula to test the hypothesis of postglacial dispersal from two main refugia, one in the northeast and the other in the southwest. Apart from historical fragmentation that resulted in geographic discontinuity of two distinct mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Glades A and B, patterns of haplotype genetic variability have been shaped mostly by restricted gene flow via isolation by distance. The distribution of tip versus interior haplotypes suggests that dispersal occurred from both the southwestern and northeastern groups. Dispersal from the southwest had a north and northwest direction, whereas from the northeast it had mostly a western and southern orientation, with subsequent overlap in a southeastern-northwestern axis across the Iberian Peninsula. The analysis of the pairwise mismatch distribution of a 179-181-bp fragment of the mtDNA control region, for sewn of those populations, further supports the idea that major patterns of dispersal were in the direction of central Iberia. Additionally, rabbit populations do not show signs of any significant loss of genetic diversity in the recent past, implying that they maintained large population sues and structure throughout the ice ages. This is congruent with the fact that the Iberian Peninsula was itself a glacial refugium during Quaternary ice ages. Nonetheless, climatic oscillations of this period, although certainly milder than in northern Europe, were cuff dent to affect the range distributions of Iberian organisms.

TI Modeling exploitation in recreational fisheries and implications for
   effort management on British Columbia rainbow trout lakes
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID FISH
AB We developed and evaluated a new model for predicting exploitation from recreational fishing effort. The model assumes that fish exchange between available and unavailable states and that fishery catches are taken only from the available pool. This limited vulnerability model exhibits a nonlinear, negative relationship between fishing effort and catch rate that manifests itself in the effort-exploitation relationship as an apparent decline in catchability with increasing effort. Decreasing catchability leads to an exploitation rate asymptote that may be less than unity as well as to a wide range of fishing effort over which exploitation is insensitive to changes in effort. Model predictions were consistent with the observed relationship between fishing effort and exploitation obtained front creel surveys and mark-recapture studies on rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss lakes in British Columbia. We combined the exploitation modeling approach with an age-structured model for a naturally reproducing rainbow trout population to evaluate both optimum fishing effort policies and critical fishing effort levels that lead to population collapse. Optimum fishing effort (+/-SD) was 18.8 +/- 3.7 angler-days/ha (AD/ha) for a stock that exhibits high recruitment compensation and 9.4 +/- 2.4 AD/ha for a stock with low recruitment compensation. Critical effort did not exist for the high-compensation scenario; the estimate of critical effort for the low-compensation scenario was 23.2 +/- 5.1 AD/ha. The estimator traditionally used to predict exploitation gave a poor fit to observed data, and resulting effort levels were twice those obtained front the limited vulnerability model.

AB In this study we assessed the impact of the spatial scale of analysis on patterns of latitudinal diversity of rocky intertidal invertebrates and on the relationship between local and regional species richness. Fifty-three wave-exposed sites were sampled along the coast of Chile between 18degrees40'S and 42degrees35'S, covering a range of over 2600 km and 25degrees of latitude. Three spatial scales were defined to analyze latitudinal trends of diversity: (1) regional, based on species range limits across the entire region (100s of km), (2) site, corresponding to hundreds of square meters sampled at each location, (3) sampling unit scale, corresponding roughly with a square meter of rocky shore. The analysis showed that spatial patterns of species richness and species turnover varied according to the scale used. At a regional scale, species richness showed a mid-latitudinal peak (i.e. around 30 to 32degreesS), decreasing toward northern and southern latitudes. No clear latitudinal trends in diversity were detected at site and especially at sampling unit scales. Despite the fact that at regional scale species turnover was low and geographically uniform, at the site scale beta diversity showed the existence of 2 zones of higher species turnover (19 to 20degreesS and 30 to 32 S), which may be attributed to changes in ecological and oceanographical regimes. The relationship between regional and local species richness changed depending on the 'local' scale used; unsaturated patterns (linear positive relationship between local and regional diversity) were evident at site scale, whereas saturated patterns (quadratic trend between local and regional diversity) were observed when the local scale was defined in terms of the sampling unit. We suggest that different regulating processes, operating at different spatial scales, may explain the latitudinal trends in diversity at site and sampling unit scales. While regional processes may set an upper limit in species richness at site scale, species interactions (e.g. competition) may control species richness at sampling unit scales. These findings question the current idea of the disproportionate prevalence of regional factors over local ones in determining diversity of local assemblages. They also suggest that regulation of local diversity results from the interplay of regional and local processes.

AB The concept of phenotypic trade-offs is a central element in evolutionary theory, In general, phenotypic models assume a fixed trade-off function, whereas quantitative genetic theory predicts that the trade-off function will change as a result of selection. For a linear trade-off function selection will readily change the intercept but will have to be relatively stronger to change the slope. We test these predictions by examining the trade-off between fecundity and flight capability, as measured by dorso-longitudinal muscle mass, in four different populations of the sand cricket, Gryllus firmus. Three populations were recently derived from the wild, and the fourth had been in the laboratory for 19 years. We hypothesized that the laboratory population had most likely undergone more and different selection from the three wild populations and therefore should differ from these in respect to both slope and intercept. Because of geographic variation in selection. we predicted a general difference in intercept among the four populations. We further tested the hypothesis that this intercept will be correlated with proportion macropterous and that this relationship will itself vary with environmental conditions experienced during both the nymphal and adult period. Observed variation in the phenotypic trade-off was consistent with the predictions of the quantitative genetic model, These results point to the importance of modeling trade-offs as dynamic rather than static relationships. We discuss how, phenotypic models can incorporate such variation. The phenotypic trade-off between fecundity and dorso-longitudinal muscle mass is determined in part by variation in body size, illustrating the necessity of considering trade-offs to be multifactorial rather than simply bivariate relationships.

AB A major challenge in studies of habitat fragmentation is to determine the influence of patch quality and landscape context on patch use by animals. Few studies have simultaneously examined effects of patch (area, shape, and vegetation structure) and landscape (e.g., amount of arboreal vegetation in close proximity) on abundance patterns of animals. In this study, we examined how these characteristics influence bird species distribution and abundance in a pasture-dominated landscape in the Los Tuxtlas region of Veracruz, Mexico. We focused on three types of landscape elements: forest edge sites (n = 8), forest remnants (n = 8), and riparian forest remnants (n = 9). We quantified habitat use and community composition of birds by conducting seven counts of birds in each site between October 1996 and April 1997. Species typically restricted to forest were influenced by two patch-level factors, whereas species not so restricted were influenced by both patch- and landscape-level factors. At a community level, bird assemblages were more similar among sites within a given habitat type than among types, when all three landscape elements were analyzed simultaneously. Stepwise redundancy analyses showed that the amount of continuous forest within 500 m of the site edge and the amount of arboreal vegetation cover within 100 m and between 100 and 500 m of the edge were most influential in separating bird assemblages found in forest edge sites from those found in remnants. In a second redundancy analysis based only on remnants, two patch-level variables (shape and area) and one landscape variable (amount of continuous forest within 500 m) largely separated forest remnants from riparian remnants. To manage birds in the fragmented Los Tuxtlas landscape, large forest blocks should be conserved because certain birds rely on this habitat. Remnants of various shapes and sizes should be conserved because they may provide habitat for species that are somewhat tolerant of forest disturbance as well as generalist species.

AB Vivipary with precocious seedlings in mangrove plants was thought to be a hindrance to long-range dispersal. To examine the extent of seedling dispersal across oceans, we investigated the phylogeny and genetic structure among East Asiatic populations of Kandelia candel based on organelle DNAs. In total, three, 28 and seven haplotypes of the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) atpB-rbcL spacer, cpDNA trnL-trnF spacer, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS) were identified, respectively, from 202 individuals. Three data sets suggested consistent phylogenies recovering two differentiated lineages corresponding to geographical regions, i.e. northern South-China-Sea + East-China-Sea region and southern South-China-Sea region (Sarawak). Phylogenetically, the Sarawak population was closely related to the Ranong population of western Peninsula Malaysia instead of other South-China-Sea populations, indicating its possible origin from the Indian Ocean Rim. No geographical subdivision was detected within the northern geographical region. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed low levels of genetic differentiation between and within mainland and island populations (Phi (CT)=0.0151 Phi (SC) = 0.037), indicating conspicuous long-distance seedling dispersal across oceans. Significant linkage disequilibrium excluded the possibility of recurrent homoplasious mutations as the major force causing phylogenetic discrepancy between mtDNA and the trnL-trnF spacer within the northern region. Instead, relative ages of alleles contributed to nonrandom chlorotype-mitotype associations and tree inconsistency. Widespread distribution and random associations (chi (2) = 0.822, P = 0.189) of eight hypothetical ancestral cytotypes indicated the panmixis of populations of the northern. geographical region as a whole. In contrast, rare and recently evolved alleles were restricted to marginal populations, revealing some preferential directional migration.

AB Leaf gas exchange responses to elevated CO2 and N are presented for 13 perennial species, representing four functional groups: C-3 grasses, C-4 grasses, legumes, and nonleguminous forbs. Understanding how CO2 and N effects interact is important to predict plant community response to global change.
   Plants were field-grown in monoculture under current ambient and elevated (560 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentrations (free-air CO2 enrichment), in combination with soil N treatments, for two growing seasons.
   All species, regardless of functional group, showed pronounced photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2, resulting in minimal stimulation of photosynthesis (A) averaging +15% in C-3 grasses, +8% in forbs, +7% in legumes and -2% in C-4 grasses. The effects of CO, and soil N supply did not interact for any leaf traits measured. Elevated CO2 consistently decreased stomatal conductance (g(s)) leading to 40% increase in A/g(s).
   This substantial acclimation of photosynthesis was greater in magnitude than in most field studies, and was associated with the combined effects of decreased g(s) and decreased leaf N concentrations in response to growth under elevated CO2.

AB Ground-occurring Coleoptera were sampled over 2 years using pitfall traps in 23 northern hardwood or eastern hemlock-dominated sites representing even-aged, uneven-aged, or old growth forests. Overall, 65,586 individuals were obtained, representing 33 families and 192 species. Carabids comprised 54% of the total catch in 1996, when all the families were tallied. There was little variation in the number and relative abundance of carabid species caught between seasons. No differences in overall species richness or abundance were observed among forest management regimes or habitat types. However, there were substantial differences in species composition. Thirteen species showed significant habitat associations among the five forest management regimes, and 21 species were associated with specific habitat features of the sites, such as dominant tree species or canopy structure. More species (16) were affected by the presence of forest management than by tree species dominance (6) or canopy structure (5). Halpalus fulvilabris, Pterostichus coracinus, Carabus nemoralis, Glischrochilus siepmanni, Nicrophorus orbicollis, and Nicrophorus sayi were more commonly caught in managed than in old growth forest sites, while Carabus sylvosus, Platynus decentis and Oiceoptoma novaboracensis were more commonly associated with old growth sites. Calosoma frigidum and Necrophila americana were associated with northern hardwood sites, while Platynus decentis was significantly associated with sites dominated by eastern hemlock. Calosoma frigidum,, Necrophila americana, and Nicrophorus vespilloides were more common in even-aged sites, while a lampyrid and a leiodid morphospecies were more common in sites with an uneven-aged canopy structure. The importance of microsite features was reflected in the high variability observed among sites and among traps within sites. Results indicate that conservation of a range of forest types is required in order to maintain the diversity of ground-occurring beetles on a regional scale. This will be quite challenging, since forest types such as old growth hemlock-hardwood are rare across the landscape due to habitat fragmentation and logging. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB When wetland restoration includes re-establishing native plant taxa as an objective, an understanding of the variables driving the development of plant communities is necessary. With this in mind, we examined soil and physiographic characteristics of depressional wetlands of three vegetation types (cypress-gum swamps, cypress savannas, and grass-sedge marshes) located in a fire-maintained longleaf pine ecosystem in southwestern Georgia, USA. Our objective was to establish whether plant community development in these wetlands is controlled primarily by hydrogeomorphic features or by different disturbance histories. We did not identify physical features that uniquely separate the wetland vegetation types. Instead, we observed a range of topo-edaphic conditions that likely drive variations in hydrologic regimes, which in turn, are probable influences on fire regime. We propose that several long-term successional trajectories may be initiated in the prolonged absence of fire, altered hydrology, or both, which link the distinctive vegetation types. Thus, a range of vegetation types may be suitable as potential restoration goals for these depressional wetlands. We suggest that the opportunities or constraints for use of prescribed fire in the long-term management of restored wetlands and adjacent uplands should be a significant consideration in the development of restoration strategies targeting specific plant communities.

AB Separating the confounding effects of long-term population history from gene flow can he difficult. Here, we address the question of what inferences about gene flow can be made from mitochondrial sequence data in three closely related species of mosquitoes, Anopheles dirus species A, C, and D, from southeast Asia. A total of 84 sequences of 923 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene were obtained from 14 populations in Thailand, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. The genealogy of sequences obtained from two populations of Ail. dirus C indicates no contemporary gene flow between them. The F-ST value of 0.421 therefore probably represents a recent common history, perhaps involving colonization events. Anopheles dirus A and D are parapatric. yet no differentiation was seen either within or between species. The starlike genealogy of their haplotypes, smooth unimodal mismatch distributions, and excess of low frequency mutations indicate population expansion in Ail. dirus A and D. This, rather than widespread gene flow, explains their low within-species F-ST values (0.018 and 0.022). The greater genetic diversity of An. dirus D suggests that expansion occurred first in species D and subsequently in species A. The current geographical separation and low hybrid fitness of these species also argue against ongoing interspecific gene how. They suggest instead either historical introgression of mtDNA from An. dirus D into species A followed by independent range expansions, or a selective sweep of mtDNA that originated in An. dirus D. While not excluding contemporary gene flow, historical population processes are sufficient to explain the data in An. dirus A and D. The genealogical relationships between haplotypes could not be used to make inferences of gene flow because of extensive homoplasy due to hypervariable sites and possibly also recombination. However, it is concluded that this approach, rather than the use of fixation indices, is required in the future to understand contemporary gene flow in these mosquitoes. The implications of these results Tor understanding gene flow in another important and comparable group of malaria vector mosquitoes in Africa, the An. gambiae complex, are also discussed.

AB Models of habitat associations for species often are developed with an implicit assumption that habitats are static, even though recent disturbance may have altered the landscape. We tested our hypothesis that trajectory and magnitude of habitat change influenced observed distribution and abundance of passerine birds breeding in shrubsteppe habitats of southwestern Idaho. Birds in this region live in dynamic landscapes undergoing predominantly large-scale, radical, and unidirectional habitat change because wildfires are converting shrublands into expanses of exotic annual grasslands. We used data from field surveys and satellite image analyses in a series of redundancy analyses to partition variances and to determine the relative contribution of habitat change and current landscapes. Although current habitats explained a greater proportion of total variation, changes in habitat and measures of habitat richness and texture also contributed to variation in abundance of Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris), Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri), and Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli). Abundance of birds was insensitive to scale for nonspatial habitat variables. In contrast, spatial measures of habitat richness and texture in the landscape were significant only at large spatial scales. Abundance of Horned Larks, Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), and Brewer's Sparrows, but not Sage Thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus) or Sage Sparrows, was positively correlated with changes toward stable habitats. Because dominant habitat changes were toward less stable conditions, regional declines of those birds in shrubsteppe habitats reflect current landscapes as well as the history, magnitude, and trajectory of habitat change.

AB Information on the dynamics of sapling growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var, glauca (Beissn.) France) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm), two dominant species in the interior of British Columbia, Canada, is incomplete and thus the objective of this study was to understand how light availability and sapling size interact to influence their growth and crown morphology. in an undisturbed forest, 360 saplings were randomly selected in three light classes 0-15, 15-30, and >30% PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density). A number of morphological and growth parameters were measured, including height and lateral branch growth. Douglas-fir had a more plastic crown morphology than lodgepole pine with its leader to lateral branch growth ratio, live crown depth, and number of branches increasing with increasing light class. Sapling size had little effect on morphological characteristics, but larger saplings of both species had greater absolute height growth and lateral branch growth than did smaller saplings. Both Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine were able to survive up to 50 years and attain a height of 3 m at less than 5% PPFD. These results further suggest that shade tolerance is greater on drier sites, although the mechanisms for such increases in tolerance are unknown. The ecological implications of these findings are discussed in a forestry context.

AB Changes in the growing-season lengths of temperate trees greatly affect biotic interactions and global carbon balance. Yet future growing-season trajectories remain highly uncertain because the environmental drivers of autumn leaf senescence are poorly understood. Using experiments and long-term observations, we show that increases in spring and summer productivity due to elevated carbon dioxide, temperature, or light levels drive earlier senescence. Accounting for this effect improved the accuracy of senescence predictions by 27 to 42% and reversed future predictions from a previously expected 2- to 3-week delay over the rest of the century to an advance of 3 to 6 days. These findings demonstrate the critical role of sink limitation in governing the end of seasonal activity and reveal important constraints on future growing-season lengths and carbon uptake of trees.

AB The increasing urbanization process is hypothesized to drastically alter (semi-)natural environments with a concomitant major decline in species abundance and diversity. Yet, studies on this effect of urbanization, and the spatial scale at which it acts, are at present inconclusive due to the large heterogeneity in taxonomic groups and spatial scales at which this relationship has been investigated among studies. Comprehensive studies analysing this relationship across multiple animal groups and at multiple spatial scales are rare, hampering the assessment of how biodiversity generally responds to urbanization. We studied aquatic (cladocerans), limno-terrestrial (bdelloid rotifers) and terrestrial (butterflies, ground beetles, ground- and web spiders, macro-moths, orthopterans and snails) invertebrate groups using a hierarchical spatial design, wherein three local-scale (200 m x 200 m) urbanization levels were repeatedly sampled across three landscape-scale (3 km x 3 km) urbanization levels. We tested for local and landscape urbanization effects on abundance and species richness of each group, whereby total richness was partitioned into the average richness of local communities and the richness due to variation among local communities. Abundances of the terrestrial active dispersers declined in response to local urbanization, with reductions up to 85% for butterflies, while passive dispersers did not show any clear trend. Species richness also declined with increasing levels of urbanization, but responses were highly heterogeneous among the different groups with respect to the richness component and the spatial scale at which urbanization impacts richness. Depending on the group, species richness declined due to biotic homogenization and/or local species loss. This resulted in an overall decrease in total richness across groups in urban areas. These results provide strong support to the general negative impact of urbanization on abundance and species richness within habitat patches and highlight the importance of considering multiple spatial scales and taxa to assess the impacts of urbanization on biodiversity.

AB Models of plant water fluxes have evolved from studies focussed on understanding the detailed structure and functioning of specific components of the soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum to architectures often incorporated inside eco-hydrological and terrestrial biosphere (TB) model schemes. We review here the historical evolution of this field, examine the basic structure of a simplified individual-based model of plant water transport, highlight selected applications for specific ecological problems and conclude by examining outstanding issues requiring further improvements in modelling vegetation water fluxes. We particularly emphasise issues related to the scaling from tissue-level traits to individual-based predictions of water transport, the representation of nonlinear and hysteretic behaviour in soil-xylem hydraulics and the need to incorporate knowledge of hydraulics within broader frameworks of plant ecological strategies and their consequences for predicting community demography and dynamics.

AB Full-subsets information theoretic approaches are becoming an increasingly popular tool for exploring predictive power and variable importance where a wide range of candidate predictors are being considered. Here, we describe a simple function in the statistical programming language R that can be used to construct, fit, and compare a complete model set of possible ecological or environmental predictors, given a response variable of interest and a starting generalized additive (mixed) model fit. Main advantages include not requiring a complete model to be fit as the starting point for candidate model set construction (meaning that a greater number of predictors can potentially be explored than might be available through functions such as dredge); model sets that include interactions between factors and continuous nonlinear predictors; and automatic removal of models with correlated predictors (based on a user defined criterion for exclusion). The function takes continuous predictors, which are fitted using smoothers via either gam, gamm (mgcv) or gamm4, as well as factor variables which are included on their own or as two-level interaction terms within the gam smooth (via use of the by argument), or with themselves. The function allows any model to be constructed and used as a null model, and takes a range of arguments that allow control over the model set being constructed, including specifying cyclic and linear continuous predictors, specification of the smoothing algorithm used, and the maximum complexity allowed for smooth terms. The use of the function is demonstrated via case studies that highlight how appropriate model sets can be easily constructed and the broader utility of the approach for exploratory ecology.

AB To understand ecological phenomena, it is necessary to observe their behaviour across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Since this need was first highlighted in the 1980s, technology has opened previously inaccessible scales to observation. To help to determine whether there have been corresponding changes in the scales observed by modern ecologists, we analysed the resolution, extent, interval and duration of observations (excluding experiments) in 348 studies that have been published between 2004 and 2014. We found that observational scales were generally narrow, because ecologists still primarily use conventional field techniques. In the spatial domain, most observations had resolutions <= 1 m(2) and extents 10,000 ha. In the temporal domain, most observations were either unreplicated or infrequently repeated (>1month interval) and <= 1 year in duration. Compared with studies conducted before 2004, observational durations and resolutions appear largely unchanged, but intervals have become finer and extents larger. We also found a large gulf between the scales at which phenomena are actually observed and the scales those observations ostensibly represent, raising concerns about observational comprehensiveness. Furthermore, most studies did not clearly report scale, suggesting that it remains a minor concern. Ecologists can better understand the scales represented by observations by incorporating autocorrelation measures, while journals can promote attentiveness to scale by implementing scale-reporting standards.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) is primarily associated with decline in immune health status. As gut microbiome (GM) is implicated in the regulation of host immunity and metabolism, here we investigate GM alteration in TB patients by 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The study group constituted of patients with pulmonary TB and their healthy household contacts as controls (HCs). Significant alteration of microbial taxonomic and functional capacity was observed in patients with active TB as compared to the HCs. We observed that Prevotella and Bifidobacterium abundance were associated with HCs, whereas butyrate and propionate-producing bacteria like Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Eubacterium and Phascolarctobacterium were significantly enriched in TB patients. Functional analysis showed reduced biosynthesis of vitamins and amino acids in favour of enriched metabolism of butyrate and propionate in TB subjects. The TB subjects were also investigated during the course of treatment, to analyse the variation of GM. Although perturbation in microbial composition was still evident after a month's administration of anti-TB drugs, significant changes were observed in metagenome gene pool that pointed towards recovery in functional capacity. Therefore, the findings from this pilot study suggest that microbial dysbiosis may contribute to pathophysiology of TB by enhancing the anti-inflammatory milieu in the host.

AB The core properties of microbial genomes, including GC content and genome size, are known to vary widely among different bacteria and archaea(1,2). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this genomic variability, but the fundamental drivers that shape bacterial and archaeal genomic properties remain uncertain(3-7). Here, we report the existence of a sharp genomic transition zone below the photic zone, where bacterial and archaeal genomes and proteomes undergo a community-wide punctuated shift. Across a narrow range of increasing depth of just tens of metres, diverse microbial clades trend towards larger genome size, higher genomic GC content, and proteins with higher nitrogen but lower carbon content. These community-wide changes in genome features appear to be driven by gradients in the surrounding environmental energy and nutrient fields. Collectively, our data support hypotheses invoking nutrient limitation as a central driver in the evolution of core bacterial and archaeal genomic and proteomic properties.

AB Invasive alien species are a major problem for managers of protected areas (PAs) worldwide. Until the 1980s biological invasions were widely considered to be largely confined to anthropogenically disturbed sites and the widespread disruption of ecosystems in PAs by invasive species was not globally perceived as a major threat. A working group of the SCOPE program on biological invasions in the 1980s showed that PAs are not spared from major disruptive effects of invasions. Early research focused on descriptive studies of the extent to which PAs were invaded. More recent research explored drivers of invasion, and in the last decade much work has focused on understanding the impacts of invasions. We review the current understanding of alien plant invasions in PAs, focusing on four themes: (1) the status and macroecological patterns of alien plant invasions; (2) the threats that invasive alien plants (IAPs) pose and the impacts detected to date; (3) the current focus of invasion science in PAs; and (4) research priorities for advancing science-based management and policy. Of a sample of 59 widespread IAP species from a representative sample of 135 PAs globally, trees make up the largest proportion (32%), followed by perennial herbs (17%) and shrubs (15%). About 1857 papers have been published on alien species in PAs; 45% have focused on alien plants. Some textbook examples of impacts by IAPs originate from PAs, illustrating the severe threat to the core function of PAs. Impacts have been quantified at the species and community levels through the displacement and alteration of habitats. In some cases, native species abundance, diversity and estimated species richness have been altered, but reversed following control. At an ecosystem level, invasive plants have radically altered fire regimes in several PAs, in some cases causing regime shifts and transforming woodlands or savannas to grasslands. Invasions have also had a major impact on nutrient cycles. Protected areas are performing an increasingly important part of the global response to stem the rate of environmental change. Despite this, integrated efforts involving science, management and policy that are sufficiently resourced to generate insights on the status and dynamics of IAPs in PAs are insufficient or even lacking. Such efforts are needed to pave the way for monitoring trends, revising legislation and policies, and improving management interventions to reduce the extent and magnitude of impacts of invasive plants in PAs. While policy instruments to support management of non-native species date back to the 1930s, there has been a substantial increase in legislative support and general awareness since the early 2000s. Still, opportunities to improve research for PAs need to be created. Towards this goal, the establishment of a global PA research network could provide a unique vehicle to explore questions across species or functional groups and systems, at a scale currently beyond existing abilities. Developing an integrated global database with standardized, quantitative information could form part of such a networks function.

AB Macroecology and biogeography are concerned with understanding biodiversity patterns across space and time. In the past, the two disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations. Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models, identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field. Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the field towards such a systems macroecology' will test and improve our understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.

AB Urban green spaces provide ecosystem services, including climate regulation, food, and opportunities for recreation. The quantity and structure of green space in a city may therefore have consequences for human well-being. Cities in Southeast Asia are rapidly changing as they must accommodate larger populations, and their residents are becoming wealthier. Such changes may have impacts on urban green spaces and the ecosystem services that they provide. To assess the potential impacts of future urbanisation in the region, we analysed existing relationships between city size, wealth, and population density, and (1) the percentage cover of green space, (2) the quantity of green space per capita, and (3) the aggregation of green space. We used remote sensing analysis of Landsat 7 data to classify green space in 111 urban areas in Southeast Asia. Cities with higher population densities had less green space and less green space per capita. Cities with higher GDP per capita had higher percentage coverage of green space. Larger cities had lower percentage coverage of green space and less green space per capita. Cities with higher percentage cover of green space had more aggregated green spaces. Authorities in developing cities should consider protecting ecological assets such as remnant forest patches and river corridors, as re-creating habitats at a later stage of development rarely provides comparable levels of ecosystem services.

AB Context Hill stations are known for their favorable cool climate and natural environments which generate valuable ecosystem services that benefit the local population, tourists and visitors. However, rapid urbanization threatens the sustainability of these highly valued fragile landscapes.
   Objectives We aim to characterize and quantify the changes in the landscape patterns and ecosystem service values (ESVs) of Baguio (Philippines), Bogor (Indonesia), Dalat (Vietnam), and Pyin Oo Lwin (Myanmar), and discuss their implications to landscape sustainability.
   Methods We used remote sensing imagery to map land-use/cover (2001 and 2014), and spatial metrics and gradient analysis to characterize the changes in landscape pattern. We employed a benefit transfer method to estimate the changes in ESV and human-to-ESV ratio. A land-change model was used to simulate different scenarios of future built-up expansions (2014-2030).
   Results The landscapes of Dalat and Pyin Oo Lwin are becoming more fragmented, while those of Baguio and Bogor are getting more aggregated. Dalat had the highest decrease (absolute change) in ESV and H-ESV ratio, while Bogor had the highest percentage decrease (2001-2014).
   Conclusions Rapid urbanization has been a major factor in the landscape transformation of Baguio, Bogor, Dalat and Pyin Oo Lwin. If the current built-up expansion rate will speed up, the decline in future ESV and H-ESV ratio (2014-2030) will be higher than if the rate will continue or slow down. Unless the concept of landscape sustainability is taken seriously in landscape and urban planning, the respective 'values' of these precious hill stations will become less and less.

AB Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition or fertilization has been found to significantly affect carbon (C) cycling. However, a comprehensive understanding of how different C chemical components of plant, litter, and soil would respond to external N addition is still lacking. We compiled data of 1,160 observations from 52 individual studies and conducted a meta--analysis of N addition effects on 18 variables related to C chemical compositions in terrestrial ecosystems. Results showed that plant lignin (+7.13%), plant protein (+25.94%), and soil lignin (+7.30%) were significantly increased by N addition, and plant hemicellulose (-4.39%) was significantly decreased, whereas plant fiber, plant cellulose, plant non-structural carbohydrate (NSC), litter lignin, and litter cellulose were not significantly changed. The effects of N addition on C chemical composition varied among different ecosystems/plant types and different forms of N addition. Increasing treatment duration did not significantly change the effects of N addition on the chemical composition of plant, litter, and soil C. With increasing N addition rate, the effect of N addition on plant lignin, plant fiber, plant cellulose, and plant protein increased, while the effect of N addition on plant hemicellulose, plant NSC, and litter cellulose became more negative. Our meta--analysis provided a systematic evaluation of the responses of different C chemical components to N addition in the plant-litter-soil continuum. Results suggest that the change of plant and soil C chemical composition under N addition may be beneficial for ecosystem C sequestration and could affect ecosystem structure and function in the future.

AB Over 20 species of asteroids were devastated by a sea star wasting disease (SSWD) epizootic, linked to a densovirus, from Mexico to Alaska in 2013 and 2014. For Pisaster ochraceus from the San Juan Islands, South Puget Sound and Washington outer coast, time-series monitoring showed rapid disease spread, high mortality rates in 2014, and continuing levels of wasting in the survivors in 2015. Peak prevalence of disease at 16 sites ranged to 100%, with an overall mean of 61%. Analysis of longitudinal data showed disease risk was correlated with both size and temperature and resulted in shifts in population size structure; adult populations fell to one quarter of pre-outbreak abundances. In laboratory experiments, time between development of disease signs and death was influenced by temperature in adults but not juveniles and adult mortality was 18% higher in the 19 degrees C treatment compared to the lower temperature treatments. While larger ochre stars developed disease signs sooner than juveniles, diseased juveniles died more quickly than diseased adults. Unusual 2-3 degrees C warm temperature anomalies were coincident with the summer 2014 mortalities. We suggest these warm waters could have increased the disease progression and mortality rates of SSWD in Washington State.

AB Agroforestry offers proven strategies as an environmentally benign and ecologically sustainable land management practice to promote ecosystem services. In this literature review, we systematically consider the agroforestry and ecosystem services literature with the aim to identify and catalogue the knowledge field and provide the first systematic synthesis of ecosystem services research in relation to European agroforestry. We reviewed 71 scientific publications from studies conducted in farmland and forest ecosystems with various types of agroforestry management. Each publication was systematically characterized and classified by agroforestry practice and research approach in order to provide an insight into the current research state in addressing ecosystem services (including methods, indicators, and approaches). Spatial distribution of the case study sites in Europe was also explored. In addition, typical clusters of similar research approaches were identified.
   The results show that ecosystem service assessment of European agroforestry is currently focused on the spatially extensive wood pastures in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Continental agricultural mosaic landscapes. A specific emphasis has been on regulating, supporting, and provisioning services, such as provision of habitat and biodiversity, food, climate regulation, fibre, and fuel, and the consideration of cultural services has been largely limited to aesthetic value. There is a bias to biophysical and monetary research approaches. The majority of the studies focus on quantitative methods and biophysical field measurements addressing the assessment of only one or two services. Monetary approaches have been applied in less than one fifth of the studies but form a distinctive group.
   Our results highlight gaps and biases in the ecosystem service research agenda within agroforestry based on which we conclude that research should aim to diversify from the biophysical and monetary approaches, towards a wider variety of approaches, especially socio-cultural, and a wider coverage of ecosystem services, Stronger consideration of stakeholder participation and introduction of spatially explicit mapping are also important key actions. We make suggestions to advance the promise of ecosystem services provision from European agroforestry in decision making including various actors, stakeholders, and institutions, with strong links to policy processes, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy and Common Agricultural Policy.

AB A common approach to the conservation of farmland biodiversity and the promotion of multifunctional landscapes, particularly in landscapes containing only small remnants of non-crop habitats, has been to maintain landscape heterogeneity and reduce land-use intensity. In contrast, it has recently been shown that devoting specific areas of non-crop habitats to conservation, segregated from high-yielding farmland ("land sparing"), can more effectively conserve biodiversity than promoting low-yielding, less intensively managed farmland occupying larger areas ("land sharing"). In the present paper we suggest that the debate over the relative merits of land sparing or land sharing is partly blurred by the differing spatial scales at which it is suggested that land sparing should be applied. We argue that there is no single correct spatial scale for segregating biodiversity protection and commodity production in multifunctional landscapes. Instead we propose an alternative conceptual construct, which we call "multiple-scale landsparing," targeting biodiversity and ecosystem services in transformed landscapes. We discuss how multiple-scale land sparing may overcome the apparent dichotomy between land sharing and land sparing and help to find acceptable compromises that conserve biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality.

AB Habitat loss is the greatest threat to biodiversity and rapid, human-forced climate change is likely to exacerbate this. Here we present the first global assessment of current and potential future impacts on biodiversity of a habitat loss and fragmentation-climate change (HLF-CC) interaction. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the negative impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation have been disproportionately severe in areas with high temperatures in the warmest month and declining rainfall, although impacts also varied across vegetation types. We compiled an integrated global database of past, current and future climate variables and past vegetation loss to identify ecoregions where (i) past climate change is most likely to have exacerbated the impacts of HLF, and (ii) forecasted climate change is most likely to exacerbate the impacts of HLF in the future. We found that recent climate change is likely (probability >66%) to have exacerbated the impacts of HLF in 120 (18.5%) ecoregions. Impacted ecoregions are disproportionately biodiverse, containing over half (54.1%) of all known terrestrial amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species. Forecasts from the RCP8.5 emissions scenario suggest that nearly half of ecoregions globally (n = 283, 43.5%) will become impacted during the 21st century. To minimize ongoing and future HLF-CC impacts on biodiversity, ecoregions where impacts are most likely must become priorities for proactive conservation actions that avoid loss of native vegetation (e.g., protected area establishment). Highly degraded ecoregions where impacts are most likely should be priorities for restoration and candidates for unconventional conservation actions (e.g. translocation of species).

AB Background and Aims Extreme climatic events such as severe droughts are expected to increase with climate change and to limit grassland perennity. The present study aimed to characterize the adaptive responses by which temperate herbaceous grassland species resist, survive and recover from a severe drought and to explore the relationships between plant resource use and drought resistance strategies.
   Methods Monocultures of six native perennial species from upland grasslands and one Mediterranean drought-resistant cultivar were compared under semi-controlled and non-limiting rooting depth conditions. Above- and below-ground traits were measured under irrigation in spring and during drought in summer (50 d of withholding water) in order to characterize resource use and drought resistance strategies. Plants were then rehydrated and assessed for survival (after 15 d) and recovery (after 1 year).
   Key Results Dehydration avoidance through water uptake was associated with species that had deep roots (> 1 center dot 2 m) and high root mass (> 4 kg m(-3)). Cell membrane stability ensuring dehydration tolerance of roots and meristems was positively correlated with fructan content and negatively correlated with sucrose content. Species that survived and recovered best combined high resource acquisition in spring (leaf elongation rate > 9 mm d(-1) and rooting depth > 1 center dot 2 m) with both high dehydration avoidance and tolerance strategies.
   Conclusions Most of the native forage species, dominant in upland grassland, were able to survive and recover from extreme drought, but with various time lags. Overall the results suggest that the wide range of interspecific functional strategies for coping with drought may enhance the resilience of upland grassland plant communities under extreme drought events.

AB How ecological and morphological diversity accrues over geological time has been much debated by paleobiologists. Evidence from the fossil record suggests that many clades reach maximal diversity early in their evolutionary history, followed by a decline in evolutionary rates as ecological space fills or due to internal constraints. Here, we apply recently developed methods for estimating rates of morphological evolution during the post-Paleozoic history of a major invertebrate clade, the Echinoidea. Contrary to expectation, rates of evolution were lowest during the initial phase of diversification following the Permo-Triassic mass extinction and increased over time. Furthermore, although several subclades show high initial rates and net decreases in rates of evolution, consistent with "early bursts" of morphological diversification, at more inclusive taxonomic levels, these bursts appear as episodic peaks. Peak rates coincided with major shifts in ecological morphology, primarily associated with innovations in feeding strategies. Despite having similar numbers of species in today's oceans, regular echinoids have accrued far less morphological diversity than irregular echinoids due to lower intrinsic rates of morphological evolution and less morphological innovation, the latter indicative of constrained or bounded evolution. These results indicate that rates of evolution are extremely heterogenous through time and their interpretation depends on the temporal and taxonomic scale of analysis.

AB The rapid urbanization of the world has significant ecological consequences that shape global biodiversity patterns. The plant communities now common in urban centers may represent new habitats with unique dynamics and the potential for highly modified ecological services. This study, joining extensive spatial and floristic data sets, examined current distribution patterns of non-native and native woody plant species in the New York metropolitan region, USA. We joined the New York Metropolitan Flora (NYMF) database of woody species with GIS data of urban land cover for 297 5 km by 5 km landscape blocks. We tested the relationship between urbanization and native and non-native species richness patterns, the extent of non-native species presence in the urban area, and the change in beta diversity across a gradient of urban land cover. We found that across the urban-rural gradient, native plant species richness decreased and non-native species richness increased with increasing urban land cover. Total richness does not change across the urban-rural gradient. Our analyses show that these patterns are highly correlated with urbanization, but vary across the New Jersey landscape. We also found an increase in beta diversity with urbanization; urban areas are not homogenized in plant species composition compared to rural areas. Here we show a species-rich flora dominated by non-native species which are differentiating the urban flora. These results can help guide appropriate conservation decisions for the maintenance of plant biodiversity in cities.

AB Change in river water temperature has important consequences for the environment and people. This review provides a new perspective on the topic by evaluating changes in river water temperature for the UK over the 20th century and possible changes over the 21st century. There is limited knowledge of space-time variability in, and controls on, river temperature at the region scale and beyond over the 20th century. There is historical evidence that UK river temperature has increased in the latter part of the 20th century, but low agreement on the attribution of changes to climatic warming because river temperature is a complex, dynamic response to climate and hydrological patterns moderated by basin properties and anthropogenic impacts. Literature is scarce to evaluate changes to UK river temperature in the 21st century, but it appears as likely as not that UK river temperature will increase in the future. However, there are a number of interlinked sources of uncertainty (related to observations, scenarios, process interactions and feedback) that make estimating direction and rate of temperature change for rivers across the UK with confidence very challenging. Priority knowledge gaps are identified that must be addressed to improve understanding of past, contemporary and future river temperature change.

AB Thirty streams were surveyed in urban and natural settings in the municipality of Manaus in the central Amazon basin (Brazil) with the objective of identifying the species of adult odonates that can be used as bioindicators of environmental quality. The data collected were used to test the hypothesis that species in the suborder Zygoptera are indicators of better-preserved environments due to their smaller body sizes and reduced tolerances to habitat modification, whereas species in the suborder Anisoptera were presumed to be indicators of impacted habitats with no vegetation. The habitats were classified as preserved, intermediate, and degraded, based on their environmental characteristics. A total of 908 specimens were collected, representing 60 species. The results of the indicator value (IndVal) identified 13 species as indicators of environmental quality, of which nine were typical of preserved habitats, two of intermediate habitats, and four of modified habitats (intermediate or degraded). Odonate species richness declined with increasing urbanization, a pattern also presented by the zygopterans, although anisopteran species richness was higher in intermediate habitats. Zygopteran species showed high fidelity/specificity for preserved habitats, although a small number of the species of this suborder showed a similar relationship with intermediate or degraded habitats, whereas anisopterans were associated only with disturbed habitats (intermediate and degraded). Overall, the results indicate that the diagnosis of the adult odonate community can provide a rapid and effective tool for evaluation of environmental quality. As many species are stenotopic, they can be used as indicators of good habitat quality, whereas some of the more eurytopic species can indicate disturbed habitats. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Riparian vegetation is exposed to stress from inundation and hydraulic disturbance, and is often rich in native and alien plant species. We describe 35 traits that enable plants to cope with riparian conditions. These include traits for tolerating or avoiding anoxia and enabling underwater photosynthesis, traits that confer resistance and resilience to hydraulic disturbance, and attributes that facilitate dispersal, such as floating propagules. This diversity of life-history strategies illustrates that there are many ways of sustaining life in riparian zones, which helps to explain high riparian biodiversity. Using community assembly theory, we examine how adaptations to inundation, disturbance and dispersal shape plant community composition along key environmental gradients, and how human actions have modified communities. Dispersal-related processes seem to explain many patterns, highlighting the influence of regional processes on local species assemblages. Using alien plant invasions like an (uncontrolled) experiment in community assembly, we use an Australian and a global dataset to examine possible causes of high degrees of riparian invasion. We found that high proportions of alien species in the regional species pools have invaded riparian zones, despite not being riparian specialists, and that riparian invaders disperse in more ways, including by water and humans, than species invading other ecosystems.

AB Parenting behaviors, such as the provisioning of food by parents to offspring, are known to be highly responsive to changes in environment. However, we currently know little about how such flexibility affects the ways in which parenting is adapted and evolves in response to environmental variation. This is because few studies quantify how individuals vary in their response to changing environments, especially social environments created by other individuals with which parents interact. Social environmental factors differ from nonsocial factors, such as food availability, because parents and offspring both contribute and respond to the social environment they experience. This interdependence leads to the coevolution of flexible behaviors involved in parenting, which could, paradoxically, constrain the ability of individuals to rapidly adapt to changes in their nonsocial environment.

AB The influence of environmental change on species interactions will affect population dynamics and community structure in the future, but our current understanding of the outcomes of species interactions in a high-CO2 world is limited. Here, we draw upon emerging experimental research examining the effects of ocean acidification on coastal molluscs to provide hypotheses of the potential impacts of high-CO2 on predator-prey interactions. Coastal molluscs, such as oysters, mussels, and snails, allocate energy among defenses, growth, and reproduction. Ocean acidification increases the energetic costs of physiological processes such as acid-base regulation and calcification. Impacted molluscs can display complex and divergent patterns of energy allocation to defenses and growth that may influence predator-prey interactions; these include changes in shell properties, body size, tissue mass, immune function, or reproductive output. Ocean acidification has also been shown to induce complex changes in chemoreception, behavior, and inducible defenses, including altered cue detection and predator avoidance behaviors. Each of these responses may ultimately alter the susceptibility of coastal molluscs to predation through effects on predator handling time, satiation, and search time. While many of these effects may manifest as increases in per capita predation rates on coastal molluscs, the ultimate outcome of predator-prey interactions will also depend on how ocean acidification affects the specified predators, which also exhibit complex responses to ocean acidification. Changes in predator-prey interactions could have profound and unexplored consequences for the population dynamics of coastal molluscs in a high-CO2 ocean.

AB Landscape characteristics have a substantial effect on non-point source (NPS) pollution. The relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality provides important information for effectively addressing planning and NPS management problems. Multiple stepwise regression analysis and redundancy analysis were integrated to explore the quantitative association between landscape metrics, at both the landscape and class levels, and water quality in the highly urbanized Beiyun River Watershed. The relationship between water quality and the landscape pattern metrics was more significant during the rainy season than after the rainy season. The landscape composition was found to explain 46.9% of the variation in water quality. A total of 60.3% of the variation in water quality could be explained if the landscape configuration metrics were also included in the analysis. This result indicated the importance of the landscape configuration for the water quality of the watershed. Compared with the indices at the landscape level, the class metrics were more effective in predicting water quality. Three metrics, namely, the patch density of water, the largest patch index of forest and the proportion of unused land, could jointly effectively represent the influence of the landscape pattern on the water quality during the rainy season. It is probable that water quality can be improved by maintaining the connectivity of urban rivers, controlling the proportion of unused land and retaining a widespread distribution of unfragmented forest. Furthermore, avoiding the compact distribution of urban land use might reduce the overall emission of pollutants from all forms of transport. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change has brought renewed interest in the study of plant phenology - the timing of life history events. Data on shifting phenologies with warming have accumulated rapidly, yet research has been comparatively slow to explain the diversity of phenological responses observed across latitudes, growing seasons and species. Here, we outline recent efforts to synthesize perspectives on plant phenology across the fields of ecology, climate science and evolution. We highlight three major axes that vary among these disciplines: relative focus on abiotic versus biotic drivers of phenology, on plastic versus genetic drivers of intraspecific variation, and on cross-species versus autecological approaches. Recent interdisciplinary efforts, building on data covering diverse species and climate space, have found a greater role of temperature in controlling phenology at higher latitudes and for early-flowering species in temperate systems. These efforts have also made progress in understanding the tremendous diversity of responses across species by incorporating evolutionary relatedness, and linking phenological flexibility to invasions and plant performance. Future research with a focus on data collection in areas outside the temperate mid-latitudes and across species' ranges, alongside better integration of how risk and investment shape plant phenology, offers promise for further progress.

AB Lignocellulolytic bacteria have promised to be a fruitful source of new enzymes for next-generation lignocellulosic biofuel production. Puerto Rican tropical forest soils were targeted because the resident microbes decompose biomass quickly and to near-completion. Isolates were initially screened based on growth on cellulose or lignin in minimal media. 75 Isolates were further tested for the following lignocellulolytic enzyme activities: phenol oxidase, peroxidase, beta-D-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-xylopyranosidase, chitinase, CMCase, and xylanase. Cellulose-derived isolates possessed elevated beta-D-glucosidase, CMCase, and cellobiohydrolase activity but depressed phenol oxidase and peroxidase activity, while the contrary was true of lignin isolates, suggesting that these bacteria are specialized to subsist on cellulose or lignin. Cellobiohydrolase and phenol oxidase activity rates could classify lignin and cellulose isolates with 61% accuracy, which demonstrates the utility of model degradation assays. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, all isolates belonged to phyla dominant in the Puerto Rican soils, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, suggesting that many dominant taxa are capable of the rapid lignocellulose degradation characteristic of these soils. The isolated genera Aquitalea, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Cupriavidus, Gordonia, and Paenibacillus represent rarely or never before studied lignolytic or cellulolytic species and were undetected by metagenomic analysis of the soils. The study revealed a relationship between phylogeny and lignocellulose-degrading potential, supported by Kruskal-Wallis statistics which showed that enzyme activities of cultivated phyla and genera were different enough to be considered representatives of distinct populations. This can better inform future experiments and enzyme discovery efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB We evaluated the latent structure and validity of an expanded pool of Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) items. An experimental rating scale with 44 candidate SCT items was administered to parents and teachers of 165 children in grades 2-5 (ages 7-11) recruited for a randomized clinical trial of a psychosocial intervention for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were used to extract items with high loadings (>0.59) on primary factors of SCT and low cross-loadings (0.30 or lower) on other SCT factors and on the Inattention factor of ADHD. Items were required to meet these criteria for both informants. This procedure reduced the pool to 15 items. Generally, items representing slowness and low initiative failed these criteria. SCT factors (termed Daydreaming, Working Memory Problems, and Sleepy/Tired) showed good convergent and discriminant validity in EFA and in a confirmatory model with ADHD factors. Simultaneous regressions of impairment and comorbidity on SCT and ADHD factors found that Daydreams was associated with global impairment, and Sleepy/Tired was associated with organizational problems and depression ratings, across both informants. For teachers, Daydreams also predicted ODD (inversely); Sleepy/Tired also predicted poor academic behavior, low social skills, and problem social behavior; and Working Memory Problems predicted organizational problems and anxiety. When depression, rather than ADHD, was included among the predictors, the only SCT-related associations rendered insignificant were the teacher-reported associations of Daydreams with ODD; Working Memory Problems with anxiety, and Sleepy/Tired with poor social skills. SCT appears to be meaningfully associated with impairment, even when controlling for depression. Common behaviors resembling Working Memory problems may represent a previously undescribed factor of SCT.

AB Elevational trends in the ecology of macroorganisms have been studied extensively; by contrast very little is known of such trends in microbial diversity. Previous studies on soil bacteria have found either a diversity decline, a 'peak' in mid altitudes, or no trend with increasing elevation. Here we studied bacterial diversity and community composition in relation to elevation on Mt. Halla, Jeju Island, South Korea, a massive shield volcano. Samples were taken along two transects, from 100 m.a.s.l. to the summit at 1950 m.a.s.l., at elevational intervals of 200 m. PCR-amplified soil DNA for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene targeting V1 to V3 region was 454-pyrosequenced, and taxonomically classified against EzTaxon-e database.
   Elevation was the best predictor of variation in bacterial community composition along the two transects, even when considering other soil parameters. Elevation was itself highly correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP), suggesting that soil bacterial community composition On Mt. Haifa is more strongly affected by climate than by geochemical or soil textural factors. The two transects showed certain consistent differences in bacterial phyla composition, with one transect having significantly higher abundance of Planctomycetes and Gemmatimonadetes than the other. Certain other phyla (e.g. Acidobacteria) also showed striking trends in abundance with elevation, but the trends differed between the two transects.
   Bacterial diversity and richness were also most strongly correlated with elevation, MAT and MAP, although soil pH explained a part of the variation. Moreover, vegetation cover type, irrespective of elevation, had an effect on soil bacterial diversity and richness. We found a 'dip' in diversity at lower mid elevations (700-1300 m) in both transects; a trend which has not been found before. Our results, when compared with other studies, emphasize that no simple rule can be applied to mountain systems in general, but that climate itself is a major influence on community composition.

AB Dispersal is a fundamental life-history trait for many ecological processes. Recent studies suggest that dispersers, in comparison to residents, display various phenotypic specializations increasing their dispersal inclination or success. Among them, dispersers are believed to be consistently more bold, exploratory, asocial or aggressive than residents. These links between behavioural types and dispersal should vary with the cause of dispersal. However, with the exception of one study, personality-dependent dispersal has not been studied in contrasting environments. Here, we used mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) to test whether personality-dependent dispersal varies with predation risk, a factor that should induce boldness or sociability-dependent dispersal. Corroborating previous studies, we found that dispersing mosquitofish are less social than non-dispersing fish when there was no predation risk. However, personality-dependent dispersal is negated under predation risk, dispersers having similar personality types to residents. Our results suggest that adaptive dispersal decisions could commonly depend on interactions between phenotypes and ecological contexts.

AB Integrated measures of corticosterone (CORT), such as from feathers (CORTf), have intuitive appeal because they incorporate both the duration and amplitude of glucocorticoid secretion. An association between CORTf and plasma CORT has never been shown in wild birds, and it is unclear as to when and whether these measures should be correlated, given that they are fundamentally different yet related measures of physiology. We hypothesized that CORTf should correlate with instantaneous measurements of plasma CORT when the latter reflect sustained changes in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. To test this, we experimentally manipulated levels of plasma CORT in wild nestling tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) using 5 day time-release CORT pellets, and measured plasma CORT and growth parameters before, during and at the end of hormone manipulation (days 7, 9 and 11 post-hatch, respectively). CORTf and plasma CORT were significantly positively related only when the latter was at its highest and most variable among individuals (day 9). A similar relationship was expected at day 11, but plasma CORT had returned to near-original levels. Nestlings with higher CORTf were smaller, lighter and less likely to fledge, but we did not detect seasonal effects on CORTf. Our results clearly demonstrate that CORTf from free-living birds can reflect plasma CORT, but correlations may not always be expected, especially if elevations in plasma CORT are relatively modest and of short duration. Our work suggests that CORTf is best used to study the activity of the HPA axis over relatively long time frames and can be used effectively to advance avian ecology.

AB Lakes are a central component of the carbon cycle, both mineralizing terrestrially derived organic matter and storing substantial amounts of organic carbon (OC) in their sediments. However, the rates and controls on OC burial by lakes remain uncertain, as do the possible effects of future global change processes. To address these issues, we derived OC burial rates in Pb-210-dated sediment cores from 116 small Minnesota lakes that cover major climate and land-use gradients. Rates for individual lakes presently range from 7 to 127 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and have increased by up to a factor of 8 since Euro-American settlement (mean increase: 2.8x). Mean pre-disturbance OC burial rates were similar (14-22 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) across all land-cover categories (prairie, mixed deciduous and boreal forest), indicating minimal effect of the regional temperature gradient (approx. 4 degrees C) on background carbon burial. The relationship between modern OC burial rates and temperature was also not significant after removal of the effect of total phosphorus. Contemporary burial rates were strongly correlated with lake-water nutrients and the extent of agricultural land cover in the catchment. Increased OC burial, documented even in relatively undisturbed boreal lake ecosystems, indicates a possible role for atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Our results suggest that globally, future land-cover change, intensification of agriculture and associated nutrient loading together with atmospheric N-deposition will enhance OC sequestration by lakes.

AB Geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) is a key precursor of various isoprenoids that have diverse functions in plant metabolism and development. The annotation of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome predicts 12 genes to encode geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPS). In this study we analyzed GGPPS activity as well as the subcellular localization and tissue-specific expression of the entire protein family in A. thaliana. GGPPS2 (At2g18620), GGPPS3 (At2g18640), GGPPS6 (At3g14530), GGPPS7 (At3g14550), GGPPS8 (At3g20160), GGPPS9 (At3g29430), GGPPS10 (At3g32040) and GGPPS11 (At4g36810) showed GGPPS activity in Escherichia coli, similar to activities reported earlier for GGPPS1 (At1g49530) and GGPPS4 (At2g23800) (Zhu et al. in Plant Cell Physiol 38(3):357-361, 1997a; Plant Mol Biol 35(3):331-341, b). GGPPS12 (At4g38460) did not produce GGPP in E. coli. Based on DNA sequence analysis we propose that GGPPS5 (At3g14510) is a pseudogene. GGPPS-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion proteins of the ten functional GGPP synthases localized to plastids, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, with the majority of the enzymes located in plastids. Gene expression analysis using quantitative real time-PCR, GGPPS promoter-GUS (beta-glucuronidase) assays and publicly available microarray data revealed a differential spatio-temporal expression of GGPPS genes. The results suggest that plastids and mitochondria are key subcellular compartments for the synthesis of ubiquitous GGPP-derived isoprenoid species. GGPPS11 and GGPPS1 are the major isozymes responsible for their biosynthesis. All remaining paralogs, encoding six plastidial isozymes and two cytosolic isozymes, were expressed in specific tissues and/or at specific developmental stages, suggesting their role in developmentally regulated isoprenoid biosynthesis. Our results show that of the 12 predicted GGPPS encoded in the A. thaliana genome 10 are functional proteins that can synthesize GGPP. Their specific subcellular location and differential expression pattern suggest subfunctionalization in providing GGPP to specific tissues, developmental stages, or metabolic pathways.

AB Freshwater habitats make up only approximate to 0.01% of available aquatic habitat and yet harbor 40% of all fish species, whereas marine habitats comprise >99% of available aquatic habitat and have only 60% of fish species. One possible explanation for this pattern is that diversification rates are higher in freshwater habitats than in marine habitats. We investigated diversification in marine and freshwater lineages in the New World silverside fish clade Menidiinae (Teleostei, Atherinopsidae). Using a time-calibrated phylogeny and a state-dependent speciation-extinction framework, we determined the frequency and timing of habitat transitions in Menidiinae and tested for differences in diversification parameters between marine and freshwater lineages. We found that Menidiinae is an ancestrally marine lineage that independently colonized freshwater habitats four times followed by three reversals to the marine environment. Our state-dependent diversification analyses showed that freshwater lineages have higher speciation and extinction rates than marine lineages. Net diversification rates were higher (but not significant) in freshwater than marine environments. The marine lineage-through time (LTT) plot shows constant accumulation, suggesting that ecological limits to clade growth have not slowed diversification in marine lineages. Freshwater lineages exhibited an upturn near the recent in their LTT plot, which is consistent with our estimates of high background extinction rates. All sequence data are currently being archived on Genbank and phylogenetic trees archived on Treebase.

AB Spatially explicit land-use models simulate the patterns of change on the landscape in response to coupled human ecological dynamics. As these models become more complex involving larger than ever data sets, the need to improve calibration techniques as well as methods that test model accuracy also increases. To this end, we developed a Genetic Algorithm tool and applied it to optimize probability maps of deforestation generated from the Weights of Evidence method for 12 case-study sites in the Brazilian Amazon. We show that the Genetic Algorithm tool, after being constrained during the reproduction process within a specified range and trend of variation of the Weights of Evidence coefficients, was able to overcome overfitting and improve validation fitness scores with acceptable computational costs. In addition to modeling deforestation, the Genetic Algorithm tool coupled with the Weights of Evidence method is flexible enough to embrace a variety of models as well as their specific fitness functions, thus offering a practical way to optimize the performance of land-use change models.

AB Snake diversity in the island of Sri Lanka is extremely high, hosting at least 89 inland (i.e., non-marine) snake species, of which at least 49 are endemic. This includes the endemic genera Aspidura, Balanophis, Cercaspis, Haplocercus, and Pseudotyphlops, which are of uncertain phylogenetic affinity. We present phylogenetic evidence from nuclear and mitochondrial loci showing the relationships of 40 snake species from Sri Lanka (22 endemics) to the remaining global snake fauna. To determine the phylogenetic placement of these species, we create a molecular dataset containing 10 genes for all global snake genera, while also sampling all available species for genera with endemic species occurring in Sri Lanka. Our sampling comprises five mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S, cyt-b, ND2, and ND4) and five nuclear genes (BDNF, c-mos, NT3 RAG-1, and RAG-2), for a total of up to 9582 bp per taxon. We find that the five endemic genera represent portions of four independent colonizations of Sri Lanka, with Cercaspis nested within Colubrinae, Balanophis in Natricinae, Pseudotyphlops in Uropeltidae, and that Aspidura + Haplocercus represents a distinct, ancient lineage within Natricinae. We synonymize two endemic genera that render other genera paraphyletic (Haplocercus with Aspidura, and Cercaspis with Lycodon), and discover that further endemic radiations may be present on the island, including a new taxon from the blindsnake family Typhlopidae, suggesting a large endemic radiation. Despite its small size relative to other islands such as New Guinea, Borneo, and Madagascar, Sri Lanka has one of the most phylogenetically diverse island snake faunas in the world, and more research is needed to characterize the island's biodiversity, with numerous undescribed species in multiple lineages.

AB Although likelihood ratio (LR) based methods to analyse complex mixtures of two or more individuals, that exhibit the twin phenomena of drop-out and drop-in has been in the public domain for more than a decade, progress towards widespread implementation in to casework has been slow. The aim of this paper is to establish a LR-based framework using principles of the basic model recommended by the ISFG DNA commission. We use the tools in the form of open-source software (LRmix) in the Forensim package for the R software. A generalised set of guidelines has been prepared that can be used to evaluate any complex mixture. In addition, a validation framework has been proposed in order to evaluate LRs that are generated on a case-specific basis. This process is facilitated by replacing the reference profile of interest (typically the suspect's profile) with simulated random man using Monte-Carlo simulations and comparing the resulting distributions with the estimated LR. Validation is best carried out by comparison with a standard. Because LRmix is open-source we proposed that it is ideally positioned to be adopted as a standard basic model for complex DNA profile tests. This should not be confused with 'the best model' since it is clear that improvements could be made over time. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to have a methodology in place that can show whether an improvement has been achieved should additional parameters, such as allele peak heights, are incorporated into the model. To facilitate comparative studies, we provide all of the necessary data for three test examples, presented as standard tests that can be utilised to carry out comparative studies. We envisage that the resource of standard test examples will be expanded over coming years so that a range of different case-types that are included will be used in order to improve the efficacy of models; to understand their advantages; conversely, to understand any limitations and to provide training material.

AB Our review highlights how traditional ecological knowledge influences people's adaptive capacity to social-ecological change and identifies a set of mechanisms that contribute to such capacity in the context of community-based biodiversity conservation initiatives. Twenty-three publications, including twenty-nine case studies, were reviewed with the aim of investigating how local knowledge, community-based conservation, and resilience interrelate in social-ecological systems. We highlight that such relationships have not been systematically addressed in regions where a great number of community conservation initiatives are found; and we identify a set of factors that foster people's adaptive capacity to social-ecological change and a number of social processes that, in contrast, undermine such capacity and the overall resilience of the social-ecological system. We suggest that there is a need to further investigate how climate variability and other events affect the joint evolution of conservation outcomes and traditional ecological knowledge, and there is a need to expand the current focus on social factors to explain changes in traditional ecological knowledge and adaptive capacity towards a broader approach that pays attention to ecosystem dynamics and environmental change.

AB Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are key biotic components of dryland ecosystems worldwide that control many functional processes, including carbon and nitrogen cycling, soil stabilization and infiltration. Regardless of their ecological importance and prevalence in drylands, very few studies have explicitly evaluated how climate change will affect the structure and composition of BSCs, and the functioning of their constituents. Using a manipulative experiment conducted over 3 years in a semi-arid site from central Spain, we evaluated how the composition, structure and performance of lichen-dominated BSCs respond to a 2.4 degrees C increase in temperature, and to an approximately 30 per cent reduction of total annual rainfall. In areas with well-developed BSCs, warming promoted a significant decrease in the richness and diversity of the whole BSC community. This was accompanied by important compositional changes, as the cover of lichens suffered a substantial decrease with warming (from 70 to 40% on average), while that of mosses increased slightly (from 0.3 to 7% on average). The physiological performance of the BSC community, evaluated using chlorophyll fluorescence, increased with warming during the first year of the experiment, but did not respond to rainfall reduction. Our results indicate that ongoing climate change will strongly affect the diversity and composition of BSC communities, as well as their recovery after disturbances. The expected changes in richness and composition under warming could reduce or even reverse the positive effects of BSCs on important soil processes. Thus, these changes are likely to promote an overall reduction in ecosystem processes that sustain and control nutrient cycling, soil stabilization and water dynamics.

AB Cytokinins (CKs) mediate cellular responses to drought stress and targeted control of CK metabolism can be used to develop drought-tolerant plants. Aiming to manipulate CK levels to improve drought tolerance of soybean cultivars through genetic engineering of CK metabolic genes, we surveyed the soybean genome and identified 14 CK biosynthetic (isopentenyltransferase, GmIPT) and 17 CK degradative (CK dehydrogenase, GmCKX) genes. Comparative analyses of GmIPTs and GmCKXs with Arabidopsis counterparts revealed their similar architecture. The average numbers of abiotic stress-inducible cis-elements per promoter were 0.4 and 1.2 for GmIPT and GmCKX genes, respectively, suggesting that upregulation of GmCKXs, thereby reduction of CK levels, maybe the major events under abiotic stresses. Indeed, the expression of 12 GmCKX genes was upregulated by dehydration in R2 roots. Overall, the expressions of soybean CK metabolic genes in various tissues at various stages were highly responsive to drought. CK contents in various organs at the reproductive (R2) stage were also determined under well-watered and drought stress conditions. Although tRNA-type GmIPT genes were highly expressed in soybean, cis-zeatin and its derivatives were found at low concentrations. Moreover, reduction of total CK content in R2 leaves under drought was attributable to the decrease in dihydrozeatin levels, suggesting a role of this molecule in regulating soybean's responses to drought stress. Our systematic analysis of the GmIPT and GmCKX families has provided an insight into CK metabolism in soybean under drought stress and a solid foundation for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by manipulation of CK levels via biotechnological approach.

AB Animals display incredibly diverse color patterns yet little is known about the underlying genetic basis of these phenotypes. However, emerging results are reshaping our view of how the process of phenotypic evolution occurs. Here, we outline recent research from three particularly active areas of investigation: melanin pigmentation in Drosophila, wing patterning in butterflies, and pigment variation in lizards. For each system, we highlight (i) the function and evolution of color variation, (ii) various approaches that have been used to explore the genetic basis of pigment variation, and (iii) conclusions regarding the genetic basis of convergent evolution which have emerged from comparative analyses. Results from these studies indicate that natural variation in pigmentation is a particularly powerful tool to examine the molecular basis of evolution, especially with regard to convergent or parallel evolution. Comparison of these systems also reveals that the molecular basis of convergent evolution is heterogeneous, sometimes involving conserved mechanisms and sometimes not. In the near future, additional work in other emerging systems will substantially expand the scope of available comparisons.

AB Natural systems are increasingly being modified by the addition of artificial habitats which may facilitate invasion. Where invaders are able to disperse from artificial habitats, their impact may spread to surrounding natural communities and therefore it is important to investigate potential factors that reduce or enhance invasibility. We surveyed the distribution of non-indigenous and native invertebrates and algae between artificial habitats and natural reefs in a marine subtidal system. We also deployed sandstone plates as experimental 'reefs' and manipulated the orientation, starting assemblage and degree of shading. Invertebrates (non-indigenous and native) appeared to be responding to similar environmental factors (e. g. orientation) and occupied most space on artificial structures and to a lesser extent reef walls. Non-indigenous invertebrates are less successful than native invertebrates on horizontal reefs despite functional similarities. Manipulative experiments revealed that even when non-indigenous invertebrates invade vertical "reefs", they are unlikely to gain a foothold and never exceed covers of native invertebrates (regardless of space availability). Community ecology suggests that invertebrates will dominate reef walls and algae horizontal reefs due to functional differences, however our surveys revealed that native algae dominate both vertical and horizontal reefs in shallow estuarine systems. Few non-indigenous algae were sampled in the study, however where invasive algal species are present in a system, they may present a threat to reef communities. Our findings suggest that non-indigenous species are less successful at occupying space on reef compared to artificial structures, and manipulations of biotic and abiotic conditions (primarily orientation and to a lesser extent biotic resistance) on experimental "reefs" explained a large portion of this variation, however they could not fully explain the magnitude of differences.

AB We need to understand joint ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change to predict future threats to biological diversity. The evolving metacommunity framework emphasizes that interactions between ecological and evolutionary mechanisms at both local and regional scales will drive community dynamics during climate change. Theory suggests that ecological and evolutionary dynamics often interact to produce outcomes different from those predicted based on either mechanism alone. We highlight two of these dynamics: (i) species interactions prevent adaptation of nonresident species to new niches and (ii) resident species adapt to changing climates and thereby prevent colonization by nonresident species. The rate of environmental change, level of genetic variation, source-sink structure, and dispersal rates mediate between these potential outcomes. Future models should evaluate multiple species, species interactions other than competition, and multiple traits. Future experiments should manipulate factors such as genetic variation and dispersal to determine their joint effects on responses to climate change. Currently, we know much more about how climates will change across the globe than about how species will respond to these changes despite the profound effects these changes will have on global biological diversity. Integrating evolving metacommunity perspectives into climate change biology should produce more accurate predictions about future changes to species distributions and extinction threats.

AB In the last few decades, there has been a remarkable discovery of new species of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, in what have been called the new age of discovery. However, owing to anthropogenic impacts such as habitat conversion, many of the still unknown species may go extinct before being scientifically documented (i.e. 'crypto-extinctions'). Here, by applying a mathematical model of species descriptions which accounts for taxonomic effort, we show that even after 250 years of taxonomic classification, about 3050 amphibians and at least 160 land mammal species remain to be discovered and described. These values represent, respectively, 33 and 3 per cent of the current species total for amphibians and land mammals. We found that tropical moist forests of the Neotropics, Afrotropics and Indomalaya probably harbour the greatest numbers of undescribed species. Tropical forests with minimal anthropogenic disturbance are predicted to have larger proportions of undescribed species. However, the protected area coverage is low in many of these key biomes. Moreover, undescribed species are likely to be at a greater risk of extinction compared with known species because of small geographical ranges among other factors. By highlighting the key areas of undescribed species diversity, our study provides a starting template to rapidly document these species and protect them through better habitat management.

AB Traditional knowledge has become a topic of considerable interest within the research and development environment. The contribution of traditional knowledge to conservation and management is increasingly recognized, and implementation endeavours are underway in several countries. The current scale of ecosystem degradation underscores the need for restoration interventions. It is increasingly recognized that successful ecological restoration depends on effective coordination of science and traditional ecological knowledge. This paper synthesizes the literature to evaluate the present and potential contribution of traditional knowledge to ecological restoration. Despite a growing number of articles published on traditional knowledge, only a few have addressed its contributions to ecological restoration per se. The main contributions of traditional knowledge to ecological restoration are in construction of reference ecosystems, particularly when historical information is not available; species selection for restoration plantations; site selection for restoration; knowledge about historical land management practices; management of invasive species; and post-restoration monitoring. Traditional knowledge and science are complementary and should be used in conjunction in ecological restoration projects. Incorporation of traditional knowledge can contribute to build a strong partnership for the successful implementation of restoration projects and increase their social acceptability, economical feasibility, and ecological viability.

AB Aims: Bioremediation of highly arsenic (As)-contaminated soil is difficult because As is very toxic for plants and micro-organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate soil arsenic removal effects using poplar in combination with the inoculation of a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR).
   Methods and Results: A rhizobacterium D14 was isolated and identified within Agrobacterium radiobacter. This strain was highly resistant to arsenic and produced indole acetic acid and siderophore. Greenhouse pot bioremediation experiments were performed for 5 months using poplar (Populus deltoides LH05-17) grown on As-amended soils, inoculated with strain D14. The results showed that P. deltoides was an efficient arsenic accumulator; however, high As concentrations (150 and 300 mg kg(-1)) inhibited its growth. With the bacterial inoculation, in the 300 mg kg(-1) As-amended soils, 54% As in the soil was removed, which was higher than the uninoculated treatments (43%), and As concentrations in roots, stems and leaves were significantly increased by 229, 113 and 291%, respectively. In addition, the As translocation ratio [(stems + leaves)/roots = 0.8] was significantly higher than the uninoculated treatments (0.5). About 45% As was translocated from roots to the above-ground tissues. The plant height and dry weight of roots, stems and leaves were all enhanced; the contents of chlorophyll and soluble sugar, and the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were all increased; and the content of a toxic compound malondialdehyde was decreased.
   Conclusions: The results indicated that the inoculation of strain D14 could contribute to the increase in the As tolerance of P. deltoides, promotion of the growth, increase in the uptake efficiency and enhancement of As translocation.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The use of P. deltoides in combination with the inoculation of strain D14 provides a potential application for efficient soil arsenic bioremediation.

AB In order to understand the behaviours and subsistence choices of Palaeolithic hunter gatherers, it is essential to understand the behavioural ecology of their prey. Here, we present strontium isotope data from sequentially-sampled enamel from three reindeer (Rangifer tarandus ssp.) and a single bison (Bison cf. priscus) from the late Middle Palaeolithic site of Jonzac (Chez-Pinaud), France. The results are used to investigate the ranging and migratory behaviours of these important prey species. We found that the bison had isotope values most consistent with a local range, while the three reindeer had values indicating a seasonal migration pattern. Due to the similarity of the patterning of two of the three reindeer and in conjunction with zooarchaeological results, we suggest that they may have been from the same herd, were likely killed around the same point during their seasonal round and may therefore be the product of a single hunting event or a small number of successive hunting events. The isotope analyses complement the zooarchaeological data and have allowed greater insight into the palaeoecology of these species, the palaeoenvironment, and Neanderthal site use and hunting strategies.

AB The Northern Hemisphere's boreal forests, particularly the Siberian boreal forest, may have a strong effect on Earth's climate through changes in dominant vegetation and associated regional surface albedo. We show that warmer climate will likely convert Siberia's deciduous larch (Larix spp.) to evergreen conifer forests, and thus decrease regional surface albedo. The dynamic vegetation model, FAREAST, simulates Russian boreal forest composition and was used to explore the feedback between climate change and forest composition at continental, regional, and local scales. FAREAST was used to simulate the impact of changes in temperature and precipitation on total and genus-level biomass at sites across Siberia and the Russian Far East (RFE), and for six high- and low-diversity regions. Model runs with and without European Larch (Larix decidua) included in the available species pool were compared to assess the potential for this species, which is adapted to warmer climate conditions, to mitigate the effects of climate change, especially the shift to evergreen dominance. At the continental scale, when temperature is increased, larch-dominated sites become vulnerable to early replacement by evergreen conifers. At the regional and local scales, the diverse Amur region of the RFE does not show a strong response to climate change, but the low-diversity regions in central and southern Siberia have an abrupt vegetation shift from larch-dominated forest to evergreen-conifer forest in response to increased temperatures. The introduction of L. decidua prevents the collapse of larch in these low-diversity areas and thus mitigates the response to warming. Using contemporary MODIS albedo measurements, we determined that a conversion from larch to evergreen stands in low-diversity regions of southern Siberia would generate a local positive radiative forcing of 5.1 +/- 2.6 W m-2. This radiative heating would reinforce the warming projected to occur in the area under climate change.

AB Medina lagoon in Andalusia has one of the highest densities of spent lead (Pb) shot in Europe. Blood samples from waterbirds were collected in 2006-2008 to measure Pb concentration (PbB), delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma biochemistry. PbB above background levels (> 20 mu g/dl) was observed in 19% (n=59) of mallards (Anus platyrhynchos) and in all common pochards (Aythya ferina) (n=4), but common coots (Fulica atra) (n=37) and moorhens (Gallinula chloropus)(n = 12) were all < 20 mu g/dl. ALAD ratio in mallards and coots decreased with PbB levels > 6 mu g/d1. In mallards, an inhibition of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and an increased level of oxidized glutathione (oxGSH) in red blood cells (RBC) were associated with PbB levels > 20 mu g/dl. In coots, PbB levels were negatively related to vitamin A and carotenoid levels in plasma, and total glutathione in RBCs; and positively related with higher superoxide dismutase and Gfix activities and % oxGSH in RBCs. Overall, the results indicate that previously assumed background levels of PbB for birds need to be revised. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim
   Aquatic-terrestrial ecotones are vulnerable to climate change, and degradation of the emergent aquatic macrophyte zone would have severe ecological consequences for freshwater, wetland and terrestrial ecosystems. Our aim was to uncover future changes in boreal emergent aquatic macrophyte zones by modelling the occurrence and percentage cover of emergent aquatic vegetation under different climate scenarios in Finland by the 2050s.
   Location
   Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods
   Data derived from different GIS sources were used to estimate future emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions in all catchments in Finland (848 in total). We used generalized additive models (GAM) with a full stepwise selection algorithm and Akaike information criterion to explore the main environmental determinates (climate and geomorphology) of emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions, which were derived from the national subclass of CORINE land-cover classification. The accuracy of the distribution models (GAMs) was cross-validated, using percentage of explained deviance and the area under the curve derived from the receiver-operating characteristic plots.
   Results
   Our results indicated that emergent aquatic macrophytes will expand their distributions northwards from the current catchments and percentage cover will increase in all of the catchments in all climate scenarios. Growing degree-days was the primary determinant affecting distributions of emergent aquatic macrophytes. Inclusion of geomorphological variables clearly improved model performance in both model exercises compared with pure climate variables.
   Main conclusions
   Emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions will expand due to climate change. Many emergent aquatic plant species have already expanded their distributions during the past decades, and this process will continue in the years 2051-80. Emergent aquatic macrophytes pose an increasing overgrowth risk for sensitive macrophyte species in boreal freshwater ecosystems, which should be acknowledged in management and conservation actions. We conclude that predictions based on GIS data can provide useful 'first-filter' estimates of changes in aquatic-terrestrial ecotones.

AB Bluetongue (BT) is still present in Europe and the introduction of new serotypes from endemic areas in the African continent is a possible threat. Culicoides imicola remains one of the most relevant BT vectors in Spain and research on the environmental determinants driving its life cycle is key to preventing and controlling BT. Our aim was to improve our understanding of the biotic and abiotic determinants of C. imicola by modelling its present abundance, studying the spatial pattern of predicted abundance in relation to BT outbreaks, and investigating how the predicted current distribution and abundance patterns might change under future (2011-2040) scenarios of climate change according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. C. imicola abundance data from the bluetongue national surveillance programme were modelled with spatial, topoclimatic, host and soil factors. The influence of these factors was further assessed by variation partitioning procedures. The predicted abundance of C. imicola was also projected to a future period. Variation partitioning demonstrated that the pure effect of host and topoclimate factors explained a high percentage (>80%) of the variation. The pure effect of soil followed in importance in explaining the abundance of C. imicola. A close link was confirmed between C. imicola abundance and BT outbreaks. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to consider wild and domestic hosts in predictive modelling for an arthropod vector. The main findings regarding the near future show that there is no evidence to suggest that there will be an important increase in the distribution range of C. imicola; this contrasts with an expected increase in abundance in the areas where it is already present in mainland Spain. What may be expected regarding the future scenario for orbiviruses in mainland Spain, is that higher predicted C. imicola abundance may significantly change the rate of transmission of orbiviruses.

AB Long-term systematic population monitoring data sets are rare but are essential in identifying changes in species abundance. In contrast, community groups and natural history organizations have collected many species lists. These represent a large, untapped source of information on changes in abundance but are generally considered of little value. The major problem with using species lists to detect population changes is that the amount of effort used to obtain the list is often uncontrolled and usually unknown. It has been suggested that using the number of species on the list, the "list length,'' can be a measure of effort. This paper significantly extends the utility of Franklin's approach using Bayesian logistic regression. We demonstrate the value of List Length Analysis to model changes in species prevalence (i.e., the proportion of lists on which the species occurs) using bird lists collected by a local bird club over 40 years around Brisbane, southeast Queensland, Australia. We estimate the magnitude and certainty of change for 269 bird species and calculate the probabilities that there have been declines and increases of given magnitudes.
   List Length Analysis confirmed suspected species declines and increases. This method is an important complement to systematically designed intensive monitoring schemes and provides a means of utilizing data that may otherwise be deemed useless. The results of List Length Analysis can be used for targeting species of conservation concern for listing purposes or for more intensive monitoring. While Bayesian methods are not essential for List Length Analysis, they can offer more flexibility in interrogating the data and are able to provide a range of parameters that are easy to interpret and can facilitate conservation listing and prioritization.

TI Taking Root: Enduring Effect of Rhizosphere Bacterial Colonization in
   Mangroves
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background: Mangrove forests are of global ecological and economic importance, but are also one of the world's most threatened ecosystems. Here we present a case study examining the influence of the rhizosphere on the structural composition and diversity of mangrove bacterial communities and the implications for mangrove reforestation approaches using nursery-raised plants.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A barcoded pyrosequencing approach was used to assess bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of plants in a nursery setting, nursery-raised transplants and native (non-transplanted) plants in the same mangrove habitat. In addition to this, we also assessed bacterial composition in the bulk sediment in order to ascertain if the roots of mangrove plants affect sediment bacterial composition. We found that mangrove roots appear to influence bacterial abundance and composition in the rhizosphere. Due to the sheer abundance of roots in mangrove habitat, such an effect can have an important impact on the maintenance of bacterial guilds involved in nutrient cycling and other key ecosystem functions. Surprisingly, we also noted a marked impact of initial nursery conditions on the rhizosphere bacterial composition of replanted mangrove trees. This result is intriguing because mangroves are periodically inundated with seawater and represent a highly dynamic environment compared to the more controlled nursery environment.
   Conclusions/Significance: In as far as microbial diversity and composition influences plant growth and health, this study indicates that nursery conditions and early microbial colonization patterns of the replants are key factors that should be considered during reforestation projects. In addition to this, our results provide information on the role of the mangrove rhizosphere as a habitat for bacteria from estuarine sediments.

AB Lakes and rivers are intimately connected in an alternating series of lentic and lotic reaches in many regions. The study of lakes and their outlets in hierarchical and branching river networks has not gained the attention of stream ecologists, and little effort has been focused on synthesizing the ecology of lake-stream interactions within a drainage network. Rapid and predictable changes in the ecological characteristics of streams occur at the interface with lakes. The influence that a lake might have on a stream is dependent on its position within the stream, stream type and size, lake size and shape, and the inlet and outlet positions. Little is known about the influences of multiple lakes within stream-lake networks and how these influences are determined by network shape and pattern. Fruitful collaborations and novel insights will come from the combined efforts of limnologists, stream ecologists, and landscape ecologists. Geographic information systems and network analyses will play an important role in summarizing aquatic landscape characteristics and creating a predictive science of aquatic networks. Lakes need to be more explicitly incorporated into ecological concepts in stream ecology, and reciprocally, streams need to be incorporated into ecological concepts involving lakes for the successful management and conservation of our aquatic resources.

AB Tropical islands are species foundries, formed either as a by-product of volcanism, when previously submerged seabed is thrust upwards by tectonics, or when a peninsula is isolated by rising sea level. After colonisation, the geographical isolation and niche vacancies provide the competitive impetus for an evolutionary radiation of distinct species-island endemics. Yet the very attributes which promote speciation in evolutionary time also leave island endemics highly vulnerable to recent and rapid impacts by modern people. Indeed, the majority of documented human-driven extinctions have been exacted upon island endemics. The causes include over-exploitation, invasive species brought by people and destruction of island's naturally constrained habitats. Imminent threats include inundation by rising sea levels and other adaptive pressures related to anthropogenic global warming. We review recent work which underscores the susceptibility of island endemics to the drivers of global change, and suggest a methodological framework under which, we argue, the science and mitigation of island extinctions can be most productively advanced.

AB P>1. We studied lifetime arrival patterns in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica L.) in relation to variation in ecological conditions, as reflected by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Sub-Saharan winter quarters and at stopover sites in North Africa.
   2. Migratory birds have recently advanced their arrival dates, but the relative role of microevolution and phenotypic plasticity as mechanisms of response to changing environmental conditions remains unknown. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigated the change in the arrival date using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.
   3. We predicted that the effect (i.e. slopes) of environmental conditions in stopover or winter areas on arrival date should be similar using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in case phenotypic plasticity is the underlying mechanism, or they should differ in case microevolution is the mechanism.
   4. As expected according to a previous cross-sectional study, we found an advance in the arrival date when ecological conditions improve in stopover areas and a delay in the arrival date when ecological conditions improve in the winter quarters.
   5. Change in the arrival time at the breeding grounds due to ecological conditions found en route and, in the winter areas, was mainly due to phenotypic plasticity as shown by similarities in the slopes found in these relationships using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.
   6. We also investigated sex and age of barns swallows as sources of variation in the arrival time with respect to conditions experienced in winter and stopover areas. We found that earlier arrival at the breeding grounds due to prevailing ecological conditions found en route in North Africa was similar for males and females of all age-classes. In contrast, individuals tended to delay departure when ecological conditions improved in the winter quarters, but this delay differed among age classes, with old individuals delaying departure more than middle-aged and yearling birds.
   7. The migratory response of individuals to changing climatic conditions experienced during different parts of their life provides evidence for individuals responding differently to prevailing conditions in the winter quarters depending on their age, but not to conditions experienced en route during spring migration.

AB Pathogens are increasingly emerging in human-altered environments as a serious threat to biodiversity. In this context of rapid environmental changes, improving our knowledge on the interaction between ecology and evolution is critical. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of an immunocompetence gene, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II beta, on the pathogen infection levels in wild Atlantic salmon populations, Salmo salar, and identify selective agents involved in contemporary coevolution. MHC variability and bacterial infection rate were determined throughout the summer in juvenile salmon from six rivers belonging to different genetic and ecological regions in Que'bec, Canada. A total of 13 different pathogens were identified in kidney by DNA sequence analysis, including a predominant myxozoa, most probably recently introduced in North America. Infection rates were the highest in southern rivers at the beginning of the summer (average 47.6 +/- 6.3% infected fish). One MHC allele conferred a 2.9 times greater chance of being resistant to myxozoa, while another allele increased susceptibility by 3.4 times. The decrease in frequency of the susceptibility allele but not other MHC or microsatellite alleles during summer was suggestive of a mortality event from myxozoa infection. These results supported the hypothesis of pathogen-driven selection in the wild by means of frequency-dependent selection or change in selection through time and space rather than heterozygous advantage, and underline the importance of MHC standing genetic variation for facing pathogens in a changing environment.

TI Rapid Effects of Marine Reserves via Larval Dispersal
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as conservation and fishery management tools. It is argued that they can protect ecosystems and also benefit fisheries via density-dependent spillover of adults and enhanced larval dispersal into fishing areas. However, while evidence has shown that marine reserves can meet conservation targets, their effects on fisheries are less understood. In particular, the basic question of if and over what temporal and spatial scales reserves can benefit fished populations via larval dispersal remains unanswered. We tested predictions of a larval transport model for a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico, via field oceanography and repeated density counts of recently settled juvenile commercial mollusks before and after reserve establishment. We show that local retention of larvae within a reserve network can take place with enhanced, but spatially-explicit, recruitment to local fisheries. Enhancement occurred rapidly ( 2 yrs), with up to a three-fold increase in density of juveniles found in fished areas at the downstream edge of the reserve network, but other fishing areas within the network were unaffected. These findings were consistent with our model predictions. Our findings underscore the potential benefits of protecting larval sources and show that enhancement in recruitment can be manifested rapidly. However, benefits can be markedly variable within a local seascape. Hence, effects of marine reserve networks, positive or negative, may be overlooked when only focusing on overall responses and not considering finer spatially-explicit responses within a reserve network and its adjacent fishing grounds. Our results therefore call for future research on marine reserves that addresses this variability in order to help frame appropriate scenarios for the spatial management scales of interest.

AB Continental shelf island systems, created by rising sea levels, provide a premier setting for studying the effects of geographical isolation on non-adaptive radiation and allopatric speciation brought about by genetic drift. The Aegean Archipelago forms a highly fragmented complex of mostly continental shelf islands that have become disconnected from each other and the mainland in relatively recent geological times (ca < 5.2 Ma). These ecologically fairly homogenous islands thus provide a suitable biogeographic context for assessing the relative influences of past range fragmentation, colonization, gene flow and drift on taxon diversification. Indeed, recent molecular biogeographic studies on the Aegean Nigella arvensis complex, combining phylogenetic, phylogeographic and population level approaches, exemplify the importance of allopatry and genetic drift coupled with restricted gene flow in driving plant speciation in this continental archipelago at different temporal and spatial scales. While the recent (Late Pleistocene) radiation of Aegean Nigella, as well as possible instances of incipient speciation (in the Cyclades), is shown to be strongly conditioned by (palaeo) geographic factors (including changes in sea level), shifts in breeding system (selfing) and associated isolating mechanisms have also contributed to this radiation. By contrast, founder event speciation has probably played only a minor role, perhaps reflecting a migratory situation typical for continental archipelagos characterized by niche pre-emption because of a long established resident flora. Overall, surveys of neutral molecular markers in Aegean Nigella have so far revealed population genetic processes that conform remarkably well to predictions raised by genetic drift theory. The challenge is now to gain more direct insights into the relative importance of the role of genetic drift, as opposed to natural selection, in the phenotypic and reproductive divergence among these Aegean plant species.

AB Recruitment variation can be a major source of fluctuation in populations and communities, making it difficult to generalize results. Determining the scales of variation and whether spatial patterns in the supply of individuals are persistent over time can provide insight into spatial generality and the application of conservation and metacommunity models. We examined these issues using eight-year-long data sets of monthly recruitment of intertidal mussels (Mytilus spp., Perumytilus purpuratus, Semimytilus algosus, Brachidontes granulata) and barnacles (Balanus glandula, Chthamalus dalli, Jehlius cirratus, Notochthamalus scabrosus) at sites spanning >900 km along the coasts of Oregon northern California (OR-NCA, 45.47-39.43 degrees N) and central Chile (CC, 29.5-34.65 degrees S). We evaluated four general "null" hypotheses: that despite different phylogenies and great spatial separation of these taxa, their similar life history strategies and environmental settings lead to similar patterns of recruitment (1) between hemispheres, (2) in time, (3) in space, and (4) at larger and smaller spatial scales. Hypothesis I was rejected: along the OR NCA coast, rates of recruitment were between two and three orders of magnitude higher, and patterns of seasonality were generally stronger and more coherent across space and time than along CC. Surprisingly, however, further analysis revealed regularities in both time and space for all species, supporting hypotheses 2 and 3. Temporal decorrelation scales were 1-3 months, and characteristic spatial scales of recruitment were similar to 250 km. Contrary to hypothesis 4, for the ecologically dominant species in both hemispheres, recruitment was remarkably persistent at larger mesoscales (kilometers) but was highly stochastic at smaller microscales (meters). Across species, increased recruitment variation at large scales was positively associated with increased persistence. Our results have several implications. Although the two regions span distinct latitudinal ranges, potential forcing processes behind these patterns include similar large-scale climates and topographically locked hydrographic features, such as upwelling. Further, spatial persistence of the recruitment patterns of most species at the mesoscale supports the view that marine protected areas can be powerful conservation and management tools. Finally, persistent and yet contrasting spatial patterns of recruitment among competing species suggest that recent metacommunity models might provide useful representations of the mechanisms involved in species coexistence.

AB Reproductive allocation at one age is predicted to reduce the probability of surviving to the next year or to lead to a decrease in future reproduction. This prediction assumes that reproduction involves fitness costs. However, few empirical studies have assessed whether such costs may vary with the age at primiparity or might be overridden by heterogeneities in individual quality. We used data from 35 years' monitoring of individually marked semi-domestic reindeer females to investigate fitness costs of reproduction. Using multi-state statistical models, we compared age-specific survival and reproduction among four reproductive states (never reproduced, experienced non-breeders, reproduced but did not wean offspring, and reproduced and weaned offspring) and among contrasted age at primiparity. We assessed whether reproductive costs occurred, resulting in a trade-off between current reproduction and future reproduction or survival, and whether early maturation was costly or rather reflected differences in individual quality of survival and reproduction capabilities. We did not find any evidence for fitness costs of reproduction in female reindeer. We found no cost of gestation and lactation in terms of future reproduction and survival. Conversely, successful breeders had higher survival and subsequent reproductive success than experienced non-breeders and unsuccessful breeders, independently of the age at primiparity. Moreover, it was beneficial to mature earlier, especially for females that successfully weaned their first offspring. Successful females at early primiparity remained successful throughout their life, clearly supporting the existence of marked among-female differences in quality. The weaning success peaked for multiparous females and was lower for first-time breeders, indicating a positive effect of experience on reproductive performance. Our findings emphasize an overwhelming importance of individual quality and experience to account for observed variation in survival and reproductive patterns of female reindeer that override trade-offs between current reproduction and future performance, at least in the absence of harsh winters.

TI Anthropogenic and biophysical contributions to increasing atmospheric

SO BIOGEOSCIENCES

ID CARBON-CYCLE; CLIMATE; FOREST; EMISSIONS; DIOXIDE
AB We quantify the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic influences on the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 and the CO2 airborne fraction, considering both interdecadal trends and interannual variability. A combined ENSO-Volcanic Index (EVI) relates most (similar to 75%) of the interannual variability in CO2 growth rate to the El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) climate mode and volcanic activity. Analysis of several CO2 data sets with removal of the EVI-correlated component confirms a previous finding of a detectable increasing trend in CO2 airborne fraction (defined using total anthropogenic emissions including fossil fuels and land use change) over the period 1959-2006, at a proportional growth rate 0.24% y(-1) with probability similar to 0.9 of a positive trend. This implies that the atmospheric CO2 growth rate increased slightly faster than total anthropogenic CO2 emissions. To assess the combined roles of the biophysical and anthropogenic drivers of atmospheric CO2 growth, the increase in the CO2 growth rate (1.9% y(-1) over 1959-2006) is expressed as the sum of the growth rates of four global driving factors: population (contributing + 1.7% y(-1)); per capita income (+ 1.8% y(-1)); the total carbon intensity of the global economy (-1.7% y(-1)); and airborne fraction (averaging + 0.2% y(-1) with strong interannual variability). The first three of these factors, the anthropogenic drivers, have therefore dominated the last, biophysical driver as contributors to accelerating CO2 growth. Together, the recent (post-2000) increase in growth of per capita income and decline in the negative growth (improvement) in the carbon intensity of the economy will drive a significant further acceleration in the CO2 growth rate over coming decades, unless these recent trends reverse.

AB Elevational patterns of species richness and their underlying mechanisms have long been a controversial issue in biodiversity and biogeographical research, and several hypotheses have been proposed in the past decades. Local and regional studies have suggested that area and geometric constraint are two of major factors affecting the elevational pattern of species richness. In this study, using data of seed plants and their distribution ranges and a Digital Elevation Model data set, we explored altitu-dinal patterns of seed plant richness and quantified the effects of area and the mid-domain effect (MDE) on the richness patterns in a high mountain area, Gaoligong Mountains (ranging from 215 m to 5791 m a.s.l.) located in south-eastern Tibet, China. The results showed that richness and density (richness/ log-transformed area) of seed plants at species, genus, and family levels all showed hump-shaped patterns along the altitudinal gradient. The altitudinal changes in richness of species with three different range sizes (< 500 m, 500 - 1500 m, and > 1500 m), species of different plant life-forms (trees, shrubs, and herbs), and endemic species further confirmed this finding. Analysis of Generalized Linear Model depicted that although the area of each elevational band was always in high correlation with the species richness, the MDE could explain 84.9%, 33.8%, 83.8%, and 84.5% of the total variation in richness for all species and the three species groups with different range sizes, respectively. This suggests that the MDE significantly influences the patterns of species richness and is likely be stronger for broad-ranged species than for narrow-ranged ones in the Gaoligong Mountains.

AB In the United States, housing density has substantially increased in and adjacent to forests. Our goal in this study was to identify how housing density and human populations are associated with avian diversity. We compared these associations to those between landscape pattern and avian diversity, and we examined how these associations vary across the conterminous forested United States. Using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the U.S. Census, and the National Land Cover Database, we focused on forest and woodland bird communities and conducted our analysis at multiple levels of model specificity, first using a coarse-thematic resolution (basic models), then using a larger number of fine-thematic resolution variables (refined models). We found that housing development was associated with forest bird species richness in all forested ecoregions of the conterminous United States. However, there were important differences among ecoregions. In the basic models, housing density accounted for < 5% of variance in avian species richness. In refined models, 85% of models included housing density and/or residential land cover as significant variables. The strongest guild response was demonstrated in the Adirondack-New England ecoregion, where 29% of variation in richness of the permanent resident guild was associated with housing density. Model improvements due to regional stratification were most pronounced for cavity nesters and short-distance migrants, suggesting that these guilds may be especially sensitive to regional processes. The varying patterns of association between avian richness and attributes associated with landscape structure suggested that landscape context was an important mediating factor affecting how biodiversity responds to landscape changes. Our analysis suggested that simple, broadly applicable, land use recommendations cannot be derived from our results. Rather, anticipating future avian response to land use intensification (or reversion to native vegetation) has to be conditioned on the current landscape context and the species group of interest. Our results show that housing density and residential land cover were significant predictors of forest bird species richness, and their prediction strengths are likely to increase as development continues.

AB In early 1992, the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, was first seen in Tasmania and currently has spread to most of the island. Here, we report on the genetic structure, using micro-satellites, of the invading population from samples collected in the years 1998-2000, a few years after the first sighting of the species in its new area. The data show that the Tasmanian population has a very low genetic diversity, with less than half of the allelic richness ( Richness 2.89 alleles; H-exp=0.591) and lower levels of heterozygosity as compared to populations in New Zealand ( 4.24 alleles; H-exp=0.729) and Europe (5.08 alleles; H-exp=0.826). In addition, the genetic data suggest that the invasion must have happened once, probably around late 1991, and was the result of very few, perhaps only two, individuals arriving in Tasmania. Furthermore, these founders came from the New Zealand population. Today, the population in the south of Tasmania seems to act as a source population from which individuals migrate into other parts of the state. A similar source-sink structure seems also the case for New Zealand. The data show that B. terrestris is a highly invasive species capable of establishing itself even after a dramatic genetic bottleneck. B. terrestris may be an invasive species due to the haplo-diploid sex determination system, which exposes recessive, deleterious mutations to selection. Offspring of such purged lines may then be able to tolerate high levels of inbreeding.

AB Duplicate genes in mouse are widely thought to have functional redundancy, and to be less essential than singleton genes. We analyzed nearly 3900 individually knocked out mouse genes and discovered that the proportion of essential genes is similar to 55% in both singletons and duplicates. This suggests that mammalian duplicates rarely compensate for each other, and that the absence of phenotypes in mice deficient for a duplicate gene should not be automatically attributed to paralogous compensation.

AB Population structuring in species inhabiting marine environments such as the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (NEA) and Mediterranean Sea (MS) has usually been explained based on past and present physical barriers to gene flow and isolation by distance (IBD). Here, we examined the relative importance of these factors on population structuring of the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis by using methods of phylogenetic inference and hypothesis testing coupled with coalescent and classical population genetic parameter estimation. Individuals from 10 Atlantic and 15 Mediterranean sites were sequenced for 659 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene (259 sequences). IBD seems to be the main factor driving present and past genetic structuring of Sepia populations across the NEA-MS, both at large and small geographical scales. Such an evolutionary process agrees well with some of the biological features characterizing this cuttlefish species (short migrations, nektobenthic habit, benthic eggs hatching directly to benthic juveniles). Despite the many barriers to migration/gene flow suggested in the NEA-MS region, genetic population fragmentation due to past isolation of water masses (Pleistocene; 0.56 million years ago) and/or present-day oceanographic currents was only detected between the Aegean-Ionian and western Mediterranean Seas. Restricted gene flow associated with the Almeria-Oran hydrographic front was also suggested between southern and eastern Spanish populations. Distinct population boundaries could not be clearly determined, except for the Aegean-Ionian stock. Two Atlantic and five Mediterranean samples showed evidence of current decline in genetic diversity, which may indicate over-exploitation of Sepia in both marine regions.

AB Increasingly, models (and modelers) are being asked to address the interactions between human influences, ecological processes, and landscape dynamics that impact many diverse aspects of managing complex coupled human and natural systems. These systems may be profoundly influenced by human decisions at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and the limitations of traditional process-level ecosystems modeling approaches for representing the richness of factors shaping landscape dynamics in these coupled systems has resulted in the need for new analysis approaches. New tools in the areas of spatial data management and analysis, multicriteria decision-making, individual-based modeling, and complexity science have all begun to impact how we approach modeling these systems. The term "biocomplexity" has emerged as a descriptor of the rich patterns of interactions and behaviors in human and natural systems, and the challenges of analyzing biocomplex behavior is resulting in a convergence of approaches leading to new ways of understanding these systems. Important questions related to system vulnerability and resilience, adaptation, feedback processing, cycling, non-linearities and other complex behaviors are being addressed using models employing new representational approaches to analysis. The complexity inherent in these systems challenges the modeling community to provide tools that capture sufficiently the richness of human and ecosystem processes and interactions in ways that are computationally tractable and understandable. We examine one such tool, EvoLand, which uses an actor-based approach to conduct alternative futures analyses in the Willamette Basin, Oregon. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation can influence the genetic structure of biological populations. We studied the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation in Florida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus) populations. Genetic samples were collected from 339 bears, representing nine populations. Bears were genotyped for 12 microsatellite loci to estimate genetic variation and to characterize genetic structure. None of the nine study populations deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic variation, quantified by mean expected heterozygosity (H-E), ranged from 0.27 to 0.71 and was substantially lower in smaller and less connected populations. High levels of genetic differentiation among populations (global F-ST = 0.224; global R-ST = 0.245) suggest that fragmentation of once contiguous habitat has resulted in genetically distinct populations. There was no isolation-by-distance relationship among Florida black bear populations, likely because of barriers to gene flow created by habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic disturbances. These factors resulted in genetic differentiation among populations, even those that were geographically close. Population assignment tests indicated that most individuals were genetically assigned to the population where they were sampled. Habitat fragmentation and anthropogenic barriers to movement appear to have limited the dispersal capabilities of the Florida black bear, thereby reducing gene flow among populations. Regional corridors or translocation of bears may be needed to restore historical levels of genetic variation. Our results suggest that management actions to mitigate genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation are needed to ensure long-term persistence of the Florida black bear.

AB Radiocarbon levels in annual plants provide a means to map out regional and continental-scale fossil fuel plumes in surface air. We collected corn (Zea mays) across North America during the summer of 2004. Plants from mountain regions of western North America showed the smallest influence of fossil fuel-derived CO2 with a mean Delta C-14 of 66.3 parts per thousand +/- 1.7 parts per thousand. Plants from eastern North America and from the Ohio-Maryland region showed a larger fossil fuel influence with a mean Delta C-14 of 58.8 parts per thousand +/- 3.9 parts per thousand and 55.2 parts per thousand +/- 2.3 parts per thousand, respectively, corresponding to 2.7 ppm +/- 1.5 ppm and 4.3 ppm +/- 1.0 ppm of added fossil fuel CO2 relative to the mountain west. A model - data comparison suggests that surveys of annual plant Delta C-14 can provide a useful test of atmospheric mixing in transport models that are used to estimate the spatial distribution of carbon sources and sinks.

AB Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes were measured at a tundra site near Chokurdakh, in the lowlands of the Indigirka river in north-east Siberia. This site is one of the few stations on Russian tundra and it is different from most other tundra flux stations in its continentality. A suite of methods was applied to determine the fluxes of NEE, GPP, R-eco and methane, including eddy covariance, chambers and leaf cuvettes. Net carbon dioxide fluxes were high compared with other tundra sites, with NEE=-92 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which is composed of an R-eco=+141 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and GPP=-232 g C m(-2) yr(-1). This large carbon dioxide sink may be explained by the continental climate, that is reflected in low winter soil temperatures (-14 degrees C), reducing the respiration rates, and short, relatively warm summers, stimulating high photosynthesis rates. Interannual variability in GPP was dominated by the frequency of light limitation (R-g<200 W m(-2)), whereas R-eco depends most directly on soil temperature and time in the growing season, which serves as a proxy of the combined effects of active layer depth, leaf area index, soil moisture and substrate availability. The methane flux, in units of global warming potential, was +28 g C-CO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1), so that the greenhouse gas balance was -64 g C-CO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1). Methane fluxes depended only slightly on soil temperature and were highly sensitive to hydrological conditions and vegetation composition.

AB The Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico harbours important fractions of tropical montane cloud forests. Although it is well known that the frequent occurrence of dense fog is a common climatic characteristic of cloud forests around the world, it is poorly understood how fog processes shape and influence these ecosystems. Our study focuses on the physical characteristics of fog and quantifies the fogwater input to elfin cloud forest using direct eddy covariance net flux measurements during a 43-day period in 2002. We used an ultrasonic anemometer-thermometer in combination with a size-resolving cloud droplet spectrometer capable of providing number counts in 40 droplet size classes at a rate of 12.5 times per second. Fog occurred during 85% of the time, and dense fog with a visibility < 200 m persisted during 74% of the period. Fog droplet size depended linearly on liquid water content (r(2) = 0.89) with a volume-weighted mean diameter of 13.8 mu m. Due to the high frequency of occurrence of fog the total fogwater deposition measured with the eddy covariance method and corrected for condensation and advection effects in the persistent upslope air flow, averaged 4.36 mm day(-1), rainfall during the same period was 28 mm day(-1). Thus, our estimates of the contribution of fogwater to the hydrological budget of elfin cloud forests is considerable and higher than in any other location for which comparable data exist but still not a very large component in the hydrological budget. For estimating fogwater fluxes for locations without detailed information about fog droplet distributions we provide simple empirical relationships using visibility data. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many studies have reported increased numbers of certain synanthropic species in urbanizing landscapes, but few have evaluated if urban habitats constitute ecological traps for these species. The Northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) was used as a model species to evaluate if urban riparian forests might act as ecological traps for understory-nesting birds. Cardinals were surveyed within 2-ha riparian forest plots within rural (n = 6) and urban (n = 6) landscapes in Ohio USA during breeding and non-breeding seasons 2003-2005. Cues used by cardinals to select habitats were identified based on measurements surrounding 219 nests and in 106 randomly-located plots and 96 systematically-located plots. Productivity of 161 cardinal pairs and survival of 180 adults were monitored from late March-September, 2003-2005. Cardinals were 1.7x (in the breeding season) to nearly 4x (in non-breeding season) more abundant in urban than rural forests, and the results suggest that these differences in abundance stemmed from urban-associated changes in habitat and microclimate features used by cardinals to select habitats. Most notably, cardinals were strongly associated with dense understory vegetation and warmer minimum January temperatures, both of which were promoted as urban development increased within the landscapes surrounding riparian forests. Although other studies suggest mismatches between the habitat cues used by cardinals and how those features affect nesting success (e.g., higher nest predation in exotic shrubs), these results provide no evidence that urban forests were acting as ecological traps for cardinals. Instead, cardinals in urban and rural forests had similar numbers of nesting attempts, young fledged over the breeding season, and apparent annual survival rates. Thus, these findings do not support for the idea that urban forests in central Ohio represent ecological traps for synanthropic understory birds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies in population dynamics suggest that landscape processes and habitat quality. act at different scales on population abundances, but very few have modelled their simultaneous effects. However, at a time of large declines in natural populations, it is essential to understand such multivariate components. We tested the hypothesis that natural populations of palmate newts (Triturus helveticus) are affected on three scales: breeding patch (pond), habitat complementation (terrestrial cover), and metapopulation. structure (density of ponds, surrounding populations). We conducted our survey in 130 ponds from southern France (Larzac) and analysed data with generalized additive models (GAM). Two main novel results emerge from these models: (1) the three landscape scales have significant effects on newt abundance, with more newts in deep, vegetated ponds, devoid of fish and surrounded by wooded areas and inhabited ponds; (2) the quality of the surrounding breeding patches is of primary importance in determining the abundance at core sites in a complex way: high abundances are associated positively with high densities of inhabited ponds, but negatively with the number of surrounding ponds. Deforestation, invasive species and abandonment of ponds all have negative impacts on the persistence of palmate newt populations. Future studies should encompass landscapes at different scales and incorporate the habitat quality in surrounding sites to better understand population dynamics and. provide adequate conservation measures.

AB The prominently right-skewed distribution of species sizes has been the subject of a large literature in animal ecology, but has received comparatively little attention from plant ecologists. It is evident that not all explanations that have been offered for animals are directly applicable to plants.
   We suggest three hypotheses that require further study in the interpretation of size-dependent species richness in plants.
   These hypotheses are all based on mechanisms that have generated, for smaller plants, a greater historical opportunity for speciation: (i) large adult plant size confers significant adaptation primarily in habitat types that have been relatively uncommon in space, across evolutionary time; (ii) relatively small species are more widely differentiated from each other in the environmental qualities defining their niches, many of which are made possible by the mere presence of larger species residing in the same habitat; and (iii) compared with large species, smaller species generally have higher fecundity allocation, i.e. they can produce a greater number of offspring per unit plant size per unit time, which generally confers a higher premium under most circumstances of natural selection, thus generating a potentially greater number of descendant individuals, and derived species.
   We discuss the implications of these hypotheses in addressing an underlying paradox in plant competition/coexistence theory, i.e. that large adult size is assumed to be the principal trait that confers competitive ability yet, even in those habitat types where competition is assumed to reach the highest levels of intensity within vegetation, the vast majority of the resident species are, nevertheless, relatively small.

AB Nutrient resorption efficiency of woody plants, litterfall and nutrient fluxes were investigated in a burned and an unburned cerrado plot between October 199 7 and September 1999. A large experiment (Fire project, Brasilia, Brazil) on the effects of prescribed burnings was initiated in 1992. Cerrado plots were delimited and subjected to different fire regimes. Seasonal trend of litterfall was similar in both plots but the production in the burned plot was 42.2 g m(-2) y(-1) before the fourth prescribed fire (September 1998) and decreased by 22%, 1 y after burning while in the unburned plot it was around 2 30 g m(-2) y(-1). Although nutrient concentrations in leaf litter were higher in the burned plot, the nutrient fluxes were 60-80% lower than in the unburned plot. Nutrient use efficiency (ecosystem level) was 4373 for P and 137 for N. Measured resorption efficiency for 10 cerrado species ranged front 14.5 to 37.2% for N and from 40 to 70.4%, for P and in general. there were no differences between plots. N is in short supply, partly because of fire history, but the results, both at ecosystem and species levels (mean N/P in fresh leaves was 18), indicated it stronger limitation by P than by N.

AB Aim This paper has two objectives. First, we examine how a variety of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors influence the endemic and introduced arthropod richness on an oceanic island. Second, we look at the relationship between the endemic and introduced arthropod richness, to ask whether areas with high levels of endemic species richness deter invasions.
   Location The work was carried out on a young volcanic island, Terceira, in the Azores.
   Methods We used standard techniques to collect data on arthropod species richness. Environmental data were obtained from the CIELO climatic model and using GIS. The explanatory value of environmental variables on a small-scale gradient of endemic and exotic arthropod species richness was examined with generalized linear models (GLMs). In addition, the impact of both endemic and exotic species richness in the communities was assessed by entering them after the environmental variable(s) to see if they contributed significantly to the final model (the hierarchical method).
   Results Abiotic (climatic and geomorphological) variables gave a better explanation of the variation in endemic species richness, whereas anthropogenic variables explained most of the variation in introduced species richness. Furthermore, after accounting for all environmental variables, part of the unexplained variance in the endemic species richness is explained by the introduced species richness and vice-versa. That is, areas with high levels of endemic species richness had many introduced species. There is evidence of a somewhat inverse spatial distribution between a group of oceanic-type, forest-dwelling, endemic, relict arthropods and a group of more generalist endemic arthropods that are able to survive in disturbed marginal sites particularly rich in non-indigenous species.
   Main conclusions Richness of endemic species is mainly driven by abiotic factors such as a climatic axis (oceanic-type localities with lower temperatures and summer precipitations) and a binary variable CALD (location of sites in caldeiras or ravines), whereas richness of introduced species depends on disturbance related factors. However, after factoring out these major influences, there is a correlation between endemic and introduced richness, suggesting that - independent of the environmental and geographical factors that affect the distribution of endemic or introduced species - the richest endemic assemblages are more prone to invasion, due probably to a facilitation process. Inconclusive evidence suggests that non-indigenous species are limited to those sites under anthropogenic influence located mainly near forest edges, but the rate of expansion of those species to high-altitude, core pristine sites has still to be tested.

AB Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) has received considerable attention from evolutionary biologists, but relatively little is known about the physiological mechanisms underlying sex differences in growth that lead to SSD. Testosterone (T) stimulates growth in many male-larger vertebrates, but inhibits growth in the female-larger lizard Sceloporus undulatus. Thus, opposite patterns of SSD may develop in part because of underlying differences in the hormonal regulation of male growth. In the present study, we examined the effects of T on male growth in two sympatric congeners with opposite patterns of SSD (S. virgatus: female-larger; S. jarrovii: male-larger). During the mating season, yearling males of both species have higher plasma T levels than females, but whereas yearling males of S. virgatus grow only half as fast as females, yearling males of S. jarrovii grow more quickly than females. Thus, we hypothesized that T inhibits growth in yearling S. virgatus males, but promotes growth in yearling S. jarrovii males. In support of this hypothesis, we found that castrated (CAST) males of S. virgatus grew faster than castrated males given T implants (TEST). In contrast, TEST males of S. jarrovii grew faster than CAST males. Our results provide the first direct evidence for opposite effects of T on male growth in closely related species with opposite patterns of SSD. We speculate that growth inhibition by T reflects an energetic trade-off between growth and reproductive investment, and propose that such 'costs' of male reproduction may help explain the evolution of female-larger SSD in Sceloporus.

AB The M and S molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae are undergoing speciation as they adapt to heterogeneities in the environment, spreading malaria in the process: We hypothesized that their divergence despite gene flow is facilitated by reduced recombination at the centromeric (proximal) end of the X chromosome. We sequenced introns from 22 X chromosome genes in M and S from two locations of West Africa where the forms are sympatric. Generally, in both forms nucleotide diversity was high distally, lower proximally, and very low nearest the centromere. Conversely, differentiation between the forms was virtually zero distally and very high proximally. Pairwise comparisons to a close relative, the sibling species Anopheles arabiensis, demonstrated uniformly high divergence regardless of position along the X chromosome, suggesting that this pattern is not purely mechanical. Instead, the pattern observed for M and S suggests the action of divergent natural selection countering gene flow only at the proximal end of the X chromosome, where recombination is reduced. Comparison of sites with fixed differences between M and S to the corresponding sites in A. arabiensis revealed that derived substitutions had been fixed in both forms, further supporting the hypothesis that both have been under selection. These derived substitutions are fixed in the two West African samples and in samples of S from western and coastal Kenya, suggesting that selection occurred before the forms expanded to their current ranges. Our findings are consistent with a role for suppressed genetic recombination in speciation of A. gambiae.

AB Presence of higher plant species was recorded in 1455 permanently marked quadrats located across Britain in 1978, 1990 and 1998 in a stratified, random sample of 259 1 km squares. Significant increases and decreases in frequency of each species were summarised as changes in the representation of simple traits, each of which had an established relationship with varying levels of fertility or disturbance. By testing the null hypothesis that the trait values represented among increasing or decreasing species were a random draw from the 1978 species pool, we determined the consistency of botanical change with changes in land-use in different vegetation types and landscape locations across Britain.
   Overall, 63% of significant changes in species occupancy were decreases and 37% increases. Trait changes were largely consistent with the impact of increased nutrient availability across vegetation types associated with inherently low fertility, such as infertile grassland, heath, bog and moorland. Linear habitats in lowland Britain saw trait changes consistent with secondary succession. Although trait changes were highly consistent with eutrophication in upland vegetation, the identity of the changing species left open the possibility that increased N deposition, sheep grazing intensity and local improvement could all have played a part.
   Recent changes in common plant species across Britain suggest that objectives for large-scale restoration and maintenance of plant communities must address four problems: (a) the increasing scarcity of stress-tolerant species in lowland species pools, (b) exploitation and maintenance of species populations on habitat fragments and linear features in the lowlands, (c) the spread and persistence of generalist species in upland Britain, (d) systemic nutrient enrichment in both lowland and upland environments.

AB The possibility that disruptive sexual selection alone can cause sympatric speciation is currently a subject of much debate. The initial difficulty for new and rare ornament phenotypes to invade a population, and the stabilisation of the resulting polymorphism in trait and preference make this hypothesis problematic. Recent theoretical work indicates that the invasion is facilitated if males with the new phenotype have an initial advantage in male-male competition. We studied a pair of sympatric incipient species of cichlids from Lake Victoria, in which the red (Pundamilia nyererei) and blue males (P. pundamilia) vigorously defend territories. Other studies suggested that red phenotypes may have repeatedly invaded blue populations in independent episodes of speciation. We hypothesised that red coloration confers an advantage in male-male competition, assisting red phenotypes to invade. To test this hypothesis, we staged contests between red and blue males from a population where the phenotypes are interbreeding morphs or incipient species. We staged contests under both white and green light condition. Green light effectively masks the difference between red and blue coloration. Red males dominated blue males under white light, but their competitive advantage was significantly diminished under green light. Contests were shorter when colour differences were visible. Experience of blue males with red males did not affect the outcome of a contest. The advantage of red over blue in combats may assist the red phenotype to invade blue populations. The apparently stable co-existence of red and blue incipient species in many populations of Lake Victoria cichlids is discussed.

AB A positive relationship between regional distribution and local abundance of species is almost ubiquitous macroecological pattern, yet the mechanisms behind this pattern remain poorly understood. I tested for the relationship between regional distribution and local abundance of stream insect species in a boreal drainage system, with a specific aim to examine if this relationship follows the mechanistic basis of either the niche-based (niche breadth and niche position) or metapopulation models. There was a positive relationship between regional distribution and local abundance of stream insects, and there also were significant relationships between distribution/abundance and niche breadth or niche position. These results thus suggest that widely distributed species tend to be, on average, locally more abundant, have wider niches and lower marginality of niche position with regard to environmental factors than species that have more restricted distributions. However, although significant, there was much unexplained variability around these relationships, suggesting that other mechanisms (e.g. metapopulation dynamics) besides differences in species' niches are likely to affect the distribution and abundance of stream insects, at least within a drainage system. The results thus showed that 1) although niche position was more consistently related to the positive distribution-abundance relationship, ecologists should not abandon niche breadth as a potential mechanism behind this relationship, and 2) that several mechanisms are likely to act in concert in determining the relationship between distribution and abundance of species.

AB Recent advances in ecology are of great potential relevance to economists. Here we present two ecological models of mechanisms of competition and coexistence, and use these to derive how the primary productivity of ecosystems, the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere and stored by plants, the efficiency of resource use, and the spatial and temporal variability of productivity and resource use should depend on diversity. We then discuss the relevance of these results to (1) ecosystem services and the economic value of diversity and (2) the functioning of any competitive system, including the economy.

AB Models of speciation in African rain forests have stressed either the role of isolation or ecological gradients. Here we contrast patterns of morphological and genetic divergence in parapatric and allopatric populations of the Little Greenbul, Andropadus virens, within different and similar habitats. We sampled 263 individuals from 18 sites and four different habitat types in Upper and Lower Guinea. We show that despite relatively high rates of gene flow among populations, A. virens has undergone significant morphological divergence across the savanna-forest ecotone and mountain-forest boundaries. These data support a central component of the divergence-with-gene-flow model of speciation by suggesting that despite large amounts of gene flow, selection is sufficiently intense to cause morphological divergence. Despite evidence of isolation based on neutral genetic markers, we find little evidence of morphological divergence in fitness-related traits between hypothesized refugial areas. Although genetic evidence suggests populations in Upper and Lower Guinea have been isolated for over 2 million years, morphological divergence appears to be driven more by habitat differences than geographic isolation and suggests that selection in parapatry may be more important than geographic isolation in causing adaptive divergence in morphology.

AB To investigate the origin and maintenance of the genetic discontinuity between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of the common sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) we analysed the genetic variation at a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence for 18 population samples. The result were also compared with new or previously published microsatellite data. Seven mitochondrial haplotypes and an average nucleotidic divergence of 0.02 between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations that matches a Pleistocene allopatric isolation were found. The frequency variation at the cytochrome b locus was many times greater between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations ((theta) over cap (C) = 0.67) than at microsatellite loci ((theta) over cap (N) = 0.02). The examination of the different evolutionary forces at play suggests that a sex-biased hybrid breakdown is a likely explanation for part of the observed discrepancy between mitochondrial and nuclear loci. In addition, an analysis is made of the correlation between microsatellite loci points towards the possible existence of a hybrid zone in samples from the Alboran Sea.

AB Invasive species have received considerable attention in recent years, but research has primarily focused on invasive specie: of natural habitats. Furthermore, cropland weeds have often been viewed as possessing a "general-purpose genotype" and therefore exhibiting relatively static genetics. However, a more current view is that weeds are capable of rapid genetic change. thereby making analysis of their evolutionary ecology a potentially valuable component for the development of sustainable weed management systems. In particular, further analysis of ongoing evolutionary change in cropland weeds is important because (1) most cropland weed species exhibit considerable adaptability. (2) cropland agriculture is continuously changing. and (3) further research on weed adaptability is needed to design cropping systems to address evolutionary change. In this review, we examine the potential of cropland weeds to evolve so as to affect their invasiveness. There is abundant evidence of genetic variation within and among weed populations in traits relevant to invasiveness, including seed germination patterns, life history, traits, physiological adaptability and adaptation to disturbance and resource fluctuations. Approximately half of cropland weed species are primarily selfing, and species with a high degree of selfing tend to exhibit homogeneity within populations but divergence among populations. We identified four critical areas for future research: conflicting selection pressures on wed in agroecosystems, feed-back driven dynamics of human-weed co-evolution. co-evolutionary mechanisms of weed adaptation in conjunction with other weed species or organisms, and the role of weed evolution in the restoration of agroecosystems.

AB Changes in leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen content on a mass-basis (N-m) and on an area basis (N-a) with relative irradiance were assessed in leaves of eight temperate species harvested at different depths in a canopy. Relative irradiance (GSF) at the points of leaf sampling was estimated by hemispheric photographs. There was a strong species-dependent positive relationship between LMA and GSF for all species. Shade-tolerant species such as Fagus sylvatica showed lower LMA for the same GSF than less tolerant species as Quercus pyrenaica or Quercus petraea. The only evergreen species in the study, Ilex aquifollium, had the highest LMA, independent of light environment, with minimum values much higher than the rest of the broad-leaved species studied. There was no relation between N and GSF for most species studied and only a very weak relation for the relative shade-intolerant species Q. pyrenaica. Within each species, the pattern of Na investment with regard to GSF was linked mainly to LMA. At the same relative irradiance, differences in N. among species were conditioned both by the LMA-GSF relationship and by the species N value. The lowest N-m value was measured in I. aquifollium (14.3 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)); intermediate values in Crataegus monogyna (16.9 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)) and Prunus avium (19.1 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)) and higher values, all in a narrow range (21.3 +/- 0.6 to 23 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)), were measured for the other five species. Changes in LMA with the relative irradiance were linked both to lamina thickness (LT) and to palisade/spongy parenchyma ratio (PP/SP). In the second case, the LMA changes may be related to an increase in lamina density as palisade parenchyma involves higher cell packing than spongy parenchyma. However, since PP/SP ratio showed a weak species-specific relationship with LMA, the increase in LT should be the main cause of LMA variation. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The framework for modern studies of speciation was established as part of the Neo-Darwinian synthesis of the early twentieth century. Here we evaluate this framework in the light of recent empirical and theoretical studies. Evidence from experimental studies of selection, quantitative genetic studies of species' differences, and the molecular evolution of 'isolation' genes, all agree that directional selection is the primary cause of speciation, as initially proposed by Darwin. Likewise, as suggested by Dobzhansky and Mayr, gene flow does hold species together, but probably more by facilitating the spread of beneficial mutants and associated hitchhiking events than by homogenizing neutral loci. Reproductive barriers are important as well in that they preserve adaptations, but as has been stressed by botanists for close to a century, they rarely protect the entire genome from gene flow in recently diverged species. Contrary to early views, it is now clear that speciation can occur in the presence of gene flow. However, recent theory does support the long-held view that population structure and small population size may increase speciation rates, but only under special conditions and not because of the increased efficacy of drift as suggested by earlier authors. Rather, low levels of migration among small populations facilitates the rapid accumulation of beneficial mutations that indirectly cause hybrid incompatibilities. (C) New Phytologist (2003).

AB Understanding the spacing patterns of individuals in a population of animals is important for establishing the specific functions of territorial behavior. Here, we couple a comprehensive analysis of home range with demographic information and focal behavioral observations of Sceloporus undulatus (eastern fence lizard) to investigate (1) spacing patterns, (2) the determinants of home range, and (3) the functional significance of territorial behavior and traits related to territorial behavior (body size, color). Male home-range area is an order of magnitude larger in the New Jersey population of S. undulatus described here than in other populations, whereas female home ranges are comparable in area to other populations of this species. Home-range area is positively correlated with body size in adult males, although this relationship is not found within age classes, and males share about 50% of their home range with other males. After removal of the effect of body size, residual home-range area is smaller in two-year olds (first breeding season) than in older males. Home-range area increases as a function of the number of overlapped females, even after the effect of body size is statistically removed, and the sightings of males within their home ranges are tightly clustered in and near the home ranges of females. Males courted females in 60% of focal behavioral observations and contested other males in 14%, always in close proximity to a female. Relative body size, color, and behavior were displayed by contest "winners" and "losers" in the same manner as previously characterized in captive lizards. Of the three status traits examined, only body size explained variation in home-range area, apparently reflecting the ability of males to court increasing numbers of females as they get older and larger. The winners of contests gained access to the nearby female, but contests had no lasting influence on the locations where males subsequently were sighted. Thus, the size and shape of male home ranges are determined largely by the number and locations of females with whom males interact. Females themselves and not specific sites or home-range area are the contested resources. Plasma corticosterone was correlated with the area of a male's home range overlapped by female home ranges. Because this measure of overlap may reflect the frequency of interactions between lizards and assuming that elevated corticosterone reflects a stress response, social interactions including contests between males and courtship of females appear to be stressful in free-living male S. undulatus.

AB To assess potential forest compositional responses to exchangeable soil calcium (Ca-exch) and aluminum (Al-exch), we characterized light-dependent growth and mortality of tree seedlings under amendments of CaCl2 and AlCl3 at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, U.S.A. Seedlings of Acer saccharum Marsh., Fagus grandifolia Ehrh., Betula alleghaniensis Britton, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., and Picea rubens Sarg. were transplanted into field plots, which were randomly assigned to control, CaCl2, or AlCl3 treatments and stratified across <1 to 35% full sun. Acer saccharum and P. rubens exhibited significantly higher mortality in Al-amended than Ca-amended or control plots. Acer saccharum showed significant increases in relative diameter growth in Ca-amended plots versus controls; all other species showed nonsignificantly higher relative diameter growth under Ca amendments. We incorporated significant seedling responses into a model of forest dynamics (SORTIE) to assess potential changes in species composition under Al-exch increases and Ca-exch losses. SORTIE predicts that further increases in Al-exch would have negligible effects on canopy composition within 200 years but that the estimated Ca-exch depleted from HBEF between 1968 and 1995 and its influence on seedling dynamics could lead to substantial decreases in A. saccharum canopy dominance within a single forest generation (<125 years).

AB Many trees in mature forests show intermittent reproduction. Intensive flowering and seed production occur only once in several years, often synchronized over a long distance. In a previous paper, we showed that the limitation of fruit production by the outcross pollen availability can bring about synchronized reproduction of trees in a constant environment, assuming that pollen availability depends on the mean flowering intensity of the trees. However, pollen exchange normally occurs within a distance much shorter than the extent of the whole forest. We studied a coupled map lattice, in which each tree engages in the chaotic dynamics of energy reserve level, but different trees are coupled by pollen exchange with neighbors. We first derived a relation between two statistics of spatial covariance (dynamic spatial covariance and snapshot spatial covariance). A strong synchronization of tree reproduction can develop over the whole forest that may be orders of magnitude larger than the distance of direct pollen exchange between trees. The fluctuation is close to a cycle with a period of two years. The model of local coupling always generates non-uniform spatial patterns, but the enhanced spatial covariance caused by the spatial heterogeneity is restricted to a short range, only a few times larger than the spatial range of direct interaction. When pollen exchange occurs beyond the nearest neighbors, the local spatial pattern becomes proportionally larger, but the condition for synchronization of the whole forest and its magnitude are the same as for the case with the nearest neighbor pollen exchange. When a fraction of the seeds are sired by globally dispersed pollen and the rest are sired by local pollen, long-range synchronization can occur for a wide-parameter region, and trees may engage in a fluctuation with a masting interval longer than two years. We discuss alternative explanations for the long-range synchronization of beech forests.

AB The Landsat Earth observation approach introduced in 1972 created a new way of monitoring land cover and land use globally. The Landsat 7 mission, successfully launched on April 15, 1999, continues those observations and demonstrates significant progress in precise numerical radiometry, spectral differentiation, and seasonally repetitive monitoring. Substantial improvements in calibration procedures, both prior to launch and during normal operations, have also been made to ensure long-term stability in the acquired spectral radiometry. Landsat 7 data acquisitions are being driven by a long-term data acquisition plan that was designed to ensure that substantially cloud-free, seasonal coverage would be recorded and archived in the US for all land areas of the globe. NASA competitively selected a Landsat Science Team, consisting of representatives from US universities and government agencies, to exploit the Landsat 7 record for global change research. This team is addressing the technical and analytical means to process and analyze the core of this observation record, and for the first time in the history of the Landsat mission, the technical and operational aspects of the mission are being driven by the goals of the US science community. The expected outcome of these efforts is a rapid improvement in understanding the Earth system, as well as conceptual knowledge that will underpin significant advancements in the application of this technology for commercial, operational, educational, and research purposes. Pathways to achieve effective Landsat continuity in the early decades of the 21st century are also being given careful attention, and there is no question that the lessons teamed from the Landsat 7 mission will strongly influence these next-generation sensor systems.

AB An improved biomass estimation method that converts timber volume to total forest biomass was used to estimate forest biomass carbon storage and its changes over to the past 50 years in China, by using inventory data of seven periods from 1949 to 1998 and forest biomass data obtained from direct field measurements. By the mid-1970s, forest carbon decreased by 0.62 Pg C (Pg = 10(15) g), with a decreasing rate of 0.024 Pg C per year. Since then the biomass carbon showed a significant increase, from 4.38 Pg C by the end of 1970s to 4.75 Pg C by 1998, with an increasing rate of 0.022 Pg C per year, due mainly to the increased reforestation and afforestation. During the last two decades, planted forests have sequestered 0.45 Pg of carbon, with an annual rate of 0.021 Pg C. The average carbon density of plantations showed a significant increase from 15.3 Mg/hm(2) in the mid-1970 to 31.1 Mg/hm(2) in 1998, suggesting that the rising global temperature and CO2 fertilization may enhance this increasing uptake as well as expansion of planted forests.

AB This article explores the pattern of land use in China to understand the relationships between land use and factors that can be used to predict it. Such understanding is important for development of comprehensive models of land-use dynamics. Correlation and regression analyses are used to identify the most important explanatory variables from a large set of factors generally considered important in predicting the distribution of land use. We found. that the spatial distribution of all land-use types in China is best described by an integrated set of biophysical and socioeconomic factors. Specific attention is given to the influence of the scale of analysis on study results. Both data resolution and the extent of the study area influence the discovered relationships. Relationships obtained at a certain scale of analysis therefore may not be directly applied at other scales or in other areas. The relevance of the systematic and quantitative characterization of the land-use patterns in China for the parameterization of spatially explicit land-use models is discussed.

AB Insights into field-planted conifer seedling growth were gained by fitting height and diameter growth to relative irradiance over the growing season using Michaelis-Menten functions. There was little difference among tree species (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt., Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr., Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud., Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don, Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) in response to ambient light. No significant differences in whole-plant compensation paints were observed among species but the ranking of species' compensation points was consistent with their shade-tolerance ranking. Five years after planting, total size and recent growth rates varied little among species from low to high light, implying an absence of trade-offs in low- and highlight growth strategies. Thuja plicata had the greatest response to increased light under deep shade (<20% relative irradiance). All species increased growth above 40% relative irradiance, with no clear whole-plant light saturation point evident under field conditions. Growth rates at high light were broadly overlapping and varied considerably within species. As expected, Pinus contorta growth exceeded that of other species above 70% relative irradiance, but it also exhibited high growth rates at low light. Greatest variability among species was at intermediate light levels (30-70% relative irradiance) where careful matching of tree species to light environment can maximize growth rates.

Biomagnification, measured as the increase in lipid-based chemical concentrations in predator over that in prey, was observed for high-K-OW chemicals (log K-OW > 6.3). Low-K-OW chemicals (log K-OW < 5.5) did not biomagnify in the food web, and chemicals with log K-OW between 5.5 and 6.3 showed some evidence of biomagnification. Trophic level differences in chemical accumulation in the food web could not be attributed to bioconcentration into increasing trophic levels with increasing lipid levels, as no relationship was observed between trophic position and lipid content of organisms. Plots of contaminant-ordinated principal component scores in component space predicted the detailed diets of the species examined. It is concluded that(1) trophic interactions play a crucial role in the distribution of high-K-OW chemicals but not for low-k(OW) chemicals and that (2) contaminant distributions provide a means to determine structure in aquatic communities.

AB The role of spatial configuration for metapopulation survival is analyzed by using a stochastic metapopulation model. This model reveals conditions which must be satisfied by the species' ecology and the landscape settings before a metapopulation can persist over a long term. Taking this as a basis, initial rules of thumb for landscape management are deduced. The following results are highlighted: (1) the critical correlation length d(c) of the extinction processes determines a spatial scale of the metapopulation dynamics. (2) Only species with a dispersal range d(c) above the correlation length d(c) are able to benefit from landscape management at all. (3) A certain metapopulation can only persist over a long term if no patch is inside the range of correlation of another one. (4) There is a hierarchy of importance in the characteristics of a spatial configuration (scale and type) and, hence, in the scopes of landscape management. To conclude, some general consequences for supporting species survival by management are discussed. Some prospects concerning the use of models for decision support in landscape planning are discussed.

AB We observed brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) on indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and estimated the impact of parasitism on the success of the individual buntings in their current nests and in their future survival and reproduction. Rates of parasitism over 8 gears were 26.6% in 1040 nests and 19.8% in 693 nests in two areas in southern Michigan. Risk of parasitism was high early in the season; half the bunting nests were begun after the end of the cowbird season. Risk was independent of female age, plant containing the nest, or habitat. The immediate cost of parasitism was 1.19 and 1.26 fewer buntings fledged per nest Bunting success was lower in parasitized nests with cowbird eggs (nests were more likely to be deserted of predated), lower when the cowbird nestling failed (nests were more likely to be predated), and lower when the cowbird fledged (fewer buntings fledged) compared to nonparasitized nests. Costs were due to removal of a bunting egg when the cowbird laid its own egg and to competition for parental care of the cowbird and bunting nestlings. Buntings that fledged from nests where a cowbird also fledged were only 18% as likely to survive and return to their natal area in the next year as buntings from nests where a cowbird did not fledge. Long-term effects of cowbird parasitism on adult breeding later in the season, survival to the nest season, and reproductive success in the next season were negligible when compared between birds that reared a cowbird and birds that reared only a bunting brood, or between birds that were parasitized and birds that escaped parasitism. The results indicate little long-term cost of brood parasitism on individual fitness of adult buntings beyond the impact on the current nest and the survival of buntings that fledge from it; nearly all cost is to the parasitized brood.

AB Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were estimated in the gut and arterial blood of tropical marine fishes collected from the vicinity of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. Species sampled were predominantly herbivorous, with some related non-herbivorous species. A total of 253 individuals from the following taxa were examined: Acanthuridae, 18 species; Siganidae, eight species; Scaridae, four species; Kyphosidae, one species; and Pomacanthidae, one species. The highest concentration of SCFA in the gut of all species was in the posterior half of the intestine, where the mean acetate concentration per species ranged from 3 to 40 mM. Lower concentrations of propionate, butyrate, and isovalerate were found in the gut of all species. The highest concentrations of SCFAs were found in species that fed on macroalgae, and the lowest concentrations in species that fed on sediments. Substantial concentrations of SCFAs were found in some planktivorous acanthurids. Acetate was present in the blood of species examined at concentrations of 0.45-3.80 mM. In addition, some species of acanthurids and all species of siganids examined had high blood levels of isovalerate. The high concentration of SCFAs in the intestine of some species suggests that gastrointestinal microorganisms contribute to the nutrition of many of the species examined.

AB We measured shoot architecture and photosynthesis by three species of maple (Acer pensylvanicum, A. rubrum, A. saccharum) in response to understory and small canopy gaps in the mixed deciduous forests of central New England. Trees were felled to create six cleared gaps of two sizes(8 x 12 m, 75 m(2); 16 x 24 m, 300 m(2)). Seedlings of the three species (2160 total, 720 per species) were transplanted into five plot locations (center plus northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast gap edges) within all gaps and additional understory sites 1 yr before gap creation. Measurements of microclimates, architecture, photosynthetic performance, and seedling survival and growth were made over 1 yr before, and 2 yr following, gap release.
   Architectural variation increased greatly over the 3-yr period. Striped maple (A. pensylvanicum) and red maple C4. rubrum) increased branch numbers, leaf numbers, and total leaf areas in gaps, especially large gaps, while sugar maple (A. saccharum) showed much smaller changes. Red maple tended to increase the number of leaves while leaf size decreased; striped maple increased leaf number but held leaf size constant.
   Diurnal patterns of photosynthesis by these species differed within and between gap and understory sites. Red maple showed higher photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area than striped and sugar maple in all site/plot combinations except the large-gap south plots, where striped maple exceeded red maple. Estimated diurnal shoot-level assimilation differentiated species more than unit area assimilation rates and also altered the rank order of performance, with striped maple > red maple > sugar maple in all microsites except the large-gap north.
   Population-level assimilation vs. irradiance response curves exhibited a similar pattern, with red maple dominating unit area rates in most plot microsites. In contrast, shoot assimilation curves showed striped maple > red maple > sugar maple in all microsites except the large-gap north, where red maple > striped maple.
   Architectural variation among these species interacted with leaf-level assimilation rates to produce some differences among these species in shoot-level assimilation across the gap understory microclimatic gradient. Since survival and growth patterns are usually correlated with differences in whole-plant carbon assimilation, our results suggest that there is some photosynthetic potential for gap partitioning among these three species of Acer.

AB Spatial distribution patterns of the interstitial meiobenthos are examined across a range of scales, A global interstitial highway model is presented with the alluvial aquifer system as its central core. Spatially discontinuous hypogean entities, such as karstic aquifers, springs, anchialine waters and the psammolittoral, have limited interconnections except through the alluvial aquifer system and are contiguous with epigean waters. The global interstitial highway is viewed as an evolutionary pathway and long-term dispersal route for meiobenthic forms. The distribution of interstitial animals in alluvial river-aquifer systems is examined at longitudinal (altitudinal), reach, floodplain, gravel bar, and vertical (depth) scales. Geomorphic and hydrogeologic features and interactions emerge as major determinants of the spatially heterogeneous nature of alluvial aquifers that structure the patchy distribution patterns of hypogean fauna across a range of scales.

AB I explored contributions of phenotypic plasticity and local genetic differentiation to resource allocation patterns by juvenile salamanders from populations that are known to differ in age and size at maturity. Salamanders were raised in a realistic field-experimental system with a reciprocal transplant design crossed with a prey addition treatment. This design allowed simultaneous assessment of (1) environmental effects (prey and garden), (2) genetic effects (populations), and (3) interactions between environmental and genetic effects on overall allocation patterns and on particular response variables. Genetic differences in maturity but not growth were detected, suggesting local adaptation in age at maturity. Prey supplementation accelerated growth and increased gonad and fat body mass similarly in both populations. Gonad maturation was also accelerated by supplemental food, but the populations differed in the timing of this effect. Gonad development of low-elevation salamanders, known to mature earlier in nature, responded to high prey levels at smaller sizes (younger ages) than did high-elevation animals. The plasticity of overall allocation patterns in response to supplemental prey also differed between the populations. The result that these populations differ in maturation rates but not in growth potential suggests that growth capacity and maturation timing and size are free to evolve independently. I argue that correlations between growth rates and age and size at maturity observed in many taxa do not necessarily indicate causation but probably reflect correlated responses to local environments.

AB Sampling of 24-, 34-, and 44-year-old patch cuts (324-2400 m2) in the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, was undertaken to assess the effect of gap size and location within a gap on tree species abundance (relative basal area and relative density). Shade-tolerant species, especially eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), were relatively more abundant in small gaps and gap edges and generally decreased with increasing gap size. Shade-intolerant species, including paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica L.f.), were relatively more abundant in large gaps and gap centers and increased with increasing gap size. Intermediately shade-tolerant species, especially yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.), were relatively more abundant in gap centers. Striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum L.) was relatively more abundant in gap edges. Many of these relationships were complex due to interactions with gap age and slope. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) relative abundance was not associated with gap size or location within a gap. Analyses isolating irradiance as a factor influencing species composition were inconclusive. Instead, other effects of gap disturbance and characteristics associated with different locations in the gap, such as soil conditions and root competition, may play an important role in the gap dynamics of this northern hardwoods forest. Gap age had a strong effect on species relative abundances and these patterns reflected typical successional sequences in northern hardwood forests. The gap disturbances increased species richness and diversity in this forest. Gaps contained species not present in the old-growth forest, and the species compositional variations among different gap sizes suggest that a forest with a range of gap sizes will have high diversity. Competitive exclusion appeared to be prevented by the gap disturbances, a likely consequence of the release of previously unavailable resources.

AB Urbanization and climate change are together exacerbating water scarcity-where water demand exceeds availability-for the world's cities. We quantify global urban water scarcity in 2016 and 2050 under four socioeconomic and climate change scenarios, and explored potential solutions. Here we show the global urban population facing water scarcity is projected to increase from 933 million (one third of global urban population) in 2016 to 1.693-2.373 billion people (one third to nearly half of global urban population) in 2050, with India projected to be most severely affected in terms of growth in water-scarce urban population (increase of 153-422 million people). The number of large cities exposed to water scarcity is projected to increase from 193 to 193-284, including 10-20 megacities. More than two thirds of water-scarce cities can relieve water scarcity by infrastructure investment, but the potentially significant environmental trade-offs associated with large-scale water scarcity solutions must be guarded against.

AB Urbanisation is an important global driver of biodiversity change, negatively impacting some species groups whilst providing opportunities for others. Yet its impact on ecosystem services is poorly investigated. Here, using a replicated experimental design, we test how Central European cities impact flying insects and the ecosystem service of pollination. City sites have lower insect species richness, particularly of Diptera and Lepidoptera, than neighbouring rural sites. In contrast, Hymenoptera, especially bees, show higher species richness and flower visitation rates in cities, where our experimentally derived measure of pollination is correspondingly higher. As well as revealing facets of biodiversity (e.g. phylogenetic diversity) that correlate well with pollination, we also find that ecotones in insect-friendly green cover surrounding both urban and rural sites boost pollination. Appropriately managed cities could enhance the conservation of Hymenoptera and thereby act as hotspots for pollination services that bees provide to wild flowers and crops grown in urban settings.

AB Freshwater ecosystems are among the most diverse and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. At the same time, they are among the most threatened ecosystems but remain underrepresented in biodiversity research and conservation efforts. The rate of decline of vertebrate populations is much higher in freshwaters than in terrestrial or marine realms. Freshwater megafauna (i.e., freshwater animals that can reach a body mass >= 30 kg) are intrinsically prone to extinction due to their large body size, complex habitat requirements and slow life-history strategies such as long life span and late maturity. However, population trends and distribution changes of freshwater megafauna, at continental or global scales, remain unclear. In the present study, we compiled population data of 126 freshwater megafauna species globally from the Living Planet Database and available literature, and distribution data of 44 species inhabiting Europe and the United States from literature and databases of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and NatureServe. We quantified changes in population abundance and distribution range of freshwater megafauna species. Globally, freshwater megafauna populations declined by 88% from 1970 to 2012, with the highest declines in the Indomalaya and Palearctic realms (-99% and -97%, respectively). Among taxonomic groups, mega-fishes exhibited the greatest global decline (-94%). In addition, freshwater megafauna experienced major range contractions. For example, distribution ranges of 42% of all freshwater megafauna species in Europe contracted by more than 40% of historical areas. We highlight the various sources of uncertainty in tracking changes in populations and distributions of freshwater megafauna, such as the lack of monitoring data and taxonomic and spatial biases. The detected trends emphasize the critical plight of freshwater megafauna globally and highlight the broader need for concerted, targeted and timely conservation of freshwater biodiversity.

AB Tropical forests are converted at an alarming rate for agricultural use and pastureland, but also regrow naturally through secondary succession. For successful forest restoration, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of secondary succession. These mechanisms may vary across forest types, but analyses across broad spatial scales are lacking. Here, we analyse forest recovery using 1,403 plots that differ in age since agricultural abandonment from 50 sites across the Neotropics. We analyse changes in community composition using species-specific stem wood density (WD), which is a key trait for plant growth, survival and forest carbon storage. In wet forest, succession proceeds from low towards high community WD (acquisitive towards conservative trait values), in line with standard successional theory. However, in dry forest, succession proceeds from high towards low community WD (conservative towards acquisitive trait values), probably because high WD reflects drought tolerance in harsh early successional environments. Dry season intensity drives WD recovery by influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in convergence of the community WD over time as vegetation cover builds up. These ecological insights can be used to improve species selection for reforestation. Reforestation species selected to establish a first protective canopy layer should, among other criteria, ideally have a similar WD to the early successional communities that dominate under the prevailing macroclimatic conditions.

AB Globally, the allocation of root-shoot biomass is a key plant-adaptive strategy for terrestrial ecosystems to enhance carbon-sequestration capacity. However, the deep mechanisms of above-/below-ground biomass distribution remain unclear, partly due to the multiple influencing factors. We thus aim to clarify the role of various factors in biomass allocation across diverse terrestrial biomes in the paper. A key indicator named root/shoot ratio (RSR) was established, and 7763 observational data-sets were collected from literature, including root biomass, shoot biomass, plant height, climate information and the geographical coordinates. Results highlighted the differences in RSR across terrestrial plants in biomes with a mean value of approximately 0.90. Grasses and boreal forest captured the highest and lowest mean RSR, respectively, while tree had a lower mean RSR than shrub and grass. Angiosperms and deciduous plants, on the other hand, have a higher mean RSR than gymnosperms and evergreen plants, respectively. Moreover, RSR is negatively correlated with mean annual temperature, precipitation, plant height and shoot biomass, but positively correlated with elevation and latitude. Redundancy analysis reflected that biotic and abiotic factors explained RSR variability similarly with a residual of 0.883. These findings support the optimal partitioning hypothesis that plants adjust their growth strategy according to different environments, and in particular, tend to partition more biomass to root systems under more stressful, low-nutrient and poor climatic conditions.

AB Much ecological research aims to explain how climate impacts biodiversity and ecosystem-level processes through functional traits that link environment with individual performance. However, the specific climatic drivers of functional diversity across space and time remain unclear due largely to limitations in the availability of paired trait and climate data. We compile and analyze a global forest dataset using a method based on abundance-weighted trait moments to assess how climate influences the shapes of whole-community trait distributions. Our approach combines abundance-weighted metrics with diverse climate factors to produce a comprehensive catalog of trait-climate relationships that differ dramatically-27% of significant results change in sign and 71% disagree on sign, significance, or both-from traditional species-weighted methods. We find that (i) functional diversity generally declines with increasing latitude and elevation, (ii) temperature variability and vapor pressure are the strongest drivers of geographic shifts in functional composition and ecological strategies, and (iii) functional composition may currently be shifting over time due to rapid climate warming. Our analysis demonstrates that climate strongly governs functional diversity and provides essential information needed to predict how biodiversity and ecosystem function will respond to climate change.

AB The last 100 years have seen a huge change in the global structure of the human population, with the majority of people now living in urban rather than rural environments. An assumed consequence is that people will have fewer experiences of nature, and this could have important consequences given the myriad health benefits that they can gain from such experiences. Alternatively, as experiences of nature become rarer, people might be more likely actively to seek them out, mitigating the negative effects of urbanisation. In this study, we used data for 3000 survey respondents from across the UK, and a nature-dose framework, to determine whether (a) increasing urbanisation is associated with a decrease in the frequency, duration and intensity of nature dose; and (b) differences in nature exposure associated with urbanisation impact on four population health outcomes (depression, self-reported health, social cohesion and physical activity). We found negative exponential relationships between nature dose and the degree of urbanisation. The frequency and duration of dose decreased from rural to suburban environments, followed by little change with further increases in urbanisation. There were weak but positive associations between frequency and duration of dose across all four health domains, while different dimensions of dose showed more positive associations with specific health domains in towns and cities. We show that people in urban areas with a low nature dose tend to have worse health across multiple domains, but have the potential for the greatest gains from spending longer in nature, or living in green areas.

AB Despite the prevalence of sexual reproduction across eukaryotes, there is a remarkable diversity of sex-determination mechanisms. The underlying causes of this diversity remain unclear, and it is unknown whether there are convergent trends in the directionality of turnover in sex-determination mechanisms. We used the recently assembled Tree of Sex database to assess patterns in the evolution of sex-determination systems in the remarkably diverse vertebrate clades of teleost fish, squamate reptiles and amphibians. Contrary to theoretical predictions, we find no evidence that the evolution of separate sexes is irreversible, as transitions from separate sexes to hermaphroditism occur at higher rates than the reverse in fish. We also find that transitions from environmental sex determination to genetic sex determination occur at higher rates than the reverse in both squamates and fish, suggesting that genetic sex determination is more stable. However, our data are not consistent with the hypothesis that heteromorphic sex chromosomes are an evolutionary trap. Rather, we find similar transition rates between homomorphic and heteromorphic sex chromosomes in both fish and amphibians, and to environmental sex determination from heteromorphic vs. homomorphic sex chromosome systems in fish. Finally, we find that transitions between male and female heterogamety occur at similar rates in amphibians and squamates, while transitions to male heterogamety occur at higher rates in fish. Together, these results provide the most comprehensive view to date of the evolution of vertebrate sex determination in a phylogenetic context, providing new insight into long-standing questions about the evolution of sexual reproduction.

AB This paper employs the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in studying the impact of energy consumption, economic growth, and urbanization on carbon emissions in developing economies. Data from twelve developing East Asian and Pacific countries for the period 1990 to 2014 has been used for analysis. The empirical results, estimated through application of the System Generalized Method of Moment (GMM), show that energy consumption, economic growth, and urbanization all significantly increase carbon emissions, thereby adding to serious environmental challenges in the region. Moreover, public policies designed to shift economies from non-renewable to renewable energy resources have been taken into account, and their impact was found to have been insignificant in the sampled countries. However, the results depict an inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita economic growth and carbon emissions, confirming the existence of an EKC in the region. The empirical findings suggest that energy conservation and policies fostering use of renewables helped to improve economic growth, control carbon emissions, and support the rising energy demand resulting from increased urban sprawl. In order to improve the influence of public policies in controlling carbon emissions, our analysis finds a need for stronger initiative to be taken in regional dialogues and policy frameworks, and for greater collaboration among diverse stakeholders often characterized by differing values, interests, and objectives.

AB The pace-of-life syndrome (i.e., POLS) hypothesis posits that behavioral and physiological traits mediate the trade-off between current and future reproduction. This hypothesis predicts that life history, behavioral, and physiological traits will covary under clearly defined conditions. Empirical tests are equivocal and suggest that the conditions necessary for the POLS to emerge are not always met. We nuance and expand the POLS hypothesis to consider alternative relationships among behavior, physiology, and life history. These relationships will vary with the nature of predation risk, the challenges posed by resource acquisition, and the energy management strategies of organisms. We also discuss how the plastic response of behavior, physiology, and life history to changes in ecological conditions and variation in resource acquisition among individuals determine our ability to detect a fast-slow pace of life in the first place or associations among these traits. Future empirical studies will provide most insights on the coevolution among behavior, physiology, and life history by investigating these traits both at the genetic and phenotypic levels in varying types of predation regimes and levels of resource abundance.
   We revisit the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, suggesting that behaviors involving a risk of death or injury should coevolve with higher metabolic rates, higher fecundity, faster growth, and heightened mortality rates. Empirical support for this hypothesis is mixed. We show how relaxing some of the assumptions underlying the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis allows us to consider alternative relationships among behavior, physiology, and life history, and why we fail to meet the predictions posed by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis in some populations. Our discussion emphasizes the need to re-integrate the role of the species' natural history, ecological conditions, and phenotypic plasticity in shaping relationships among behavior, physiology, and life history.

AB Specific members of complex microbiota can influence host phenotypes, depending on both the abiotic environment and the presence of other microorganisms. Therefore, it is challenging to define bacterial combinations that have predictable host phenotypic outputs. We demonstrate that plant-bacterium binary-association assays inform the design of small synthetic communities with predictable phenotypes in the host. Specifically, we constructed synthetic communities that modified phosphate accumulation in the shoot and induced phosphate starvation-responsive genes in a predictable fashion. We found that bacterial colonization of the plant is not a predictor of the plant phenotypes we analyzed. Finally, we demonstrated that characterizing a subset of all possible bacterial synthetic communities is sufficient to predict the outcome of untested bacterial consortia. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to infer causal relationships between microbiota membership and host phenotypes and to use these inferences to rationally design novel communities.

AB Protected areas (PAs) are intended to provide native biodiversity and habitats with a refuge against the impacts of global change, particularly acting as natural filters against biological invasions. In practice, however, it is unknown how effective PAs will be in shielding native species from invasions under projected climate change. Here, we investigate the current and future potential distributions of 100 of the most invasive terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species in Europe. We use this information to evaluate the combined threat posed by climate change and invasions to existing PAs and the most susceptible species they shelter. We found that only a quarter of Europe's marine and terrestrial areas protected over the last 100years have been colonized by any of the invaders investigated, despite offering climatically suitable conditions for invasion. In addition, hotspots of invasive species and the most susceptible native species to their establishment do not match at large continental scales. Furthermore, the predicted richness of invaders is 11%-18% significantly lower inside PAs than outside them. Invasive species are rare in long-established national parks and nature reserves, which are actively protected and often located in remote and pristine regions with very low human density. In contrast, the richness of invasive species is high in the more recently designated Natura 2000 sites, which are subject to high human accessibility. This situation may change in the future, since our models anticipate important shifts in species ranges toward the north and east of Europe at unprecedented rates of 14-55km/decade, depending on taxonomic group and scenario. This may seriously compromise the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study is the first comprehensive assessment of the resistance that PAs provide against biological invasions and climate change on a continental scale and illustrates their strategic value in safeguarding native biodiversity.

AB The annual migration of similar to 1.2 million wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) through the Serengeti Mara Ecosystem is the largest remaining overland migration in the world. One of the most iconic portions of their migration is crossing of the Mara River, during which thousands drown annually. These mass drownings have been noted, but their frequency, size, and impact on aquatic ecosystems have not been quantified. Here, we estimate the frequency and size of mass drownings in the Mara River and model the fate of carcass nutrients through the river ecosystem. Mass drownings (>100 individuals) occurred in at least 13 of the past 15 y; on average, 6,250 carcasses and 1,100 tons of biomass enter the river each year. Half of a wildebeest carcass dry mass is bone, which takes 7 y to decompose, thus acting as a long-term source of nutrients to the Mara River. Carcass soft tissue decomposes in 2-10 wk, and these nutrients are mineralized by consumers, assimilated by biofilms, transported downstream, or moved back into the terrestrial ecosystem by scavengers. These inputs comprise 34-50% of the assimilated diet of fish when carcasses are present and 7-24% via biofilm on bones after soft tissue decomposition. Our results show a terrestrial animal migration can have large impacts on a river ecosystem, which may influence nutrient cycling and river food webs at decadal time scales. Similar mass drownings may have played an important role in rivers throughout the world when large migratory herds were more common features of the landscape.

AB Following a request from EFSA, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues developed an opinion on the science behind the risk assessment of plant protection products for in-soil organisms. The current risk assessment scheme is reviewed, taking into account new regulatory frameworks and scientific developments. Proposals are made for specific protection goals for in-soil organisms being key drivers for relevant ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes such as nutrient cycling, soil structure, pest control and biodiversity. Considering the time-scales and biological processes related to the dispersal of the majority of in-soil organisms compared to terrestrial non-target arthropods living above soil, the Panel proposes that in-soil environmental risk assessments are made at in- and off-field scale considering field boundary levels. A new testing strategy which takes into account the relevant exposure routes for in-soil organisms and the potential direct and indirect effects is proposed. In order to address species recovery and long-term impacts of PPPs, the use of population models is also proposed. (C) 2017 European Food Safety Authority.

AB Metacommunity ecology has rapidly become a dominant framework through which ecologists understand the natural world. Unfortunately, persistent misunderstandings regarding metacommunity theory and the methods for evaluating hypotheses based on the theory are common in the ecological literature. Since its beginnings, four major paradigms-species sorting, mass effects, neutrality, and patch dynamics-have been associated with metacommunity ecology. The Big 4 have been misconstrued to represent the complete set of metacommunity dynamics. As a result, many investigators attempt to evaluate community assembly processes as strictly belonging to one of the Big 4 types, rather than embracing the full scope of metacommunity theory. The Big 4 were never intended to represent the entire spectrum of metacommunity dynamics and were rather examples of historical paradigms that fit within the new framework. We argue that perpetuation of the Big 4 typology hurts community ecology and we encourage researchers to embrace the full inference space of metacommunity theory. A related, but distinct issue is that the technique of variation partitioning is often used to evaluate the dynamics of metacommunities. This methodology has produced its own set of misunderstandings, some of which are directly a product of the Big 4 typology and others which are simply the product of poor study design or statistical artefacts. However, variation partitioning is a potentially powerful technique when used appropriately and we identify several strategies for successful utilization of variation partitioning.

AB Understanding and forecasting species' geographic distributions in the face of global change is a central priority in biodiversity science. The existing view is that one must choose between correlative models for many species versus process-based models for few species. We suggest that opportunities exist to produce process-based range models for many species, by using hierarchical and inverse modeling to borrow strength across species, fill data gaps, fuse diverse data sets, and model across biological and spatial scales. We review the statistical ecology and population and range modeling literature, illustrating these modeling strategies in action. A variety of large, coordinated ecological datasets that can feed into these modeling solutions already exist, and we highlight organisms that seem ripe for the challenge.

AB The quantification of landscape structures from remote-sensing products is an important part of many analyses in landscape ecology studies. This paper introduces a new free and open-source tool for conducting landscape ecology analysis. LecoS is able to compute a variety of basic and advanced landscape metrics in an automatized way. The calculation can furthermore be partitioned by iterating through an optional provided polygon layer. The new tool is integrated into the QGIS processing framework and can thus be used as a stand-alone tool or within bigger complex models. For illustration a potential case-study is presented, which tries to quantify pollinator responses on landscape derived metrics at various scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silviculture is a means to meet objectives ranging from timber production to wildlife habitat to naturalness. A common global trend in forestry is development of new silvicultural approaches as alternatives to plantation forestry that bear names that include the words 'nature', 'ecological' orsomeother positive expression regarding their intent or effects. Some approaches are attempting to emulate natural processes and others to minimize disturbance effects in an attempt to be more natural. In any case, the effects of climate changes, non-native plants, insects, pathogens and animals, and other anthropogenic effects are creating novel forest ecosystems where the silviculture of the past may not be appropriate. It should be recognized that forestry has always attempted to manage stands to meet objectives in ways that would not be similarly met without management. Rather than acquiescing to pressures to follow a nature-based model based on the past, we need to recognize that our forest ecosystems are changing and the rate of change may accelerate in the future. Natural processes and stand structures are important information about natural systems, but not necessarily for the management of these changing systems. Management of these novel ecosystems to meet societal needs will have to be novel. Rather than striving to be close to a nature that is under constant change, silviculture should strive to be better than nature. 'Close-to-nature' is flawed in both its intent to emulate nature and as a means to meet shifting ecological conditions and societal needs.

ID NO-NET-LOSS; CONSERVATION; RESTORATION; IMPACTS
AB Biodiversity offset trades usually aim to achieve 'no net loss' of biodiversity. But the question remains: no net loss compared to what? Determining whether an offset can compensate for a given impact requires assumptions about the counterfactual scenario that which would have happened without the offset against which the gain at an offset site can be estimated. Where this counterfactual scenario, or 'crediting baseline', assumes a future trajectory of biodiversity decline, the intended net outcome of the offset trade is maintenance of that declining trajectory. If the rate of decline of the crediting baseline is implausibly steep, biodiversity offset trades can exacerbate biodiversity decline. We examined crediting baselines used in offset policies across Australia, and compared them with recent estimates of decline in woody vegetation extent. All jurisdictions permitted offset credit generated using averted loss implying an assumption of background decline but few were explicit about their crediting baseline. The credit calculation approaches implied assumed crediting baselines of up to 4.2% loss (of vegetation extent and/or condition) per annum; on average, the crediting baselines were >5 times steeper than recent rates of vegetation loss. For these crediting baselines to be plausible, declines in vegetation condition must be rapid, but this was not reflected in the approaches for which assumptions about decline in extent and condition could be separated. We conclude that crediting baselines in Australian offset schemes risk exacerbating biodiversity loss. The near-ubiquitous use of declining crediting baselines risks 'locking in' biodiversity decline across impact and offset sites, with implications for biodiversity conservation more broadly.

AB Habitats are rapidly changing across the planet and the consequences will have major and long-lasting effects on wildlife and their parasites. Birds harbor many types of blood parasites, but because of their relatively high prevalence and ease of diagnosis, it is the haemosporidians - Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon - that are the best studied in terms of ecology and evolution. For parasite transmission to occur, environmental conditions must be permissive, and given the many constraints on the competency of parasites, vectors and hosts, it is rather remarkable that these parasites are so prevalent and successful. Over the last decade, a rapidly growing body of literature has begun to clarify how environmental factors affect birds and the insects that vector their hematozoan parasites. Moreover, several studies have modeled how anthropogenic effects such as global climate change, deforestation and urbanization will impact the dynamics of parasite transmission. This review highlights recent research that impacts our understanding of how habitat and environmental changes can affect the distribution, diversity, prevalence and parasitemia of these avian blood parasites. Given the importance of environmental factors on transmission, it remains essential that researchers studying avian hematozoa document abiotic factors such as temperature, moisture and landscape elements. Ultimately, this continued research has the potential to inform conservation policies and help avert the loss of bird species and threatened habitats. (C) 2015 The Author.

AB Prevailing theory suggests that stream temperature warms asymptotically in a downstream direction, beginning at the temperature of the source in the headwaters and levelling off downstream as it converges to match meteorological conditions. However, there have been few empirical examples of longitudinal patterns of temperature in large rivers due to a paucity of data. We constructed longitudinal thermal profiles (temperature vs distance) for 53 rivers in the Pacific Northwest (USA) using an extensive data set of remotely sensed summertime river temperatures and classified each profile into one of five patterns of downstream warming: asymptotic (increasing then flattening), linear (increasing steadily), uniform (not changing), parabolic (increasing then decreasing), or complex (not fitting other classes). We evaluated (1) how frequently profiles warmed asymptotically downstream as expected, and (2) whether relationships between river temperature and common hydroclimatic variables differed by profile class. We found considerable diversity in profile shape, with 47% of rivers warming asymptotically and 53% having alternative profile shapes. Water temperature did not warm substantially over the course of the river for coastal parabolic and uniform profiles, and for some linear and complex profiles. Profile classes showed no clear geographical trends. The degree of correlation between river temperature and hydroclimatic variables differed among profile classes, but there was overlap among classes. Water temperature in rivers with asymptotic or parabolic profiles was positively correlated with August air temperature, tributary temperature and velocity, and negatively correlated with elevation, August precipitation, gradient and distance upstream. Conversely, associations were less apparent in rivers with linear, uniform or complex profiles. Factors contributing to the unique shape of parabolic profiles differed for coastal and inland rivers, where downstream cooling was influenced locally by climate or cool water inputs, respectively. Potential drivers of shape for complex profiles were specific to each river. These thermal patterns indicate diverse thermal habitats that may promote resilience of aquatic biota to climate change. Without this spatial context, climate change models may incorrectly estimate loss of thermally suitable habitat. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Behavior of wild vertebrate individuals can vary in response to environmental or social factors. Such within-individual behavioral variation is often mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Hormones also serve as a basis for among-individual variations in behavior including animal personalities and the degree of responsiveness to environmental and social stimuli. How do relationships between hormones and behavioral traits evolve to produce such behavioral diversity within and among individuals? Answering questions about evolutionary processes generating among-individual variation requires characterizing how specific hormones are related to variation in specific behavioral traits, whether observed hormonal variation is related to individual fitness and, whether hormonal traits are consistent (repeatable) aspects of an individual's phenotype. With respect to within-individual variation, we need to improve our insight into the nature of the quantitative relationships between hormones and the traits they regulate, which in turn will determine how they may mediate behavioral plasticity of individuals. To address these questions, we review the actions of two steroid hormones, corticosterone and testosterone, in mediating changes in vertebrate behavior, focusing primarily on birds. In the first part, we concentrate on among-individual variation and present examples for how variation in corticosterone concentrations can relate to behaviors such as exploration of novel environments and parental care. We then review studies on correlations between corticosterone variation and fitness, and on the repeatability over time of corticosterone concentrations. At the end of this section, we suggest that further progress in our understanding of evolutionary patterns in the hormonal regulation of behavior may require, as one major tool, reaction norm approaches to characterize hormonal phenotypes as well as their responses to environments.
   In the second part, we discuss types of quantitative relationships between hormones and behavioral traits within individuals, using testosterone as an example. We review conceptual models for testosterone-behavior relationships and discuss the relevance of these models for within-individual plasticity in behavior. Next, we discuss approaches for testing the nature of quantitative relationships between testosterone and behavior, concluding that again reaction norm approaches might be a fruitful way forward.
   We propose that an integration of new tools, especially of reaction norm approaches into the field of behavioral endocrinology will allow us to make significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms, the functional implications and the evolution of hormone-behavior relationships that mediate variation both within and among individuals. This knowledge will be crucial in light of already ongoing habitat alterations due to global change, as it will allow us to evaluate the mechanisms as well as the capacity of wild populations to adjust hormonally-mediated behaviors to altered environmental conditions.

AB Although classical ecological theory (e.g., on ideal free consumers) recognizes the potential effect of population density on the spatial distribution of animals, empirical species distribution models assume that species-habitat relationships remain unchanged across a range of population sizes. Conversely, even though ecological models and experiments have demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity for the rate of population change, we still have no practical method for making the connection between the makeup of real environments, the expected distribution and fitness of their occupants, and the long-termimplications of fitness for population growth. Here, we synthesize several conceptual advances into a mathematical framework using a measure of fitness to link habitat availability/selection to (density-dependent) population growth in mobile animal species. A key feature of this approach is that it distinguishes between apparent habitat suitability and the true, underlying contribution of a habitat to fitness, allowing the statistical coefficients of both to be estimated from multiple observation instances of the species in different environments and stages of numerical growth. Hence, it leverages data from both historical population time series and snapshots of species distribution to predict population performance under environmental change. We propose this framework as a foundation for building more realistic connections between a population's use of space and its subsequent dynamics (and hence a contribution to the ongoing efforts to estimate a species' critical habitat and fundamental niche). We therefore detail its associated definitions and simplifying assumptions, because they point to the framework's future extensions. We show how the model can be fit to data on species distributions and population dynamics, using standard statistical methods, and we illustrate its application with an individual-based simulation. When contrasted with nonspatial population models, our approach is better at fitting and predicting population growth rates and carrying capacities. Our approach can be generalized to include a diverse range of biological considerations. We discuss these possible extensions and applications to real data.

AB Objective. The purpose of this study was to quantify the predictive value of frailty index on 30-day Clavien class IV (requiring critical care support) and class V (30-day mortality) complications after gynecologic cancer surgery.
   Methods. Patients included in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) 2008-2011 had a final diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy. Modified frailty index (mFI) was calculated with 11 variables. Higher mFI scores indicated more severe comorbidities. Logistic regression was used to control for known predictors of complications.
   Results. Of the total 6551 patients, 188 (2.9%) of the patients experienced a Clavien IV/V complication. 2958 patients had a score of 0 (45.2%), 2405 patients had a score of I (36.7%), 985 patients had a score of 2 (15%), 162 patients had a score of 3 (2.5%) and 41 patients had a score >= 4 (0.6%). The rates of Clavien IV/V complications were 2%, 2.7%, 4.4%, 7.4% and 24.4% for mFI scores of 0, 1, 2, 3 and >= 4, respectively (p < 0.001). Variables found to be significant for predicting Clavien IV and V complications on logistic regression modeling were preoperative albumin <3 g/dL (OR = 6.5), operative time (OR = 1.003 per min increase), non-laparoscopic surgery (OR = 3.3), and frailty index (OR score 0 = reference, score 1 = 1.26, score 2 = 1.9, score 3 = 2.33 and score >= 4 = 12.5). Taking the two preoperative factors of albumin and mFI allowed for greater precision in identifying women who are at higher risk for requiring ICU care (>10% risk).
   Conclusions. Modified frailty index (mFI) is predictive of the need for critical care support and 30-day mortality after surgery for gynecologic cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in water temperature can have important consequences for aquatic ecosystems, with some species being sensitive even to small shifts in temperature during some or all of their life cycle. While many studies report increasing regional and global air temperatures, evidence of changes in river water temperature has, thus far, been site specific and often from sites heavily influenced by human activities that themselves could lead to warming. Here we present a tiered assessment of changing river water temperature covering England and Wales with data from 2773 locations. We use novel statistical approaches to detect trends in irregularly sampled spot measurements taken between 1990 and 2006. During this 17-year period, on average, mean water temperature increased by 0.03 degrees C per year (+/- 0.002 degrees C), and positive changes in water temperature were observed at 2385 (86%) sites. Examination of catchments where there has been limited human influence on hydrological response shows that changes in river flow have had little influence on these water temperature trends. In the absence of other systematic influences on water temperature, it is inferred that anthropogenically driven climate change is driving some of this trend in water temperature.

AB Various definitions and indices have been proposed in the literature to identify keystone species. In this study, we intended to make the concept of keystone species operational for marine biodiversity conservation. We used an exclusive definition of keystone species, based on the original concept of keystone predator, and derived a new functional index of keystoneness (KS) from an ecosystem-modeling approach. First, several KS indices were formulated, by combining measures of the mixed-trophic impact (MTI) and biomass of species. Then, a meta-analysis was performed, based on 101 published Ecopath food-web models, selected with a scoring method, and representative of the variety of marine ecosystems worldwide. The indices were applied to the models, and two statistical methods were compared to select the most promising KS index. Rank correlation tests were performed to assess the balance between the contribution of the impact and biomass components to the different KS indices. In addition, a classification tree was implemented, based on ecosystem-specific thresholds applied to the latter species traits, and used to confirm the identified keystone species. The selected index obtained the highest number of models with positive results from both the rank correlation tests and the classification tree. We also demonstrated the limitations of existing KS indices previously applied in the literature. Species were ranked according to their estimates of keystoneness with the selected KS index, so that potential keystone species were quantitatively identified in the 101 modeled food webs. The standardized modeling approach allowed for a comparison of the identified keystone species across models: cartilaginous fishes and toothed whales obtained the highest occurrences. Finally, the selected KS index was applied to the well-known case study of Prince William Sound (Alaska, USA). Potentially significant anthropogenic (fishing) impacts on keystone species were also considered and discussed. The operational methodology presented is directly applicable to marine food webs, and may be adapted to other (freshwater or terrestrial) systems.

AB Plants in terrestrial systems have evolved in direct association with microbes functioning as both agonists and antagonists of plant fitness and adaptability. As such, investigations that segregate plants and microbes provide only a limited scope of the biotic interactions that dictate plant community structure and composition in natural systems. Invasive plants provide an excellent working model to compare and contrast the effects of microbial communities associated with natural plant populations on plant fitness, adaptation, and fecundity. The last decade of DNA sequencing technology advancements opened the door to microbial community analysis, which has led to an increased awareness of the importance of an organism's microbiome and the disease states associated with microbiome shifts. Employing microbiome analysis to study the symbiotic networks associated with invasive plants will help us to understand what microorganisms contribute to plant fitness in natural systems, how different soil microbial communities impact plant fitness and adaptability, specificity of host microbe interactions in natural plant populations, and the selective pressures that dictate the structure of above-ground and below-ground biotic communities. This review discusses recent advances in invasive plant biology that have resulted from microbiome analyses as well as the microbial factors that direct plant fitness and adaptability in natural systems.

AB Understanding how species' traits relate to their status (e.g. invasiveness or rarity) is important because it can help to efficiently focus conservation and management effort and infer mechanisms affecting plant status. This is particularly important for invasiveness, in which proactive action is needed to restrict the establishment of potentially invasive plants. We tested the ability of genome size (DNA 1C-values) to explain invasiveness and compared it with cytogenetic traits (chromosome number and ploidy level). We considered 890 species from 62 genera, from across the angiosperm phylogeny and distributed from tropical to boreal latitudes. We show that invasiveness was negatively related to genome size and positively related to chromosome number (and ploidy level), yet there was a positive relationship between genome size and chromosome number; that is, our result was not caused by collinearity between the traits. Including both traits in explanatory models greatly increased the explanatory power of each. This demonstrates the potential unifying role that genome size, chromosome number and ploidy have as species' traits, despite the diverse impacts they have on plant physiology. It provides support for the continued cataloguing of cytogenetic traits and genome size of the world's flora.

AB Improvements in the luminous efficiency of outdoor lamps might not result in energy savings or reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The reason for this is a rebound effect: when light becomes cheaper, many users will increase illumination, and some previously unlit areas may become lit. We present three policy recommendations that work together to guarantee major energy reductions in street lighting systems. First, taking advantage of new technologies to use light only when and where it is needed. Second, defining maximum permitted illuminances for roadway lighting. Third, defining street lighting system efficiency in terms of kilowatt hours per kilometer per year. Adoption of these policies would not only save energy, but would greatly reduce the amount of light pollution produced by cities. The goal of lighting policy should be to provide the light needed for any given task while minimizing both the energy use and negative environmental side effects of the light.

AB Predators impact prey populations not only by consuming individuals, but also by altering their behaviours. These nonlethal effects can influence food web properties as much as lethal effects. The mechanisms of nonlethal effects include chronic and temporary anti-predator behaviours, the nature of which depends on the spatial dynamics of predators and the range over which prey perceive risk. The relation between chronic and ephemeral responses to risk determines predator-prey interactions, with consequences that can ripple across the food web. Nonetheless, few studies have quantified the spatio-temporal scales over which prey respond to predation threat, and how this response varies with habitat features. We evaluated the reaction of radio-collared caribou and moose to the passage of radio-collared wolves, by considering changes in movement characteristics during winter and summer. We used an optimization algorithm to identify the rate at which the impact of prior passage of wolves decreases over time and with the predator's distance. The spatial and temporal scales of anti-predator responses varied with prey species and season. Caribou and moose displayed four types of behaviour following the passage of wolves: lack of response, increased selection of safe land cover types, decreased selection of risky cover types and increased selection of food-rich forest stands. For example, moose increased their avoidance of open conifer stands with lichen in summer, which are selected by wolves in this season. Also in winter, caribou increased their selection of conifer stands with lichen for nearly 10days following a wolf's passage. This stronger selection for food-rich patches could indicate that the recent passage of wolves informs caribou on the current predator distribution and reveals the rate at which this information become less reliable over time. Caribou and moose used anti-predator responses that combine both long- and short-term behavioural adjustments. The spatial game between wolves and their prey involves complex and nonlinear mechanisms that vary between species and seasons. A comprehensive assessment of risk effects on ecosystem dynamics thus requires the characterization of chronic and temporary anti-predator behaviours.

AB The species pool concept has played a central role in the development of ecological theory for at least 60 yr. Surprisingly, there is little consensus as to how one should define the species pool, and consequently, no systematic approach exists. Because the definition of the species pool is essential to infer the processes that shape ecological communities, there is a strong incentive to develop an ecologically realistic definition of the species pool based on repeatable and transparent analytical approaches. Recently, several methodological tools have become available to summarize repeated patterns in the geographic distribution of species, phylogenetic clades and taxonomically broad lineages. Here, we present three analytical approaches that can be used to define what we term the biogeographic species pool': distance-based clustering analysis, network modularity analysis, and assemblage dispersion fields. The biogeographic species pool defines the pool of potential community members in a broad sense and represents a first step towards a standardized definition of the species pool for the purpose of comparative ecological, evolutionary and biogeographic studies.

AB Flower colour polymorphism is traditionally attributed to pollinator selection although other factors, such as indirect selection on correlated traits, can play an important role.Lysimachia arvensis is a widespread annual species with two colour morphs differing in anthocyanin composition. We explored the hypothesis that colour polymorphism is maintained by selection related to environmental heterogeneity. Morph frequencies and environmental traits were recorded in 51 populations along a wide geographical range. To explore the existence of morph-by-environment interactions, we conducted an experimental study comparing the two morphs under treatments differing in water and light availability. A geographical pattern was found with a negative association between blue frequencies and latitude. The proportion of the blue morph increased with temperature and sunshine hours, but decreased with precipitation. Flowering onset and flower size differed between morphs and scarcely varied across treatments. In contrast, several fitness components such as germination, seedling survival, seedling mass and flower production showed important morph-by-environment interactions. The blue morph showed higher overall male and female fitness in all the treatment combinations excepting in sun-wet conditions where the red morph had higher fitness.Synthesis. Our results indicate that the mechanism of selection on flower colour seems to be related to differences in fitness of both morphs due to abiotic factors. These differences could explain the geographical distribution of flower colour morphs and the maintenance of the colour polymorphism. The marked difference in flowering time between morphs leaves open the potential for assortative mating and speciation in Lysimachia arvensis.

AB Much attention has been given to recent predictions that widespread extinctions of tropical ectotherms, and tropical forest lizards in particular, will result from anthropogenic climate change. Most of these predictions, however, are based on environmental temperature data measured at a maximum resolution of 1km(2), whereas individuals of most species experience thermal variation on a much finer scale. To address this disconnect, we combined thermal performance curves for five populations of Anolis lizard from the Bay Islands of Honduras with high-resolution temperature distributions generated from physical models. Previous research has suggested that open-habitat species are likely to invade forest habitat and drive forest species to extinction. We test this hypothesis, and compare the vulnerabilities of closely related, but allopatric, forest species. Our data suggest that the open-habitat populations we studied will not invade forest habitat and may actually benefit from predicted warming for many decades. Conversely, one of the forest species we studied should experience reduced activity time as a result of warming, while two others are unlikely to experience a significant decline in performance. Our results suggest that global-scale predictions generated using low-resolution temperature data may overestimate the vulnerability of many tropical ectotherms to climate change.

AB Rapid climate changes are occurring in the Arctic, with substantial repercussions for arctic ecosystems. It is challenging to assess ecosystem changes in remote polar environments, but one successful approach has entailed monitoring the diets of upper trophic level consumers. Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) and fatty acid carbon isotope (C-13-FA) patterns were used to assess diets of East Greenland (EG) polar bears (Ursus maritimus) (n=310) over the past three decades. QFASA-generated diet estimates indicated that, on average, EG bears mainly consumed arctic ringed seals (47.5 +/- 2.1%), migratory subarctic harp (30.6 +/- 1.5%) and hooded (16.7 +/- 1.3%) seals and rarely, if ever, consumed bearded seals, narwhals or walruses. Ringed seal consumption declined by 14%/decade over 28years (90.1 +/- 2.5% in 1984 to 33.9 +/- 11.1% in 2011). Hooded seal consumption increased by 9.5%/decade (0.0 +/- 0.0% in 1984 to 25.9 +/- 9.1% in 2011). This increase may include harp seal, since hooded and harp seal FA signatures were not as well differentiated relative to other prey species. Declining C-13-FA ratios supported shifts from more nearshore/benthic/ice-associated prey to more offshore/pelagic/open-water-associated prey, consistent with diet estimates. Increased hooded seal and decreased ringed seal consumption occurred during years when the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was lower. Thus, periods with warmer temperatures and less sea ice were associated with more subarctic and less arctic seal species consumption. These changes in the relative abundance, accessibility, or distribution of arctic and subarctic marine mammals may have health consequences for EG polar bears. For example, the diet change resulted in consistently slower temporal declines in adipose levels of legacy persistent organic pollutants, as the subarctic seals have higher contaminant burdens than arctic seals. Overall, considerable changes are occurring in the EG marine ecosystem, with consequences for contaminant dynamics.

AB Latitudinal patterns of nonnative species richness suggest fewer successful invasions in the tropics, relative to temperate regions. One main hypothesis for this pattern is that biotic resistance to invasion is stronger in the tropics than at higher latitudes. Biotic resistance can limit the distribution and abundance of nonnative species and, in extreme cases, can prevent establishment. We provide the first experimental test of this hypothesis, comparing the strength of biotic resistance in a tropical and a temperate marine ecosystem. Predation is one mechanism of biotic resistance, and since predation can be stronger at lower latitudes, we predicted that predation will serve to increase biotic resistance more in the tropics than at higher latitude. We conducted predator-exclusion experiments on marine epifaunal communities, a heavily invaded system, focusing on nonnative tunicates as a model fauna. The effect of predation on species richness of nonnative tunicates was more than three times greater at sites in tropical Panama than in temperate Connecticut, consistent with the prediction of stronger biotic resistance in the tropics. In Connecticut, predation reduced the abundance of one nonnative tunicate but did not affect the abundances of any other nonnative tunicate species, and no species were excluded from communities. In contrast, predation resulted in striking reductions in abundance and often exclusion of nonnative tunicates from experimental communities in Panama. If proved to be general, latitudinal differences in the biotic resistance of communities to nonnative species establishment may help explain emerging patterns of global invasions.

AB Introduction: The major climatic oscillations during the Quaternary Ice Age heavily influenced the distribution of species and left their mark on intraspecific genetic diversity. Past range shifts can be reconstructed with the aid of species distribution modeling and phylogeographical analyses. We test the responses of the different members of the genus Triturus (i.e. the marbled and crested newts) as the climate shifted from the previous glacial period (the Last Glacial Maximum, similar to 21 Ka) to the current interglacial.
   Results: We present the results of a dense mitochondrial DNA phylogeography (visualizing genetic diversity within and divergence among populations) and species distribution modeling (using two different climate simulations) for the nine Triturus species on composite maps.
   Conclusions: The combined use of species distribution modeling and mitochondrial phylogeography provides insight in the glacial contraction and postglacial expansion of Triturus. The combined use of the two independent techniques yields a more complete understanding of the historical biogeography of Triturus than both approaches would on their own. Triturus newts generally conform to the 'southern richness and northern purity' paradigm, but we also find more intricate patterns, such as the absence of genetic variation and suitable area at the Last Glacial Maximum (T. dobrogicus), an 'extra-Mediterranean' refugium in the Carpathian Basin (T. cristatus), and areas where species displaced one another postglacially (e. g. T. macedonicus and western T. karelinii). We provide a biogeographical scenario for Triturus, showing the positions of glacial refugia, the regions that were postglacially colonized and the areas where species displaced one another as they shifted their ranges.

AB Rationale: Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the primary limiting factor for long-term survival after lung transplantation, and has previously been associated with microbial infections.
   Objectives: To cross-sectionally and longitudinally characterize microbial communities in allografts from transplant recipients with and without BOS using a culture-independent method based on high-throughput sequencing.
   Methods: Allografts were sampled by bronchoalveolar lavage, and microbial communities were profiled using 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing. Community profiles were compared using the weighted Unifrac metric and the relationship between microbial populations, BOS, and other covariates was explored using PERMANOVA and logistic regression.
   Measurements and Main Results: Microbial communities in transplant patients fell into two main groups: those dominated by Pseudomonas or those dominated by Streptococcus and Veillonella, which seem to be mutually exclusive lung microbiomes. Aspergillus culture was also negatively correlated with the Pseudomonas-dominated group. The reestablishment of dominant populations present in patients pretransplant, notably Pseudomonas in individuals with cystic fibrosis, was negatively correlated with BOS.
   Conclusions: Recolonization of the allograft by Pseudomonas in individuals with cystic fibrosis is not associated with BOS. In general, reestablishment of pretransplant lung populations in the allograft seems to have a protective effect against BOS, whereas de novo acquisition of microbial populations often belonging to the same genera may increase the risk of BOS.

AB A warming climate may increase the frequency and severity of stand-replacing wildfires, reducing carbon (C) storage in forest ecosystems. Understanding the variability of postfire C cycling on heterogeneous landscapes is critical for predicting changes in C storage with more frequent disturbance. We measured C pools and fluxes for 77 lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud var. latifolia Engelm.) stands in and around Yellowstone National Park (YNP) along a 300-year chronosequence to examine how quickly forest C pools recover after a stand-replacing fire, their variability through time across a complex landscape, and the role of stand structure in this variability.
   Carbon accumulation after fire was rapid relative to the historical mean fire interval of 150-300 years, recovering nearly 80% of prefire C in 50 years and 90% within 100 years. Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) declined monotonically, from 160 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) at age 12 to 5 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) at age 250, but was never negative after disturbance. Decomposition and accumulation of dead wood contributed little to NECB relative to live biomass in this system. Aboveground net primary productivity was correlated with leaf area for all stands, and the decline in aboveground net primary productivity with forest age was related to a decline in both leaf area and growth efficiency. Forest structure was an important driver of ecosystem C, with ecosystem C, live biomass C, and organic soil C varying with basal area or tree density in addition to forest age. Rather than identifying a single chronosequence, we found high variability in many components of ecosystem C stocks through time; a >50% random subsample of the sampled stands was necessary to reliably estimate the nonlinear equation coefficients for ecosystem C. At the spatial scale of YNP, this variability suggests that landscape C develops via many pathways over decades and centuries, with prior stand structure, regeneration, and within-stand disturbance all important. With fire rotation projected to be <30 years by mid century in response to a changing climate, forests in YNP will store substantially less C (at least 4.8 kg C/m(2) or 30% less).

AB Using top predators as sentinels of the marine environment, Hg contamination was investigated within the large subantarctic seabird community of Kerguelen Islands, a remote area from the poorly known Southern Indian Ocean. Chicks of 21 sympatric seabirds presented a wide range of Hg concentrations, with the highest contaminated species containing similar to 102 times more feather Hg than the less contaminated species. Hence, Kerguelen seabirds encompass the whole range of chick feather Hg values that were previously collected worldwide in poorly industrialized localities. Using stable isotopes, the effects of foraging habitats (reflected by delta C-13) and trophic positions (reflected by delta N-15) on Hg concentrations were investigated. Species-related Hg variations were highly and positively linked to feather delta N-15 values, thus highlighting the occurrence of efficient Hg biomagnification processes within subantarctic marine trophic webs. By contrast, Hg contamination overall correlated poorly with feeding habitats, because of the pooling of species foraging within different isotopic gradients corresponding to distinct seabird habitats (benthic, pelagic, neritic and oceanic). However, when focusing on oceanic seabirds, Hg concentration was related to feather delta C-13 values, with species feeding in colder waters (lower delta C-13 values) south of Kerguelen Islands being less prone to be contaminated than species feeding in northern warmer waters (higher delta C-13 values). Within the context of continuous increase in global Hg emissions, Kerguelen Islands that are located far away from anthropogenic sources can be considered as an ideal study site to monitor the temporal trend of global Hg contamination. The present work helps selecting some seabird species as sentinels of environmental pollution according to their high Hg concentrations and their contrasted foraging ecology.

AB Background: Himalayan forests are the most important source of medicinal plants and with useful species for the local people. Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS) is situated in the interior part of the Garhwal Himalayan region. The presented study was carried out in Madhmeshwar area of KWLS for the ecological status of medicinal plants and further focused on the ethnomedicinal uses of these plants in the study area.
   Methods: Ecological information about ethnomedicinal plants were collected using random quadrats in a random sampling technique along an altitudinal gradient in the KWLS. Information on medicinal properties of plants encountered in the present study was generated by questionnaire survey and was also compared with relevant literature.
   Results: A total of 152 medicinally important plant species were reported, in which 103 were found herbs, 32 shrubs and 17 were tree species which represented 123 genera of 61 families. A total of 18 plant species fell into the rare, endangered (critically endangered) and vulnerable status categories.
   Conclusion: The present study documented the traditional uses of medicinal plants, their ecological status and importance of these plants in the largest protected area of Garhwal Himalaya. This study can serve as baseline information on medicinal plants and could be helpful to further strengthen the conservation of this important resource.

AB Aim We address the unexplored question of whether the lack of information on intra-specific diversity inherent in species-level niche modelling might bias evaluation of the conservation requirements of species and phylogeographic lineages under changing climates. We test for directional biases that might arise due to these methodological differences in ways of assessing risks from climate change. Location The African continent. Methods We identified from peer-reviewed studies that used both nuclear and plastid markers the distribution of deep phylogeographic divisions within nine species of African mammals and their phylogeographic lineages. We fitted ecological niche models to describe currently suitable, occupied climates and to project the shift of suitable climate to two future time slices. We applied gap analysis to reveal potential changes in the protection of phylogeographic diversity owing to climatic shifts. Results We found that, within species, most phylogeographic lineages differ in the climates they experience and have substantial geographic separation. Models that do not distinguish these subspecific units often fail to identify potential risks of climate change to lineages. Modelled potential effects of climate change on the geographic extent of suitable climate vary in both direction and magnitude. Predictions of the persistence of suitable climate in current protected areas for the resident lineages differ on average by factor of 2 between species and lineage models. Main conclusions Our study develops an original synthetic approach by combining niche modelling, projected climate change, phylogeographic information and gap analysis. We clearly identify the potential benefits of using the new approach to evaluate risks to the conservation of intra-specific genetic diversity that are posed by climate change. Our results suggest that prudent conservation strategies need to incorporate potential differences in climate tolerance among lineages when planning conservation measures for species confronted with environmental change.

AB Animal movements and the acquisition and allocation of resources provide mechanisms for individual behavioural traits to propagate through population, community and ecosystem levels of biological organization. Recent developments in analytical geochemistry have provided ecologists with new opportunities to examine movements and trophic dynamics and their subsequent influence on the structure and functioning of animal communities. We refer to this approach as ecogeochemistry-the application of geochemical techniques to fundamental questions in population and community ecology. We used meta-analyses of published data to construct delta H-2, delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18 and Delta C-14 isoscapes throughout the world's oceans. These maps reveal substantial spatial variability in stable isotope values on regional and ocean-basin scales. We summarize distributions of dissolved metals commonly assayed in the calcified tissues of marine animals. Finally, we review stable isotope analysis (SIA) of amino acids and fatty acids. These analyses overcome many of the problems that prevent bulk SIA from providing sufficient geographic or trophic resolution in marine applications. We expect that ecologists will increasingly use ecogeochemistry approaches to estimate animal movements and trace nutrient pathways in ocean food webs. These studies will, in turn, help provide the scientific underpinning for ecosystem-based management strategies in marine environments.

AB Diverse geographical modes and mechanisms of speciation are known, and individual speciation genes have now been identified. Despite this progress, genome-wide outcomes of different evolutionary processes during speciation are less understood. Here, we integrate ecological and spatial information, mating trials, transplantation data and analysis of 86 130 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight populations (28 pairwise comparisons) of Timema cristinae stick insects to test the effects of different factors on genomic divergence in a system undergoing ecological speciation. We find patterns consistent with effects of numerous factors, including geographical distance, gene flow, divergence in host plant use and climate, and selection against maladaptive hybridization (i.e. reinforcement). For example, the number of highly differentiated 'outlier loci', allele-frequency clines and the overall distribution of genomic differentiation were recognizably affected by these factors. Although host use has strong effects on phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation, its effects on genomic divergence were subtler and other factors had pronounced effects. The results demonstrate how genomic data can provide new insights into speciation and how genomic divergence can be complex, yet predictable. Future work could adopt experimental, mapping and functional approaches to directly test which genetic regions are affected by selection and determine their physical location in the genome.

The growing field of ecohydrology and recent recognition that loss of hydrologic connectivity is leading to a global decline in biodiversity underscore the need for a unified connectivity concept. One outstanding need is a way to quantify directional connectivity that is consistent, robust to variations in sampling, and transferable across scales or environmental settings. Understanding connectivity in a particular direction (e.g., streamwise, along or across gradient, between sources and sinks, along cardinal directions) provides critical information for predicting contaminant transport, planning conservation corridor design, and understanding how landscapes or hydroscapes respond to directional forces like wind or water flow. Here we synthesize progress on quantifying connectivity and develop a new strategy for evaluating directional connectivity that benefits from use of graph theory in ecology and percolation theory in hydrology. The directional connectivity index (DCI) is a graph-theory based, multiscale metric that is generalizable to a range of different structural and functional connectivity applications. It exhibits minimal sensitivity to image rotation or resolution within a given range and responds intuitively to progressive, unidirectional change. Further, it is linearly related to the integral connectivity scale length-a metric common in hydrology that correlates well with actual fluxes-but is less computationally challenging and more readily comparable across different landscapes. Connectivity-orientation curves (i.e., directional connectivity computed over a range of headings) provide a quantitative, information-dense representation of environmental structure that can be used for comparison or detection of subtle differences in the physical-biological feedbacks driving pattern formation. Case-study application of the DCI to the Everglades in south Florida revealed that loss of directional hydrologic connectivity occurs more rapidly and is a more sensitive indicator of declining ecosystem function than other metrics (e.g., habitat area) used previously. Here and elsewhere, directional connectivity can provide insight into landscape drivers and processes, act as an early-warning indicator of environmental degradation, and serve as a planning tool or performance measure for conservation and restoration efforts.

AB Tropical forests play a major role in regulating global carbon (C) fluxes and stocks, and even small changes to C cycling in this productive biome could dramatically affect atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Temperature is expected to increase over all land surfaces in the future, yet we have a surprisingly poor understanding of how tropical forests will respond to this significant climatic change. Here we present a contemporary synthesis of the existing data and what they suggest about how tropical forests will respond to increasing temperatures. Our goals were to: (i) determine whether there is enough evidence to support the conclusion that increased temperature will affect tropical forest C balance; (ii) if there is sufficient evidence, determine what direction this effect will take; and, (iii) establish what steps should to be taken to resolve the uncertainties surrounding tropical forest responses to increasing temperatures. We approach these questions from a mass-balance perspective and therefore focus primarily on the effects of temperature on inputs and outputs of C, spanning microbial- to ecosystem-scale responses. We found that, while there is the strong potential for temperature to affect processes related to C cycling and storage in tropical forests, a notable lack of data combined with the physical, biological and chemical diversity of the forests themselves make it difficult to resolve this issue with certainty. We suggest a variety of experimental approaches that could help elucidate how tropical forests will respond to warming, including large-scale in situ manipulation experiments, longer term field experiments, the incorporation of a range of scales in the investigation of warming effects (both spatial and temporal), as well as the inclusion of a diversity of tropical forest sites. Finally, we highlight areas of tropical forest research where notably few data are available, including temperature effects on: nutrient cycling, heterotrophic versus autotrophic respiration, thermal acclimation versus substrate limitation of plant and microbial communities, below-ground C allocation, species composition (plant and microbial), and the hydraulic architecture of roots. Whether or not tropical forests will become a source or a sink of C in a warmer world remains highly uncertain. Given the importance of these ecosystems to the global C budget, resolving this uncertainty is a primary research priority.

AB Farms benefit from pest control services provided by nature, but management of these services requires an understanding of how habitat complexity within and around the farm impacts the relationship between agricultural pests and their enemies. Using cage experiments, this study measures the effect of habitat complexity across scales on pest suppression of the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae in broccoli. Our results reveal that proportional reduction of pest density increases with complexity both at the landscape scale (measured by natural habitat cover in the 1 km around the farm) and at the local scale (plant diversity). While high local complexity can compensate for low complexity at landscape scales and vice versa, a delay in natural enemy arrival to locally complex sites in simple landscapes may compromise the enemies' ability to provide adequate control. Local complexity in simplified landscapes may only provide adequate top-down pest control in cooler microclimates with relatively low aphid colonization rates. Even so, strong natural enemy function can be overwhelmed by high rates of pest reproduction or colonization from nearby source habitat.

AB Monitoring the population trends of multiple animal species at a landscape scale is prohibitively expensive. However, advances in survey design, statistical methods, and the ability to estimate species presence on the basis of detectionnondetection data have greatly increased the feasibility of species-level monitoring. For example, recent advances in monitoring make use of detectionnondetection data that are relatively inexpensive to acquire, historical survey data, and new techniques in genetic evaluation. The ability to use indirect measures of presence for some species greatly increases monitoring efficiency and reduces survey costs. After adjusting for false absences, the proportion of sample units in a landscape where a species is detected (occupancy) is a logical state variable to monitor. Occupancy monitoring can be based on real-time observation of a species at a survey site or on evidence that the species was at the survey location sometime in the recent past. Temporal and spatial patterns in occupancy data are related to changes in animal abundance and provide insights into the probability of a species' persistence. However, even with the efficiencies gained when occupancy is the monitored state variable, the task of species-level monitoring remains daunting due to the large number of species. We propose that a small number of species be monitored on the basis of specific management objectives, their functional role in an ecosystem, their sensitivity to environmental changes likely to occur in the area, or their conservation importance.

AB The positive relationship between species diversity (richness and evenness) and critical ecosystem functions, such as productivity, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling, is often used to predict the consequences of extinction. At regional scales, however, plant species richness is mostly increasing rather than decreasing because successful plant species introductions far outnumber extinctions. If these regional increases in richness lead to local increases in diversity, a reasonable prediction is that productivity, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling will increase following invasion, yet this prediction has rarely been tested empirically. We tested this prediction in novel forest communities dominated by introduced species (similar to 90% basal area) in lowland Hawaiian rain forests by comparing their functionality to that of native forests. We conducted our comparison along a natural gradient of increasing nitrogen availability, allowing for a more detailed examination of the role of plant functional trait differences (specifically, N-2 fixation) in driving possible changes to ecosystem function. Hawaii is emblematic of regional patterns of species change; it has much higher regional plant richness than it did historically, due to >1000 plant species introductions and only; 71 known plant extinctions, resulting in an similar to 100% increase in richness. At local scales, we found that novel forests had significantly higher tree species richness and higher diversity of dominant tree species. We further found that aboveground biomass, productivity, nutrient turnover (as measured by soil-available and litter-cycled nitrogen and phosphorus), and belowground carbon storage either did not differ significantly or were significantly greater in novel relative to native forests. We found that the addition of introduced N-2-fixing tree species on N-limited substrates had the strongest effect on ecosystem function, a pattern found by previous empirical tests. Our results support empirical predictions of the functional effects of diversity, but they also suggest basic ecosystem processes will continue even after dramatic losses of native species diversity if simple functional roles are provided by introduced species. Because large portions of the Earth's surface are undergoing similar transitions from native to novel ecosystems, our results are likely to be broadly applicable.

AB Humified soil organic matter storage in boreal forests is large, and its responses to warming over relatively long timescales is critical for predicting soil feedbacks to climate change. To derive information relevant across decades to centuries from manipulative short-term experiments, we conducted incubations of soils from two forested sites along the Newfoundland-Labrador Boreal Ecosystem Latitude Transect in eastern Canada and assessed linkages between incubation data and these sites' profile characteristics. The sites differ in mean annual temperature by 3.4 degrees C, but vegetation and soil types are similar. Organic soils (Oe + Oa) were incubated for 120 days at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, with and without a replaced Oi subhorizon possessing a distinct delta C-13 signature. Laboratory warming induced significantly greater mineralization and leaching of humified SOM relative to replaced Oi, congruent with greater warming-induced increases in phenol oxidase activity relative to enzymes associated with labile C acquisition (percent increases of 101% versus 50%, respectively). These data suggest that warming can influence microbial communities and their enzymatic dynamics such that relative losses of humified SOM are disproportionately enhanced. This is consistent with stable isotopic, C:N, and radiocarbon profile differences between the two sites, which suggest a greater degree of microbial processing and greater relative losses of older SOC over the preceding decades at the warmer site, given our knowledge of organic inputs in these soils. This study is a first step toward linking the divergent timescales represented by soil profiles and laboratory manipulations, an important goal for biogeochemists assessing climate change impacts on SOM dynamics.

AB Modelling the spatial distributions of human parasite species is crucial to understanding the environmental determinants of infection as well as for guiding the planning of control programmes. Here, we use ecological niche modelling to map the current potential distribution of the macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF), in Africa, and to estimate how future changes in climate and population could affect its spread and burden across the continent. We used 508 community-specific infection presence data collated from the published literature in conjunction with five predictive environmental/climatic and demographic variables, and a maximum entropy niche modelling method to construct the first ecological niche maps describing potential distribution and burden of LF in Africa. We also ran the best-fit model against climate projections made by the HADCM3 and CCCMA models for 2050 under A2a and B2a scenarios to simulate the likely distribution of LF under future climate and population changes. We predict a broad geographic distribution of LF in Africa extending from the west to the east across the middle region of the continent, with high probabilities of occurrence in the Western Africa compared to large areas of medium probability interspersed with smaller areas of high probability in Central and Eastern Africa and in Madagascar. We uncovered complex relationships between predictor ecological niche variables and the probability of LF occurrence. We show for the first time that predicted climate change and population growth will expand both the range and risk of LF infection (and ultimately disease) in an endemic region. We estimate that populations at risk to LF may range from 543 and 804 million currently, and that this could rise to between 1.65 to 1.86 billion in the future depending on the climate scenario used and thresholds applied to signify infection presence.

AB Inorganic nitrogen losses from many unpolluted mature tropical forests are over an order of magnitude higher than losses from analogous temperate forests. This pattern could either reflect a lack of N limitation or accelerated plantsoil N cycling under tropical temperatures and moisture. We used a simple analytical framework of the N cycle and compared our predictions with data of N in stream waters of temperate and tropical rainforests. While the pattern could be explained by differences in N limitation, it could not be explained based on up-regulation of the internal N cycle without invoking the unlikely assumption that tropical plants are two to four times less efficient at taking up N than temperate plants. Our results contrast with the idea that a tropical climate promotes and sustains an up-regulated and leaky but N-limited internal N cycle. Instead, they are consistent with the notion that many tropical rainforests exist in a state of N saturation.

AB Phenotypic plasticity is traditionally defined as the capacity of a given genotype to render alternative phenotypes under different environmental conditions. Some studies focus on the individual genotype to study true phenotypic plasticity, regardless of the level of ecological organization involved in each particular study. We argue that, depending on the research question and the scale, there are advantages of looking beyond the genetic identity of each individual phenotype when addressing phenotypic plasticity. This broad approach may simplify experimental designs, increase their statistical power, and allow a more inclusive estimation of the extent of phenotypic plasticity in natural populations. We also posit that when the focus is on the ecological significance of a given phenotype, the final ontogenetic stage and size of the experimental individuals whose plastic responses are compared should not be necessarily considered as confounding factors. A broad approach to the genotypic basis of phenotypic responses, focusing on the representativeness of the genotypic sample, together with the recognition that any environmentally-induced phenotypic change is legitimate plasticity (and potential target of natural selection), may contribute to the understanding of the ecological significance of phenotypic plasticity.

AB Studies of both vertebrates and invertebrates have suggested that specialists, as compared to generalists, are likely to suffer more serious declines in response to environmental change. Less is known about the effects of environmental conditions on specialist versus generalist parasites. Here, we study the evolutionary strategies of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) among different bird host communities. We determined the parasite diversity and prevalence of avian malaria in three bird communities in the lowland forests in Cameroon, highland forests in East Africa and fynbos in South Africa. We calculated the host specificity index of parasites to examine the range of hosts parasitized as a function of the habitat and investigated the phylogenetic relationships of parasites. First, using phylogenetic and ancestral reconstruction analyses, we found an evolutionary tendency for generalist malaria parasites to become specialists. The transition rate at which generalists become specialists was nearly four times as great as the rate at which specialists become generalists. We also found more specialist parasites and greater parasite diversity in African lowland rainforests as compared to the more climatically variable habitats of the fynbos and the highland forests. Thus, with environmental changes, we anticipate a change in the distribution of both specialist and generalist parasites with potential impacts on bird communities.

AB Antipatharians, commonly known as black corals, are treasured by many cultures for medicinal purposes and to produce jewellery. Despite their economic and cultural importance, very little is known about the basic biology and ecology of black corals because most species inhabit deeper-water environments (>50 m) which are logistically challenging to study. There has been a recent increase of studies focusing on antipatharians; however, these have not yet been comprehensively reviewed. This literature review seeks to summarize the available information on the biology and ecology of antipatharians. Although black corals occur throughout all oceans and from subtidal to abyssal depths, they are particularly common in tropical and subtropical regions at depths below 50 m. Antipatharians are generally found in areas with hard substrates, low-light and strong currents. Under favourable conditions, some black coral species form dense aggregations to the point of becoming ecologically dominant. Zooplankton appears to be the major component of the diet of black corals, which feed as suspension feeders and use mucus and nematocysts to capture their prey. Previously categorized as azooxanthellate corals, recent research has revealed that many antipatharians appear capable of harbouring symbionts, but unlike other corals, dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium are generally not important to the nutrition of black corals. Antipatharians reproduce through both sexual and asexual processes. In general, polyps and colonies are gonochoric, with fertilization and larval development likely occurring externally; however, to date antipatharian larvae have only been observed for a single species. Antipatharians are generally slow-growing and long-lived organisms with maximum longevities ranging from decades to millennia. Black corals are more abundant with depth, a pattern which has been hypothesized to avoid competition with obligate photosynthetic fauna. Additionally, antipatharians may compete for space by using sweeper tentacles and secondary metabolites. With the exception of a few predators such as gastropods and green sea turtles, antipatharians appear to be little impacted by predation. Like other corals, antipatharians can be habitat engineers of importance to a myriad of associated organisms including arthropods, annelids, echinoderms, mollusks, sponges and cnidarians, several of which are adapted to live exclusively on black corals. Given that most black coral species inhabit remote environments, our understanding of these organisms will depend on our ability to effectively sample and study them. Future collections, particularly in deeper waters (>50 m), will be needed to determine whether antipatharian species have limited biogeographical distributions or whether this has simply been an artefact of low sampling efforts away from population centres and taxonomic uncertainties within this group. Additionally, biological and ecological studies require increased sample sizes because most information is currently derived from the examination of only a handful of specimens.

AB Climate change, among other factors, will impact waterborne pathogen concentrations in surface water worldwide, possibly increasing the risk of diseases caused by these pathogens. So far, the impacts are only determined qualitatively and thorough quantitative estimates of future pathogen concentrations have not yet been made. This review shows how changes in temperature and precipitation influence pathogen concentrations and gives opportunities to quantitatively explore the impact of climate change on pathogen concentrations using examples from ecological and hydrological modelling, already available statistical and process-based pathogen models and climate change scenarios. Such applications could indicate potential increased waterborne pathogen concentrations and guide further research.

AB Recent molecular research on Antarctic benthic organisms has challenged traditional taxonomic classifications, suggesting that our current perceptions of Antarctic biodiversity and species distributions must be thoroughly revised. Furthermore, genetic differentiation at the intraspecific level remains poorly understood, particularly in eastern Antarctica. We addressed these issues using DNA sequence data for two sibling amphipod species that could be collected on a circum-Antarctic scale: Eusirus perdentatus and Eusirus giganteus. Haplotype networks and Bayesian phylogenies based on mitochondrial (COI, CytB) and nuclear (ITS2) DNA provided strong evidence of multiple cryptic species of Eusirus, with several occurring in sympatry and at least one likely to have a true circum- Antarctic distribution. Within species, gene flow was often highly restricted, consistent with a brooding life history and in some cases suggestive of current or future allopatric speciation. Patterns of genetic structure were not always predictable: one cryptic species showed preliminary evidence of high genetic differentiation across similar to 150 km in eastern Antarctica (F-ST > 0.47, P < 0.01), yet another was remarkably homogenous across similar to 5000 km (F-ST = 0.00, P = 1.00). Genetic diversity also varied among cryptic species, independent of sample size (pi = 0.00-0.99). These results indicate several hidden levels of genetic complexity in these Antarctic amphipods that are neither apparent from previous taxonomic or ecological studies nor predictable from their life history. Such genetic diversity and structure may reflect different modes of survival for Antarctic benthic organisms during historic glacial cycles, and/or subsequent re-establishment of populations on the shelf, and highlight our misunderstanding of Antarctic marine species diversity.

AB Background: The advent of molecular techniques in microbial ecology has aroused interest in gaining an understanding about the spatial distribution of regional pools of soil microbes and the main drivers responsible of these spatial patterns. Here, we assessed the distribution of crenarcheal, bacterial and fungal communities in an alpine landscape displaying high turnover in plant species over short distances. Our aim is to determine the relative contribution of plant species composition, environmental conditions, and geographic isolation on microbial community distribution.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Eleven types of habitats that best represent the landscape heterogeneity were investigated. Crenarchaeal, bacterial and fungal communities were described by means of Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism. Relationships between microbial beta diversity patterns were examined by using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and Principal Coordinate Analyses. Distance-based redundancy analyses and variation partitioning were used to estimate the relative contributions of different drivers on microbial beta diversity. Microbial communities tended to be habitat-specific and did not display significant spatial autocorrelation. Microbial beta diversity correlated with soil pH. Fungal beta-diversity was mainly related to soil organic matter. Though the effect of plant species composition was significant for all microbial groups, it was much stronger for Fungi. In contrast, geographic distances did not have any effect on microbial beta diversity.
   Conclusions/Significance: Microbial communities exhibit non-random spatial patterns of diversity in alpine landscapes. Crenarcheal, bacterial and fungal community turnover is high and associated with plant species composition through different set of soil variables, but is not caused by geographical isolation.

AB Within the field of natural-resources management, the application of adaptive management is appropriate for complex problems high in uncertainty. Adaptive management is becoming an increasingly popular management-decision tool within the scientific community and has developed into two primary schools of thought: the Resilience-Experimentalist School (with high emphasis on stakeholder involvement, resilience, and highly complex models) and the Decision-Theoretic School (which results in relatively simple models through emphasizing stakeholder involvement for identifying management objectives). Because of these differences, adaptive management plans implemented under each of these schools may yield varying levels of success. We evaluated peer-reviewed literature focused on incorporation of adaptive management to identify components of successful adaptive management plans. Our evaluation included adaptive management elements such as stakeholder involvement, definitions of management objectives and actions, use and complexity of predictive models, and the sequence in which these elements were applied. We also defined a scale of degrees of success to make comparisons between the two adaptive management schools of thought. Our results include the relationship between the adaptive management process documented in the reviewed literature and our defined continuum of successful outcomes. Our data suggest an increase in the number of published articles with substantive discussion of adaptive management from 2000 to 2009 at a mean rate of annual change of 0.92 (r(2) = 0.56). Additionally, our examination of data for temporal patterns related to each school resulted in an increase in acknowledgement of the Decision-Theoretic School of thought at a mean annual rate of change of 0.02 (r(2) = 0.6679) and a stable acknowledgement for the Resilience-Experimentalist School of thought (r(2) = 0.0042; slope = 0.0013). Identifying the elements of successful adaptive management will be advantageous to natural-resources managers considering adaptive management as a decision tool. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Our understanding of the spatial organization of root diversity in plant communities and of the mechanisms of community assembly has been limited by our ability to identify plants based on root tissue, especially in diverse communities. Here, we test the effectiveness of the plastid gene rbcL, a core plant DNA barcoding marker, for investigating spatial patterns of root diversity, and relate observed patterns to above-ground community structure. We collected 3800 root fragments from four randomly positioned, 1-m-deep soil profiles (two vertical transects per plot), located in an old-field community in southern Ontario, Canada, and extracted and sequenced DNA from 1531 subsampled fragments. We identified species by comparing sequences with a DNA barcode reference library developed previously for the local flora. Nearly 85% of sampled root fragments were successfully sequenced and identified as belonging to 29 plant species or species groups. Root abundance and species richness varied in horizontal space and were negatively correlated with soil depth. The relative abundance of taxa below-ground was correlated with their frequency above-ground (r = 0.73, P = 0.0001), but several species detected in root tissue were not observed in above-ground quadrats. Multivariate analyses indicated that diversity was highly structured below-ground, and associated with depth, root morphology, soil chemistry and soil texture, whereas little structure was evident above-ground. Furthermore, analyses of species co-occurrence indicates strong species segregation overall but random co-occurrence among confamilials. Our results provide insights into the role of environmental filtering and competitive interactions in the organization of plant diversity below-ground, and also demonstrate the utility of barcoding for the identification of plant roots.

AB Agricultural drainage is thought to alter greenhouse gas emissions from temperate peatlands, with CH4 emissions reduced in favor of greater CO2 losses. Attention has largely focussed on C trace gases, and less is known about the impacts of agricultural conversion on N2O or global warming potential. We report greenhouse gas fluxes (CH4, CO2, N2O) from a drained peatland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California, USA currently managed as a rangeland (that is, pasture). This ecosystem was a net source of CH4 (25.8 +/- A 1.4 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1)) and N2O (6.4 +/- A 0.4 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)). Methane fluxes were comparable to those of other managed temperate peatlands, whereas N2O fluxes were very high; equivalent to fluxes from heavily fertilized agroecosystems and tropical forests. Ecosystem scale CH4 fluxes were driven by "hotspots" (drainage ditches) that accounted for less than 5% of the land area but more than 84% of emissions. Methane fluxes were unresponsive to seasonal fluctuations in climate and showed minimal temporal variability. Nitrous oxide fluxes were more homogeneously distributed throughout the landscape and responded to fluctuations in environmental variables, especially soil moisture. Elevated CH4 and N2O fluxes contributed to a high overall ecosystem global warming potential (531 g CO2-C equivalents m(-2) y(-1)), with non-CO2 trace gas fluxes offsetting the atmospheric "cooling" effects of photoassimilation. These data suggest that managed Delta peatlands are potentially large regional sources of greenhouse gases, with spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture modulating the relative importance of each gas for ecosystem global warming potential.

TI Raised temperatures over the Kericho tea estates: revisiting the climate
   in the East African highlands malaria debate
SO MALARIA JOURNAL

   FUTURE; TRANSMISSION; PATTERNS; TRENDS; MODEL
AB Background: Whether or not observed increases in malaria incidence in the Kenyan Highlands during the last thirty years are associated with co-varying changes in local temperature, possibly connected to global changes in climate, has been debated for over a decade. Studies, using differing data sets and methodologies, produced conflicting results regarding the occurrence of temperature trends and their likelihood of being responsible, at least in part, for the increases in malaria incidence in the highlands of western Kenya. A time series of quality controlled daily temperature and rainfall data from Kericho, in the Kenyan Highlands, may help resolve the controversy. If significant temperature trends over the last three decades have occurred then climate should be included (along with other factors such as land use change and drug resistance) as a potential driver of the observed increases in malaria in the region.
   Methods: Over 30 years (1 January 1979 to 31 December 2009) of quality controlled daily observations (> 97% complete) of maximum, minimum and mean temperature were used in the analysis of trends at Kericho meteorological station, sited in a tea growing area of Kenya's western highlands. Inhomogeneities in all the time series were identified and corrected. Linear trends were identified via a least-squares regression analysis with statistical significance assessed using a two-tailed t-test. These 'gold standard' meteorological observations were compared with spatially interpolated temperature datasets that have been developed for regional or global applications. The relationship of local climate processes with larger climate variations, including tropical sea surface temperatures (SST), and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was also assessed.
   Results: An upward trend of approximate to 0.2 degrees C/decade was observed in all three temperature variables (P < 0.01). Mean temperature variations in Kericho were associated with large-scale climate variations including tropical SST (r = 0.50; p < 0.01). Local rainfall was found to have inverse effects on minimum and maximum temperature. Three versions of a spatially interpolated temperature data set showed markedly different trends when compared with each other and with the Kericho station observations.
   Conclusion: This study presents evidence of a warming trend in observed maximum, minimum and mean temperatures at Kericho during the period 1979 to 2009 using gold standard meteorological observations. Although local factors may be contributing to these trends, the findings are consistent with variability and trends that have occurred in correlated global climate processes. Climate should therefore not be dismissed as a potential driver of observed increases in malaria seen in the region during recent decades, however its relative importance compared to other factors needs further elaboration. Climate services, pertinent to the achievement of development targets such as the Millennium Development Goals and the analysis of infectious disease in the context of climate variability and change are being developed and should increase the availability of relevant quality controlled climate data for improving development decisions. The malaria community should seize this opportunity to make their needs heard.

AB Spatial pattern metrics have routinely been applied to characterize and quantify structural features of terrestrial landscapes and have demonstrated great utility in landscape ecology and conservation planning. The important role of spatial structure in ecology and management is now commonly recognized, and recent advances in marine remote sensing technology have facilitated the application of spatial pattern metrics to the marine environment. However, it is not yet clear whether concepts, metrics, and statistical techniques developed for terrestrial ecosystems are relevant for marine species and seascapes. To address this gap in our knowledge, we reviewed, synthesized, and evaluated the utility and application of spatial pattern metrics in the marine science literature over the past 30 yr (1980 to 2010). In total, 23 studies characterized seascape structure, of which 17 quantified spatial patterns using a 2-dimensional patch-mosaic model and 5 used a continuously varying 3-dimensional surface model. Most seascape studies followed terrestrial-based studies in their search for ecological patterns and applied or modified existing metrics. Only 1 truly unique metric was found (hydrodynamic aperture applied to Pacific atolls). While there are still relatively few studies using spatial pattern metrics in the marine environment, they have suffered from similar misuse as reported for terrestrial studies, such as the lack of a priori considerations or the problem of collinearity between metrics. Spatial pattern metrics offer great potential for ecological research and environmental management in marine systems, and future studies should focus on (1) the dynamic boundary between the land and sea; (2) quantifying 3-dimensional spatial patterns; and (3) assessing and monitoring seascape change.

AB Background: The relationship between mosquito development and temperature is one of the keys to understanding the current and future dynamics and distribution of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Many process-based models use mean air temperature to estimate larval development times, and hence adult vector densities and/or malaria risk.
   Methods: Water temperatures in three different-sized water pools, as well as the adjacent air temperature in lowland and highland sites in western Kenya were monitored. Both air and water temperatures were fed into a widely-applied temperature-dependent development model for Anopheles gambiae immatures, and subsequently their impact on predicted vector abundance was assessed.
   Results: Mean water temperature in typical mosquito breeding sites was 4-6 degrees C higher than the mean temperature of the adjacent air, resulting in larval development rates, and hence population growth rates, that are much higher than predicted based on air temperature. On the other hand, due to the non-linearities in the relationship between temperature and larval development rate, together with a marginal buffering in the increase in water temperature compared with air temperature, the relative increases in larval development rates predicted due to climate change are substantially less.
   Conclusions: Existing models will tend to underestimate mosquito population growth under current conditions, and may overestimate relative increases in population growth under future climate change. These results highlight the need for better integration of biological and environmental information at the scale relevant to mosquito biology.

AB Global warming is one of the principal challenges facing insects worldwide. It affects individual species and interactions between species directly through effects on their physiology and indirectly through effects on their habitat. Aphids are particularly sensitive to temperature changes due to certain specific biological features of this group. Effects on individuals have repercussions for aphid diversity and population dynamics. At a pan-European scale, the EXAMINE observation network has provided evidence for an increase in the number of aphid species present over the last 30 years and for earlier spring flights. We review these results and provide a review of the principal effects of global warming on aphid communities. (C) 2010 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Governmental entities are responsible for managing and conserving large numbers of lake, river, and wetland ecosystems that can be addressed only rarely on a case-by-case basis. We present a system for predictive classification modeling, grounded in the theoretical foundation of landscape limnology, that creates a tractable number of ecosystem classes to which management actions may be tailored. We demonstrate our system by applying two types of predictive classification modeling approaches to develop nutrient criteria for eutrophication management in 1998 north temperate lakes. Our predictive classification system promotes the effective management of multiple ecosystems across broad geographic scales by explicitly connecting management and conservation goals to the classification modeling approach, considering multiple spatial scales as drivers of ecosystem dynamics, and acknowledging the hierarchical structure of freshwater ecosystems. Such a system is critical for adaptive management of complex mosaics of freshwater ecosystems and for balancing competing needs for ecosystem services in a changing world.

AB Soil microorganisms are key regulators of the biogeochemical phosphorus (P) cycle. Microbial P limitation in highly weathered tropical soils has been reported, but whether it affects the cellular P content of indigenous soil microorganisms and its biochemical composition is unknown. We investigated the effect of microbial P limitation by measuring respiration, microbial growth, community composition and P content of microbial cells in a Ferralsol with low amounts of available P as affected by amendments with C substrates with ample nitrogen (CN) with and without extra phosphate (P). Microbial biomass and community composition were quantified by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. Cellular P content and P pools (PLFA, DNA and RNA per cell) were determined after extraction of microbial cells from soil by density gradient centrifugation. The apparent microbial growth rate during exponential increase in respiration rates in response to CNP addition was 0.072 h(-1), compared to 0.017 h(-1) for the CN amendment (no extra P added). This suggests that the microbial growth after a combined C and N addition was retarded by P limitation in the native soil (without added P). The net increase in microbial biomass, however, reached similar levels for both the CN and CNP treatment (measured at the point in time when respiration rates peaked). This outcome was unexpected since maximum respiration rates were about three times higher in the CNP compared to the CN treatment. Total P in extracted cells ranged from 2.1 to 8.9 fg P cell(-1) (microscopic counts), with a tendency for lower values for treatments without C amendments. Only 10-25% of the measured total P in extracted cells was accounted for by the measured RNA, DNA and PLFA. This low percentage could partly be due to underestimation of the RNA pool (degradation during extraction). PLFA analyses showed that substrate induced growth, regardless of P addition, led to a change in microbial community composition and was dominated by fungi. The extraction of microbial cells from soil by density gradient centrifugation, however, discriminates against fungi. Accordingly, the extracted cells were not fully representative for the entire soil microbiota regarding the community composition and metabolic state. Nevertheless, for the first time microbial cell P content and P pools are reported for microorganisms that actually grew in soil and not in chemostat or batch cultures. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Species that evolved through ecological speciation and that lack intrinsic genetic incompatibilities may nonetheless be maintained by extrinsic postmating isolating barriers that impose selection against hybrids. These species, however, may be vulnerable to a breakdown in postmating isolation. Here, we investigate a model system for ecological speciation: sympatric limnetic-benthic pairs of three-spine sticklebacks. Recently, stickleback hybrid abundance in Enos Lake has increased. Given that ecological selection against hybrids was historically an important component of total reproductive isolation, we tested whether ecologically dependent postmating isolation is still functioning. We compared body shape, diet, growth, and survival in present-day Enos fish with trait data in the undisturbed Paxton Lake species pair and with historical Enos Lake data. In both Paxton and historical Enos data, we found a strong correlation between body shape and diet; however, in present-day Enos fish, this correlation was absent. Using fitness estimates based on growth rates and survival, we found no evidence of selection against intermediate morphologies. It appears that postmating isolation has broken down, allowing hybrids to persist and contributing to the collapse of the species pair.

AB Pleistocene climate fluctuations have shaped the patterns of genetic diversity observed in extant species. In contrast to Europe and North America where the effects of recent glacial cycles on genetic diversity have been well studied, the genetic legacy of the Pleistocene for the Qinghai-Tibetan (Tibetan) plateau, a region where glaciation was not synchronous with the North Hemisphere ice sheet maxima, remains poorly understood. Here, we compared the phylogeographical patterns of five avian species on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau by three mitochondrial DNA fragments: the Tibetan snow finch (Montifringilla adamsi), the Blanford's snow finch (Pyrgilauda blanfordi), the horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), the twite (Carduelis flavirostris) and the black redstart (Phoenicurus ochruros). Our results revealed the three species mostly distributed on the platform region of the plateau that experienced population expansion following the retreat of the extensive glaciation period (0.5-0.175 Ma). These results are at odds with the results from avian species of Europe and North America, where population expansions occurred after Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 0.023-0.018 Ma). A single refugium was identified in a restricted semi-continuous area around the eastern margin of the plateau, instead of multiple independent refugia for European and North American species. For the other two species distributed on the edges of the plateau (the twite and black redstart), populations were maintained at stable levels. Edge areas are located on the eastern margin, which might have had little or no ice cover during the glaciation period. Thus, milder climate may have mitigated demographic stresses for edge species relative to the extremes experienced by platform counterparts, the present-day ranges of which were heavily ice covered during the glaciation period. Finally, various behavioural and ecological characteristics, including dispersal capacities, habitat preference and altitude specificity along with evolutionary history might have helped to shape different phylogeographical structures appearing in these five species.

AB Background: The gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and its orthologues play a central role in the integration of flowering signals within Arabidopsis and other diverse species. Multiple copies of FT, with different cis-intronic sequence, exist and appear to operate harmoniously within polyploid crop species such as Brassica napus (AACC), a member of the same plant family as Arabidopsis.
   Results: We have identified six BnFT paralogues from the genome of B. napus and mapped them to six distinct regions, each of which is homologous to a common ancestral block (E) of Arabidopsis chromosome 1. Four of the six regions were present within inverted duplicated regions of chromosomes A7 and C6. The coding sequences of BnFT paralogues showed 92-99% identities to each other and 85-87% identity with that of Arabidopsis. However, two of the paralogues on chromosomes A2 and C2, BnA2.FT and BnC2.FT, were found to lack the distinctive CArG box that is located within intron 1 that has been shown in Arabidopsis to be the binding site for the FLC protein. Three BnFT paralogues (BnA2.FT, BnC6.FT.a and BnC6.FT.b) were associated with two major QTL clusters for flowering time. One of the QTLs encompassing two BnFT paralogues (BnC6.FT.a and BnC6.FT.b) on chromosome C6 was resolved further using near isogenic lines, specific alleles of which were both shown to promote flowering. Association analysis of the three BnFT paralogues across 55 cultivars of B. napus showed that the alleles detected in the original parents of the mapping population used to detect QTL (NY7 and Tapidor) were ubiquitous amongst spring and winter type cultivars of rapeseed. It was inferred that the ancestral FT homologues in Brassica evolved from two distinct copies, one of which was duplicated along with inversion of the associated chromosomal segment prior to the divergence of B. rapa (AA) and B. oleracea (CC). At least ten such inverted duplicated blocks (IDBs) were identified covering a quarter of the whole B. napus genome.
   Conclusion: Six orthologues of Arabidopsis FT were identified and mapped in the genome of B. napus which sheds new light on the evolution of paralogues in polyploidy species. The allelic variation of BnFT paralogues results in functional differences affecting flowering time between winter and spring type cultivars of oilseed Brassica. The prevalent inverted duplicated blocks, two of which were located by four of the six BnFT paralogues, contributed to gene duplications and might represent predominant pathway of evolution in Brassica.

AB In most studies concerning the carbon ( C) exchange between soil and atmosphere only the topsoil (0-0.3 m) is taken into account. However, it has been shown that important amounts of stable soil organic carbon (SOC) are also stored at greater depth. Here, we developed a quantitative model to estimate the evolution of the distribution of SOC with depth between 1960 ( database 'Aardewerk') and 2006 in northern Belgium. This temporal analysis was conducted under different land use, texture and drainage conditions. The results indicate that intensified land management practices seriously affect the SOC status of the soil. The increase in plough depth and a change in crop rotation result in a significant decrease of C near the surface for dry silt loam cropland soils, (i.e. 1.02 +/- 0.23 kg C m(-2) in the top 0.3 m between 1960 and 2006). In wet to extremely wet grasslands, topsoil SOC decreased significantly, indicating a negative influence of intensive soil drainage on SOC stock. This resulted in a decline of SOC between 1960 and 2006 in the top 1m, ranging from 3.99 +/- 2.57 kg C m(-2) in extremely wet silt loam soils to 2.04 +/- 2.08 kg C m(-2) in wet sandy soils. A slight increase of SOC stock is observed under dry to moderately wet grasslands at greater depths corresponding to increased livestock densities in the region. The increase of SOC in the top 1m under grassland ranges from 0.65 +/- 1.39 kg C m(-2) in well drained silt loam soils to 2.59 +/- 6.49 kg C m(-2) in moderately drained silt loam soils over entire period.

AB Seed dispersal should leave a signature on the spatial distribution of recruits that can be quantified using sophisticated techniques of spatial pattern analysis. Here we study spatial patterns of five frugivore-dispersed tropical tree species at the Barro Colorado Island forest, Panama, to describe detailed properties of the spatial patterns of recruits and to investigate whether these patterns were produced by temporally consistent mechanisms. Our spatial point pattern analyses detected the existence of surprising spatial structures, such as double-cluster and superposition patterns, and they allowed for a detailed quantification of their properties. The spatial recruitment patterns were composed of two independent components comprising a random component and a component showing a complex spatial pattern with two critical scales of clustering. The analysis allowed an estimation of the relative contribution of scatter dispersal versus clump dispersal in effective seed dispersal for our study species. Additionally, the cluster characteristics were temporally consistent over 25 years and correlated with several species traits. We are just beginning to discover the richness of spatial patterns found at tropical forests, and we are confident that a combination of advanced point pattern analysis with field data will allow for significant advances in establishing the link between spatial patterns and processes.

AB Environmental and phytoplankton parameters were explored at nine stations located along a large scale (3188 km) east-west longitudinal transect (4 degrees 95'E-32 degrees 67'E) of the Mediterranean Sea. The trend analysis confirmed a statistically significant east-west decrease of mean temperatures and salinities and an increase of nutrients (P-PO4 and N-NO3), chlorophyll alpha, primary productivity and phytoplankton cell concentrations. A total of 216 species were identified: 48 diatoms, 112 dinoflagellates and 56 coccolithophores. On the basis of this analysis, the structure of the microphytoplankton community (Shannon's diversity, species richness, taxa dominance and community dissimilarities) along the transect was investigated. Many species (102) of this community were rare, having a frequency of occurrence <= 2.0 in all samples, but they were very important because they controlled the levels of species diversity. A highly significant power relationship between "species number-sample number" was also recorded along the studied transect. The analysis showed that the prevailing east-west gradients of the physical and chemical conditions determined phytoplankton abundance and community diversification.

AB We developed a biogeophysical model called Agro-C to assess the regional carbon budgets of agroecosystems on a large scale. The model consists of two submodels, Crop-C and Soil-C. Crop-C simulates crop photosynthesis, autotrophic respiration and net primary production (NPP). Soil-C simulates soil heterotrophic respiration via the decomposition of both input organic carbon and soil organic carbon (SOC). Changes in SOC are determined by balancing the loss of soil carbon with the sequestration of input organic carbon. The model also simulates the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) between cropland and the atmosphere. Agro-C was validated against independent datasets from the literature, multi-year agricultural statistics, and field measurements in China. These datasets covered areas with a range of climates, soils, crop rotations and agricultural practices. Model validation showed that Crop-C simulated NPP quite well for rice, wheat and maize, and reasonably well for cotton, while it did not simulate NPP well for soybean and rapeseed. Changes in SOC at different sites could be properly simulated, although there was a systematic negative bias. Observed seasonal fluctuations of NEE in a winter wheat-maize rotation system were well captured by Agro-C, but a discrepancy existed at a daily timescale. These systematic biases and errors may result from imperfect inputs, insufficient knowledge and inappropriate simplifications during model development. We conclude that the Agro-C can simulate crop NPP and changes in SOC under various conditions of climate, soil, and agricultural practices in general, making it possible to extrapolate the model to a wider domain. Agro-C also has the potential for modeling net CO2 exchange between cropland and the atmosphere. Further improvements of Agro-C should focus on the enhancement of its descriptive power for key processes, as well as on parameterization, re-calibration and validation using spatiotemporal datasets across a wider domain so that it can be more applicable to broader regions.

AB Given climate change, thermal stress-related mass coral-bleaching events present one of the greatest anthropogenic threats to coral reefs. While corals and their symbiotic algae may respond to future temperatures through genetic adaptation and shifts in community compositions, the climate may change too rapidly for coral response. To test this potential for response, here we develop a model of coral and symbiont ecological dynamics and symbiont evolutionary dynamics. Model results without variation in symbiont thermal tolerance predict coral reef collapse within decades under multiple future climate scenarios, consistent with previous threshold-based predictions. However, model results with genetic or community-level variation in symbiont thermal tolerance can predict coral reef persistence into the next century, provided low enough greenhouse gas emissions occur. Therefore, the level of greenhouse gas emissions will have a significant effect on the future of coral reefs, and accounting for biodiversity and biological dynamics is vital to estimating the size of this effect.

AB Global temperatures are increasing at an unprecedented rate and the analysis of long-term phenological records has provided some of the most compelling evidence for the effect of these changes on species. In regions where systematically collected data on the timing of life-cycle events is scarce, such as Australia, researchers must seek alternative sources of information from which climate-change signals can be identified. In the present paper, we explore the limitations and strengths of using herbarium specimens to detect changes in flowering phenology, to select potential indicator species, and to pinpoint locations for potential monitoring schemes of native plants in Australia's subalpine and alpine zone. We selected 20 species on the basis of a range of selection criteria, including a flowering duration of 3 months or less and the number of herbarium records available in the areas above 1500 m. By the use of gridded temperature data within the study region, we identified an increase in mean annual temperature of 0.74 degrees C between 1950 and 2007. We then matched the spatial locations of the herbarium specimens to these temperature data and, by using linear regression models, identified five species whose flowering response may be sensitive to temperature. Higher mean annual temperatures at the point of collection were negatively associated with earlier flowering in each of these species (alpha = 0.05). We also found a significant (P = 0.02) negative relationship between year and flowering observation for Alpine groundsel, Senecio pectinatus var. major. This species is potentially a suitable candidate for monitoring responses of species to future climate change, owing to the accessibility of populations and its conspicuous flowers. It is also likely that with ongoing warming the other four species identified (Colobanthus affinis, Ewartia nubigena, Prasophyllum tadgellianum and Wahlenbergia ceracea) in the present study may show the same response.

AB Recent models of community assembly, structure, and dynamics have incorporated, to varying degrees, three mechanistic processes: resource limitation and interspecific competition, niche requirements of species, and exchanges between a local community and a regional species pool. Synthesizing 30 years of data from an intensively studied desert rodent community, we show that all of these processes, separately and in combination, have influenced the structural organization of this community and affected its dynamical response to both natural environmental changes and experimental perturbations. In addition, our analyses suggest that zero-sum constraints, niche differences, and metacommunity processes are inextricably linked in the ways that they affect the structure and dynamics of this system. Explicit consideration of the interaction of these processes should yield a deeper understanding of the assembly and dynamics of other ecological communities. This synthesis highlights the role that long-term data, especially when coupled with experimental manipulations, can play in assessing the fundamental processes that govern the structure and function of ecological communities.

AB We estimated carbon pools and emissions from deforestation in northern Argentine forests between 1900 and 2005, based on forest inventories, deforestation estimates from satellite images and historical data on forests and agriculture. Carbon fluxes were calculated using a book-keeping model. We ran 1000 simulations for a 105-year period with different combinations of values of carbon stocks (Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon in the top 0.2 m, and annual deforestation series. The 1000 combinations of parameters were performed as a sensitivity analysis that for each run, randomly selected the values of each variable within a predefined range of values and probability distributions. Using the simulation outputs, we calculated the accumulated C emissions due to deforestation from 1900 to 2005 and the annual emission as the average of the 1000 simulations, and uncertainties of our estimates as the standard deviation. We found that northern Argentine forests contain an estimated 4.54 Pg C (2.312 Pg C in biomass and 2.233 Pg C in soil). Between 1900 and 2005 approximately 30% of the forests were deforested, yielding carbon emissions of 0.945 (SD = 0.270) Pg C. Estimated average annual carbon emissions between 1996 and 2005, mostly from deforestation of the Chaco dry forests, were 20,875 (SD = 6,156) Gg C y(-1) (1 Gg = 10(-6) Pg). These values represent the largest source of carbon from land-cover change in the extra-tropical southern hemisphere, between 0.9 and 2.7% of the global carbon emissions from deforestation, and approximately 10% of carbon emissions from the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation, which has accelerated during the last decades as a result of modern agriculture expansion, represents a major national source of greenhouse gases and the second emission source, after fossil fuel consumption by fixed sources. We conclude that Argentine forests are an important carbon pool and emission source that need more attention for accurate global estimates, and seasonally dry forest deforestation is a key component of the Argentine carbon cycle.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are the leading causes of species' declines and extinctions. A key component of studying population response to habitat alteration is to understand how fragmentation affects population connectivity in disturbed landscapes. We used landscape genetic analyses to determine how habitat fragmentation due to timber harvest affects genetic population connectivity of the coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), a forest-dwelling, stream-breeding amphibian. We compared rates of gene flow across old-growth (Olympic National Park) and logged landscapes (Olympic National Forest) and used spatial autoregression to estimate the effect of landscape variables on genetic structure. We detected higher overall genetic connectivity across the managed forest, although this was likely a historical signature of continuous forest before timber harvest began. Gene flow also occurred terrestrially, as connectivity was high across unconnected river basins. Autoregressive models demonstrated that closed forest and low solar radiation were correlated with increased gene flow. In addition, there was evidence for a temporal lag in the correlation of decreased gene flow with harvest, suggesting that the full genetic impact may not appear for several generations. Furthermore, we detected genetic evidence of population bottlenecks across the Olympic National Forest, including at sites that were within old-growth forest but surrounded by harvested patches. Collectively, this research suggests that absence of forest (whether due to natural or anthropogenic changes) is a key restrictor of genetic connectivity and that intact forested patches in the surrounding environment are necessary for continued gene flow and population connectivity.

AB No-take marine reserves (NTRs) may promote recovery of exploited populations within their boundaries and spillover offishes to adjacent fishing grounds, thus potentially benefiting the local fisheries. Although some Studies have measured spillover by examining gradients of fish abundance and body size across reserve boundaries, there are no such Studies to date including information from before reserve estab lishment, thus seriously limiting interpretation of results. We measured reef fish spillover from a NTR (Itacolomis Reef, Eastern Brazil) by estimating biomass and body size across the reserve boundary before (2001) and after (2002-2005) initiation of protection. Replicate sites were sampled inside and Outside the reserve, with Unprotected sites included in three distance categories from the reserve boundary: 0-400, 400-800 and 800-1200 m. This latter category generally surpasses the scales over which spillover is expected to influence patterns of fish abundance outside reserves (generally <500 m), particularly for relatively sedentary fishes, thus acting as a control for the reserve effect. Habitat measurements were undertaken at the same sites, from 2003 on. Biomass of Scarus trispinosus, a major fishery resource and the dominant species in terms of biomass (37.4% of total biomass), was lower inside the reserve area before its establishment. During this same period, no individuals of two primary target species, Mycteroperca bonaci and Sparisoma axillare, were recorded inside the reserve. Coral cover was consistently lower inside the reserve from 2003 on. Biomass and body size of M. bonoci, as well as biomass of Ocyurus chrysurus, increased continuously inside the reserve after its establishment, with no similar increases recorded in control sites. Evidences of spillover (i.e. higher biomass inside the reserve and in unprotected sites closer to its boundary) were obtained for M. bonaci, O. chrysurus and S. trispinosus, although this pattern was only marginally significant for O. chrysarus. Despite these positive signs, recovery and spillover of S. trispinosus were probably inhibited by increased poaching from 2003 on. Our results indicate that the NTR at Itacolomis Reef was established a priori on poor quality habitats. Thus, future spatial comparisons between protected and unprotected sites would underestimate changes due to protection. These findings highlight the importance of baseline information and continued monitoring for adequately understanding the effects of NTRs, as well as the need of closer collaboration between natural and social scientists in order to effectively protect high-quality habitats in the long term while accounting for the socio-economic needs of local fishing communities.

AB Even though the Indo-Malay Archipelago hosts the world's greatest diversity of marine species, studies on the genetic population structure and gene flow of marine organisms within this area are rather rare. Consequently, not much is known about connectivity of marine populations in the Indo-Malay Archipelago, despite the fact that such information is important to understand evolutionary and ecological processes in the centre of marine biodiversity. This study aims to investigate the genetic population structure of the boring giant clam, Tridacna crocea. The analysis is based on a 456-bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase I gene from 300 individuals collected from 15 localities across the Indo-Malay Archipelago. Tridacna crocea shows a very strong genetic population structure and isolation by distance, indicating restricted gene flow between almost all sample sites. The observed (Phi(ST)-value of 0.28 is very high compared to other studies on giant clams. According to the pronounced genetic differences, the sample sites can be divided into four groups from West to East: (i) Eastern Indian Ocean, (ii) Java Sea, (iii) South China Sea, Indonesian throughflow, as well as seas in the East of Sulawesi, and (iv) Western Pacific. This complex genetic population structure and pattern of connectivity, characterised by restricted gene flow between some sites and panmixing between others can be attributed to the geological history and prevailing current regimes in the Indo-Malay Archipelago.

AB Invasive species often evolve rapidly in response to the novel biotic and abiotic conditions in their introduced range. Such adaptive evolutionary changes might play an important role in the success of some invasive species. Here, we investigated whether introduced European populations of the South African ragwort Senecio inaequidens (Asteraceae) have genetically diverged from native populations. We carried out a greenhouse experiment where 12 South African and 11 European populations were for several months grown at two levels of nutrient availability, as well as in the presence or absence of a generalist insect herbivore. We found that, in contrast to a current hypothesis, plants from introduced populations had a significantly lower reproductive output, but higher allocation to root biomass, and they were more tolerant to insect herbivory. Moreover, introduced populations were less genetically variable, but displayed greater plasticity in response to fertilization. Finally, introduced populations were phenotypically most similar to a subset of native populations from mountainous regions in southern Africa. Taking into account the species' likely history of introduction, our data support the idea that the invasion success of Senecio inaequidens in Central Europe is based on selective introduction of specific preadapted and plastic genotypes rather than on adaptive evolution in the introduced range.

AB Question: It is well established that predators can influence the structure and dynamics of prey communities and that changes in prey communities can drive predator evolution. Here we ask whether changes in prey communities, brought on by the effects of predators, can feed back to mould the evolution of predator foraging traits.
   Study system: We sampled lakes in Connecticut (USA) containing either anadromous or landlocked (freshwater resident) alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) populations in 2004 and 2005.
   Methods: We examined alewife populations for differences in (1) seasonal effects on zooplankton communities, (2) feeding morphology, (3) prey size, and (4) prey selectivity.
   Results: Landlocked alewives, which are year-round residents of lakes, permanently structure lake zooplankton communities, thereby creating a strong feedback on the evolution of their foraging traits. Anadromous alewives, which are seasonal residents of lakes, intermittently structure lake zooplankton communities, preventing a strong feedback on the evolution of their foraging traits. This difference in the strength of the eco-evolutionary feedback between predator and prey appears to have led to the divergence of foraging morphology and prey selectivity between alewife life-history forms.
   Conclusions: Predator-induced changes to prey communities can feed back to drive the evolution of predator foraging traits under conditions where eco-evolutionary feedbacks are strong. Moreover, variation in the strength of eco-evolutionary feedbacks appears to shape patterns of ecological and evolutionary diversity in this predator-prey system.

AB The National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) program is a nationally coordinated research and monitoring program that identifies and tracks changes in ecological resources of representative estuarine ecosystems and coastal watersheds. In recent years, attention has focused on using high spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery to map and monitor wetland plant communities in the NERRs, particularly invasive plant species. The utility of this technology for that purpose has yet to be assessed in detail. To that end, a specific high spatial resolution satellite imagery, QuickBird, was used to map plant communities and monitor invasive plants within the Hudson River NERR (HRNERR). The HRNERR contains four diverse tidal wetlands (Stockport Flats, Tivoli Bays, Iona Island, and Piermont), each with unique water chemistry (i.e., brackish, oligotrophic and fresh) and, consequently, unique assemblages of plant communities, including three invasive plants (Trapa natans, Phragmites australis, and Lythrum salicaria). A maximum-likelihood classification was used to produce 20-class land cover maps for each of the four marshes within the HRNERR. Conventional contingency tables and a fuzzy set analysis served as a basis for an accuracy assessment of these maps. The overall accuracies, as assessed by the contingency tables, were 73.6%, 68.4%, 67.9%, and 64.9% for Tivoli Bays, Stockport Flats, Piermont, and Iona Island, respectively. Fuzzy assessment tables lead to higher estimates of map accuracies of 83%, 75%, 76%, and 76%, respectively. In general, the open water/tidal channel class was the most accurately mapped class and Scirpus sp. was the least accurately mapped. These encouraging accuracies suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery offers significant potential for the mapping of invasive plant species in estuarine environments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Sequencing of a BAC clone encompassing the Glu-B1 locus in Glenlea, revealed a 10.3 Kb segmental duplication including the Bx7 gene and flanking an LTR retroelement. To better understand the evolution of this locus, two collections of wheat were surveyed. The first consisted of 96 diploid and tetraploid species accessions while the second consisted of 316 Triticum aestivum cultivars and landraces from 41 countries. The genotypes were first characterized by SDS-PAGE and a total of 40 of the 316 T. aestivum accessions were found to display the overexpressed Bx7 phenotype (Bx7(OE)). Three lines from the 96 diploid/tetraploid collection also displayed the stronger intensity staining characteristic of the Bx7(OE) subunit. The relative amounts of the Bx7 subunit to total HMW-GS were quantified by RP-HPLC for all Bx7(OE) accessions and a number of checks. The entire collection was assessed for the presence of four DNA markers namely an 18 bp indel of the coding region of Bx7 variant alleles, a 43 bp indel of the 5'-region and the left and right junctions of the LTR retrotransposon borders and the duplicated segment. All 43 accessions found to have the Bx7(OE) subunit by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC produced the four diagnostic PCR amplicons. None of the lines without the Bx7(OE) had the LTR retroelement/duplication genomic structure. However, the 18 and 43 bp indel were found in accessions other than Bx7(OE). These results indicate that the overexpression of the Bx7 HMW-GS is likely the result of a single event, i.e., a gene duplication at the Glu-B1 locus mediated by the insertion of a retroelement. Also, the 18 and 43 bp indels pre-date the duplication event. Allelic variants Bx7*, Bx7 with and without 43 bp insert and Bx7(OE) were found in both tetraploid and hexaploid collections and shared the same genomic organization. Though the possibility of introgression from T. aestivum to T. turgidum cannot be ruled out, the three structural genomic changes of the B-genome taken together support the hypothesis of multiple polyploidization events involving different tetraploid progenitors.

AB Availability of and access to useful energy is a crucial factor for maintaining and improving human well-being. Looming scarcities and increasing awareness of environmental, economic, and social impacts of conventional sources of non-renewable energy have focused attention on renewable energy sources, including biomass.
   The complex interactions of social, economic, and ecological factors among the bioenergy system components of feedstock supply, conversion technology, and energy allocation have been a major obstacle to the broader development of bioenergy systems. For widespread implementation of bioenergy to occur there is a need for an integrated approach to model the social, economic, and ecological interactions associated with bioenergy. Such models can serve as a planning and evaluation tool to help decide when, where, and how bioenergy systems can contribute to development.
   One approach to integrated modeling is by assessing the sustainability of a bioenergy system. The evolving nature of sustainability can be described by an adaptive systems approach using general systems principles. Discussing these principles reveals that participation of stakeholders in all components of a bioenergy system is a crucial factor for sustainability.
   Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is an effective tool to implement this approach. This approach would enable decision-makers to evaluate bioenergy systems for sustainability in a participatory, transparent, timely, and informed manner. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We carried out short-term (2d) experiments in nine unproductive lakes in northern Sweden in order to investigate organic carbon sources supporting lake water respiration. Surface water was incubated in gas-tight bottles in the dark, and the concentration and isotopic composition (delta C-13) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were measured at the start and end of the incubations. Keeling plot analyses revealed that the delta C-13 of the respired carbon was between -28.4 parts per thousand and -30.6 parts per thousand. in the lakes and that the respired carbon was mainly of allochthonous organic carbon (AlloOC) origin. The respiration of AlloOC corresponded well with metabolic imbalances indicated by negative net ecosystem production (NEP) values in the lake waters. Keeling plot analysis of DIC accumulating in the hypolimnion of two lakes during summer stratification showed delta C-13 values of around -26.6 parts per thousand for excess DIC, implying that the accumulation of DIC was mainly derived from respiration of AlloOC. Our data provide direct evidence that net heterotrophy of these lakes is caused by input and respiration of AlloOC. We conclude that the Keeling plot method is a powerful technique that enables characterization and quantification of the organic carbon sources contributing to respiration in aquatic systems.

AB Background. The haplochromine cichlid species assemblages of Lake Malawi and Victoria represent some of the most important study systems in evolutionary biology. Identifying adaptive divergence between closely-related species can provide important insights into the processes that may have contributed to these spectacular radiations. Here, we studied a pair of sympatric Lake Malawi species, Pseudotropheus fainzilberi and P. emmiltos, whose reproductive isolation depends on olfactory communication. We tested the hypothesis that these species have undergone divergent selection at MHC class II genes, which are known to contribute to olfactory-based mate choice in other taxa. Methodology/Principal Findings. Divergent selection on functional alleles was inferred from the higher genetic divergence at putative antigen binding sites (ABS) amino acid sequences than at putatively neutrally evolving sites at intron 1, exon 2 synonymous sequences and exon 2 amino acid residues outside the putative ABS. In addition, sympatric populations of these fish species differed significantly in communities of eukaryotic parasites. Conclusions/Significance. We propose that local host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics may have driven adaptive divergence in MHC alleles, influencing odor-mediated mate choice and leading to reproductive isolation. These results provide the first evidence for a novel mechanism of adaptive speciation and the first evidence of adaptive divergence at the MHC in closely related African cichlid fishes.

AB The translocation of animal species, that is the transfer of individuals from a source population to a release area to restock, is a widespread practice in conservation biology and wildlife management. However, translocation is likely a severe test for the translocated individuals as they are subjected to stressful and inevitable disturbances: physical handling, transport and release into an unknown environment. Moreover, other disturbances may be induced by translocation, for example in case of social disorganization among translocated individuals or of a large difference in habitat quality between origin and release areas. These disturbances induced by the translocation process may have a negative impact upon the translocated individuals, through reduced survival or breeding success, or abnormal behaviour. Consequently, founding a viable population by the mean of a translocation is not easy. Then, it is necessary to determine which factors are involved in the failure or the success of a translocation. Numerous studies carried out in many animal species throw some light on the determinism of translocation success, which nevertheless remains rather complex due to the various factors concurrently involved, and which often differs among species. However, some general principles may stand for the determinism of translocation success. Thus, wildlife managers may promote translocation success by intervening at several levels, in particular by choosing which individuals to release, from which population or environment to remove them and in which release area, or by conducting both adequate habitat management and translocation protocol.

AB The effects of climate changes oil carbon and water fluxes are quantified using a physiologically multi-layer, process-based model containing a carbon allocation model and coupled with a soil model (CASTANEA). The model is first evaluated on four EUROFLUX sites using eddy covariance data, which provide estimates of carbon and water fluxes at the ecosystem scale. It correctly reproduces the diurnal fluxes and the seasonal pattern. Thereafter simulations were conducted on six French forest ecosystems representative of three climatic areas (oceanic. continental and Mediterranean areas) dominated by deciduous species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur), coniferous species (Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris) or sclerophyllous evergreen species (Quercus Hex). The model is driven by the results of a meteorological model (ARPEGE) following the B2 scenario of IPCC. From 1960 to 2100, the average temperature increases by 3.1 degrees C (30%) and the rainfall during summer decreases by 68 mm (-27%). For all the sites, between the two periods, the simulations predict on average a gross primary production (GPP) increase of 513 g(C) m(-2) (+38%). This increase is relatively steep until 2020, followed by a slowing down of the GPP rise due to an increase of the effect of water stress. Contrary to GPP, the ecosystem respiration (R-eco) raises at a constant rate (350 g(C) m(-2) i.e. 31% from 1960 to 2100). The dynamics of the net ecosystem productivity (GPP minus R-eco) is the consequence of the effect on both GPP and R-eco and differs per site. The ecosystems always remain carbon sinks; however the sink strength globally decreases for coniferous (-8%), increases for sclerophyllous evergreen (+34%) and strongly increases for deciduous forest (+67%) that largely benefits by the lengthening of the foliated period. The separately quantified effects of the main variables (temperature, length of foliated season, CO2 fertilization, drought effect), show that the magnitude of these effects depends on the species and the climatic zone.

AB Many domestic dog breeds have originated through fixation of discrete mutations by intense artificial selection. As a result of this process, markers in the proximity of genes influencing breed-defining traits will have reduced variation (a selective sweep) and will show divergence in allele frequency. Consequently, low-resolution genomic scans can potentially be used to identify regions containing genes that have a major influence oil breed-defining traits. We model the process of breed formation and show that the probability of two or three adjacent marker loci showing a spurious signal of selection within at least one breed (i.e., Type I error or false-positive rate) is low if highly variable and moderately spaced markers are utilized. We also use simulations with selection to demonstrate that even a moderately spaced set of highly polymorphic markers (e.g., one every 0.8 cM) has high power to detect regions targeted by strong artificial selection in dogs. Further, we show that a gene responsible for black coat color in the Large Munsterlander has a 40-Mb region surrounding the gene that is very low in heterozygosity foi microsatellite markers. Similarly, we survey 302 microsatellite markers in the Dachshund and find three linked monomorphic microsatellite markers all within a 10-Mb region on chromosome 3. This region contains the FGFR3 gene, which is responsible for achondroplasia in humans, but not in dogs. Consequently, our results Suggest that the causative mutation is a gene or regulatory region closely linked to FURS.

AB 1. Multiple biological invertebrate traits (e.g. body size, body form, dispersal potential) each described through multiple categories (e.g. small, intermediate or large body size) could serve as indicators of particular types of human impacts on large rivers. The trait composition of natural invertebrate communities is scarcely constrained by taxonomic differences among them, i.e. individual trait categories could be used to discriminate various types of human impacts across large geographic areas, which would require the definition of trait patterns for conditions of relatively low human impact.
   2. Using large databases to link 14 biological traits (described through 66 categories) of invertebrate genera to their occurrence in running water reaches with known environmental conditions, we examined the accuracy of various approaches to predict expected trait variation across least impacted river reaches (LIRRs) of Europe in a stepwise analytical procedure. This procedure included Monte Carlo simulations and ultimately the assignment of test-LIRRs (reaches not used in previous analyses) to the previously defined LIRR conditions.
   3. Distance from the source was an integrative variable capturing some (but not all) landscape features (e.g. altitude) or habitat variables (e.g. reach shear stress). Correspondingly, the relative abundance of many trait categories changed along 13 European running waters, although particularly the intensity of these changes differed among these 13 running waters.
   4. 'Downstream models' (using only distance from the source as predictor) provided the least accurate predictions of expected invertebrate trait patterns when compared with 'landscape models' (using distance from the source in combination with altitude and/or latitude) or 'habitat models' (using reach shear stress, mean annual air temperature and/or pH of the water). Landscape models provided more accurate predictions than habitat models, but the improvement of predictions of expected invertebrate traits patterns obtained using landscape models was negligible in comparison with a simpler 'mean-model' approach, suggesting that defining LIRR conditions through simple descriptions of frequency distributions would be sufficient for the future biomonitoring of large European rivers.
   5. To define these LIRR conditions, we used the average of the relative abundance of each trait category from 68 LIRRs (>= 40 m wide) as expected LIRR values, and computed LIRR frequency distributions that described the deviations of the 68 individual LIRRs from these expected values. Computing such deviations from the expected LIRR values for 57 test-LIRRs (also >= 40 m wide), 57 trait categories correctly assigned > 90% of the test-LIRRs to LIRR conditions if the latter were defined through the entire range of the LIRR frequency distributions. To the 90%-range enveloped by the LIRR frequency distributions, 42 trait categories correctly assigned > 80% and 12 categories > 90% of the test-LIRRs.
   6. Using a framework that required no regionalisation of a large geographic area, no modelling of expected values using environmental information and no standardised invertebrate sampling, the performance of our trait approach to assign test-LIRRs to LIRR conditions encourages future assessments of deviations from these defined LIRR conditions in large European river reaches with different types of human impacts.

AB If biospheric sinks, such as soil organic carbon, are to be used to meet obligations for greenhouse gas emission reduction under the Kyoto Protocol, the permanence of these sinks needs to be considered. Further, since only direct human-induced carbon sinks can be included, and sinks resulting from indirect and natural effects cannot be used, there is a pressing need to separate direct human-induced effects from indirect and natural effects. Since these effects also influence the permanence of soil organic stocks, this paper attempts to synthesize existing knowledge in soil science, and use models to examine the likely influence of direct, indirect and natural effects on the permanence of soil organic carbon stocks.

AB Long-distance colonization and rapid range expansion associated with biological invasion may have major evolutionary consequences via both stochastic processes and selection. Using large-scale population genetic surveys, we demonstrate a major shift in the relative frequency of sexually fertile diploid versus sexually sterile triploid populations associated with the invasion of North America by a clonal aquatic plant, Butontus umbellatus. Most populations across the native European range were triploid (84% of 108), whereas most introduced populations were diploid (71% of 136). We evaluated the roles of stochastic processes versus natural selection in causing this shift by surveying predominantly neutral genetic variation at 28 RAPD loci. In Europe (EU) we detected 47 distinct genotypes among 142 plants sampled from 71 populations, whereas in North America INA) we detected only six genotypes among 138 plants from 69 populations. Of the six NA genotypes, a set of four closely related genotypes were found only in triploid populations and a pair of closely related genotypes were found only in diploid populations, and these were genetically divergent from the triploid genotypes. This result is consistent with severe founder effect. Because sex creates genotypic variation and produces offspring with greater dispersal potential than those produced clonally, we tested the hypothesis that sexual reproduction characteristic of diploids has given them a colonization advantage that accounts for their high frequency in NA. However, we found little or no evidence of sexual recruitment in introduced diploids. One very widespread heterozygous genotype occurred in 95% of 38 introduced diploid populations (i.e., 72 of 76 plants surveyed) suggesting predominant clonal reproduction. Moreover genotypic diversity was not higher within or among diploid than triploid populations in either the native or introduced range. Low genetic diversity in diploid populations was also supported by a comparison of within-population quantitative variation for plant size under a common greenhouse environment. Thus, diploids have not been favored during colonization owing to their sexual fertility. However, concurrent studies have shown that NA diploids exhibit a much higher capacity for clonal reproduction, via small vegetative bulbils, than NA triploids, which almost never produce bulbils. The same difference in clonal capacity is not a consistent feature of the native EU populations. Taken together, these results suggest that strong founder effect has set the stage for a major increase in diploid frequency due to the particular, and possibly idiosyncratic, features of the diploid and triploid lineages introduced to North America.

AB The increasing popularity of stable isotope analysis (SIA) as an ecological research tool and the ease of automated analysis have created a knowledge gap between ecologists using SIA and the operators of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) equipment. This has led to deterioration in the understanding of IRMS methodology and its proper dissemination in the ecological literature. Of 330 ecological research papers surveyed, 63 (19%) failed to report any form of analytical error associated with IRMS. Of the 267 papers that reported analytical error, there was considerable variation both in the terminology and approach used to quantify and describe error. Internal laboratory standards were often used to determine the analytical error associated with IRMS, so chosen because they are homogenous and have isotopic signatures that do not vary over time. We argue that true ecological samples collected in the field are complex bulk mixtures and often fail to adhere to these two criteria. Hence the analytical error associated with samples is potentially greater than that of standards. A set of standard data run over time with a precision typically reported in the ecological literature (I standard deviation: 1SD = 0.26 parts per thousand) was simulated to determine the likelihood of spurious treatment effects depending on timing of analysis. There was a 90% likelihood of detecting a significant difference in the stable nitrogen ratio of a single sample (homogenized bovine liver) run in two time periods when n > 30. Minor protocol adjustments, including the submission of blind replicates by researchers, random assignment of sample repeats within a run by analytical labs, and reporting 1SD of a single sample analyzed both within and between runs, will only serve to strengthen the interpretation of true ecological processes by both researchers and reviewers.

AB Shade tolerance, plastic phenotypic response to light and sensitivity to photoinhibition were studied in holly (Ilex aquifolium L.) seedlings transported from the field to a greenhouse and in adult trees in the field. All plants were growing in, or originated from, continental Mediterranean sites in central Spain. Seedlings tolerated moderate but not deep shade. Mortality was high and growth reduced in 1% sunlight. Survival was maximal in 12% sunlight and minimal in full sunlight, although the relative growth rate of the seedlings surviving in high light was similar to that of plants in moderate shade. Maximum photochemical efficiency at predawn was significantly lower in sun plants than in shade plants in the field, revealing chronic photoinhibition that was most pronounced in winter. Plasticity in response to available light varied according to the variable studied, being low for photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance, and high for specific leaf area root:shoot ratio and leaf area ratio, particularly in seedlings. Differences in water relations and hydraulic features between sun and shade plants in the field were marginal. High water potential at the turgor loss point of field-grown plants suggested that holly is sensitive to drought during both the seedling and the adult stage. Low relative growth rates in both high and low light with low physiological plasticity in response to light indicate the existence of a stress-tolerance mechanism. We conclude that holly is a facultative understory plant in areas of oceanic and relatively mild climate, but an obligate understory plant in dry continental areas such as the study site. The impact of abandonment of traditional management practices and climate change on these Mediterranean populations is discussed.

Although corridors are a widely accepted approach to connecting populations, their merits are still debated, and they may be impractical in many situations. A focus on management of the vegetation matrix between populations has been advocated as an alternative way to deal with habitat fragmentation and has theoretical support. We combined microsatellite DNA and demographic data to provide an empirical account of how two forms of agricultural land use affect the connectivity of insular populations of an endangered skink in southern New Zealand. The grand skink (Oligosoma grande) lives in small populations (approximately 20 individuals) on rock outcrops separated from one another by 50-150 m of inhospitable matrix vegetation (either native tussock grassland or exotic pasture). Skinks typically dispersed short distances, and the nature of the matrix both quantitatively and qualitatively affected dispersal dynamics. Skink populations in pasture were significantly more genetically structured and had less genetic variation than similar populations in tussock, implying less dispersal between populations in pasture than tussock. Furthermore, although female-biased dispersal was a feature of populations in tussock, no sex bias was evident in pasture. In addition, Bayesian individual-based genetic assignment tests that incorporated prior mark-recapture information revealed that some populations produced many emigrants but received few immigrants, whereas other populations were relatively insular Patterns of dispersal and response to matrix vegetation were complex, and the causes of these patterns deserve attention in future studies of habitat fragmentation. Managing the vegetation matrix may be a practical way to connect animal populations in some situations.

AB Biomass increment, biomass allocation and fine-root morphology were compared on four-year old Fagus sylvatica seedlings growing under low ( 11% relative irradiance), medium ( 14 - 19%) or high (46%) irradiance under natural Pinus sylvestris canopies, and under full light in a weeded meadow in the French Massif Central. Significant differences in biomass increment were found among plots in relation to light regime and interspecific competition. Light regime had little effect on shoot-to-root ratio and biomass allocation, but had a clear impact on above- and belowground morphological variables. Beech seedlings displayed a lower specific root length (SRL) and a higher specific leaf area (SLA) under shade, thus indicating morphological adjustment to shade. Similarly, competition from herbaceous vegetation had a negligible effect on seedling growth and biomass allocation, but significant impact on fine-root morphology. Low SLA and high SRL values at high irradiance coincided with high growth increments.

AB [ 1] Coastal wetlands are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, the dynamics of carbon ( C) cycling in coastal wetlands and its response to sea level change associated with global warming is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the long-term and short-term rates of C accumulation, using C and C isotopic measurements of peat cores collected along a soil chronosequence, in a coastal wetland in north Florida. The long-term C accumulation rates determined by examining the C inventory and the radioactive decay of radiocarbon as a function of depth in the peat cores decrease with time from -130 +/- 9 g C/m(2)/yr over the last century to -13 +/- 2 g C/m(2)/yr over the millennium timescale. The short-term C accumulation rates estimated by examining the differences in the radiocarbon and C contents of the surfacial peat between archived ( 1985, 1988) and present ( 1996 and 1997) samples range from 42 to 193 g C/m(2)/yr in low marsh, from 18 to 184 g C/m(2)/yr in middle marsh, and from -50 to 181 g C/m(2)/yr in high marsh. The high end-values of our estimated short-term C accumulation rates are comparable to the estimated rates of C sequestration in coastal wetlands reported by Chmura et al. [ 2003], but are significantly higher than our estimated long-term rates in the marshes and are also much higher than the published rates of C sequestration in northern peatlands. The higher recent rates of C accumulation in coastal marshes, in comparison with the longer-term rates, are due to slow but continuous decomposition of organic matter in the peat over time. However, other factors such as increased primary production in the coastal wetland over the last decades or century, due to a rise in mean sea level and/or CO2 and nitrogen fertilization effect, could also have contributed to the large difference between the recent and longer-term rates. Our data indicate that salt marshes in this area have been and continue to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of higher rates of C sequestration and lower CH4 emissions, coastal wetlands could be more valuable C sinks per unit area than other ecosystems in a warmer world.

AB 1. Spatial patterns in channel morphology and substratum composition at small (1-10 metres) and large scales (1-10 kilometres) were analysed to determine the influence of habitat heterogeneity on the distribution and abundance of larval lamprey.
   2. We used a nested sampling design and multiple logistic regression to evaluate spatial heterogeneity in the abundance of larval Pacific lamprey, Lampetra tridentata, and habitat in 30 sites (each composed of twelve 1-m(2) quadrat samples) distributed throughout a 55-km section of the Middle Fork John Day River, OR, U.SA. Statistical models predicting the relative abundance of larvae both among sites (large scale) and among samples (small scale) were ranked using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to identify the 'best approximating' models from a set of a priori candidate models determined from the literature on larval lamprey habitat associations.
   3. Stream habitat variables predicted patterns in larval abundance but played different roles at different spatial scales. The abundance of larvae at large scales was positively associated with water depth and open riparian canopy, whereas patchiness in larval occurrence at small scales was associated with low water velocity, channel-unit morphology (pool habitats), and the availability of habitat suitable for burrowing.
   4. Habitat variables explained variation in larval abundance at large and small scales, but locational factors, such as longitudinal position (river km) and sample location within the channel unit, explained additional variation in the logistic regression model. The results emphasise the need for spatially explicit analysis, both in examining fish habitat relationships and in developing conservation plans for declining fish populations.

AB Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is an important virulence factor encoded by a family of roughly 60 var genes and is used by the parasite to interact with the human host. The parasite regularly exchanges the expressed var gene generating antigenic variation of the infected RBCs (pRBC) surface which is crucial for successful proliferation and transmission. PfEMP1 is also an adhesive molecule that binds to an array of human receptors. By sequestration in the post-capillary venules, pRBCs are able to escape the spleen-mediated clearance but severe malaria may develop if the local binding is extensive. Anti-PfEMP1 immunity is important for preventing the development of both cerebral malaria and placental malaria, but more immunological studies on PfEMP1 antigens and their interaction with the human host are needed. Over the last few years our knowledge about var genes and PfEMP1s has increased dramatically through genetic, biochemical, immunological and epidemiological studies. In addition, the genome sequence has also provided us with a new platform for further dissecting its biological functions. This review highlights the recent analyses of var genes in the P. falciparum genome and postulates significance of genome recombination to the diversity of parasite virulence. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB Resource management strategies have begun to adopt natural landscape disturbance emulation as a means of minimizing risk to ecosystem integrity. Detailed understanding of the disturbance regime and the associated spatial landscape patterns are required to provide a "natural" baseline for comparison with the results of emulation strategies. Landscape pattern indices provide a useful tool to quantify spatial pattern for developing these strategies and evaluating their success. Despite an abundance of indices and tools to calculate these, practical knowledge of interpretation is rare. Quantifying changes in landscape pattern indices and the meaning of these changes is confounded by index sensitivity to input data characteristics such as spatial extent, spatial resolution, and thematic resolution. Sensitivity has been examined for simulated landscapes but rarely using real data for large areas as real landscapes are more difficult to manipulate systematically than simulated data. While simulated data offer a control, they do not provide an accurate portrayal of reality for practical applications. Our goal was to test the sensitivity of a suite of landscape pattern indices useful for disturbance emulation strategy development and evaluation to spatial extent, spatial resolution, and thematic resolution using current land cover data for a case study of the managed forest of Ontario, Canada. We also examined how sensitivity varies spatially across the study area. We used Landsat TM-based land cover data (> 45.5 million ha), controlling spatial extent (2,500 to 2,560,000 ha), spatial resolution (1 to 16 ha), and thematic resolution (2 to 26 classes). For each index we tested a hypothesis of insensitivity to changes in each input data characteristic using a combination of ANOVA and regression and compared our results with previous studies. Of the 18 indices studied, significant (p < 0.01) effects were found for 17 indices with changes in spatial extent, 13 indices with changes in spatial resolution and 18 indices with changes in thematic resolution. A significant (p < 0.01) linear trend accounted for the majority of the variance for all of the significant relationships identified. Most of the mean index responses were consistent with those interpreted from previous studies of simulated and real landscapes; however, sensitivity varied greatly among indices and over space. We suggest that variation in sensitivity to input data characteristics among indices and over space must be explicitly incorporated in the design of future natural disturbance emulation efforts.

AB Plant cover was visually estimated by five observers, independent of each other, in a species-rich grassland in the Bile Karpaty Mts., southeastern Czech Republic, in seven plots ranging from 0.001 to 4 m(2). Variation of total plant cover among the observers was high at small scales: 0.001 - 0.016 m(2); coefficient of variation, CV = 35 to 45%, but much lower at larger scales: 0.06 - 4 1112 CV = 7 to 15%. Differences between visual estimates of plant cover of individual species made by different observers were affected by plot size, total cover and morphology of particular plants. CV of the cover of individual species ranged front 0 to 225% and decreased with increasing plot size. For abundant plants the CV attained ca. 50%, independent of plot size. In spite of a very high number of sterile plants with similar leaf morphology and colour, the observed variation in cover estimates in the studied grassland was comparable with results reported front other vegetation types. Differences between estimates by individual observers were often larger than Usual year to year changes in undisturbed grasslands. Therefore, I Suggest that to avoid difficulties in the interpretation of results based on plant cover data obtained front visual estimates, several observers should always work together, adjusting their extreme estimates.

AB Riparian areas in western North America have been characterized as centers of avian diversity, yet little is known about the ways that native species in streamside habitats are affected by development nearby. To address this issue, we examined patterns of habitat use by birds during the 1995-1997 breeding seasons at 16 lowland riparian sites representing an urban-to-rural gradient. As development increased, riparian woodlands tended to have fewer native. trees and shrubs, less ground and shrub. cover, higher tree densities, and greater canopy closure. Bird species richness also declined as urbanization increased in the surrounding landscape. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that measures of settlement intensity best explained variation in habitat use by riparian birds, although some residual variation was accounted for by differences in woodland understory features. Migrant and low-nesting species were associated with lower-than-average levels of development, whereas resident and cavity-nesting species tended to increase with urbanization. In partial CCA analyses, however, local habitat variables explained twice the variation that measures of settlement did; nearly half of all explained variation could be attributed to local and landscape variables simultaneously. For avian guilds based on migratory; nesting, and foraging behavior, regression analyses showed that the best variables for explaining patterns of habitat use were usually those that reflected levels of urbanization, particularly at broad scales. When the effects of local habitat variation were removed, however, the best variables for explaining residual variation in habitat use tended to describe development at relatively fine scales, especially for species that nested or foraged low for insects or seeds. These species were also the most sensitive to human trail use. Our analyses indicated that bird communities and local habitat conditions in riparian areas were both affected by development in the surrounding landscape. It may be possible to mitigate the negative impacts of human settlement on native birds in streamside woodlands by maintaining or restoring vegetation structure and composition, and by imposing limits on human recreational activity in these habitats.

AB Fire is a key ecological process in several biomes worldwide. Although many conservation agencies have the protection of biodiversity as at least one of their major goals, information on the effects of fire on fauna in these biomes is fragmentary. Here we provide an overview of the published research undertaken to date on the effects of fire on fauna using examples from Southern Africa. We found that few studies have examined the effects of fire on amphibians or reptiles, and work on invertebrates is likewise sparse. The majority of studies that have been published are observational reports, and few experimental studies have been undertaken using an experimental fire regime, or over appropriately long time intervals. Replication was often not reported and where this was done, it was generally inadequate. The majority of the studies failed to report the area over which the studies were undertaken and sampling unit size was often not reported. Despite the importance of fire duration, ignition method, season and time of day of fire, few studies investigated these variables. We conclude that at present the information on the effects of fire on fauna in Southern Africa is fragmentary and, consequently, informed management decisions regarding the consequences of burning policies on the conservation of biodiversity both within and outside protected areas are problematic. We recommend that future studies, both in Southern Africa and elsewhere, be based on a suite of large-scale and experimental approaches (the latter firmly grounded in the principles of sound experimental design), use non-classical statistics to explore the effects of large-scale or unreplicated fires, and where possible include baseline information such as that gathered in fragmentation experiments.

AB Maximum food-chain length has been correlated with resource availability, ecosystem size, environmental stability and colonization history. Some of these correlations may result from environmental effects on predator-prey body size ratios. We investigate relationships between maximum food-chain length, predator-prey mass ratios, primary production and environmental stability in marine food webs with a natural history of community assembly. Our analyses provide empirical evidence that smaller mean predator-prey body size ratios are characteristic of more stable environments and that food chains are longer when mean predator-prey body size ratios are small. We conclude that environmental effects on predator-prey body size ratios contribute to observed differences in maximum food-chain length.

AB [1] The micrometeorological technique of eddy covariance is a powerful tool for characterizing the carbon (C) budget of terrestrial ecosystems. However, few attempts have been made to link canopy-scale eddy exchange to soil C processes. Here we develop a simple means of using calculations derived from a global database of eddy flux measurements to examine the role of climate on soil C decomposition rates. We then compare the results of the eddy covariance calculations to the temperature dependence of soil C residence times determined by four common methods: laboratory incubations, direct soil respiration measurements, radiocarbon uptake, and stable C isotope change following land conversion. In all five methods, the soil organic C turnover time decreases exponentially with increasing mean annual temperature. The similar slopes and intercepts of the eddy flux and chamber measurements lend support for the robustness of micrometeorological techniques in measuring respiration. The similarities in the response of soil C turnover to temperature for the eddy flux and C-14-derived turnover times is especially encouraging in that bomb-C-14 measurements do not rely on any of the assumptions that were used to calculate soil C turnover from eddy flux data. However, the 13 C isotope method yields a significantly different slope and intercept than the other three techniques. The results of this work reinforce the recognized temperature dependence of soil C turnover and suggest that eddy flux experiments are a useful and additional approach for studying the soil C budget.

AB The diverse fauna and flora of rocky intertidal ecosystems are being impacted by the activities of rapidly increasing coastal populations in many regions of the world. Human harvesting of intertidal species can lead to significant changes in body sizes of these taxa. However, little is known about the temporal trajectories of such size declines and more importantly, the long-term effects of chronic human impacts. Furthermore, it is unclear whether sizes of species not directly targeted for harvesting are also declining through indirect effects. Here we use historical (extending back to 1869) and field survey data covering 200 km of mainland southern California coast to show that human activities have led to significant and widespread declines in body sizes of rocky intertidal gastropod species over the last century. These declines, initiated several decades ago, are continuing and contrary to expectation, they are not restricted to species harvested for human consumption. Data from the only national park in this area, where conservation laws are strictly imposed, demonstrate that negative ecological impacts can be ameliorated if existing laws are enforced.

AB The amphibian decline problem is complex, and there is no easy solution. I highlight four major areas of future research that should increase our ability to detect declines, elucidate their underlying mechanisms, and advance our capacity to manage and conserve amphibian populations. First, a statistically sensitive monitoring approach is necessary to determine the distribution and abundance of amphibian populations, to assess whether they are declining, and to quantify the extent of declines. Most amphibian populations characteristically fluctuate, detection probabilities may be low for many species and populations tend to decline in numbers between years more often than they increase. These traits make establishing monitoring programmes difficult and distinguishing declines from natural fluctuations challenging. It is thus necessary to determine the best monitoring techniques based on their statistical power and to use appropriate statistical methods for detecting population trends. Secondly, although amphibian population studies occur most commonly at single or few breeding sites, research should occur often at the landscape level, and conservation efforts should focus on suitable habitat (whether or not it is occupied) and dispersal capabilities of species. Metapopulation dynamics are probably important for many species, but we must be cautious how we define metapopulations. That is, the term 'metapopulation' is currently used to define a wide range of demographic situations in amphibian populations, each with different management implications. Thirdly, recent advances in molecular genetic techniques make it possible to infer demographic events such as effects of recent fragmentation, bottlenecks or hybridization. Molecular techniques can be used in conjunction with census surveys to bolster knowledge about demographic processes such as declines. Alternatively, in the absence of long-term census data, molecular data can be used to infer population trends. New genomic approaches may make estimating adaptive genetic variation more feasible. Fourthly, multi-factorial studies are needed to disentangle the complexity of the several putative causes that probably interact to cause amphibian declines. Recent studies demonstrate the value of a multi-factorial approach, and more work is needed to elucidate the synergistic effects of multiple environmental factors affecting amphibian populations simultaneously worldwide.

AB Large seeds have been hypothesized to confer survival advantages in the shaded forest, and small seeds to confer growth advantages in open habitats. We explored these hypotheses using experimental studies in both field and controlled conditions. Our experiments examined intraspecific effects of seed mass on seedling demography in eight sympatric woody species of Psychotria. We compared the effects of seed mass on seedling size (biomass), maximum relative growth rate (RGR), the proportion of emerged seedlings that survived until one year of age, and the proportion of Sown seeds reaching the stage of one-year-old seedlings in gaps compared with shaded rain forest habitats, as well as in contrasting greenhouse, light conditions. For each species, seeds were classified into four seed mass categories and introduced to three pairs of shaded forest gap sites. In the greenhouse, emerged seedlings from different seed mass categories were grown in contrasting light environments. A positive effect of seed mass on seedling survival was observed in six of seven species in the shaded forest but only in two species in gaps. Final seedling biomass was positively related to seed mass in five species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. In some species,RGR decreased with seed mass. Consequently, the biomass achieved by small-seeded seedlings with relatively fast growth rates was similar to that of seedlings derived from large seeds. The probability of recruitment increased with seed mass in four of seven species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. Negative effects of seed mass on recruitment occurred only in one species, and only in gaps. The positive effects of seed mass on seedling biomass and survival observed under shaded greenhouse conditions were weaker than those observed in the shaded forest. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) seed mass influences recruitment in natural forest habitats, (2) larger seeds confer higher probability of recruitment in the shaded forest by producing seedlings with larger size and higher probability of survival, and (3) in natural habitats ecological factors in addition to light (e.g., seed predators) operated selectively on seedlings emerging from seeds differing in mass.

AB We examined spatial and temporal variability of understory herbaceous vegetation on opposing north- and south-facing slopes in an eastern deciduous old-growth forest in southeastern Ohio, USA. Secondly, we explored the influence of sampling scale and analytical technique on our assessment of diversity patterns. The influence of aspect and seasonality were examined at varying sampling scales using observed richness, evenness, and H' diversity measures, non-parametric richness estimators, species-area curves, and SHE analysis. Herb layer composition, abundance, and diversity were strongly influenced by location (north slope vs. south slope), seasonal sampling period (April, June, August), and plot size (micro (2 m(2))- vs. meso (70 m(2))-scale samples). Although north and south plots were compositionally distinct, they followed similar courses of change through the growing season. Richness, evenness, and H' diversity were generally greater on the south plot whereas herbaceous abundance was greater on the north plot. Species composition and diversity showed marked phenological (temporal) changes, and comparison of diversity measures at micro- and meso-scales produced markedly different results. Minimum sample areas of 150-200 m(2) were needed to evaluate micro- scale richness in these species rich communities, suggesting that forest understories may be frequently undersampled in ecological studies. Comparison of observed and estimated meso-scale richness also suggested underestimation of richness in the north plot, particularly earlier in the growing season. Thus, sample size, area, and time of sampling appear critical to assessment of diversity in spatially and temporally variable communities such as herbaceous forest understories.

AB Tropical land-use changes can have profound influence on earthworms that play important roles in regulating soil processes. Converting tropical forests to pastures often drastically increases the abundance of exotic earthworm populations such as Pontoscolex corethrurus. We initiated this study to examine the influence of exotic earthworms on the decomposition of plant leaves and roots in a tropical pasture and a wet forest of Puerto Rico. We employed two treatments: control with natural earthworm population, and earthworm reduction using an electroshocking technique. Decomposition rates of plant leaves on the ground surface and root materials within the surface mineral soil were estimated using a litterbag technique. To understand the role that exotic earthworms play in altering plant litter decomposition, we also compared soil CO2 evolution rates, soil microbial biomass, and physical and chemical soil properties between the controls and earthworm-reduced plots during a one-year period. Earthworm populations in the electroshocked enclosures were reduced by 85% and 87% as compared with pasture and forest controls by the end of the experiment. Earthworm reduction significantly decreased the annual decay rates of plant leaves but had no effects on those of plant roots in both pasture and forest sites. Although the control plots had less mass remaining on every litterbag collecting date, significant treatment effects on leaf decomposition occurred only after 240 d in both sites. The decay rates were greater when organic materials had low carbon to nitrogen or phosphorus ratios. Soil respiration was also decreased in the earthworm-reduced plots. In contrast, soil microbial biomass C was not affected by earthworm reduction. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two treatments in soil bulk density, moisture content, pH, or temperature at either site. Our results suggest that exotic earthworms may accelerate leaf litter decomposition by elevating rates of litter consumption/digestion or microbial activity, rather than by improving soil physical/chemical conditions or altering microbial biomass.

AB 1. The creation and maintenance of spatial and temporal heterogeneity by rivers flowing through floodplain landscapes has been disrupted worldwide by dams and water diversions. Large reservoirs (novel ecosystems) now separate and isolate remnant floodplains (relict ecosystems). From above, these appear as a string of beads, with beads of different sizes and string connections of varying lengths.
   2. Numerous studies have documented or forecast sharp declines in riparian biodiversity in relict ecosystems downstream from dams. Concurrently, novel ecosystems containing species and communities of the former predam ecosystems have arisen along all regulated rivers. These result from the creation of new environments caused by upper reservoir sedimentation, tributary sedimentation and the formation of reservoir shorelines.
   3. The contribution of novel habitats to the overall biodiversity of regulated rivers has been poorly studied. Novel ecosystems may become relatively more important in supporting riverine biodiversity if relict ecosystems are not restored to predam levels. The Missouri River of the north-central U.S.A. is used to illustrate existing conditions on a large, regulated river system with a mixture of relict and novel ecosystems.

AB To gain insight into suborganismal mechanisms underlying responses of predators to environmental stress, we examined the effects of temperature and food availability on the physiology and feeding activity of the predatory whelk Nucella ostrina (formerly N. emarginata). Studies were conducted in the mid-low transition zone on rocky reefs at two sites on the Oregon coast: Strawberry Hill (SH) and Boiler Bay (BB). SH is dominated by suspension-feeding invertebrates and their predators, while BB is dominated by macrophytes. In wave-exposed (EX) and wave-protected (PR) habitat,, at each site, we measured air and water temperatures, whelk body temperatures, and indices of physiological condition (malate dehydrogenase [MDH] activities and RNA: DNA ratios) for wild-caught whelks. The influence of food (+/- prey) and thermal conditions (+/- shelter) on prey consumption, physiological performance (oxygen consumption rate), and response to thermal stress (induction of Hsp70-class stress proteins) of whelks was determined in field experiments. Low-tide air temperatures, whelk body temperatures, and biochemical indices of whelk field condition were consistently different between sites (SH > BB) and wave exposures (temperatures: PR > EX, condition: PR < EX). Foraging activity, metabolic rates, and stress protein (Hsp) expression were consistently higher at SH than BB. Respiration rates were lower for all -prey treatments than for +prey treatments however, whelks in -prey +shade treatments had lower Hsp expression and higher respiration rates (an indication of better physiological condition) than whelks in -prey -shade treatments. Most measures of performance suggested that wave-exposed individuals were more physiologically robust than wave-protected individuals. Temporal physiological responses to stress suggested that high levels of heat stress compromise whelk performance later in the summer. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that physiological stress interacts with prey abundance to modify activity of whelks. Detailed studies of the effects of environmental stress on predator-prey interactions are needed to elucidate the relationship between physiological stress and predator-prey interactions. However, present evidence suggests that whelks alter activity (behavioral modification) and physiology (biochemical modification) in ways that lead to differential impacts by these predators on prey populations at different sites.

AB 1. Process-based models, and spatially explicit models in particular, will play an important role in predicting the impacts of future environmental change. Enthusiasm for the rich potential of these models, however, is tempered by the realization that their parameterization is often challenging and time consuming. Moreover, these models are seldom validated; this makes their predictive value in applied contexts uncertain.
   2. In this paper we describe the process of parameterizing and validating a spatial demographic model of a spreading alien plant population. The model, a spatially explicit individual-based simulation, has modest data requirements (for a spatial simulation model) in that it concentrates on simulating recruitment, dispersal, mortality and disturbance and ignores the environmental and biotic heterogeneity of the receiving environment.
   3. We tested the model using the invasion of Acacia cyclops and Pinus pinaster into fynbos, the mediterranean shrublands of South Africa, as a case study. Dispersal, recruitment and mortality data were collected for each species at six different sites. Aerial photographs from six independent sites (two sites for A. cyclops and four sites for P. pinaster) were used to reconstruct the invasion histories of the two species between 1938 and 1989. Demographic data were used to parameterize the model, and the 1938 distribution of alien plants, derived from aerial photography, was used to initialize the model.
   4. The empirically estimated indices of rate and pattern of invasion fell within the range of model predictions made at all six sites studied. The indices of rate and pattern of invasion predicted by the model did not differ significantly from the empirically estimated indices for 76% of the model data comparisons made. These analyses suggested that the model predictions are good, given the variance in parameter estimates.
   5. The proportion of grid locations where the model correctly predicted alien plant distribution was typically above 0.75 and always above 0.5 for both species. A permutation test showed that locations of invasive plants predicted by the model were significantly better than random for P. pinaster, but not always for A. cyclops; this may be because A. cyclops is bird dispersed, and its dispersal may be biased towards perch sites, whereas P. pinaster is wind dispersed.
   6. We conclude that, although spatial simulation models are often more difficult to parameterize and validate than statistical or analytical models, there are situations where such effort is warranted. In this case the validation process provides confidence to use the model as a tool for planning the control of invasive plants. In a more general sense we believe that the approach outlined here could be used for model parameterization and validation in situations where spatial simulation models seem appropriate.

AB 1 Alliaria petiolata, a European biennial herb, is an important pest in temperate North American deciduous forests. Habitat resource structure has probably been important for invasion and proliferation of this species.
   2 Alliaria was grown in an experimental garden at two densities (equivalent to 17 and 170 plants m(-2)), three nutrient levels (no, low, or high nutrient addition) and three light levels (ambient sunlight and two shading treatments) to determine the effects of environmental heterogeneity on growth, reproduction and resource allocation in both mature and rosette plants.
   3 Overall, rosette growth and allocation patterns were significantly affected by all three variables tested. Low plant density, nutrient addition and high light availability resulted in plants with more leaves and greater dry weight biomass. Biomass allocation to shoots was greatest for plants in high-density and low-light treatments. Leaf chlorophyll content was significantly greater for plants in the two shaded treatments.
   4 Mature plants also responded to environmental manipulation with significantly greater total dry weight biomass at low plant density, high light availability and with nutrient addition. Low density and high light availability resulted in significantly higher seed production. Plants in the lowest light treatment allocated significantly more biomass to shoot production and less to root production. Leaf chlorophyll content was lowest for plants in the highest light treatment and increased with nutrient addition at the two highest light treatments.
   5 Plants growing at high density responded to nutrient addition and light attenuation in the same direction but with greatly reduced magnitude compared with plants growing at low density. The effect of irradiance was the most important determinant of all facets of growth and allocation patterns in both rosettes and mature plants.
   6 Our results indicate that although density and site fertility may play important roles in Alliaria invasion and establishment, light availability may be the most important factor affecting subsequent growth and proliferation.

AB The regeneration (regrowth into viable plants or production of propagules, such as turions or buds) and colonization (development of roots and establishment in the sediment) of fragments of six aquatic plant species (Elodea canadensis Michaux, Hippuris vulgaris L., Luronium natans (L.) Rafin., Potamogeton pusillus L., Ranunculus trichophyllus Chaix, Sparganium emersum Rehmann) occurring in habitats frequently disturbed by floods, were investigated through laboratory experiments conducted in two seasons, and compared to the recolonization patterns depicted after field experiments. Hypothesis was that differences observed between recolonization patterns after spring and autumn flood disturbances should be related to differences in recolonization (via rooting) and regeneration (via propagules) abilities of species fragments. In May and in August, five types of fragments were collected from the plants. Their development and/or rooting abilities were recorded over 10 weeks in the greenhouse. Fragments from E. canadensis and H. vulgaris had higher regeneration and lower colonization abilities in spring and conversely in autumn. Fragments from R. trichophyllus and S. emersum had high colonization and low regeneration abilities during both seasons. Fragments from L. natans developed new buds in spring, whereas root development occurred only in autumn. Fragments from P. pusillus never rooted into the sediment, but developed turions in autumn. Differences between recolonization patterns observed in the field at the two seasons can most often be related to differences in regeneration and colonization abilities of species fragments. Species that colonize disturbed areas rapidly whenever the disturbance by flooding occurs have at least one type of vegetative fragment with a high colonization potential; this is called the 'always-ready strategy' which appears to be an adaptation of aquatic plants to the unpredictability of flood disturbances.

AB Evolutionary biologists, ecologists and experimental gerontologists have increasingly used estimates of age-specific mortality as a critical component in studies of a range of important biological processes. However, the analysis of age-specific mortality rates is plagued by specific statistical challenges caused by sampling error. Here we discuss the nature of this 'demographic sampling error', and the way in which it can bias our estimates of (1) rates of ageing, (2) age at onset of senescence, (3) costs of reproduction and (4) demographic tests of evolutionary models of ageing. We conducted simulations which suggest that using standard statistical techniques, we would need sample sizes on the order of tens of thousands in most experiments to effectively remove any bias due to sampling error. We argue that biologists should use much larger sample sizes than have previously been used. However, we also present simple maximum likelihood models that effectively remove biases due to demographic sampling error even at relatively small sample sizes.

AB Differences in arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization, mycotrophic growth and response to superphosphate were studied in seedlings of 28 native woody species belonging to different successional groups in woodland fragments in the state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. The experiment was carried out in a glasshouse in plastic bags filled with a soil-mix composed of soil + burnt rice shell (6:1 v/v) amended or not with superphosphate (Control, P) and infested or not with a mixture of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi Glomus etunicatum Becker and Gerdermann and Gigaspora margarita Becker and Hall (M) and co-application of P and M (MP), with 10 replications per species. Successional groups were represented by 8, 5, 4 and 11 species of pioneers, early secondary, late secondary and climax species, respectively. It was found that dry matter yield of climax species was 6.8-fold higher than the pioneer ones in control treatments. However, pioneers were markedly more responsive to soil-mix treatments than climax ones. Based upon shoot dry matter, overall response for M, P and MP overcontrols was 813, 575 and 1688% for pioneers and 0, 48 and 106% for climax ones. Mycorrhizal effects were much greater in soil-mix with no added P than when superphosphate was added. They were maximum and consistent among pioneers and markedly diminished in climax species in which positive response to M was found in only 27% of the species of this group. AM colonization ranged from 0 to 81% of the root length colonized and it was inversely related to succession and directly related to mycorrhizal response. Growth responses to soil-mix treatments were inversely related to seed weight and to succession. Pioneer species have light seeds, high susceptibility to infection and colonization rate and are responsive to both mycorrhiza and superphosphate, whereas, late successional species are more dependent upon their seed reserves than upon AM and superphosphate for initial growth. However, late successional species may become myconhiza-dependent in later growth stages. The Glomalean fungi and soil phosphorus are important factors in light of the forest ecology and reforestation technology in low-fertility soils in the tropics. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The standing crop of seagrass is highly sensitive to environmental disturbance. We evaluate 3 optical remote sensing methods for measuring standing crop in the tropical Western Atlantic. Extensive field measurements of standing crop were used to define empirical relationships with imagery from satellite sensors [Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT (Systeme Probatoire de l'Observation de la Terre) XS (multispectral)], and the digital airborne imager CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager). Predictions of standing crop from processed imagery had high coefficients of determination: 0.74, 0.79 and 0.81 respectively. Using a bootstrap method to measure standard error, the 95% confidence interval of predictions was found to have a similar order of magnitude to quadrat sampling in situ at a precision (standard error/mean) of 10%. Explicit cost-benefit and monitoring considerations are discussed.

AB 1. The hypothesis that European Starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, regulate their body mass in response to availability of food was tested in two experiments. The first experiment investigated the response to periodic food deprivations of 6 h, beginning at a random time in the day. The second experiment examined the response to fixed and variable food deprivations, and whether this response differed according to 'season', which was manipulated photoperiodically.
   2. In the first experiment, the food deprived birds responded by increasing body mass, in accordance with the adaptive regulation hypothesis.
   3. The second experiment demonstrated that the response to food availability differed according to photoperiodic history; birds that were photosensitive responded to a decrease in time available to feed by increasing body mass, whereas birds that were photorefractory did not.
   4. Contrary to theoretical predictions, there was no indication that the response to variable time of onset deprivations was larger than the response to deprivations that began at a fixed time of day.
   5. It is suggested that different strategies of mass regulation at different points in the annual cycle may be a response to season-specific costs and benefits of fat storage, or may relate to season-specific changes in environmental stochasticity.

TI Nitrogen enrichment, altered stoichiometry, and coral reef decline at

AB Increased loadings of nitrogen (N) from fertilizers, top soil, sewage, and atmospheric deposition are important drivers of eutrophication in coastal waters globally. Monitoring seawater and macroalgae can reveal long-term changes in N and phosphorus (P) availability and N:P stoichiometry that are critical to understanding the global crisis of coral reef decline. Analysis of a unique 3-decade data set for Looe Key reef, located offshore the lower Florida Keys, showed increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), chlorophyll a, DIN:soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) ratios, as well as higher tissue C:P and N:P ratios in macroalgae during the early 1990s. These data, combined with remote sensing and nutrient monitoring between the Everglades and Looe Key, indicated that the significant DIN enrichment between 1991 and 1995 at Looe Key coincided with increased Everglades runoff, which drains agricultural and urban areas extending north to Orlando, Florida. This resulted in increased P limitation of reef primary producers that can cause metabolic stress in stony corals. Outbreaks of stony coral disease, bleaching, and mortality between 1995 and 2000 followed DIN enrichment, algal blooms, and increased DIN:SRP ratios, suggesting that eutrophication interacted with other factors causing coral reef decline at Looe Key. Although water temperatures at Looe Key exceeded the 30.5 degrees C bleaching threshold repeatedly over the 3-decade study, the three mass bleaching events occurred only when DIN:SRP ratios increased following heavy rainfall and increased Everglades runoff. Theseresults suggest that Everglades discharges, in conjunction with local nutrient sources, contributed to DIN enrichment, eutrophication, and increased N:P ratios at Looe Key, exacerbating P limitation, coral stress and decline. Improved management of water quality at the local and regional levels could moderate N inputs and maintain more balanced N:P stoichiometry, thereby reducing the risk of coral bleaching, disease, and mortality under the current level of temperature stress.

AB Every living creature on Earth is made of atoms of the various bioelements that are harnessed in the construction of molecules, tissues, organisms, and communities, as we know them. Organisms need these bioelements in specific quantities and proportions to survive and grow. Distinct species have different functions and life strategies, and have therefore developed distinct structures and adopted a certain combination of metabolic and physiological processes. Each species is thus also expected to have different requirements for each bioelement. We therefore propose that a "biogeochemical niche" can be associated with the classical ecological niche of each species. We show from field data examples that a biogeochemical niche is characterized by a particular elementome defined as the content of all (or at least most) bioelements. The differences in elementome among species are a function of taxonomy and phylogenetic distance, sympatry (the bioelemental compositions should differ more among coexisting than among non-coexisting species to avoid competitive pressure), and homeostasis with a continuum between high homeostasis/low plasticity and low homeostasis/high plasticity. This proposed biogeochemical niche hypothesis has the advantage relative to other associated theoretical niche hypotheses that it can be easily characterized by actual quantification of a measurable trait: the elementome of a given organism or a community, being potentially applicable across taxa and habitats. The changes in bioelemental availability can determine genotypic selection and therefore have a feedback on ecosystem function and organization, and, at the end, become another driving factor of the evolution of life and the environment.

AB Antibiotic exposure in children has been associated with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Antibiotic use in children or in their pregnant mother can affect how the intestinal microbiome develops, so we asked whether the transfer of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota from mothers to their children could affect their risk of developing IBD. Here we demonstrate that germ-free adult pregnant mice inoculated with a gut microbial community shaped by antibiotic exposure transmitted their perturbed microbiota to their offspring with high fidelity. Without any direct or continued exposure to antibiotics, this dysbiotic microbiota in the offspring remained distinct from controls for at least 21 weeks. By using both IL-10-deficient and wild-type mothers, we showed that both inoculum and genotype shape microbiota populations in the offspring. Because IL10(-/-) mice are genetically susceptible to colitis, we could assess the risk due to maternal transmission of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota. We found that the IL10(-/-) offspring that had received the perturbed gut microbiota developed markedly increased colitis. Taken together, our findings indicate that antibiotic exposure shaping the maternal gut microbiota has effects that extend to the offspring, with both ecological and long-term disease consequences.

AB Subsurface petroleum reservoirs are an important component of the deep biosphere where indigenous microorganisms live under extreme conditions and in isolation from the Earth's surface for millions of years. However, unlike the bulk of the deep biosphere, the petroleum reservoir deep biosphere is subject to extreme anthropogenic perturbation, with the introduction of new electron acceptors, donors and exogenous microbes during oil exploration and production. Despite the fundamental and practical significance of this perturbation, there has never been a systematic evaluation of the ecological changes that occur over the production lifetime of an active offshore petroleum production system. Analysis of the entire Halfdan oil field in the North Sea (32 producing wells in production for 1-15 years) using quantitative PCR, multigenic sequencing, comparative metagenomic and genomic bins reconstruction revealed systematic shifts in microbial community composition and metabolic potential, as well as changing ecological strategies in response to anthropogenic perturbation of the oil field ecosystem, related to length of time in production. The microbial communities were initially dominated by slow growing anaerobes such as members of the Thermotogales and Clostridiales adapted to living on hydrocarbons and complex refractory organic matter. However, as seawater and nitrate injection (used for secondary oil production) delivered oxidants, the microbial community composition progressively changed to fast growing opportunists such as members of the Deferribacteres, Delta-, Epsilon-and Gammaproteobacteria, with energetically more favorable metabolism (for example, nitrate reduction, H2S, sulfide and sulfur oxidation). This perturbation has profound consequences for understanding the microbial ecology of the system and is of considerable practical importance as it promotes detrimental processes such as reservoir souring and metal corrosion. These findings provide a new conceptual framework for understanding the petroleum reservoir biosphere and have consequences for developing strategies to manage microbiological problems in the oil industry.

AB Studies on tree communities have demonstrated that species diversity can enhance forest productivity, but the driving mechanisms at the local neighbourhood level remain poorly understood. Here, we use data from a large-scale biodiversity experiment with 24 subtropical tree species to show that neighbourhood tree species richness generally promotes individual tree productivity. We found that the underlying mechanisms depend on a focal tree's functional traits: For species with a conservative resource-use strategy diversity effects were brought about by facilitation, and for species with acquisitive traits by competitive reduction. Moreover, positive diversity effects were strongest under low competition intensity (quantified as the total basal area of neighbours) for acquisitive species, and under high competition intensity for conservative species. Our findings demonstrate that net biodiversity effects in tree communities can vary over small spatial scales, emphasising the need to consider variation in local neighbourhood interactions to better understand effects at the community level.

AB Coastal food webs can be supported by local benthic or pelagic primary producers and by the import of organic matter. Distinguishing between these energy sources is essential for our understanding of ecosystem functioning. However, the relative contribution of these components to the food web at the landscape scale is often unclear, as many studies lack good taxonomic and spatial resolution across large areas. Here, using stable carbon isotopes, we report on the primary carbon sources for consumers and their spatial variability across one of the world's largest intertidal ecosystems (Dutch Wadden Sea; 1460 km(2) intertidal surface area), at an exceptionally high taxonomic (178 species) and spatial resolution (9,165 samples from 839 locations). The absence of overlap in delta C-13 values between consumers and terrestrial organic matter suggests that benthic and pelagic producers dominate carbon input into this food web. In combination with the consistent enrichment of benthic primary producers (delta C-13 -16.3 parts per thousand) relative to pelagic primary producers (delta C-13 -18.8) across the landscape, this allowed the use of a two-food-source isotope-mixing model. This spatially resolved modelling revealed that benthic primary producers (microphytobenthos) are the most important energy source for the majority of consumers at higher trophic levels (worms, molluscs, crustaceans, fish, and birds), and thus to the whole food web. In addition, we found large spatial heterogeneity in the delta C-13 values of benthic primary producers (delta C-13 -19.2 to -11.5 parts per thousand) and primary consumers (delta C-13 -25.5 to -9.9 parts per thousand), emphasizing the need for spatially explicit sampling of benthic and pelagic primary producers in coastal ecosystems. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the functioning of ecological networks and for the management of coastal ecosystems.

AB Soil ecosystems worldwide are subjected to marked modifications caused by anthropogenic disturbances and global climate change, resulting in microbial diversity loss and alteration of ecosystem functions. Despite the paucity of studies, restoration ecology provides an appropriate framework for testing the potential of manipulating soil microbial communities for the recovery of ecosystem functioning. We used a reciprocal transplant design in experimentally altered microbial communities to investigate the effectiveness of introducing microbial communities in degraded soil ecosystems to restore N-cycle functioning. Microbial diversity loss resulted in alternative compositional states associated with impaired N-cycle functioning. Here, the addition of complex microbial communities to these altered communities revealed a pivotal role of deterministic community assembly processes. The diversity of some alternative compositional states was successfully increased but without significant restoration of soil N-cycle functioning. However, in the most degraded alternative state, the introduction of new microbial communities caused an overall decrease in phylogenetic diversity and richness. The successful soil colonization by newly introduced species for some compositional states indicates that priority effects could be overridden when attempting to manipulate microbial communities for soil restoration. Altogether, our result showed consistent patterns within restoration treatments with minor idiosyncratic effects. This suggests the predominance of deterministic processes and the predictability of restoration trajectories, which could be used to guide the effective management of microbial community assemblages for ecological restoration of soils.

AB Forest soils represent a substantial portion of the terrestrial carbon (C) pool, and changes to soil C cycling are globally significant not only for C sequestration but also for sustaining forest productivity and ecosystem services. To quantify the effect of harvesting on soil C, we used meta-analysis to examine a database of 945 responses to harvesting collected from 112 publications from around the world. Harvesting reduced soil C, on average, by 11.2% with 95% CI [14.1%, 8.5%]. There was substantial variation between responses in different soil depths, with greatest losses occurring in the O horizon (30.2%). Much smaller but still significant losses (3.3%) occurred in top soil C pools (0-15 cm depth). In very deep soil (60-100+ cm), a significant loss of 17.7% of soil C in was observed after harvest. However, only 21 of the 945 total responses examined this depth, indicating a substantial need for more research in this area. The response of soil C to harvesting varies substantially between soil orders, with greater losses in Spodosol and Ultisol orders and less substantial losses in Alfisols and Andisols. Soil C takes several decades to recover following harvest, with Spodosol and Ultisol C recovering only after at least 75 years. The publications in this analysis were highly skewed toward surface sampling, with a maximum sampling depth of 36 cm, on average. Sampling deep soil represents one of the best opportunities to reduce uncertainty in the understanding of the response of soil C to forest harvest.

AB Across both the developing and developed worlds, community engagement has become a key strategy for natural resource management. However, a growing number of studies, report that community-based approaches are experiencing formidable challenges, with limited outcomes in terms of livelihoods, decentralization and sustainability. Yet, policies continue to focus attention unduly on "community participation", ignoring the ways in which the "community" is itself embedded in a wider social system. Recent studies have shown that local communities are more complex than previously assumed, with local community actions being heavily shaped by wider social and environmental contexts. Yet, scholarly research tends to focus on reporting such cross-scalar dynamics, with little explanation of how and why they occur. This paper advances a framework to understand how local communities interact with the wider world, through what we term "delocalization of communities" in natural resource management. Using Bourdieu's theory of social field, we present an approach to analyze various trajectories of delocalization involving the exchange of, and struggle for, a variety of resources valued in specific fields of natural resource governance.
   We extend the work of several researchers who have been critical of the conventional view of the community, and argue that a new model of delocalized "community" needs to be envisaged, one that emphasizes the interactions among actors within and between spatial scales and levels of political organization. While such a cross-scalar view is not novel, we deepen social field approach to assess how cross-scalar processes unfold in the course of "delocalization" of communities in the context of rapid social and environmental change. We draw on evidence from five different case studies from three continents that demonstrate specific aspects of the delocalization phenomenon.
   The cases selected are from Australia, Indonesia, Mexico, Nepal, and Papua New Guinea. We demonstrate through these cases that increasingly diverse interests in natural resources such as forests have served to delocalize communities beyond "local" domains. We conclude that local community is not a localized entity, and there are multiple cross-scale networks which need to be recognized, as these have profound implications in community-based natural resource management. In such situations, open and exploratory approaches - moving away from blueprint interventions - are required to facilitate context-specific fields and spheres of local democracy, nurturing diverse, flexible, and networked models of community participation, along with the recognition of political and economic influence coming from the wider domain.

AB Today's children have less direct contact with nature than ever before, resulting in an "extinction of experience". Research has suggested that such loss of daily interactions decreases people's appreciation of the natural world, but this remains quantitatively unexplored. We conducted a questionnaire survey of undergraduate university students in Tokyo, Japan, and determined the effects of frequency of contact with nature on emotional connectedness to nature and perceptions of neighbourhood nature. A total of 255 students participated in the surveys. Students' perceptions of neighbourhood nature were measured by to what extent they valued cultural ecosystem services derived from neighbourhood natural environments, birds and butterflies. Results showed that students valued neighbourhood natural environments, birds and butterflies for many different reasons, such as relaxation, beauty of natural scenes, an indicator of seasonality, and opportunities for education. Linear mixed models revealed that both current and childhood frequencies of contact with nature were positively related not only to students' emotional connectedness to nature but also their perceptions of neighbourhood nature. Students' emotional connection to nature and perceptions of neighbourhood nature were positively associated with each other. Our results suggest that, given the rapid decrease in children's daily contact with nature, public appreciation of the value of the natural world is likely gradually also to decrease. This can be a major obstacle to reversing global environmental challenges. People should therefore be encouraged to experience neighbourhood natural environments and biodiversity, and city planners and policy makers will play a vital role in connecting people with nature.

AB Emerging conservation paradigms have shifted from single to multi-species approaches focused on sustaining biodiversity. Multi-species hierarchical occupancy modelling provides a method for assessing biodiversity while accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. We analysed camera trapping data with multi-species models using a Bayesian approach to estimate the distributions of a terrestrial mammal community in northern Botswana and evaluate community, group, and species-specific responses to human disturbance and environmental variables. Groupings were based on two life-history traits: body size (small, medium, large and extra-large) and diet (carnivore, omnivore and herbivore). We photographed 44 species of mammals over 6607 trap nights. Camera station-specific estimates of species richness ranged from 8 to 27 unique species, and species had a mean occurrence probability of 0<bold></bold>32 (95% credible interval=0<bold></bold>21-0<bold></bold>45). At the community level, our model revealed species richness was generally greatest in floodplains and grasslands and with increasing distances into protected wildlife areas. Variation among species' responses was explained in part by our species groupings. The positive influence of protected areas was strongest for extra-large species and herbivores, while medium-sized species actually increased in the non-protected areas. The positive effect of grassland/floodplain cover, alternatively, was strongest for large species and carnivores and weakest for small species and herbivores, suggesting herbivore diversity is promoted by habitat heterogeneity.Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the importance of protected areas and grasslands in maintaining biodiversity in southern Africa. We demonstrate the utility of hierarchical Bayesian models for assessing community, group and individual species' responses to anthropogenic and environmental variables. This framework can be used to map areas of high conservation value and predict impacts of land-use change. Our approach is particularly applicable to the growing number of camera trap studies world-wide, and we suggest broader application globally will likely result in reduced costs, improved efficiency and increased knowledge of wildlife communities.

AB Identification of genome-wide patterns of divergence provides insight on how genomes are influenced by selection and can reveal the potential for local adaptation in spatially structured populations. In Atlantic cod - historically a major marine resource - Northeast-Arctic-and Norwegian coastal cod are recognized by fundamental differences in migratory and non-migratory behavior, respectively. However, the genomic architecture underlying such behavioral ecotypes is unclear. Here, we have analyzed more than 8.000 polymorphic SNPs distributed throughout all 23 linkage groups and show that loci putatively under selection are localized within three distinct genomic regions, each of several megabases long, covering approximately 4% of the Atlantic cod genome. These regions likely represent genomic inversions. The frequency of these distinct regions differ markedly between the ecotypes, spawning in the vicinity of each other, which contrasts with the low level of divergence in the rest of the genome. The observed patterns strongly suggest that these chromosomal rearrangements are instrumental in local adaptation and separation of Atlantic cod populations, leaving footprints of large genomic regions under selection. Our findings demonstrate the power of using genomic information in further understanding the population dynamics and defining management units in one of the world's most economically important marine resources.

AB We present 6.5years of eddy covariance measurements of fluxes of methane (F-CH4) and carbon dioxide (F-CO2) from a flooded rice paddy in Northern California, USA. A pronounced warming trend throughout the study associated with drought and record high temperatures strongly influenced carbon (C) budgets and provided insights into biophysical controls of F-CO2 and F-CH4. Wavelet analysis indicated that photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, GEP) induced the diel pattern in F-CH4, but soil temperature (T-s) modulated its amplitude. Forward stepwise linear models and neural networking modeling were used to assess the variables regulating seasonal F-CH4. As expected due to their competence in modeling nonlinear relationships, neural network models explained considerably more of the variance in daily average F-CH4 than linear models. During the growing season, GEP and water levels typically explained most of the variance in daily average F-CH4. However, T-s explained much of the interannual variability in annual and growing season CH4 sums. Higher T-s also increased the annual and growing season ratio of F-CH4 to GEP. The observation that the F-CH4 to GEP ratio scales predictably with T-s may help improve global estimates of F-CH4 from rice agriculture. Additionally, T-s strongly influenced ecosystem respiration, resulting in large interannual variability in the net C budget at the paddy, emphasizing the need for long-term measurements particularly under changing climatic conditions.

AB The statistical estimation of phylogenies is always associated with uncertainty, and accommodating this uncertainty is an important component of modern phylogenetic comparative analysis. The birth-death polytomy resolver is a method of accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty that places missing (unsampled) taxa onto phylogenetic trees, using taxonomic information alone. Recent studies of birds and mammals have used this approach to generate pseudoposterior distributions of phylogenetic trees that are complete at the species level, even in the absence of genetic data for many species. Many researchers have used these distributions of phylogenies for downstream evolutionary analyses that involve inferences on phenotypic evolution, geography, and community assembly. I demonstrate that the use of phylogenies constructed in this fashion is inappropriate for many questions involving traits. Because species are placed on trees at random with respect to trait values, the birth-death polytomy resolver breaks down natural patterns of trait phylogenetic structure. Inferences based on these trees are predictably and often drastically biased in a direction that depends on the underlying (true) pattern of phylogenetic structure in traits. I illustrate the severity of the phenomenon for both continuous and discrete traits using examples from a global bird phylogeny.

AB The increasing use of trophic position (TP) for assessing and describing ecosystems has resulted in the emergence of novel techniques for accurate and accessible measurements. The strength of amino acid compound specific nitrogen isotopic analysis (AA-CSIA) lies in its ability to determine TP using a single organism, utilizing the isotopic differences between two or more amino acids (AAs). However, calculating TP from this technique relies upon the predictability of isotopic differences across consumer types and consistency among ecosystems. The goal of this study was to use wild samples to evaluate N-15 enrichment between AA groups with differing trophic fractionation patterns, termed the trophic discrimination factor (TDFAA), and determine an accurate value for calculating TPs of marine teleosts. Using a large sample size (224 samples of 47 species) across a broad range of TPs (2.0-4.5, estimated by stomach content analysis [SCA]) and marine ecosystems, we derived TDFAA values that explained up to 80% of the variability between TP calculations from SCA and AA-CSIA. We found a TDFAA value of 5.7 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand using the difference between delta N-15 values of glutamic acid and phenylalanine, 2 parts per thousand lower than the most commonly used value of 7.6 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand. The weighted mean of several AAs resulted in the same value for TDFAA, but provided greater agreement with TPs from SCA. For more reliable TP calculations in marine teleosts, our results strongly advocate a lower TDFAA and the use of weighted mean AA delta N-15 values from triplicate analyses.

AB Rapid and periodic assessment of the impact of land cover changes on ecosystem services at regional levels is essential to understanding services and sustainability of ecosystems. This study focused on quantifying and assessing changes of multiple ecosystem services in the Sanjiang Plain of China as a result of land cover changes over the period of 1992-2012. This region is important for its large area of natural wetlands and intensive agriculture. The ecosystem services that were assessed for this region included its regulating services (water yield and ecosystem carbon stocks), supporting services (suitable waterbird habitats), and provisioning services (food production), and the approach to the assessment was composed of the surface energy balance algorithms for land (SEBAL), soil survey re-sampling method and an empirical waterbird habitat suitability model. This large scale and integrated investigation represents the first systematic evaluation on the status of ecosystem carbon stocks in the Sanjiang Plain in addition to the development of an effective model for analysis of waterbird habitat suitability with the use of both remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). More importantly, the result from this study has confirmed trade-offs between ecosystem services and negative consequences to environment in this region. The trade-offs were typically manifested by increased water yield and significantly grown food production, which is in contrast with significant losses in ecosystem carbon stocks (14%) and suitable waterbird habitats (23%) mainly due to the conversion of land cover from wetland to farmland. This finding implies that land use planning and policy making for this economically important region should take ecosystem service losses into account in order to preserve its natural ecosystems in the best interest of society.

AB A long-standing hypothesis in adaptive radiation theory is that ecological opportunity constrains rates of phenotypic evolution, generating a burst of morphological disparity early in clade history. Empirical support for the early burst model is rare in comparative data, however. One possible reason for this lack of support is that most phylogenetic tests have focused on extant clades, neglecting information from fossil taxa. Here, I test for the expected signature of adaptive radiation using the outstanding 40-My fossil record of North American canids. Models implying time-and diversity-dependent rates of morphological evolution are strongly rejected for two ecologically important traits, body size and grinding area of the molar teeth. Instead, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes implying repeated, and sometimes rapid, attraction to distinct dietary adaptive peaks receive substantial support. Diversity-dependent rates of morphological evolution seem uncommon in clades, such as canids, that exhibit a pattern of replicated adaptive radiation. Instead, these clades might best be thought of as deterministic radiations in constrained Simpsonian subzones of a major adaptive zone. Support for adaptive peak models may be diagnostic of subzonal radiations. It remains to be seen whether early burst or ecological opportunity models can explain broader adaptive radiations, such as the evolution of higher taxa.

AB Water temperature governs the distribution and behaviour of fish. Riverine salmonids use discrete cold water patches, termed thermal refuges, when stream temperature exceeds their thermal tolerances. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms driving the spatial distribution of thermal refuges, particularly at large scales. Given the threat posed by climate warming to salmon populations in Europe and North America, thermal refuges are increasingly important for salmonids during summer. In this study, we used airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery to characterise the spatial distribution of thermal refuges from similar to 700 km of rivers in an eastern Canada salmon watershed. Thermal refuges were classified into a range of categories, and those identified as being driven by groundwater processes were observed to be both the most abundant and most spatially variable. Spatial analysis was used to assemble a range of landscape metrics that were tested for associations with the spatial distribution of groundwater-driven refuges. Associations between landscape metrics and the individual occurrence of thermal refuges were assessed using Jacobs' selectivity index. Results showed that the occurrence of groundwater thermal refuges was significantly associated with high values of channel curvature and close proximity of incoming tributary valleys (X-2 p < 0.05, df = 9). Regression was used to assess correlations between landscape metrics and the density of thermal refuges (number per river km). Channel confinement was found to correlate strongly with the density of groundwater thermal refuges using a quadratic model (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.05). Our study is the first to quantify the relationship between the spatial distribution of groundwater thermal refuges and landscape hydromorphology throughout a riverscape. This information can be used to aid conservation efforts and manage critical thermal habitats in rivers and streams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The skill of a forecast can be assessed by comparing the relative proximity of both the forecast and a benchmark to the observations. Example benchmarks include climatology or a naive forecast. Hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPS) are currently transforming the hydrological forecasting environment but in this new field there is little information to guide researchers and operational forecasters on how benchmarks can be best used to evaluate their probabilistic forecasts. In this study, it is identified that the forecast skill calculated can vary depending on the benchmark selected and that the selection of a benchmark for determining forecasting system skill is sensitive to a number of hydrological and system factors. A benchmark intercomparison experiment is then undertaken using the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), a reference forecasting system and a suite of 23 different methods to derive benchmarks. The benchmarks are assessed within the operational set-up of the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) to determine those that are 'toughest to beat' and so give the most robust discrimination of forecast skill, particularly for the spatial average fields that EFAS relies upon.
   Evaluating against an observed discharge proxy the benchmark that has most utility for EFAS and avoids the most naive skill across different hydrological situations is found to be meteorological persistency. This benchmark uses the latest meteorological observations of precipitation and temperature to drive the hydrological model. Hydrological long term average benchmarks, which are currently used in EFAS, are very easily beaten by the forecasting system and the use of these produces much naive skill. When decomposed into seasons, the advanced meteorological benchmarks, which make use of meteorological observations from the past 20 years at the same calendar date, have the most skill discrimination. They are also good at discriminating skill in low flows and for all catchment sizes. Simpler meteorological benchmarks are particularly useful for high flows. Recommendations for EFAS are to move to routine use of meteorological persistency, an advanced meteorological benchmark and a simple meteorological benchmark in order to provide a robust evaluation of forecast skill. This work provides the first comprehensive evidence on how benchmarks can be used in evaluation of skill in probabilistic hydrological forecasts and which benchmarks are most useful for skill discrimination and avoidance of naive skill in a large scale HEPS. It is recommended that all HEPS use the evidence and methodology provided here to evaluate which benchmarks to employ; so forecasters can have trust in their skill evaluation and will have confidence that their forecasts are indeed better.

AB Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) are advantageous over conventional detection methods in terms of their simplicity and rapidity. These assays have been reported using various types of labels but colloidal gold nanoparticles are still the preferred choice as a label because of their easy synthesis, visual detection and stability. Bacterial contamination of food and drinking water is a major threat and hindrance towards ensuring food and water safety. Enterobacteriaceae family members are mainly transmitted by the consumption of contaminated water and food and implicated in various food or water borne infections. The LFIAs have been popularly used for detection of bacterial cells in different matrices. Therefore, this review intends to provide an analysis of the gold nanoparticle based lateral flow assays developed for detecting enterobacteriaceae family members in food and water samples. The review includes detailed data and discusses the factors that influence the performance of LFIAs and their shortcomings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tight coupling between pelagic and benthic communities is accepted as a general principle on Arctic shelves. Whereas this paradigm has been useful for guiding ecological research, it has perhaps led to a disproportionate focus on POM and ice algae as the most likely sources of carbon for the benthic food web. Arctic shelves are complex systems, including banks, fjords, and trough systems up to 350 m or more in depth. In this stable-isotope study, 13 different potential carbon sources were analyzed for their contribution to the food-webs of lsfjorden, Svalbard. A mixing model with herbivorous copepods and grazing sea urchins as end-members was applied to determine the relative contributions of the most likely carbon sources to pelagic and benthic taxa. Most taxa from the benthos feed on a broad mixture of POM and macroalgal detritus, even at depths down to 410 m. Most suspension-feeding bivalves had isotopic signals consistent with more than a 50% contribution from kelps and rockweeds. In contrast, nearly all pelagic species had diets consistent with an overwhelming contribution of pelagic POM. These results indicate that macroalgal detritus can contribute significantly to near-shore Arctic food-webs, a trophic link that may increase if macroalgae increase in the Arctic as predicted. These weaker quantitative links between pelagic and benthic components of coastal systems highlight the need for thorough sampling of potential carbon-baselines in food-web studies. A large detrital-carbon component in diets of Arctic benthos may dampen the impacts of strong seasonality in polar primary producers, leading to higher ecosystem resilience, but may also result in lower secondary productivity.

AB Responses by flowering plants to climate change are complex and only beginning to be understood. Through analyses of 10,295 herbarium specimens of Himalayan Rhododendron collected by plant hunters and botanists since 1884, we were able to separate these responses into significant components. We found a lack of directional change in mean flowering time over the past 45 y of rapid warming. However, over the full 125 y of collections, mean flowering time shows a significant response to year-to-year changes in temperature, and this response varies with season of warming. Mean flowering advances with annual warming (2.27 d earlier per 1 degrees C warming), and also is delayed with fall warming (2.54 d later per 1 degrees C warming). Annual warming may advance flowering through positive effects on overwintering bud formation, whereas fall warming may delay flowering through an impact on chilling requirements. The lack of a directional response suggests that contrasting phenological responses to temperature changes may obscure temperature sensitivity in plants. By drawing on large collections from multiple herbaria, made over more than a century, we show how these data may inform studies even of remote localities, and we highlight the increasing value of these and other natural history collections in understanding long-term change.

AB Complex systems science provides a transdisciplinary framework to study systems characterized by (1) heterogeneity, (2) hierarchy, (3) self-organization, (4) openness, (5) adaptation, (6) memory, (7) non-linearity, and (8) uncertainty. Complex systems thinking has inspired both theory and applied strategies for improving ecosystem resilience and adaptability, but applications in forest ecology and management are just beginning to emerge. We review the properties of complex systems using four well-studied forest biomes (temperate, boreal, tropical and Mediterranean) as examples. The lens of complex systems science yields insights into facets of forest structure and dynamics that facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. These biomes share the main properties of complex systems but differ in specific ecological properties, disturbance regimes, and human uses. We show how this approach can help forest scientists and managers to conceptualize forests as integrated social-ecological systems and provide concrete examples of how to manage forests as complex adaptive systems.

AB Aim At a global scale, the relationship of leaf longevity (LL) to mean annual temperature (MAT) is positive for deciduous species but negative for evergreen species. The aim of this paper is to understand the mechanisms underlying these contrasting patterns of leaf longevity, from a cost-benefit perspective.
   Location Global.
   Methods We tested our hypothesis that contrasting LL-MAT relationships in evergreen and deciduous species result from differing adaptations to variation in the length of the annual favourable period. We defined f as the portion of the year when monthly temperature and water availability were favourable. We examined whether the contrasting LL patterns with MAT can be also seen with f. Next, we calculated the optimal LL that maximizes carbon gain per unit time across a range of f.
   Results The contrasting LL patterns across MAT were also found across f. Our optimization model successfully reproduced the contrasting LL patterns across f for the evergreen (LL longer than 1 year) and deciduous plants. The model shows that longer LL is required to maximize carbon gain for evergreen plants in shorter f, while LL of deciduous plants decreases with decreasing f. Without any a priori trait association, the model reproduced the well-known LL-leaf mass per area (LMA) relationship. The model also reproduced observed shifts in LL-LMA relationships across MAT or f. Evergreen leaves in long f need greater LMA to maintain LL than those in shorter f.
   Main conclusions Observed contrasting LL-MAT patterns in deciduous and evergreen species can be reproduced via the simple rule of maximizing carbon gain across different lengths of favourable periods. Our model provides a mechanistic explanation for the empirical global patterns of several key leaf traits and their relationships.

AB Many aspects of animal behaviour are affected by real-time changes in the risk of predation. This conclusion holds for virtually all taxa and ecological systems studied, but does it hold for bats? Bats are poorly represented in the literature on anti-predator behaviour, which may reflect a lack of nocturnal predators specialized on bats. If bats actually experience a world with minimal anti-predator concerns, then they will provide a unique contrast within the realm of vertebrate ecology. Alternatively, such predator-driven behaviour in bats may not yet be fully understood, given the difficulties in working with these highly mobile and nocturnal animals. We provide a wide-ranging exploration of these issues in bat behaviour. We first cover the basic predator-prey information available on bats, both on potential predators and the ways in which bats might perceive predators and respond to attacks. We then cover work relevant to key aspects of bat behaviour, such as choice of daytime roosts, the nature of sleep and torpor, evening roost departures, moonlight avoidance, landscape-related movement patterns, and habitat selection. Overall, the evidence in favour of a strong influence of predators on bat behaviour is equivocal, with the picture clouded by contradictory results and a lack of information on potential predators and the perception of risk by bats. It seems clear that day-active bats run a considerable risk of being killed by diurnal raptors, which are able to capture bats with relative ease. Thus, bats taking advantage of a pulse of insects just prior to sunset are likely taking risks to gain much-needed energy. Further, the choice of daytime roosts by bats is probably strongly influenced by roost safety. Few studies, however, have directly addressed either of these topics. As a group, insectivorous temperate-zone bats show no clear tendency to avoid apparently risky situations, such as activity on moonlit nights. However, some observations are consistent with the idea that predation risk affects choice of movement paths and feeding areas by temperate-zone bats, as well as the timing of roost departures. The behaviour of tropical bats, on the other hand, seems more generally influenced by predators; this is especially true for tropical nectarivores and frugivores, but also for insectivorous bats. Presumably there are more serious predators on bats in the tropics (e.g. specialized raptors or carnivorous bats), but the identity of these predators is unclear. More information is needed to assess fully the influence of predators on bat behaviour. There is much need for work on the ways in which bats perceive predators via auditory, visual, and olfactory cues, and whether bats have some knowledge of the risks posed by different predators. Also needed is information on how predators attack bats and how bats react to attacking predators. Difficult to obtain, but of critical value, will be information on the nature of the predation risk experienced by bats while away from roosts and during the full darkness of night.

AB Previous studies demonstrate statistically significant associations between disease and climate variations, highlighting the potential for developing climate-based epidemic early warning systems. However, limitations include failure to allow for non-climatic confounding factors, limited geographical/temporal resolution, or lack of evaluation of predictive validity. Here, we consider such issues for dengue in Southeast Brazil using a spatio-temporal generalised linear mixed model with parameters estimated in a Bayesian framework, allowing posterior predictive distributions to be derived in time and space. This paper builds upon a preliminary study by Lowe et al. but uses extended, more recent data and a refined model formulation, which, amongst other adjustments, incorporates past dengue risk to improve model predictions. For the first time, a thorough evaluation and validation of model performance is conducted using out-of-sample predictions and demonstrates considerable improvement over a model that mirrors current surveillance practice. Using the model, we can issue probabilistic dengue early warnings for pre-defined alert' thresholds. With the use of the criterion greater than a 50% chance of exceeding 300 cases per 100,000 inhabitants', there would have been successful epidemic alerts issued for 81% of the 54 regions that experienced epidemic dengue incidence rates in FebruaryApril 2008, with a corresponding false alarm rate of 25%. We propose a novel visualisation technique to map ternary probabilistic forecasts of dengue risk. This technique allows decision makers to identify areas where the model predicts with certainty a particular dengue risk category, to effectively target limited resources to those districts most at risk for a given season.

AB Climate change is expected to alter the dynamics of infectious diseases around the globe. Predictive models remain elusive due to the complexity of hostparasite systems and insufficient data describing how environmental conditions affect various system components. Here, we link hostmacroparasite models with the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, providing a mechanistic framework that allows integrating multiple nonlinear environmental effects to estimate parasite fitness under novel conditions. The models allow determining the fundamental thermal niche of a parasite, and thus, whether climate change leads to range contraction or may permit a range expansion. Applying the models to seasonal environments, and using an arctic nematode with an endotherm host for illustration, we show that climate warming can split a continuous spring-to-fall transmission season into two separate transmission seasons with altered timings. Although the models are strategic and most suitable to evaluate broad-scale patterns of climate change impacts, close correspondence between model predictions and empirical data indicates model applicability also at the species level. As the application of Metabolic Theory considerably aids the a priori estimation of model parameters, even in data-sparse systems, we suggest that the presented approach could provide a framework for understanding and predicting climatic impacts for many hostparasite systems worldwide.

AB Invasive ecosystem engineers can have far-reaching effects on systems, especially if they provide structure where none was before. The non-native seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla has proliferated on estuarine mudflats throughout the southeastern US, including areas (South Carolina and Georgia) that historically were extremely low in seaweed biomass. Quantitative field surveys across 150 km of high salinity estuaries revealed that the density of the native onuphid polychaete Diopatra cuprea and the aboveground height of its biogenic tubes, which Diopatra decorates with drifting debris and seaweed, positively influenced Gracilaria biomass. The abundance of Gracilaria epifauna, composed primarily of amphipods and small snails, increased with Gracilaria biomass at many locations in our field surveys. To examine whether epifauna were facilitated by Gracilaria we experimentally manipulated Gracilaria biomass in two locations. Consistent with the field surveys, we found that increasing Gracilaria biomass facilitated epifauna, particularly amphipods and snails. Epifaunal densities on Gracilaria were higher than on a biologically-inert structural mimic of Gracilaria (plastic aquarium alga), indicating that epifauna colonize Gracilaria because Gracilaria provisions both physical structure and a biological resource. We also quantified the seaweed's net rate of productivity and decomposition. Primary production of Gracilaria was variable, but massive in some areas (up to 200 % net biomass increase in 8 weeks). The seaweed rapidly degraded upon burial in silty sediments (79 % loss in mass within 10 days) and thus may represent an important new addition to detrital foodwebs. As a copious, novel source of primary production, detritus, and desirable habitat for epifauna, Gracilaria has the potential to transform southeastern US estuaries.

AB Arable land occupies large areas of global land surface and hence plays an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Therefore agro-ecosystems show a high potential of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while optimizing agricultural management. Hence, there is a growing interest in analyzing and understanding carbon fluxes from arable land as affected by regional environmental as well as management conditions. The major goal of this study is to use a two year data set of eddy covariance measurements (October 2007 to October 2009) on a winter wheat field located in Western Germany to assess the seasonal and inter-annual variability of carbon fluxes as affected by meteorological variables and land management. During the study period, which was comprised of two full growing seasons, eddy covariance measurements together with measurements of various soil, plant, and meteorological data were performed. Flux partitioning and gap filling methods including uncertainty estimates were applied to derive complete time series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (R-eco). Despite different management dates and slightly different meteorological conditions, annual NEE resulted in 270 g C m(-2) in both years. Although the period from sowing to harvesting was more than 20 days shorter in the first year, due to the later start of senescence, GPP was higher by 220 g C m(-2). In the annual carbon budget this was compensated by a stronger heterotrophic respiration after the harvest of sugar beet grown on the field before the study period. Taking into account the carbon losses due to removal of biomass during harvest, the winter wheat field acts as a carbon source with respective net biome productivities (NBP) of 246 and 201 g C m(-2) a(-1). To complete the carbon balance, releases due to energy consumption associated with crop production are taken into account. However, the relatively large carbon loss was probably, to a large extent, compensated by carbon input from plant residues left on the field after preceding sugar beet harvest. This underlines the importance of multi-annual measurements taking full crop rotations into account. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Birds have long fascinated scientists and travellers, so their distribution and abundance through time have been better documented than those of other organisms. Many bird species are known to have gone extinct, but information on subspecies extinctions has never been synthesised comprehensively. We reviewed the timing, spatial patterns, trends and causes of avian extinctions on a global scale, identifying 279 ultrataxa (141 monotypic species and 138 subspecies of polytypic species) that have gone extinct since 1500. Species extinctions peaked in the early 20th century, then fell until the mid 20th century, and have subsequently accelerated. However, extinctions of ultrataxa peaked in the second half of the 20th century. This trend reflects a consistent decline in the rate of extinctions on islands since the beginning of the 20th century, but an acceleration in the extinction rate on continents. Most losses (78.7% of species and 63.0% of subspecies) occurred on oceanic islands. Geographic foci of extinctions include the Hawaiian Islands (36 taxa), mainland Australia and islands (29 taxa), the Mascarene Islands (27 taxa), New Zealand (22 taxa) and French Polynesia (19 taxa). The major proximate drivers of extinction for both species and subspecies are invasive alien species (58.2% and 50.7% of species and subspecies, respectively), hunting (52.4% and 18.8%) and agriculture, including non-timber crops and livestock farming (14.9% and 31.9%). In general, the distribution and drivers of subspecific extinctions are similar to those for species extinctions. However, our finding that, when subspecies are considered, the extinction rate has accelerated in recent decades is both novel and alarming.

AB We use two ecological niche modeling methods, Maxent and GARP, to model the potential distribution of emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis, EAB) in its invaded (Canada, USA) and native range (eastern Asia). For each algorithm (Maxent and GARP), we constructed three different models based on native or invaded data or a combination thereof. All GARP models yielded higher area under the curve (AUC) values and had therefore higher discriminatory power than the corresponding Maxent models, and the area predicted as suitable by GARP in North America was generally larger and included most infested sites even at the known range edges. In Asia, habitat suitability predicted by both algorithms was low and models trained with invaded coordinates did not transfer well to the native range. We found that none of the Maxent models provided a prediction precise enough for reliable risk assessment and the development of management plans, but a GARP model trained in the native range performed well when validated with data from the invaded range. Based on this GARP model, EAB may be able to extend its North American range further south, north and west covering roughly half (49%) of the natural range of the most common affected ash species (Fraxinus americana, F. nigra, F. quadrangulata, and E. pennsylvanica). While our results demonstrate that native data may be useful for risk assessment of invasive species, a validation of early predictions based on these data is only possible with a time lag, which is lacking for most species. Due to uncertainties associated with ecological niche models for invaders, native data may not be sufficient at all times for long-term risk assessment. With regard to the latter, we recommend frequent re-evaluation of models based on more current monitoring. Combining ecological niche models with more mechanistic approaches based on experimental data may reduce uncertainty and improve risk assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to accurately predict patterns of species' occurrences is fundamental to the successful management of animal communities. To determine optimal management strategies, it is essential to understand species-habitat relationships and how species habitat use is related to natural or human-induced environmental changes. Using five years of monitoring data in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, Maryland, USA, we developed four multispecies hierarchical models for estimating amphibian wetland use that account for imperfect detection during sampling. The models were designed to determine which factors (wetland habitat characteristics, annual trend effects, spring/summer precipitation, and previous wetland occupancy) were most important for predicting future habitat use. We used the models to make predictions about species occurrences in sampled and unsampled wetlands and evaluated model projections using additional data. Using a Bayesian approach, we calculated a posterior distribution of receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) values, which allowed us to explicitly quantify the uncertainty in the quality of our predictions and to account for false negatives in the evaluation data set. We found that wetland hydroperiod (the length of time that a wetland holds water), as well as the occurrence state in the prior year, were generally the most important factors in determining occupancy. The model with habitat-only covariates predicted species occurrences well; however, knowledge of wetland use in the previous year significantly improved predictive ability at the community level and for two of 12 species/species complexes. Our results demonstrate the utility of multispecies models for understanding which factors affect species habitat use of an entire community (of species) and provide an improved methodology using AUC that is helpful for quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions while explicitly accounting for detection biases.

AB Understanding the drivers of speciation is critical to interpreting patterns of biodiversity. The identification of the genetic changes underlying adaptation and reproductive isolation is necessary to link barriers to gene flow to the causal origins of divergence. Here, we present a novel approach to the genetics of speciation, which should complement the commonly used approaches of quantitative trait locus mapping and genome-wide scans for selection. We present a large-scale candidate gene approach by means of sequence capture, applied to identifying the genetic changes underlying reproductive isolation in the pea aphid, a model system for the study of ecological speciation. Targeted resequencing enabled us to scale up the candidate gene approach, specifically testing for the role of chemosensory gene families in host plant specialization. Screening for the signature of divergence under selection at 172 candidate and noncandidate loci, we revealed a handful of loci that show high levels of differentiation among host races, which almost all correspond to odorant and gustatory receptor genes. This study offers the first indication that some chemoreceptor genes, often tightly linked together in the genome, could play a key role in local adaptation and reproductive isolation in the pea aphid and potentially other phytophagous insects. Our approach opens a new route toward the functional genomics of ecological speciation.

AB Predicting future impacts of anthropogenic change on tropical forests requires a clear understanding of nutrient constraints on productivity. We compared experimental fertilization and litter manipulation treatments in an old-growth lowland tropical forest to distinguish between the effects of inorganic nutrient amendments and changes in nutrient cycling via litterfall. We measured the changes in soil and litter nutrient pools, litterfall, and fine root biomass in plots fertilized with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or potassium (K), and in litter addition and litter removal treatments during 7 years. Soil inorganic N and litter N increased in double-litter plots but not in N-fertilized plots. Conversely, litter P and soil pools of P and K increased in fertilized plots but not in the double-litter plots. Soil and litter pools of N and K decreased in the no-litter plots. Changes in litterfall with added nutrients or litter were only marginally significant, but fine root biomass decreased with both the litter and the K addition. Differences between the two experiments are mostly attributable to the coupled cycling of carbon and nutrients in litter. Increased nutrient inputs in litter may improve plant uptake of some nutrients compared to fertilization with similar amounts. The litter layer also appears to play a key role in nutrient retention. We discuss our findings in the context of possible impacts of anthropogenic change on tropical forests.

AB Mountain systems throughout the globe are characterized by high levels of species richness and species endemism. Biodiversity, however, is not distributed evenly with altitude, but often declines from mid to high altitudes. Conversely, endemic species may be over-represented at high altitudes. Upward elevational range shifts of mountain species have been reported in response to ongoing changes in climate, yet the reports are dominated by studies on woody species and mountains at high latitudes. We investigated spatial and temporal changes in the mountain biodiversity in the subtropical island of Taiwan, based on historical survey and resurvey data during the period 19062006. We found that upper altitudinal limits of mountain plant distributions have risen by ca 3.6 m yr-1 during the last century, in parallel with rising temperatures in the region. Although species, genus, and family richness decline with altitude, ca 55% of species at the highest altitudes are endemic to the island. Given the steep decline in land area with increasing elevation, these high altitude areas are disproportionately important for plant biodiversity when richness and endemism are standardized by available land area. We argue that the distributional shift that we report, in combination with the altitudinal distribution of plant diversity, is likely to pose a major threat to high mountain species of this highly biodiverse island, a threat that is becoming increasingly evident for high mountain plants throughout the globe.

AB The nature, size and distribution of the genomic regions underlying divergence and promoting reproductive isolation remain largely unknown. Here, we summarize ongoing efforts using young (12 000 yr BP) species pairs of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) to expand our understanding of the initial genomic patterns of divergence observed during speciation. Our results confirmed the predictions that: (i) on average, phenotypic quantitative trait loci (pQTL) show higher F-ST values and are more likely to be outliers (and therefore candidates for being targets of divergent selection) than non-pQTL markers; (ii) large islands of divergence rather than small independent regions under selection characterize the early stages of adaptive divergence of lake whitefish; and (iii) there is a general trend towards an increase in terms of numbers and size of genomic regions of divergence from the least (East L.) to the most differentiated species pair (Cliff L.). This is consistent with previous estimates of reproductive isolation between these species pairs being driven by the same selective forces responsible for environment specialization. Altogether, dwarf and normal whitefish species pairs represent a continuum of both morphological and genomic differentiation contributing to ecological speciation. Admittedly, much progress is still required to more finely map and circumscribe genomic islands of speciation. This will be achieved through the use of next generation sequencing data but also through a better quantification of phenotypic traits moulded by selection as organisms adapt to new environmental conditions.

TI Stabilization of the murine gut microbiome following weaning

DT Article
DE constancy; 16S rRNA; microbial ecology; 454 sequencing; communities;
   development
AB Ecologists hypothesize that community structure and stability affect productivity, sensitivity to invasion and extinction, and resilience and resistance to perturbations. Viewed in the context of the gut microbiome, the stability of the gut community is important for understanding the effects of antibiotics, diet change and other perturbations on host health and colonization resistance. Here we describe the dynamics of a self-contained community, the murine gut microbiome. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples collected daily from individual mice, we characterized the community membership and structure to determine whether there were significant changes in the gut community during the first year of life. Based on analysis of molecular variance, we observed two community states. The first was observed in the 10 days following weaning and the second was observed by 15 days following weaning. Interestingly, these two states had the same bacterial populations, but those populations had different relative abundances in the two states. By calculating the root mean squared distances between samples collected in the early and late states for each mouse, we observed that the late state was more stable than the early state. This increase in stability was not correlated with increased taxonomic richness, taxonomic diversity, or phylogenetic diversity. In the absence of an experimentally induced perturbation, the second community state was relatively constant through 364 days post weaning. These results suggest a high degree of stability in the microbiome once the community reached the second state.

AB Evolutionary changes in natural populations are often so fast that the evolutionary dynamics may influence ecological population dynamics and vice versa. Here we construct an eco-evolutionary model for dispersal by combining a stochastic patch occupancy metapopulation model with a model for changes in the frequency of fast-dispersing individuals in local populations. We test the model using data on allelic variation in the gene phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi), which is strongly associated with dispersal rate in the Glanville fritillary butterfly. Population-specific measures of immigration and extinction rates and the frequency of fast-dispersing individuals among the immigrants explained 40% of spatial variation in Pgi allele frequency among 97 local populations. The model clarifies the roles of founder events and gene flow in dispersal evolution and resolves a controversy in the literature about the consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation on the evolution of dispersal.

AB To predict the risk associated with future introductions, ecologists seek to identify traits that determine the invasiveness of species. Among numerous designated characteristics, tolerance towards environmental stress is one of the most favored. However, there is little empirical support for the assumption that non-native species generally cope better with temporarily unfavorable conditions than native species. To test this concept, we ran five pairwise comparisons between native and non-native marine invertebrates at temperate, subtropical, and tropical sites. We included (natives named first) six bivalves: Brachidontes exustus and Perna viridis, P. perm and Isognomon bicolor. Saccostrea glomerata and Crassostrea gigas, two ascidians: Diplosoma listerianum and Didemnum vexillum as well as two crustaceans: Gammarus zaddachi and G. tigrinus. We simulated acute fluctuations in salinity, oxygen concentration, and temperature, while we measured respiration and survival rates. Under stressful conditions, non-native species consistently showed less pronounced deviations from their normal respiratory performance than their native counterparts. We suggest that this indicates that they have a wider tolerance range. Furthermore, they also revealed higher survival rates under stress. Thus, stress tolerance seems to be a property of successful invaders and could therefore be a useful criterion for screening profiles and risk assessment protocols. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Global declines in biodiversity are altering disease dynamics in complex and multifaceted ways. Changes in biodiversity can have several outcomes on disease risk, including dilution and amplification effects, both of which can have a profound influence on the effects of disease in a community. The dilution effect occurs when biodiversity and disease risk are inversely related, whereas the amplification effect is a positive relationship between biodiversity and disease risk. We tested these effects with an emerging fungal pathogen of amphibians, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which is responsible for catastrophic amphibian population declines and extinctions worldwide. Despite the rapid and continued spread of Bd, the influence of host diversity on Bd dynamics remains unknown. We experimentally manipulated host diversity and density in the presence of Bd and found a dilution effect where increased species richness reduced disease risk, even when accounting for changes in density. These results demonstrate the general importance of incorporating community structure into studies of disease dynamics and have implications for the effects of Bd in ecosystems that differ in biodiversity.

AB In the last years a new tool has become widely used in ecological studies: species distribution models. These models analyze the spatial patterns of presence of organisms objectively, by means of statistical and cartographic procedures based on real data. They infer the presence of potentially suitable areas according to their environmental characteristics. Data stored in natural history collections can be used for this purpose, which gives new opportunities to use to these types of data. The models have evolved from the analysis of single species to the study of hundreds or thousands of taxa which are combined for the assessment of biodiversity and species richness. In this paper we review the variety of methods used, their potential and weaknesses, and the limiting factors that influence the interpretation of species distribution models.

AB Variation in learning and memory abilities among closely related species, or even among populations of the same species, has opened research into the relationship between cognition, ecological context and the fitness costs, and benefits of learning and memory. Such research programmes have long been dominated by vertebrate studies and by the assumption of a relationship between cognitive abilities, brain size and metabolic costs. Research on these 'large brained' organisms has provided important insights into the understanding of cognitive functions and their adaptive value. In the present review, we discuss some aspects of the fitness costs of learning and memory by focusing on 'mini-brain' studies. Research on learning and memory in insects has challenged some traditional positions and is pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the evolution of learning and memory.

AB The distribution of species on elevational gradients challenges our understanding of ecological processes, particularly in the context of biotic responses to climate change. We report here the distribution of leaf-litter ants on the Barva Transect, a continuous gradient of wet forest on Costa Rica's Atlantic slope. Seven sites were sampled, distributed from 50 to 2000 m. Worker density and microsite occupancy were high and relatively constant from 50 m to 1500 m and then abruptly dropped to near zero at 2000 m. Species density at the 1 m(2) scale was high and constant to 1070 m and then declined at higher elevations. Species richness of assemblages at the 1 km(2) scale was constant or rose slightly from 50 m to 500 m and then steeply declined. Because assemblage richness and species density declined more rapidly than worker density, density compensation with elevation is suggested and supported by a measure of mean population density. Statistically, temperature was the best predictor of both species richness and worker density. Relative humidity, soil nutrients, elevation-specific regional area, and the mid-domain effect were poor predictors of richness. Sites from 50 m to 500 m were similar in species composition. In contrast, assemblages at 1070 m, 1500 m, and 2000 m were highly differentiated. Thus elevational ranges were narrow for species at mid to upper elevations and broad for those at the lowest elevations.
   Density compensation at higher elevation suggests that if temperature or productivity are influencing the decline in diversity it must be indirectly through speciation and extinction processes, rather than by greater numbers of individuals. The broad ranges of lowland species may be a response to as yet unmeasured environmental factors (e.g., NPP) or to climate changes associated with the current interglacial period. Interglacial warming may have driven species to higher elevations, but the lack of competitors at the lower range margins may have allowed the lowest-elevation species to move upslope without a concomitant contraction of the lower range boundary. Global warming threatens a loss of narrowly-distributed montane species, but lowland biotic attrition may be ameliorated by range expansion among lowland species.

AB In sustainable agriculture, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal inoculation in agronomical management might be very important, especially when the efficiency of native inocula is poor. Here, we assessed the effect of native and exotic selected AM fungal inocula on plant growth and nutrient uptake in a low input Trifolium alexandrinum-Zea mays crop rotation. We evaluated the effects of four exotic AM fungal isolates on T. alexandrinum physiological traits in greenhouse. Then, the field performances of T. alexandrinum inoculated with the exotic AMF, both single and mixed, were compared to those obtained with a native inoculum, using a multivariate analysis approach. Finally, we tested the residual effect of AM fungal field inoculation on maize as following crop. Multivariate analysis showed that the field AM fungal inoculation increased T alexandrinum and Z mays productivity and quality and that the native inoculum was as effective as, or more effective than, exotic AM fungal isolates. Moreover, the beneficial effects of AMF were persistent until the second year after inoculation. The use of native AMF, produced on farm with mycotrophic plants species, may represent a convenient alternative to commercial AM fungal inocula, and may offer economically and ecologically important advantages in sustainable or organic cropping systems.

AB P> Aquatic ecologists use mesocosm experiments to understand mechanisms driving ecological processes. Comparisons across experiments, and extrapolations to larger scales, are complicated by the use of mesocosms with varying dimensions. We conducted a mesocosm experiment over a volumetric scale spanning five orders of magnitude (from 4 L to whole ponds) to determine the generality of algal responses to nutrient enrichment. Recognising that mesocosm dimensions may affect algal growth, we also manipulated the ratio of mesocosm surface area to volume (SA : V) over two levels (high versus low). We used mesocosm tanks of similar size and construction to those commonly used in aquatic experiments to increase the generality of our results.
   Volume was generally a stronger determinant of algal responses than mesocosm shape (i.e. SA : V). However, the effects of both volume and shape on algae were weak and explained a small portion of the variance in response variables. In addition, there was no consistent, directional relationship (positive or neutral) between mesocosm volume and algal abundance (estimated by chlorophyll concentration). Combined, our findings suggest that results from small-scale experiments, examining the direct response of algae to nutrient enrichment, can probably be 'moved on up' and applied to larger, more natural aquatic systems.
   Algal response to nutrient enrichment (e.g. nutrient use efficiency and effect size) varied strongly with time. This underscores the importance of choosing an experimental timescale appropriate to the biological and/or ecological process of interest.
   We compared our results to those from a recent meta-analysis of nutrient-limitation studies that included 359 freshwater pelagic experiments, spanning a wide range of volumetric and temporal scales. Similar findings between this experiment and the meta-analysis indicate that algal response to nutrient enrichment varies little across spatial scales. Therefore, it is probable that results from small-scale pelagic algal nutrient-limitation experiments are relevant to large-scale processes, such as eutrophication.

AB P>Compensatory or 'catch-up' growth may be an adaptive mechanism that buffers the growth trajectory of young organisms from deviations caused by reduced food availability. Theory generally assumes that rapid juvenile compensatory growth impacts reproduction only through its positive effects on age and size at maturation, but potential reproductive costs to juvenile compensatory growth remain virtually unexplored. We used a food manipulation experiment to examine the reproductive consequences of compensatory growth in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Compensatory growth did not affect adult growth rates, litter production rates or investment in offspring size. However, compensatory growth had negative effects on litter size, independent of the effects of female body length, resulting in a 20% decline in offspring production. We discuss potential mechanisms behind this observed cost to reproduction.

AB The niche is one of the most important concepts in ecology. However, there has been a persistent controversy on how to define, measure, and predict the ecological niche of an organism. Here I argue that these problems arise in part because the niche is defined by the set of all possible environments, many of which do not exist in nature. A complete description of the niche would require knowledge of a large number of environments that do not exist in nature. Given this, I propose that ecologists should not focus on the niche itself but instead on determining if a particular environment is a part of the niche. I then demonstrate that such an analysis has a natural interpretation as an estimate of the probability that an environment is suitable and that either experimental investigations or analyses of presence data can estimate this quantity. Depending on the way that resources interact to shape environmental requirements, the probability that an environment is a part of the niche behaves like published descriptions of causal inferences and distribution models. However, in some cases the probability that an environment is suitable can be strongly influenced by unmeasured aspects of the environment. When this is true, experimental and distribution models have complimentary strengths and weaknesses.

AB Understanding how urban land-use structure contributes to the abundance and diversity of riparian woody species can inform management and conservation efforts. Yet, previous studies have focused on broad-scale (e.g., urban to exurban) land-use types and have not examined more local-scale changes in land use (e.g., the variation within "urban"), which could be important in urban areas. In this paper we examine how local-scale characteristics or fine-scale urban heterogeneity affect(s) the diversity, composition, and structure of temperate woody riparian vegetation communities in the highly urbanized area of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. We use an information-theoretic approach to compare vegetation models and canonical correspondence analyses to compare species responses to urban variables. We found that urban riparian areas can harbor a high diversity of native canopy and shrub species (38 and 41, respectively); however, native and exotic woody plant species responded differently to urbanization. Exotic canopy species increased with the level of urbanization while native canopy and understory species declined. Understory species diversity displayed a greater response to urbanization than did canopy diversity, suggesting temporal lags in canopy response to disturbances associated with present and recent land-use changes. Certain native and exotic woody species represent ecological indicators of different levels of urbanization. Native species characteristic of pre-European settlement conditions were restricted to the wide riparian forests with little urban encroachment. Several native early-successional species appear tolerant to urbanization. Two exotic species, the tree Ailanthus altissima and the shrub Lonicera maackii, were the most abundant and ubiquitous woody species and appear to exploit urban disturbances. These exotic species invasions have the potential to modify forest composition and ecological function of urban riparian systems. In addition, altered hydrology may be a contributing factor as canopy and understory stem density of high-moisture-requiring species decreased with an increase in impervious surface and grass cover and with proximity to roads and railroads. In the face of urbanization, maintaining wide riparian forests and limiting building, road and railroad development within these areas may help reduce the invasion of exotic species and benefit hydrological function in temperate riparian areas.

AB Mechanistic links between top terrestrial predators and biogeochemical processes remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that large carnivores configure landscape heterogeneity through prey carcass distribution. A 50-year record composed of >3600 moose carcasses from Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, USA, showed that wolves modulate heterogeneity in soil nutrients, soil microbes, and plant quality by clustering prey carcasses over space. Despite being well utilized by predators, moose carcasses resulted in elevated soil macronutrients and microbial biomass, shifts in soil microbial composition, and elevated leaf nitrogen for at least 2-3 years at kill sites. Wolf-killed moose were deposited in some regions of the study landscape at up to 12x the rate of deposition in other regions. Carcass density also varied temporally, changing as much as 19-fold in some locations during the 50-year study period. This variation arises, in part, directly from variation in wolf hunting behavior. This study identifies a top terrestrial predator as a mechanism generating landscape heterogeneity, demonstrating reciprocal links between large carnivore behavior and ecosystem function.

AB In the Andes, demand for water is growing and upland land-use changes are increasing. Water quality, quantity and seasonal flow have thus also become environmental services with potential monetary value. Yet, currently the region's pioneer PES schemes are not paying for measured environmental services, but for proxy land uses thought to provide the(se) service(s). Hydrological modeling makes explicit the tacit causal relationships and tests underlying assumptions Ideally, when combined with an economic analysis of land-use alternatives, this could inform decision makers on how much to pay for different interventions in different spatial locations. This paper focuses on two Andean watersheds. Moyobamba (Peru) and Pimampiro (Ecuador). In the first case, a municipal water company is preparing a payment for environmental services (PES) scheme to reduce upstream sediment loads. In the second, a similar conservation-oriented municipal PES scheme has operated since 2000, but the hydrological linkages have never been tested. Applying the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), we identify in both watersheds biophysically critical areas for service delivery, and compare services for current land uses with change scenarios deforestation, reforestation, live barriers. and agroforestry We then use the ECOSAUT optimization model to predict net economic benefits for service providers. In Moyobamba, switching to shade-grown coffee would halve sediment yields, and increase significantly farmers' economic benefits. This requires high up-front investment, but the willingness to pay of water users in Moyobamba town may suffice to cover the upfront costs. In Pimampiro, resumed deforestation would increase sediments by >50% and reduce dry-season flow by 0.5%, thus reinforcing the rationale of the existing PIES scheme, focused on conserving native forests and grasslands.

AB We measured on annual basis the magnitude and relative importance of different components of the carbon balance of a boreal Scots pine dominated forest ecosystem. The continuous 10-year-long measurement period of this study and the miscellaneous measurements of the components of the ecosystem carbon balance carried out at the same site are almost unique. The ecosystem was shown to be a carbon sink in all measured years. The average net ecosystem exchange (NEE) estimated with the eddy covariance (EC) method was (-)206 g C m(-2) a(-1) and the average annual accumulation of carbon into trees was 242 g C m(-2) a(-1). The above-ground litter production was 186 g C m(-2) a(-1) of which 92 g consisted of needles and leaves. The average respiration rates of the soil, canopy and stems were 646, 316 and 62 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively and the TER deduced from EC measurements was 826 g C m(-2) a(-1). The average rate of the tree and ground vegetation photosynthesis was 982 and 114 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively. In forest ecosystems the application of biomass equations to measurements of tree dimensions and increment cores can give a reliable and unbiased estimate of carbon accumulation into trees. The chamber based flux measurements are useful in showing short term response to changes in light, temperature and moisture conditions, but the generalization of the results over time and space is difficult.

AB The distribution of predators in urban areas is overlooked by urban planners. Due to the homogenizing power of urbanization, towns are expected to favour the settlement of generalist predators. We compared the frequency of specialist and generalist predators along an urban gradient (centre, inner periphery, outer periphery, and scarcely built areas) in towns of different size (small, medium, large). We obtained data on specialist (diurnal and nocturnal raptors, Dendrocopos major) and generalist (Lotus michahellis, corvids) predators breeding in each square of the grid of 27 urban atlases. The number of species per square of specialist predators decreased in more urbanised sectors, whereas the number of generalist predators either did not change or increased in the same sectors. However, some specialist (nocturnal raptors except Athene noctua) and generalist (Garrulus glandarius, Pica pica) predators did not follow such a pattern of distribution. Town size may affect the distribution of predators. Some species (D. major, G. glandarius, P. pica) were more frequent in the more urbanised sectors in small towns. Data gathered in few towns on a limited number of predator species may not fully represent the complex response by predators to urban gradients. Urban planners should consider the distribution of predators in towns to limit risks for urban wildlife. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fact that plant invasions are an ongoing process makes generalizations of invasive spread extraordinarily challenging. This is particularly true given the idiosyncratic nature of invasions, in which both historical and local conditions affect establishment success and hinder our ability to generate guidelines for early detection and eradication of invasive species. To overcome these limitations we have implemented a comprehensive approach that examines plant invasions at three spatial scales: regional, landscape, and local levels. At each scale, in combination with the others, we have evaluated the role of key environmental variables such as climate, landscape structure, habitat type, and canopy closure in the spread of three commonly found invasive woody plant species in New England, Berberis thunbergii, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Euonymus alatus. We developed a spatially explicit hierarchical Bayesian model that allowed us to take into account the ongoing nature of the spread of invasive species and to incorporate presence/absence data from the species' native ranges as well as from the invaded regions. Comparisons between predictions from climate-only models with those from the multiscale forecasts emphasize the importance of including landscape structure in our models of invasive species' potential distributions. In addition, predictions generated using only native range data performed substantially worse than those that incorporated data from the target range. This points out important limitations in extrapolating distributional ranges from one region to another.

AB Birdsong is a sexually selected and culturally transmitted multidimensional signal. Sexually selected traits are generally assumed to indicate condition. In oscine songbirds, song is learned early in life. The developmental stress hypothesis proposed that poor early developmental condition can adversely affect song learning. The quality and accuracy of learned song features could thus indicate male quality to conspecifics. Surprisingly, studies testing this hypothesis to date mostly compared adult males' song repertoires without looking at song imitation. The few that did reported inconsistent effects and analyzed a limited number of song features. Here, we examined the effects of early condition (by brood size manipulation) on learned song in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in comparing both the number of specific elements copied from an adult song tutor and a great number of previously neglected syntax-, complexity-, and performance-related song features. The treatment did not significantly affect average number of imitated elements, the standard measure of quality of song imitation in this species. However, developmental condition had 2 significant main effects on adult song: birds from large broods (i.e., of poor early condition) in comparison to birds from small broods copied syntactical dependencies of song elements from the song motif of their tutor less accurately and had less consistent sound duration between song motifs. These findings support the developmental stress hypothesis. We discuss how this sheds light on the potential role of such long-term signals of male developmental condition in female mate choice and potential constraints underlying condition-dependent expression of song features.

AB This paper addresses the factors that constrain the assembly of earthworm communities in temperate land use systems. An occurrence matrix containing 44 localities and 20 species was build from data sets of different studies carried out in Haute Normandie (France). The whole data set included species lists from the three main landscape units and from a range of land use types from unmanaged forests and grasslands to intensive pastures and annual crops. We used species pool, multivariate (correspondence analysis) and null model analyse to explore how species occurring in a given community are sorted from the regional species pool. Special attention was paid to identifying non-randomness in co-occurrence and morpho-ecological patterns and to describing community patterns in response to habitat constraints. Twenty species of Lumbricidae were identified in the total species pool. We found no significant effect of landscape units on species richness and density, while land use type had a significant impact on both variables, with the lowest values in crops and forests, and the highest values in grasslands. Correspondence analysis highlighted how broad land use types, soil gradients and land use intensity influence patterns of community composition and ecological coherence. Non-random patterns in guild proportion were found in a few situations, with differences between grasslands and forests. This shows that environmental filters select species at specific scales according to particular ecological traits, resulting in a convergence of these traits between species of a given community. Local species richness never exceeded nine species and species co-occurrence was significantly lower than expected by chance and much lower than described in the literature for other taxa. Although no significant patterns of limiting similarity were observed at the scale of our study, we conclude that earthworm communities are also highly structured by competition. Our study thus agrees with the idea that both habitat and competitive constraints operate simultaneously to determine how community assembly takes place. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A growing body of literature offers a framework for understanding geographic and ecological distributions of species; a few applications of this framework have treated disease transmission systems and their geography. The general framework focuses on interactions among abiotic requirements, biotic constraints, and dispersal abilities of species as determinants of distributional areas. Disease transmission systems have key differences from other sorts of biological phenomena: Interactions among species are particularly important, interactions may be stable or unstable, abiotic conditions may be relatively less important in shaping disease distributions, and dispersal abilities may be quite variable. The ways in which these differences may influence disease transmission geography are complex; I illustrate their effects by means of worked examples regarding West Nile Virus, plague, filoviruses, and yellow fever.

AB Many avian species are negatively impacted by urbanization, but other species survive and prosper in urbanized areas. One factor potentially contributing to the success of some species in urban areas is the reduced presence of predators or parasite vectors in urban compared to rural areas. In addition, urban areas may provide increased food and water resources, which can enhance immune capacity to resist infection and the ability to eliminate parasites. We determined patterns of blood parasitism, body condition, and immune cell profiles in urban and rural populations of five adult male songbird species that vary in their relative abundance within urban areas. Urban birds generally exhibited less blood parasitism than rural birds. This difference was particularly evident for the urban-adaptable Abert's towhee Pipilo aberti. In contrast, no difference in haemoparasitism was seen between urban and rural populations of the curve-billed thrasher Toxostoma curvirostre, a less-urban adaptable species. In two closely related species, the curve-billed thrasher and the northern mockingbird Mimus polyglottos, urban birds had a higher leukocyte count and a higher heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, which is often associated with chronic stress or current infection, than rural birds. Urban northern mockingbirds were in better condition than rural counterparts, but no habitat-related differences in condition were detected for other species. Parasitic infection was correlated with body condition in only one species, the canyon towhee Pipilo fuscus. Parasitic infection in most species was correlated with changes in leukocyte abundance and profile. The findings suggest that interspecific differences in parasitic infection cannot be attributed entirely to differences in vector abundance or body condition. Interactions between immune function, parasite infection risk, and resource availability may contribute to determining the relative ability of certain species to adapt to cities.

AB Studies of the effects of habitat fragmentation have been heavily biased toward population and community questions, with less attention on the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on individual behaviour and reproduction. We studied the effects of habitat amount and configuration on the foraging behaviour, provisioning rates and physiological condition of breeding male northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) nesting in the fragmented aspen parkland of central Alberta, Canada. We then examined the relationship between provisioning behaviour and both reproductive success, and juvenile physiological condition. Males nesting in areas with little forest cover and large inter-patch distances spent more time perching, maintained smaller home ranges, and provisioned their nests less frequently. However, home range size and provisioning rates levelled off in landscapes with moderate to high forest cover. Male owls breeding in areas with low forest cover, and those raising large broods, also exhibited higher levels of chronic stress, as measured by heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratios. Predictably, males that provisioned the nest less often fledged fewer young, which, in turn, exhibited higher variation in physiological condition. These results suggest that low levels of habitat loss and fragmentation may be beneficial to saw-whet owls, potentially by increasing prey abundance. However, high levels of habitat loss and fragmentation appeared to reduce the foraging efficiency of male saw-whet owls, increase their levels of physiological stress, and reduce their reproductive success. Increasing habitat loss and fragmentation may ultimately decrease population sizes of saw whet owls in this area and other species that are similarly affected by changes to in habitat composition or configuration.

AB The evolutionary history of plants in the southeast Tibetan Plateau might be the most complicated around the world because of the area's extremely complex topography and climate induced by strong tectonic activity in recent history. In this research, we implemented a phylogeographical study using chloroplast sequences (psbA-trnH and trnQ-rps16 intergenic spacer) on Dipentodon, a monotypic or ditypic genus (D. sinicus and D. longipedicellatus) distributed in southwest China and adjacent areas including Myanmar (Burma), northeast India and northern Vietnam. A total of 257 samples from 16 populations from the southeast Tibetan Plateau (D. longipedicellatus) and the Yungui Plateau (D. sinicus) were collected. The results revealed that Dipentodon had 11 haplotypes for the two intergenic spacers, high genetic diversity (h(T) = 0.902) and high genetic differentiation (N-ST = 0.987 and G(ST) = 0.948). AMOVA analysis showed that the component of among-population within region/species (55.25%) was unexpectedly larger than the among-species/region component (43.69%), which indicates that there is no justification for recognizing two species in Dipentodon. Correlation of pairwise genetic and geographical distances showed that Dipentodon populations in the southeast Tibetan Plateau may have suffered more habitat fragmentation than populations in the Yungui Plateau because of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau than populations in the Yungui Plateau have. Nested clade analysis showed that 11 haplotypes formed two 3-level, three 2-level and seven 1-level clades, with eight clades showing significant geographical association. However, clade 2-1 and 2-2 did not cluster together, although they are distributed in the same region (Yungui Plateau) and belong to the same species (D. sinicus). This led not only to incongruence between haplotype network and geographical distribution of 2-level clades, but also to paraphyly of D. sinicus to D. longipedicellatus. We concluded that the incongruence and paraphyly may result from incomplete lineage sorting during the rapid and extreme tectonic events of the Tibetan Plateau. The results reported here will no doubt provide new insights into the evolution of biodiversity on the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas, and a historical framework for the conservation of biodiversity in this area, including Dipentodon.

AB Salmonids like rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout Salmo trutta are potent invaders in various regions throughout the world, but non-native rainbow trout have become established in only a few locations in the U.K. to date. Salmonid invasions in other regions are often driven by repeated authorized introductions of large numbers of fish, escapees from fish culture and illegal introductions by anglers. Their spread can be rapid within catchments via long-distance movements. Currently, large numbers of all-female diploid rainbow trout are released in the U.K., the eggs of which could be fertilized by relatively few mature males, thereby increasing the risk of invasion. If reproducing fish began to spread, especially by anadromy, then eradication could be difficult due to angler interest and logistical constraints. Establishment of non-native salmonids can be limited by abiotic factors such as flow and temperature regimes, and biotic resistance from competition, predation and parasites or diseases, which often affect early life stages most strongly. Moreover, these factors can also interact with the zoogeography and evolutionary history of the native and introduced salmonids to make explanation and prediction complex. Although flow and temperature regimes in the U.K. are broadly suitable for rainbow trout, and biotic resistance by brown trout has been overcome in other regions, resistance from native diseases and angling mortality appear to be plausible hypotheses for lack of rainbow trout invasion in the U.K. Invading salmonids can have both direct effects on native salmonids and other fishes via biotic interactions, and indirect effects by fragmenting their habitat and isolating native populations. In addition, invaders can have indirect effects on entire aquatic food webs (e.g. invertebrates and algae) that cascade throughout ecosystems, or even cross boundaries into adjacent ecosystems. Evidence from other regions indicates that rainbow trout could have negative effects on brown trout or Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in U.K. waters, but this probably depends on the context set by other factors. Overall, primary factors to consider in any risk analysis of rainbow trout invasion in the U.K. include the decline of native salmonid populations due to degradation or overexploitation, the evolutionary history of newly introduced rainbow trout stocks, local or global influences that change aquatic environments and reduce biotic resistance by native parasites or diseases, and rapid. evolution of local adaptations by new or marginally established populations of rainbow trout that makes them more invasive.

AB Parallel speciation can occur when traits determining reproductive isolation evolve independently in different populations that experience a similar range of environments. However, a common problem in studies of parallel evolution is to distinguish this hypothesis from an alternative one in which different ecotypes arose only once in allopatry and now share a sympatric scenario with substantial gene flow between them. Here we show that the combination of a phylogenetic approach with life-history data is able to disentangle both hypotheses in the case of the intertidal marine snail Littorina saxatilis on the rocky shores of Galicia in northwestern Spain. In this system, numerous phenotypic and genetic differences have evolved between two sympatric ecotypes spanning a sharp ecological gradient, and as aside effect of the former have produced partial reproductive isolation. A mitochondrial phylogeny of these populations strongly suggests that the two sympatric ecotypes have originated independently several times. Building upon earlier work demonstrating size-based assortative mating as the main contributor to reproductive isolation among ecotypes, our analysis provides strong evidence that divergent selection across a sharp ecological gradient promoted the parallel divergence of body size and shape between two sympatric ecotypes. Thus, divergent selection occurring independently in different populations has produced the marine equivalent of host races, which may represent the first step in speciation.

AB The primary goals of marine reserves include protecting biodiversity and ecosystem structure. Therefore, a multispecies approach to designing and monitoring reserve networks is necessary. To gain insight into how the interactions between species in marine communities may affect reserve design, we synthesize marine reserve community models and community models with habitat destruction and fragmentation, and we develop new extensions of existing models. This synthesis highlights the potential for species interactions to alter reserve design criteria; in particular, accounting for species interactions often leads to an increase in reserve size necessary to protect populations. Accounting for species interactions also indicates the need to base reserve design and monitoring on a variety of species, especially long-distance dispersers, inferior colonizers, and specialists. Finally, the new model extensions highlight how, given dispersal, source populations outside reserves as well as increases in fished populations after reserve establishment may negatively affect reserve populations of competitors or prey. Therefore, multispecies harvest dynamics outside reserves and before reserve establishment are critical to determining the appropriate reserve size, spacing, and expectations after establishment. These models highlight the importance of species interactions to reserve design and provide guidelines for how this complexity can begin to be incorporated into conservation planning.

AB Snakes are sold in many markets and religious article stores in Brazil. Besides their use as food, snakes are exploited in a variety of ways, such as pets, or for use in traditional medicine and magic/religious rituals (especially in Afro-Brazilian religions). Despite widespread commercialization, there is a general lack of information about this snake trade, which makes it difficult to evaluate its magnitude and its impact on reptile populations. This work documents the commercialization and use of snakes in five cities in Northeastern (Sao Luis, Teresina, Joao Pessoa and Campina Grande) and Northern (Belem) Brazil, through interviews with 119 merchants of biological products in outdoor markets and religious articles stores. The data was gathered through the use of semi-structured questionnaires, complemented by semi-directed interviews. The products derived from 11 snake species were being commercialized for medicinal or magical/religious purposes. Boa constrictor, Crotalus durissus and Eunectes murinus were the species most commonly sold. The economic importance of snakes as sources of medicines and religious products demonstrates the need for the development of sustainable use programs for these species.

AB Green gross domestic product (green GDP) is meant to account for nature's value on an equal footing with the market economy. Several problems bedevil green GDP, however. One is that nature does not come prepackaged in units like cars, houses, and bread. Even worse, green GDP requires measurement of the benefits arising from public goods provided by nature for which there are no market indicators of value. So what should green GDP count? That is the subject of this paper. Ecological and economic theories are used to describe what should be counted-and what should not-if green GDP is to account for the nonmarket benefits of nature.

   LARGE-APERTURE; WATER-VAPOR; AIRCRAFT; TOWER; SOIL; EVAPORATION
AB A number of recent intensive and extended field campaigns have been devoted to the collection of land-surface fluxes from a variety of platforms, with the purpose of inferring the long-term C, water, and energy budgets across large areas (watershed, continental, or global scales). One approach to flux upscaling is to use land-atmosphere transfer schemes (LATS) linked to remotely sensed boundary conditions as an intermediary between the sensor footprint and regional scales. In this capacity, we examined the utility of a multiscale LATS framework that uses thermal, visible and near infrared remote sensing imagery from multiple satellites to partition surface temperature and fluxes between the soil and canopy. We conducted exercises using tower and aircraft flux data collected at three experiment sites in Oklahoma and Iowa, each with a different configuration of instrumentation. Combined, the two flux-monitoring systems were found to be complementary: the towers provided high-spatial-resolution, time-continuous validation at discrete points within the modeling domain, while with the aircraft data it could be confirmed that the model was reproducing broad spatial patterns observed at specific moments in time. High-resolution flux maps created with the LATS allowed evaluation of differences in footprint associated with turbulent, radiative, and conductive flux sensors, which may be contributing to energy budget closure problems observed with eddy correlation systems. The ability to map fluxes at multiple resolutions (1 m-10 km) with a common model framework is beneficial in providing spatial context to an experiment by bracketing the scale of interest. Multiscale flux maps can also assist in the experimental design stage, in a priori assessments of sensor representativeness in complex landscapes.

AB Three small populations of a dwarf ecotype of the forest tree Eucalyptus globulus are found on exposed granite headlands in south-eastern Australia. These populations are separated by at least 100 km.
   Here, we used 12 nuclear microsatellites and a chloroplast DNA marker to investigate the genetic affinities of the dwarf populations to one another and to their nearest populations of tall E. globulus. Cape Tourville was studied in greater detail to assess the processes enabling the maintenance of distinct ecotypes in close geographical proximity.
   The three dwarf populations were not related to one another and were more closely related to adjacent tall trees than to one another. At Cape Tourville the dwarf and tall ecotypes were significantly differentiated in microsatellites and in chloroplast DNA. The dwarf and tall populations differed in flowering time and no evidence of pollen dispersal from the more extensive tall to the dwarf population was found.
   The three dwarf populations have evolved in parallel from the local tall ecotypes. This study shows that small marginal populations of eucalypts are capable of developing reproductive isolation from nearby larger populations through differences in flowering time and/or minor spatial separation, making parapatric speciation possible.

AB It was predicted that relationships of leaf mass per area (LMA) with juvenile shade tolerance will depend on leaf habit, and on whether species are compared at a common age as young seedlings, or at a common size as saplings. A meta-analysis of 47 comparative studies (372 species) was used to test predictions, and the effect of light environment on this relationship. The LMA of evergreens was positively correlated with shade tolerance, irrespective of ontogeny or light environment. The LMA of young seedlings (<= 1 yr) of deciduous species in low light was also positively correlated with shade tolerance; more weakly so in high light. By contrast, size-specific comparisons of deciduous saplings gave negative correlations of LMA with shade tolerance. Independent contrasts and cross-species analyses yielded broadly similar results. We conclude that ontogeny strongly influences the relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous trees, but has little impact on that of evergreens. Size-specific comparisons reveal opposing trends in deciduous and evergreen taxa: the negative relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous species is probably dominated by interspecific differences in palisade thickness, whereas patterns in evergreens are probably shaped more by the degree of structural reinforcement, linked to wide variation in leaf lifespan.

AB Every species occupies a limited geographic area, but how spatiotemporal environmental variation affects individual and population fitness to create range limits is not well understood. Because range boundaries arise where, on average, populations are more likely to go extinct than to persist, range limits are an inherently population-level problem for which a demographic framework is useful. In this study, I compare demographic parameters and population dynamics between central and marginal populations of monkey flowers, Mimulus cardinalis and M. lewisii, along an elevation gradient spanning both species' ranges. Central and marginal populations of both species differed in survival and fecundity. For M. lewisii, these components of fitness were higher in central than in marginal populations, but for M. cardinalis the converse was true. To assess spatiotemporal variation in population dynamics, I used transition matrix models to estimate asymptotic population growth rates ( lambda) and found that population growth rates of M. lewisii were highest at the range center and reduced at the range margin. Population growth rates of M. cardinalis were highest at the range margin and greatly reduced at the range center. Life table response analysis decomposed spatiotemporal variation in lambda into contributions from each transition between life stages, finding that transitions from large nonreproductive and reproductive plants to the seed class and stasis in the reproductive class made the largest contributions to spatial differences in lambda. These transitions had only low to moderate sensitivities, indicating that differences in projected population growth rates resulted mainly from observed differences in transition matrix parameters and their underlying vital rates.

AB This paper explores the relationship between resilience and globalization. We are concerned, most importantly, with whether resilience is a suitable conceptual framework for natural resource management in the context of the rapid changes and disruptions that globalization causes in social-ecological systems. Although theoretical in scope, we ground this analysis using our experiences in two Asian coastal areas: Junagadh District in Gujarat State, India and Banawa Selatan, in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. We present the histories of resource exploitation in the two areas, and we attempt to combine a resilience perspective with close attention to the impact of globalization. Our efforts serve as a basis from which to examine the conceptual and practical compatibility of resilience with globalization. The first challenge we address is epistemological: given that resilience and globalization have roots in different disciplines, do they share a sufficiently common perception of change and human action to be compatible? Second, we address the issue of how resilience can be a viable management objective in the rapidly changing context of globalization. We identify scale as particularly important in this regard.

AB Colonization of a novel environment is expected to result in adaptive divergence from the ancestral population when selection favors a new phenotypic optimum. Local adaptation in the new environment Occurs through the accumulation and integration of character states that positively affect fitness. The role played by plastic traits in adaptation to a novel environment has generally been ignored, except for variable environments. We propose that if conditions in a relatively stable but novel environment induce phenotypically plastic responses in many traits, and if genetic variation exists in the form of those responses, then selection may initially favor the accumulation and integration of functionally useful plastic responses. Early divergence between ancestral and colonist forms will then Occur with respect to their plastic responses across the gradient bounded by ancestral and novel environmental conditions. To test this, we compared the magnitude, integration, and pattern of plastic character responses in external body form induced by shallow versus open water conditions between two sunfish ecomorphs that coexist in four postglacial lakes. The novel sunfish ecomorph is present in the deeper open water habitat, whereas the ancestral ecomorph inhabits the shallow waters along the lake margin. Plastic responses by open water ecomorphs were more correlated than those of their local shallow water ecomorph in two of the populations, whereas equal levels of correlated plastic character responses Occurred between ecomorphs in the other two populations. Small but persistent differences occurred between ecomorph pairs in the pattern of their character responses, Suggesting a recent divergence. Open water ecomorphs shared some similarities in the covariance among plastic responses to rearing environment. Replication in the form of correlated plastic responses among populations of open water ecomorphs suggests that plastic character states may evolve under selection. Variation between ecomorphs and among lake populations in the covariance of plastic responses suggests the presence of genetic variation in plastic character responses. In three Populations, open water ecomorphs also exhibited larger plastic responses to the environmental gradient than the local shallow water ecomorph. This could account for the greater integration of plastic responses in open water ecomorplis in two of the populations. This suggests that the plastic responses of local sunfish ecomorphs can diverge through changes in the magnitude and coordination of plastic responses. Although these results require further investigation, they suggest that early adaptive evolution in a novel environment can include changes to plastic character states. The genetic assimilation of coordinated plastic responses could result in the further, and possibly rapid, divergence of such populations and could also account for the evolution of genes of major effect that contribute to suites of phenotypic differences between divergent populations.

AB Corridors may mitigate the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation by restoring or maintaining connectivity between disjunct populations. The efficacy of corridors for large carnivores, however, has rarely been evaluated objectively. We used noninvasive sampling, microsatellite analysis, and population assignment tests to evaluate the effectiveness of a regional corridor in connecting two Florida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus) populations (Osceola and Ocala). Bear movement was predominantly unidirectional, with a limited mixing of individuals from the two populations in one area of the corridor. We also documented bears in Osceola that were genetically assigned to Ocala and bears in Osceola that may be offspring from an Osceola-Ocala mating. Our results indicate that the Osceola-Ocala corridor is functional and provides a conduit for gene flow between these populations. Human development, however, may binder the use of the Osceola-Ocala corridor by bears. The noninvasive sampling and genetic methods we used provide a means of evaluating corridor effectiveness that can help identify linkages necessary for maintaining metapopulation structure and population viability.

AB The genus Boechera is a widespread North American group with great potential for studies of ecology and evolution: Boechera is closely related to Arabidopsis and exhibits different ecological and reproductive strategies. Boechera stricta (previously Arabis drummondii) is a morphologically and genetically well-defined, perennial crucifer species. Fifteen natural populations of diploid individuals from the Rocky Mountains were analysed using 21 microsatellite loci. In accordance with our expectation for this predominately inbreeding species, a high F-IS value (0.89) was observed. Furthermore, populations of B. stricta were highly differentiated, as indicated by F-ST = 0.56. Three clusters were identified using STRUCTURE-the majority of populations belonged to either the Northern or Southern cluster. Together, the north-south partitioning and evenness of genetic variation across the two clusters suggested multiple refugia for this perennial herb in the Rocky Mountains. Pleistocene glaciation, together with the topographically and climatologically heterogeneous cordillera, has profoundly influenced the genetic architecture of B. stricta. Genetic population structure was also influenced by relatively recent genome admixture at two levels: within species (involving individuals from the Northern and Southern clusters) and between species (with the hybridization of B. stricta and Boechera holboellii). This complexity of population structure at presumably neutral microsatellite loci located throughout the genome in B. stricta provides a baseline against which to test whether functional genetic variation is undergoing local adaptive evolution throughout the natural species range.

AB Degradation of nesting habitat has been proposed as a factor contributing to Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) population declines throughout North America. Delineating suitable nesting habitat across landscapes with relatively contiguous sagebrush cover is difficult but important to identify areas for protection. We used radiotelemetry to locate Greater Sage-Grouse nests in relatively contiguous sagebrush habitats in Wyoming to investigate the spatial arrangement of nests relative to lek and other nest locations. Nest distributions were spatially related to lek location within 3 and 5 km of a lek, and a 5-km buffer included 64% of the nests. There was no relationship between lek size and lek-to-nest distance, suggesting that accurate population trend evaluation might require lek surveys in addition to lek counts. Closest known lek-to-nest distance was greater for successfully hatched compared to destroyed nests, and closely spaced nests tended to experience lower success and have higher probabilities of both nests experiencing the same fate compared to isolated nests, suggesting that a mechanism of enhanced prey detection occurred at higher nest densities. A low probability that a given individual's consecutive-year nest spacing occurred randomly suggested nesting site-area fidelity. Although a grouped pattern of nests occurred within 5 km of a lek, the proportion of nesting females located farther than 5 km could be important for population viability. Managers should limit strategies that negatively influence nesting habitat regardless of lek locations, and preserve adequate amounts of unaltered nesting habitat within treatment boundaries to maintain nest dispersion and provide sites for philopatric individuals.

AB Recent studies have shown that anguillid eel populations in habitats spanning the marine-freshwater ecotone can display extreme plasticity in the range of catadromy expressed by individual fishes. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis was used to differentiate between European eels (Anguilla anguilla) collected along a short (2 km) salinity gradient ranging from < 1 parts per thousand to similar to 30 parts per thousand in Lough Ahalia, a tidal Atlantic lake system. Significant differences were recorded in mean delta C-13, delta N-15 and C:N values from eels collected from fresh, brackish and marine-dominated basins. A discriminant analysis using these predictor variables correctly classified ca. 85% of eels to salinity zone, allowing eels to be classified as freshwater (FW), brackish (BW) or marine (MW) residents. The results of the discriminant analysis also suggested that a significant proportion of eels moved between habitats (especially between FW and BW). Comparisons of several key population parameters showed significant variation between eels resident in different salinity zones. Mean condition and estimated age was significantly lower in MW eels, whilst observed length at age (a correlate of growth) was significantly higher in MW eels, intermediate in BW and lowest in FW eels. This study has demonstrated that the ecology of eels found along a short salinity gradient can be extremely plastic and that stable isotope analysis has considerable utility in demonstrating intra-population variation in diadromous fishes.

AB 1 A mutualism is a mutually beneficial interaction between individuals of two species. Here we show that the degree of benefit resulting from an interaction depends on whether adaptation within the mutualism is considered.
   2 A species'proximate response measures the short-term effect of addition or removal of the partner species, without allowing for any adaptation. We define a proximate mutualism as an interaction in which removal of each partner results in a decreased performance of the other, i.e. both species show a positive proximate response to the presence of the partner.
   3 A proximate mutualism might, however, only reflect evolved dependence (i.e. the species has lost its ability to perform well without the partner). Some authors therefore insist on an ultimate criterion, regardless of the use of proximate responses in almost all empirical studies.
   4 A species'ultimate response measures the long-term effect of adding or removing the partner species, thus allowing the focal species to adapt. In an ultimate mutualism neither partner could ever have performed as well without the other. In other words, a mutualism is called ultimate if both species show a positive ultimate response to the presence of the partner. Despite the conceptual attractiveness of this definition, ultimate responses are difficult to measure, rendering its use operationally problematic.
   5 Mutualistic evolution, the evolution of a trait that is costly to the bearer but beneficial to its partner, is not, paradoxically, a necessary consequence of either proximate or ultimate mutualism. Another counterintuitive result is that even obligate mutualisms are not necessarily ultimate interactions.
   6 We conclude that the proximate response is the only workable criterion for mutualism. Our understanding of mutualism, however, requires further evaluation of how evolved dependence may be responsible for such responses.
   7 These concepts clarify the ongoing debate about whether plant-herbivore interactions can be considered as mutualistic.
   8 This is not a semantic case of hair splitting: naive aspects in current views of mutualism need revision. In most, if not all, interactions now considered as mutualisms, some of the measured benefits are likely to result from evolved dependence, rather than what we would like to consider as ultimate benefits.

AB Intraspecific phylogeographical patterns largely depend on the life history traits of a species. Especially species with a high degree of cold tolerance, limited requirements towards habitat preferences, and relatively low active dispersal capacities may have responded in a different way to the Pleistocene climatological fluctuations than the majority of taxa studied so far. To evaluate this possibility, we studied Arion fuscus (Muller, 1774), a common and widespread European terrestrial slug, from 88 locations (N = 964). Sequence variation was assessed for fragments of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and COI genes by means of single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) and subsequent DNA sequencing. Additionally, eight allozyme loci were scored in 843 individuals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two major evolutionary lineages, one in the Balkan region and another in the Alps and the rest of Europe. The sequence divergence between the two lineages was limited (3.3%), but gene flow between the regions was absent, suggesting that the two regions have been isolated since the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene. Allozyme differentiation among geographical regions and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages was low. The geographical patterns observed in our data showed that (i) haplotype and nucleotide diversities are very low in northern Europe, suggesting that single haplotypes rapidly colonized large areas; (ii) recently expanded haplotype clades have restricted distribution ranges, suggesting that current gene flow is low; and (iii) genetic diversity in the Alps is much higher than in other regions and estimated past gene flow from the Eastern Alps to other regions was high, suggesting that this was a refugial zone during the Pleistocene. This full-range phylogeography suggests the existence of an alternative refugial zone, situated north of the refugial areas currently recognized in most other taxa.

AB We investigated factors influencing fish abundance and emigration across the boundaries of a no-take zone (NTZ), and its adjacent fished zones, within the Nabq Managed Resource Protected Area, South Sinai, Egyptian Red Sea. Underwater visual census of eight families of reef fish was undertaken at three depths across the whole NTZ (1.2 km), and for a similar distance into the adjacent fished zones. Because most fishing occurs in shallow water, the effect of the NTZ changed with depth. On reef flat transects (1 m depth), seven families showed significantly higher abundance in the NTZ, whereas at 10 m depth only two herbivorous families, Acanthuridae (surgeonfishes) and Siganidae (rabbitfishes) showed a significant difference, both being more abundant in the fished zones, an effect most likely due to reduced competition or predation. To look for evidence of emigration (spillover) of fish from the NTZ, data were also tested for evidence of gradients in abundance extending from within the NTZ to within the fished zones. In shallow water six families showed significant declines in abundance moving away from the centre of the NTZ, whereas at 10 m, the only significant gradients were for acanthurids and siganids, both becoming more abundant moving further into the fished zones. Comparisons of estimated fish length between areas also showed significant differences. The results indicate that at Nabq, while fishing reduces the abundance of most families, especially predators, abundance of some families and species, especially herbivores, may increase under light fishing pressure. Thus, spillover may occur to an extent and in a direction depending on trophic group and fishing intensity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Analysing invasive spread from a landscape ecological perspective forms an important challenge in plant invasion ecology. The present study examines the effects of landscape structure on the spatial and temporal dynamics of an expanding black cherry Prunus serotina population within a rural landscape in Flanders, Belgium, carrying a dense network of interconnected hedgerows. The study area, 251 ha in size, harboured a total of 2962 P serotina individuals. The population was characterised by a negative exponential age distribution, a high growth rate and an early and continuous reproduction throughout the species' life cycle. The historical rate of spread of the species through the hedgerow network progressively increased with time, especially during the last decade. Spatial point pattern analysis revealed that the individuals had a significantly clustered distribution pattern and were spatially aggregated around seed sources, hedgerow intersections and roosting trees. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the effect of landscape structure on P scrotina occurrence, suggesting directional long distance dispersal by avian dispersal vectors, resulting in a differential seed pressure throughout the hedgerow network due to the preference of dispersing birds for roosting in structurally rich hedgerow with large trees near hedgerow intersections. Hence, the distribution of P serotina in agricultural landscapes was strongly mediated by dispersal processes. Furthermore, decreasing spatial aggregation along the species life cycle, with especially seedlings and saplings being significantly aggregated while adult individuals were mostly distributed at random, and a relative outward shift of seedling recruitment curves with time indicate density dependent mortality, probably caused by intraspecific competition.

AB Recurrent glacial advances have shaped community histories across the planet. While biogeographic responses to glaciations likely varied with latitude, the consequences for temperate marine communities histories are less clear. By coalescent analyses of multiloci DNA sequence data (mitochondrial DNA control region, alpha-enolase intron, and alpha-tropomyosin intron) collected from a low-dispersing sister pair of rocky intertidal fishes commonly found from southeastern Alaska to California (Xiphister atropurpureus and X. mucosus), we uncover two very different responses to historical glaciations. A variety of methods that include a simulation analysis, coestimates of migration and divergence times, and estimates of minimum ages of populations sampled up and down the North American Pacific coast all strongly revealed a history of range persistence in X. atropurpureus and extreme range contraction and expansion from a southern refugium in X. mucosus. Furthermore, these conclusions are not sensitive to the independent estimates of the DNA substitution rates we obtain. While gene flow and dispersal are low in both species, the widely different histories are rather likely to have arisen from ecological differences such as diet breadth, generation time, and habitat specificity.

AB Conifers are the most widely distributed group of gymnosperms in the world. They have large genome size (1C-value) compared with most animal and plant species. The genome size ranges from similar to 6,500 Mb to similar to 37,000 Mb in conifers. How and why conifers have evolved such large genomes is not understood. The conifer genome contains similar to 75% highly repetitive DNA. Most of the repetitive DNA is composed of non-coding DNA, including ubiquitous transposable elements. Conifers have relatively larger rDNA repeat units, larger gene families generated by gene duplications, larger nuclear volume, and perhaps larger genes, as compared to angiosperm plants. These genomic components may partially account for the large genome size, as well as variation in genome size, in conifers. One of the major mechanisms for genome size expansion and evolution of species is polyploidy, which is widespread in angiosperms, but it is rare in conifers. There are only a few natural polyploids in one family of conifers, Cupressaceae. Other conifers, including well-studied pines, are nearly all diploids. Whether ancient polyploidy has played a role in the evolution of genome size in conifers still remains an open question. The mechanisms that account for the variation and evolution of genome size in conifers are addressed in this review.

AB Several hypotheses attempt to explain the latitudinal gradient of species diversity, but some basic aspects of the pattern remain insufficiently explored, including the effect of scales and the role of beta diversity. To explore such components of the latitudinal gradient, we tested the hypothesis of covariation, which states that the gradient of species diversity should show the same pattern regardless of the scale of analysis. The hypothesis implies that there should be no gradients of beta diversity, of regional range size within regions, and of the slope of the species-area curve. For the fauna of North American mammals, we found contrasting results for bats and non-volant species. We could reject the hypothesis of covariation for non-volant mammals, for which the number of species increases towards lower latitudes, but at different rates depending on the scale. Also, for this group, beta diversity is higher at lower latitudes, the regional range size within regions is smaller at lower latitudes, and z, the slope of the species-area relationship is higher at lower latitudes. Contrarily bats did not show significant deviations from the predictions of the hypothesis of covariation: at two different scales, species richness shows similar trends of increase at lower latitudes, and no gradient can be demonstrated for beta diversity, for regional range size, or for the slopes of the species-area curve. Our results show that the higher diversity of non-volant mammals in tropical areas of North America is a consequence of the increase in beta diversity and not of higher diversity at smaller scales. In contrast, the diversity of bats at both scales is higher at lower latitudes. These contrasting patterns suggest different causes for the latitudinal gradient of species diversity in the two groups that are ultimately determined by differences in the patterns of geographic distribution of the species.

AB In the last decade, greater than expected levels of genetic structure have been reported for many marine taxa with high dispersal capabilities. Although little-studied to date, it is predicted that taxa with poor dispersal abilities would exhibit even more genetic differentiation than high dispersal taxa. These systems may track biogeographical processes better than more dispersive taxa and, more critically, function as the 'lowest common denominators' in MPA design initiatives. We investigate phylogeographical patterns in the poorly dispersing, yet widely distributed Patelloida profunda group and related congeners across the Indo-west Pacific region. One hundred and twenty-five individuals were sequenced for COI mtDNA [593 base pairs (bp)] and 44 individuals were sequenced for 16S mtDNA (539 bp). Identified P. profunda group lineages are highly geographically structured, with 12 reciprocally monophyletic lineages reported from 13 localities. Divergences within Indian and Pacific basins range from d = 0.013 to 0.127 and between basins from d = 0.147 to 0.197. The latter split is ancient (> 15 Myr) and cannot be related to Plio-Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, characteristic of previously reported divergences in the same region. Juxtaposed against this structure is genetic connectivity between two widely separated P. profunda populations that share a common haplotype (phi(ST) = 0.001). This finding contrasts with previous work in the same geographical region and cautions strongly against single taxon indicators for designing conservation priorities or marine protected areas (MPAs). Historical and/or biological factors may play more significant roles than oceanography alone in determining the genetic structuring of taxa. In light of these findings, we discuss the difficulty in deriving biogeographical process or directionality from phylogenetic trees in dispersal-driven systems. Even with a well-resolved, highly supported topology, many equally parsimonious scenarios are possible.

AB Phylogeographical studies are emerging as a powerful tool for understanding the population structure and evolution of wild relatives of crop species. Because of their value as genetic resources, there is great interest in exploring the distribution of variation in wild relatives of cultivated plants. In this study, we use sequence variation from the nuclear gene, fruit vacuolar invertase (Vac), to investigate the population history of Solanum pimpinellifolium. Solanum pimpinellifolium is a close relative of the cultivated tomato and has repeatedly served as a source of valuable traits for crop improvement. We sequenced the second intron of the Vac gene in 129 individuals, representing 16 populations from the northern half of Peru. Patterns of haplotype sharing among populations indicate that there is isolation by distance. However, there is no congruence between the geographical distribution of haplotypes and their genealogical relationships. Levels of outcrossing decrease towards the southernmost populations, as previously observed in an allozyme study. The geographical pattern of Vac variation supports a centre of origin in northern Peru for S. pimpinellifolium and a gradual colonization along the Pacific coast. This implies that inbreeding populations are derived from outcrossing ones and that variation present at the Vac locus predates the spread of S. pimpinellifolium. The expansion of cities and human agricultural activity in the habitat of S. pimpinellifolium currently pose a threat to the species.

AB Ecological features of Lake Myvatn and the outflowing River Laxa show a wide range of spatial and temporal variations. The physical division of the lake into three main basins and the variation in chemical composition and temperature of the artesian springs feeding this shallow productive lake have large spatial effects. Variation in groundwater characteristics depends on percolation time and proximity to geothermal sources. Variation in precipitation is evened out by the porous volcanic soil and bedrock and the spring-water discharge is therefore very stable. A pulse of volcanic activity in 1975-1984 ( the Krafla Fires) heated the groundwater entering the North Basin of the lake and changed its chemistry. Although much reduced, these effects have not disappeared yet, but overall the impact of the volcanic activity on the biota seemed minimal. Recycling of nutrients through internal loading is important and occurs on various time scales. In winter, when the lake is ice-covered, the topmost 5-cm layer of sediment pore water has a hundredfold concentration of nutrients relative to the overlying lake water. The nutrients are released during the ice-free period by sediment resuspension, diffusion, bioturbation and recycling. In spring, resuspension events sometimes lead to spikes in dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen, but there is little evidence of any major desorption of nutrients from suspended particles during such events later in the summer. In contrast to the stable groundwater, the biota show more or less regular fluctuations with no straightforward correlation with external signals. The most prominent fluctuations, those of the chironomid Tanytarsus gracilentus seem to be driven by interactions between the species and its sediment resources. Fluctuations in other invertebrates could be a consequence of the Tanytarsus cycles due to the large impact this species has on the benthic environment of this detritus-driven ecosystem. Temporal variation in epibenthic chironomids and Cladocera translates into variable production of vertebrate predators (Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, and ducks), body condition and mortality of fish and sometimes into return rates of migrating adult ducks. The waterfowl show large temporal variation on a centennial scale, e. g., the invasion of the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) which arrived by the end of the 19th century and has by now outnumbered other species. Fluctuations of Cyanobacteria ( Anabaena) and the fish Gasterosteus aculeatus ( three-spined stickleback) harmonize with the cycles in the benthic community. Palaeolimnological studies indicate that primary production in the South Basin became increasingly benthic as the lake depth was reduced by sedimentation (around 2 mm year(-1)). Other trends include a decrease in Tanytarsus and Daphnia and an exponential increase in green algae (Cladophorales, Pediastrum) and associated organisms.

AB Management and restoration of vegetation patterns in ecosystems depends on an understanding of allogenic environmental factors that organize species assemblages and autogenic processes linked to assemblages. However, our ability to make strong inferences about vegetation-environment linkages in field studies is often limited due to correlations among environmental variables, spatial autocorrelation, and scale dependency of observations. This is particularly true in large, heterogeneous ecosystems such as the Everglades. Here, an extensive canal-and-levee system has modified historical fire regimes and hydropatterns while contributing large inputs of surface-water phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and cations such as sodium (Na). Some of these anthropogenic influences have been implicated as factors leading to the shift of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) and slough communities to an assemblage of weedy species such as cattail (Typha domingensis Pers.). To untangle the independent effect of multiple variables, we used a spatially explicit, multivariate approach to identify linkages among spatial patterns, environmental factors, and vegetation composition along a 10-km gradient of anthropogenic influence in the Everglades, an area immediately downstream from canal inflow structures. Clusters of plots were stratified among three zones (Impacted, Transition, and Reference), a design that allowed us to contrast vegetation-environment linkages and spatial patterns at multiple scales and degrees of ecosystem alteration. Along the 10-km gradient, partial Mantel tests showed that nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium) and hydropattern (frequency of dryness) were independently linked to patterns in fine-scale vegetation composition, but phosphorus was the only environmental variable linked to patterns of coarse-scale composition. Regardless of scale, the effect of distance from canal inflows accounted for variation in vegetation that could not be explained by other variables. A significant residual effect of spatial proximity among sampling locations also was detected and was highly suggestive of dispersal or other spatial determinants of vegetation pattern. However, this pure spatial effect was significantly stronger in the Transition and Impacted zones than in the Reference zone-fine-scale environmental variables explained all of the spatial structure in vegetation in the Reference zone. A further examination of spatial patterns in vegetation by using Mantel correlograms revealed significant heterogeneity at fine, local scales in the Reference zone, but this pattern progressively degraded toward homogeneity among closely neighboring locations in the Impacted zone. However, the fine-scale vegetation pattern in the Reference zone was hierarchically nested at a broader scale and yielded a similar coarse pattern across the landscape, whereas the coarse pattern in the Transition and Impacted zones was relatively heterogeneous and fragmented. Collectively, these results indicate that allogenic spatial and environmental factors related to the canal system have disrupted the coupling between pattern and process by altering fine-scale vegetation-environment linkages and spatial patterns characteristic of the natural Everglades ecosystem.

AB Detection of the genetic effects of recent habitat fragmentation in natural populations can be a difficult task, especially for high gene flow species. Previous analyses of mitochondrial DNA data from across the current range of Speyeria idalia indicated that the species exhibited high levels of gene flow among populations, with the exception of an isolated population in the eastern portion of its range. However, some populations. are found on isolated habitat patches, which were recently separated from one another by large expanses of uninhabitable terrain, in the form of row crop agriculture. The goal of this study was to compare levels of genetic differentiation and diversity among populations found in relatively continuous habitat to populations in both recently and historically isolated habitat. Four microsatellite loci were used to genotype over 300 individuals from five populations in continuous habitat, five populations in recently fragmented habitat, and one historically isolated population. Results from the historically isolated population were concordant with previous analyses and suggest significant differentiation. Also, microsatellite data were consistent with the genetic effects of habitat fragmentation for the recently isolated populations, in the form of increased differentiation and decreased genetic diversity when compared to nonfragmented populations. These results suggest that given the appropriate control populations, microsatellite markers can be used to detect the effects of recent habitat fragmentation in natural populations, even at a large geographical scale in high gene flow species.

AB 1. A functional growth analysis was used to determine the duration of strict dependency on seed reserves for energy and nitrogen in three woody Bignoniaceae species (Tabebuia rosea DC., Challichlamys latifolia K. Schum. and Pithecoctenium crucigerum A. Gentry) which differed in cotyledon function (photosynthetic, semi-photosynthetic and storage) and shade tolerance (probability of seedling establishment and survival in the understorey).
   2. Seedlings were raised from seeds in sand culture under combinations of three nitrogen levels (daily supply of nutrient solution containing 100, 10 and 0% of 2.6 mm N) and two irradiances (27 and 1% full sun). Time course of biomass, non-cotyledonous biomass and leaf area for 40 days post-germination were compared to identify when the external availability of nitrogen or light began to affect seedling growth.
   3. Seedlings of all species became dependent on external energy supply earlier than they did on nitrogen supply. In all species seed nitrogen was sufficient to support positive seedling growth for 40 days in shade, but not in sun.
   4. Tabebuia rosea with photosynthetic cotyledons responded to light availability earlier than more shade-tolerant species with storage cotyledons. Challichlamys latifolia , the most shade-tolerant species, had the highest nitrogen concentration in seeds and was the last to respond to external nitrogen availability. Thus seedlings of the most shade-tolerant species depended on seed reserves for the longest period for both energy and nitrogen.
   5. Relative growth rate after seedlings initiated autotrophic growth was in a trade-off relationship with seedling survivorship in the understorey across the three species. Tabebuia rosea , the least shade-tolerant species, had the highest positive net carbon balance in sun and shade.
   6. Functional morphology of cotyledons and concentration of seed nitrogen deserve as much attention as seed size as correlates of contrasting seedling regeneration strategies.

AB We examined the relationship between body size and perceptual range (the distance at which an animal can perceive landscape elements) for a group of forest-dwelling rodents. We used previously published data on orientation ability at various distances for three sciurid species (gray squirrel, fox squirrel and chipmunk) and one murid species (white-footed mouse) to build a predictive model. We found a significant positive relationship between perceptual range and body mass. Although this model was built using a 15.5 m high horizon, we used this relation to predict the perceptual range of root voles (3.9-4.3 m) orienting towards a 0.5 m high horizon which was consistent with other empirical work suggesting a value of something less than 5 m. This model illustrates a relationship between perceptual range and body size and can be used to develop starting points for future investigations of perceptual range for similar organisms.

AB 1 A study was carried out in oak-northern hardwood forest in NW Connecticut USA involving measurements of growth, light and soil environment of saplings of six canopy trees that are strongly associated with particular soil types as adults. The objectives were to determine patterns of growth response along soil factor gradients, and to discriminate among modes of community organization (fundamental niche differentiation, shifting competitive hierarchy or continuum concept).
   2 Relationships were found between tree species distributions and all measured soil factors (pH and exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium, aluminium, ammonium and nitrate).
   3 Growth and light data were fitted to a nested series of functions based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. For five of six species, likelihood-ratio tests indicated that functions that incorporated pH or other soil factors predicted growth better than functions based only on light availability.
   4 Species differed in the direction and strength of response to soil factors, Fraxinus americana had decreased growth on high-magnesium soils, Acer rubrum had increased growth on high-aluminium soils, Quercus rubra and Fagus grandifolia had increased growth on high-calcium soils and Tsuga canadensis had increased growth on high-nitrate soils.
   5 Growth responses were consistent with either fundamental niche differentiation and continuum concept (Acer rubrum), shifting competitive hierarchy and continuum concept (Fagus grandifolia, Quercus rubra and Tsuga canadensis) or were not consistent with any theory (Acer saccharum and Fraxinus americana).
   6 Because saplings are associated with the same soil-types as mature trees, further studies in this system should focus on earlier stages of the plant life cycle: dispersal, germination and seedling establishment.

AB The Old World dry tropical family Moringaceae is remarkable for the great diversity of habit and floral morphology found within its only genus, Moringa. To infer the phylogenetic relationships of all 13 species, parsimony analyses of morphological data and DNA sequences from a low-copy nuclear region (PEPC), a chloroplast region (trnG), and a tandemly-repeated nuclear region present in high copy number (ITS) were conducted of each data set separately and combined. Characters from studies of ontogeny substantially enhanced the resolution of the morphological data set. The Incongruence Length Difference test indicated the congruence of all data sets, as did Templeton tests comparing the single tree resulting from the combined analysis in the context of the individual data sets. This tree is presented as the preferred topology, in which the four bottle trees appear in a basal paraphyletic assemblage with the three species of slender trees (including the economically important M, oleifera) forming a clade that is sister to a clade of the six species of tuberous shrubs and trees of northeast Africa. Moringa is currently divided into three sections, but because of the basal grade, it cannot be divided into useful monophyletic infrageneric taxa. The phylogeny-based informal terms "bottle tree grade", "slender tree clade", and "tuberous clade" are suggested as alternatives. Relationships within Moringa were found to be largely congruent with a previous study of wood anatomy.

AB We compared reproductive allocation and variation in condition and survivorship of two heritable female throat color morphs (orange and yellow) in a free-living population of side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana). Using path analysis and structural equation modeling, we investigated how variation in the social environment affected clutch size and egg mass and two condition traits (postlaying mass, immunological condition) and how these traits in turn affected female field survival. In the presence of many neighbors, both morphs increased their clutch sizes, although these effects were only significant in yellow females. In addition, yellow females increased their egg mass in the presence of many orange neighbors. Orange females surrounded by many orange neighbors showed sign of stress in the form of immunosuppression, whereas this effect was less pronounced in yellow females. The morphs also differed in the impact of variation in clutch size and egg mass on both condition traits. Finally, female morphotype and immune responsiveness affected fitness interactively, and hence these two traits showed signs of fitness epistasis: Selection gradients on this trait were opposite in sign in the two morphs. The correlational selection gradient (gamma (throatxantibody) (response)) between female throat color and antibody responsiveness was -0.365. Our data thus reveal important interactive effects such as genotype-by-environment interaction toward the social environment and morph-specific trade-offs as well as the occurrence of correlational selection. We discuss the use of naturally occurring and conspicuous genetic polymorphisms in field studies of selection and life-history allocation.

AB The spatial heterogeneity of a subtidal marine landscape and the areal extent of both monospecific and mixed patches of seagrass species were studied in Tamps Bay, Florida, USA. Specifically, we examined the temporal dynamics of seagrass distribution and its relationship to water depth and the serial replacement of one species by another. The similar to 5-ha landscape was mapped at l-m intervals in the spring and fall of 1994 and 1995. The landscape consisted of monospecific and mixed patches of seagrass (47%) and bare sediment (53%). Halodule wrightii was the most abundant seagrass (similar to 74%), while Thalassia testudinum was second most common (20%), and mixed patches of H. wrightii and T. testudinum composed the remaining 6%.
   There was an overall increase in seagrass of 14% from spring 1994 to fall 1995. The majority of change occurred along the margins of existing seagrass patches (i.e., H. wrightii invading bare sediment). Typically, "new" patches were the result of the transition of one seagrass species to another (e.g., H. wrightii replacing T. testudinum). Water depth over the landscape ranged from 30 to 100 cm, and although seasonal differences in the distribution of seagrass species were detected, water depth in this landscape was not an adequate predictor of the observed distributional patterns of either seagrass species at any season.
   Temporal transitions of one seagrass species to another, or to/from bare sediment, did nor fit previously published models of seagrass succession. Instead, H. wrightii, the competitive "inferior," often replaced T. testudinum as the dominant seagrass, suggesting that factors other than competition may have a controlling influence in this landscape. We suspect that hydrodynamics (e.g., seasonal storm events) may be an organizing force in maintaining the landscape's heterogeneity.

AB The spatial distribution of plants is often thought to be an indicator of underlying biotic and abiotic processes. However, there are relatively feu examples of spatial patterns being analysed to detect an underlying ecological process. Using the spacing of savanna trees in the southern Kalahari as an example. we applied methods of computer simulation modelling and point pattern analysis in an evaluation of their potential for identifying relevant pattern generating processes from snapshot pattern. We compared real tree patterns from the southern Kalahari, derived from aerial photographs, with patterns produced from computer simulation experiments in an investigation of the following questions: does the present pattern of tree distributions allow us to characterize (1) the relative importance of the major driving forces (e.g., competition for moisture, grass fire, herbivory), (2) the spatial dimensions and structures of the underlying processes, and (3) the actual dynamic status of the ecological system (a phase of decline, increase or constancy with respect to tree abundance)?
   The simulation experiments are based on a well established, spatially explicit. grid-based model that simulates the vegetation dynamics of the major life forms under a realistic rainfall scenario of the southern Kalahari and under the impact of grass fires. herbivory and the formation of localized clumps with increased tree seed availability. For a realistic range of parameters the simulation modal produces long-term coexistence of trees and grasses with tree densities that correspond with densities observed in the field. Both real tree distributions derived from aerial photographs and tree pattern produced bq the model are characterized by a tendency towards even spacing at small scales, clumping at intermediate scales and randomness or clumping at large scales. However. increasing the spatio-temporal correlation in the formation of seed patches in the model caused an increase in the tendency towards clumping in the tree distribution whereas an increase in seed patch numbers led to a decrease in clumping. Within single simulation runs the tree pattern could change in response to the variable rainfall sequences and the corresponding differences in grass fire frequency: periods of slightly increasing tree numbers caused bq higher precipitation were characterized by an increase in tree clumping whereas periods of slightly decreasing tree numbers showed a tendency towards random or even tree spacing. Simulating the transition of an open savanna to a savanna woodland show ed that the tree pattern in the transitional phase can be diagnostic of the underlying process: If the transition was caused by improved moisture conditions the transitional phase was characterized bq increased clumping in the tree pattern. In contrast, a transition caused by an increase in the number of localized tree wed patches led to a characteristic even spacing of trees.
   Even though the simulated savanna clearly showed non-equilibrium dynamics, simulation results indicate that the tree population in the stimulated area of the southern Kalahari is in a state of long-term tree-grass coexistence with the persisting structure of an open savanna system.

AB Stem traits were analysed in laboratory-grown seedlings of 80 European woody and semiwoody species of known potential relative growth rate (RGR) and of similar ontogenetic phase. The objectives were, firstly, to assess the relation between stem structure and plant growth potential and, secondly, to explore how stem structure varies among species differing in life form and leaf habit. Hydraulic conductance was represented by the mean diameter of the widest xylem conduits (Dmax), and structural strength by the percentage of xylem tissue occupied by cell wall material (CWx) or stem tissue density (SD). Across all species RGR showed a weak positive correlation with Dmax and weak negative ones with CWx and SD, with slow-growers showing great dispersion of stem trait values. In the RGR-Dmax relationship this dispersion disappeared when trees were removed from the analysis. None of the relationships were significant among tree species alone. It was suggested that fast-growers require a xylem with wide conduits thigh (Dmax) to achieve high hydraulic conductivity, and "cheaply" constructed stems (low CWx and SD) to maximise allocation to leaves. However, the possession of such traits does not guarantee fast growth, as other factors may constrain RGR elsewhere in the plant. Deciduous seedlings showed higher Dmax and lower CWx than evergreens. Higher Dmax could reflect an innate higher tolerance of conductivity loss by freeze-induced embolism in deciduous plants, which are not burdened by the maintenance of foliage in winter. In contrast, life forms were differentiated most clearly by SD. For instance, shrub seedlings had less dense stem tissues than tree seedlings, possibly because they need less investment in long-term strength and stature.

AB Biodiversity is defined by trait differences between organisms, and biologists have long sought to predict associations among ecologically important traits. Why do some traits trade off but others are coexpressed? Why might some trait associations hold across levels of organization, from individuals and genotypes to populations and species, whereas others only occur at one level? Understanding such scaling is a core biological problem, bearing on the evolution of ecological strategies as well as forecasting responses to environmental change. Explicitly considering the hierarchy of biodiversity and expectations at each scale (individual change, evolution within and among populations, and species turnover) is necessary as we work toward a predictive framework in evolutionary ecology. Within species, a trait may have an association with another trait because of phenotypic plasticity, genetic correlation, or population-level local adaptation. Plastic responses are often adaptive and yet individuals have a fixed pool of resources; thus, positive and negative trait associations can be generated by immediate environmental needs and energetic demands. Genetic variation and covariation for traits within a population are typically shaped by varying natural selection in space and time. Although genetic correlations are infrequently long-term constraints, they may indicate competing organismal demands. Traits are often quantitatively differentiated among populations (local adaptation), although selection rarely favors qualitatively different strategies until populations become reproductively isolated. Across species, niche specialization to particular habitats or biotic interactions may determine trait correlations, a subset of which are termed "strategic trade-offs" because they are a consequence of adaptive specialization. Across scales, constraints within species often do not apply as new species evolve, and conversely, trait correlations observed across populations or species may not be reflected within populations. I give examples of such scale-dependent trait associations and their causes across taxonomic groups and ecosystems, and in the final section of the paper, I specifically evaluate leaf economics spectrum traits and their associations with plant defense against herbivory. Scale-dependent predictions emerge for understanding plant ecology holistically, and this approach can be fruitfully applied more generally in evolutionary ecology. Adaptive specialization and community context are two of the primary drivers of trade-offs and syndromes across biological scales.

AB Linear growth delay (stunting) affects roughly 155 million children under the age of 5 years worldwide. Treatment has been limited by a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Stunting is most likely associated with changes in the microbial community of the small intestine, a compartment vital for digestion and nutrient absorption. Efforts to better understand the pathophysiology have been hampered by difficulty of access to small intestinal fluids. Here, we describe the microbial community found in the upper gastrointestinal tract of stunted children aged 2-5 y living in sub-Saharan Africa. We studied 46 duodenal and 57 gastric samples from stunted children, as well as 404 fecal samples from stunted and nonstunted children living in Bangui, Central African Republic, and in Antananarivo, Madagascar, using 16S Illumina Amplicon sequencing and semiquantitative culture methods. The vast majority of the stunted children showed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth dominated by bacteria that normally reside in the oropharyngeal cavity. There was an overrepresentation of oral bacteria in fecal samples of stunted children, opening the way for developing noninvasive diagnostic markers. In addition, Escherichia coli/Shigella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were found to be more prevalent in stunted children, while Clostridia, well-known butyrate producers, were reduced. Our data suggest that stunting is associated with amicrobiome "decompartmentalization" of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by an increased presence of oropharyngeal bacteria from the stomach to the colon, hence challenging the current view of stunting arising solely as a consequence of small intestine overstimulation through recurrent infections by enteric pathogens.

AB What seems like a trivial task is one of the most difficult ones in functional plant ecology and biogeography: selecting the appropriate measures of temperature for an ecologically meaningful description of habitat conditions and for a mechanistic understanding of responses of plants. The difficulty becomes even more severe at elevations above the climatic tree limit, where plant stature, topography and seasonal snow cover interact in producing temperature conditions that largely deviate from weather station records. Temporal resolution and the distinction between extremes and means for biogeographic applications are emphasized. We summarize the key issues in handling temperature as a driver of plant life in general and in high elevation ecosystems in particular. Future directions in plant-temperature research at high elevation need to resolve the thermal species range limit issues (identify the fundamental temperature niche) and the complex controls of plant development (phenology) in a topography context.

AB Temporal stability of ecosystem functioning increases the predictability and reliability of ecosystem services, and understanding the drivers of stability across spatial scales is important for land management and policy decisions. We used species-level abundance data from 62 plant communities across five continents to assess mechanisms of temporal stability across spatial scales. We assessed how asynchrony (i.e. different units responding dissimilarly through time) of species and local communities stabilised metacommunity ecosystem function. Asynchrony of species increased stability of local communities, and asynchrony among local communities enhanced metacommunity stability by a wide range of magnitudes (1-315%); this range was positively correlated with the size of the metacommunity. Additionally, asynchronous responses among local communities were linked with species' populations fluctuating asynchronously across space, perhaps stemming from physical and/or competitive differences among local communities. Accordingly, we suggest spatial heterogeneity should be a major focus for maintaining the stability of ecosystem services at larger spatial scales.

AB This review consists of a systematic assessment of climate change adaptation literature to elicit major trends, discourses, and patterns in how local knowledge is conceived. We report on conceptual and geographic trends within the literature, including the practice of assessing local knowledge against scientific benchmarks, and present results of a textual network analysis that illustrates overlap and co-occurrence among different characterizations of local knowledge. In critically assessing the dominant trends we draw special attention to problems associated with the extraction of local knowledge without due consideration of how this process is embedded and inextricable from local contexts and sociotechnical orders. Drawing on theories of science and technology that examine the ontological politics of research practices, we propose a co-productive path forward for local knowledge mobilization to inform adaptation decision-making, which we argue facilitates the transformation of the institutional and governance arrangement of climate adaptation to provide greater flexibility and experimentalism in research and decision-making.

AB Dispersal is considered a key driver of beta diversity, the variation in species composition among local communities, but empirical tests remain limited. We manipulated dispersal of nectar-inhabiting bacteria and yeasts via flower-visiting animals to examine how dispersal influenced microbial beta diversity among flowers. Contrary to the prevailing view that dispersal lowers beta diversity, we found beta diversity was highest when dispersal was least limited. Our analysis suggested that this unexpected pattern might have resulted from stronger priority effects under increased dispersal. Dispersal is highly stochastic, generating variability in species arrival history and consequently the potential for community divergence via priority effects, in these and likely many other microbial, plant, and animal communities. Yet most previous experiments eliminated this possibility. We suggest that the positive effects of dispersal on beta diversity, like the one we report here, may have been greatly underappreciated.

AB Tropical forests dominate global terrestrial carbon (C) exchange, and recent droughts in the Amazon Basin have contributed to short-term declines in terrestrial carbon dioxide uptake and storage. However, the effects of longer-term climate variability on tropical forest carbon dynamics are still not well understood. We synthesised field data from more than 150 tropical forest sites to explore how climate regulates tropical forest aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and organic matter decomposition, and combined those data with two existing databases to explore climate - C relationships globally. While previous analyses have focused on the effects of either temperature or rainfall on ANPP, our results highlight the importance of interactions between temperature and rainfall on the C cycle. In cool forests (<20 degrees C), high rainfall slowed rates of C cycling, but in warm tropical forests (>20 degrees C) it consistently enhanced both ANPP and decomposition. At the global scale, our analysis showed an increase in ANPP with rainfall in relatively warm sites, inconsistent with declines in ANPP with rainfall reported previously. Overall, our results alter our understanding of climate - C cycle relationships, with high precipitation accelerating rates of C exchange with the atmosphere in the most productive biome on earth.

AB Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal-dependent processes of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer-resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source-sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better-suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.

AB This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall and temperature (minimum, maximum and average) trends at 47 stations throughout the Brazilian Legal Amazon for the period 1973-2013. Annual, wet season and dry season trends were quantified by Sen's slope for each station and the entire region. The Mann-Kendall test was used to determine the statistical significance of the trends. For the whole region, minimum, maximum and average annual temperatures showed increasing trend of approximately 0.04 degrees C per year. The rainfall showed an insignificant trend for most stations for annual and seasonal series. Nevertheless, some stations showed significant increasing trends in the annual and wet season rainfalls while a few stations showed decreasing trends for the dry season rainfall. A positive trend of the annual range between wet and dry season rainfall was found in some stations, caused mainly by an increasing trend in wet season rainfall.

TI Regional synchrony in full-scale activated sludge bioreactors due to

ID WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; BACTERIAL; BULKING
AB Seasonal community structure and regionally synchronous population dynamics have been observed in natural microbial ecosystems, but have not been well documented in wastewater treatment bioreactors. Few studies of community dynamics in full-scale activated sludge systems facing similar meteorological conditions have been done to compare the importance of deterministic and neutral community assembly mechanisms. We subjected weekly activated sludge samples from six regional full-scale bioreactors at four wastewater treatment plants obtained over 1 year to Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes, resulting in a library of over 17 million sequences. All samples derived from reactors treating primarily municipal wastewater. Despite variation in operational characteristics and location, communities displayed temporal synchrony at the individual operational taxonomic unit (OTU), broad phylogenetic affiliation and community-wide scale. Bioreactor communities were dominated by 134 abundant and highly regionally synchronized OTU populations that accounted for over 50% of the total reads. Non-core OTUs displayed abundance-dependent population synchrony. Alpha diversity varied by reactor, but showed a highly reproducible and synchronous seasonal fluctuation. Community similarity was dominated by seasonal changes, but individual reactors maintained minor stable differences after 1 year. Finally, the impacts of mass migration driven by direct biomass transfers between reactors was investigated, but had no significant effect on community similarity or diversity in the sink community. Our results show that population dynamics in activated sludge bioreactors are consistent with niche-driven assembly guided by seasonal temperature fluctuations.

AB Green space in cities contributes to the quality of life for city dwellers, e. g., by increasing the opportunity for recreation. However, perception of urban green space is influenced by multiple factors. We investigated effects of biodiversity and environment-related attitudes on visual and auditory perceptions of urban green space. Field measurements of biodiversity were conducted in six sites across an urban gradient in Gothenburg, Sweden, and three categories of biodiversity-high, medium, low-were established. Households were sent a survey on aesthetic perception of urban green space, sound perception and the importance of trees and plants for the perception of bird species. Each respondent focused on the site that was located nearby. The environment-related attitudes comprised BNature-oriented and BUrban-oriented persons and were based on participants' own attitude estimations. It was shown that participants' Bsubjective aesthetic and sound-related perception of urban greenery were in line with the Bobjectively measured subdivisions of high, medium and low biodiversity. So also were their estimations of the importance of trees and plants for perception of bird species in urban greenery, although differing only between high and medium/low biodiversity conditions. Persons rating themselves as highly nature-oriented were shown to give higher scores to urban green space aesthetics and to value greenery-related sounds higher, and to attach greater importance to trees and plants in their perception of bird species in urban greenery, than less nature-oriented persons. Highly urban-oriented persons compared to less urban-oriented persons did the same, but only regarding urban greenery-related aesthetics and sounds of nature. We conclude that environment-related attitudes influence perceptions of green space. Moreover, our findings support the idea that biodiversity per se also influences perceptions; people value green space significantly more with high than with low measured biodiversity. Urban planning needs to provide city inhabitants with green spaces that are species-rich, lush, varied and rich with natural sounds.

AB The average COD, TN, TP, and NH4+-N elimination rates in a new wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) based on a modified A2/O process were 83%, 72.4%, 93.5%, and 98.6%, respectively, even under conditions of a low C/N ratio and low temperature. Among the four potential denitrifying units, the post-anoxic unit was the least efficient with respect to the removal efficiency. However, the structures of the bacterial community among samples obtained from the treatment units were similar, as demonstrated using Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing. Genera with nitrifying, denitrifying, hydrolyzing, and glycogen-accumulating activities were identified in all units, indicating that functional groups were highly enriched in the active sludges and thus enabled nitrogen removal. The key functional microorganisms responsible for nitrification-denitrification in the WWTP were species belonging to the genera Nitrospira, Hydrogenophilaceae, Comamonas, Dechloromonas, Thauera, Haliangium, and Halomonas.

AB The psychological, sociological and evolutionary roots of conspecific violence in humans are still debated, despite attracting the attention of intellectuals for over two millennia(1-11). Here we propose a conceptual approach towards understanding these roots based on the assumption that aggression in mammals, including humans, has a significant phylogenetic component. By compiling sources of mortality from a comprehensive sample of mammals, we assessed the percentage of deaths due to conspecifics and, using phylogenetic comparative tools, predicted this value for humans. The proportion of human deaths phylogenetically predicted to be caused by interpersonal violence stood at 2%. This value was similar to the one phylogenetically inferred for the evolutionary ancestor of primates and apes, indicating that a certain level of lethal violence arises owing to our position within the phylogeny of mammals. It was also similar to the percentage seen in prehistoric bands and tribes, indicating that we were as lethally violent then as common mammalian evolutionary history would predict. However, the level of lethal violence has changed through human history and can be associated with changes in the socio-political organization of human populations. Our study provides a detailed phylogenetic and historical context against which to compare levels of lethal violence observed throughout our history.

AB The advances in genetics and biochemistry that have taken place over the last 10 years led to significant advances in experimental and clinical immunology. In turn, this has led to the development of new mathematical models to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively various open questions in immunology. In this study we present a review of some research areas in mathematical immunology that evolved over the last 10 years. To this end, we take a step-by-step approach in discussing a range of models derived to study the dynamics of both the innate and immune responses at the molecular, cellular and tissue scales. To emphasise the use of mathematics in modelling in this area, we also review some of the mathematical tools used to investigate these models. Finally, we discuss some future trends in both experimental immunology and mathematical immunology for the upcoming years.

AB Production of organic chemicals (OCs) is increasing exponentially, and some OCs biomagnify through food webs to potentially toxic levels. Biomagnification under field conditions is best described by trophic magnification factors (TMFs; per trophic level change in log-concentration of a chemical) which have been measured for more than two decades. Syntheses of TMF behavior relative to chemical traits and ecosystem properties are lacking. We analyzed >1500 TMFs to identify OCs predisposed to biomagnify and to assess ecosystem vulnerability. The highest TMFs were for OCs that are slowly metabolized by animals (metabolic rate k(M) < 0.01 day(-1)) and are moderately hydrophobic (log K-ow 6-8). TMFs were more variable in marine than freshwaters, unrelated to latitude, and highest in food webs containing endotherms. We modeled the probability that any OC would biomagnify as a combined function of Kow and kM. Probability is greatest (similar to 100%) for slowly metabolized compounds, regardless of Kow, and lowest for chemicals with rapid transformation rates (k(M) > 0.2 day(-1)). This probabilistic model provides a new global tool for screening existing and new OCs for their biomagnification potential.

AB Habitat selection is a fundamental behaviour that links individuals to the resources required for survival and reproduction. Although natural selection acts on an individual's phenotype, research on habitat selection often pools inter-individual patterns to provide inferences on the population scale. Here, we expanded a traditional approach of quantifying habitat selection at the individual level to explore the potential for consistent individual differences of habitat selection. We used random coefficients in resource selection functions (RSFs) and repeatability estimates to test for variability in habitat selection. We applied our method to a detailed dataset of GPS relocations of brown bears (Ursus arctos) taken over a period of 6 years, and assessed whether they displayed repeatable individual differences in habitat selection toward two habitat types: bogs and recent timber-harvest cut blocks. In our analyses, we controlled for the availability of habitat, i.e. the functional response in habitat selection. Repeatability estimates of habitat selection toward bogs and cut blocks were 0.304 and 0.420, respectively. Therefore, 30.4 and 42.0 % of the population-scale habitat selection variability for bogs and cut blocks, respectively, was due to differences among individuals, suggesting that consistent individual variation in habitat selection exists in brown bears. Using simulations, we posit that repeatability values of habitat selection are not related to the value and significance of beta estimates in RSFs. Although individual differences in habitat selection could be the results of non-exclusive factors, our results illustrate the evolutionary potential of habitat selection.

AB Fire regime characteristics in North America are expected to change over the next several decades as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Although some fire regime characteristics (e.g., area burned and fire season length) are relatively well-studied in the context of a changing climate, fire severity has received less attention. In this study, we used observed data from 1984 to 2012 for the western United States (US) to build a statistical model of fire severity as a function of climate. We then applied this model to several (n = 20) climate change projections representing mid-century (2040-2069) conditions under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Model predictions suggest widespread reduction in fire severity for large portions of the western US. However, our model implicitly incorporates climate-induced changes in vegetation type, fuel load, and fire frequency. As such, our predictions are best interpreted as a potential reduction in fire severity, a potential that may not be realized due human-induced disequilibrium between plant communities and climate. Consequently, to realize the reductions in fire severity predicted in this study, land managers in the western US could facilitate the transition of plant communities towards a state of equilibrium with the emerging climate through means such as active restoration treatments (e.g., mechanical thinning and prescribed fire) and passive restoration strategies like managed natural fire (under suitable weather conditions). Resisting changes in vegetation composition and fuel load via activities such as aggressive fire suppression will amplify disequilibrium conditions and will likely result in increased fire severity in future decades because fuel loads will increase as the climate warms and fire danger becomes more extreme. The results of our study provide insights to the pros and cons of resisting or facilitating change in vegetation composition and fuel load in the context of a changing climate.

AB Increasing attention to regime shifts, critical transitions, non-marginal changes, and systemic shocks calls for the development of models that are able to reproduce or grow structural changes that occur over time periods perceived as abrupt. This paper highlights specific modelling challenges to consider when exploring coupled socio-environmental systems experiencing regime shifts. We explore these challenges in the context of four modelling approaches that have been applied to the study of regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: statistical, system dynamics, equilibrium and agent-based modelling. When reviewing these modelling approaches we reflect on a set of criteria including the ability of an approach (1) to capture feedbacks between social and environmental system, (2) to represent the sources of regime shifts, (3) to incorporate complexity aspects, and (4) to deal with regime shift identification. Many of the modelling examples considered do not provide information on all these criteria, which receive a lot of attention in empirical studies of registered regime shifts. This suggests a need to develop a common modelling terminology in the domain of modelling for resilience and regime shifts. When discussing strengths and weaknesses of various modelling paradigms we conclude that a hybrid approach is likely to provide most insights into the processes and consequences of regime shifts. Challenges and frontier directions of research for designing models to study regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems are outlined. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is an increasing demand for environmental assessments of the marine environment to include ecosystem function. However, existing schemes are predominantly based on taxonomic (i.e. structural) measures of biodiversity. Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function (BEF) relationships are suggested to provide a mechanism for converting taxonomic information into surrogates of ecosystem function. This review assesses the evidence for marine BEF relationships and their potential to be used in practical monitoring applications (i.e. operationalized).
   Five key requirements were identified for the practical application of BEF relationships: (1) a complete understanding of strength, direction and prevalence of marine BEF relationships, (2) an understanding of which biological components are influential within specific BEF relationships, (3) the biodiversity of the selected biological components can be measured easily, (4) the ecological mechanisms that are the most important for generating marine BEF relationships, i.e. identity effects or complementarity, are known and (5) the proportion of the overall functional variance is explained by biodiversity, and hence BEF relationships, has been established.
   Numerous positive and some negative BEF relationships were found within the literature, although many reproduced poorly the natural species richness, trophic structures or multiple functions of real ecosystems (requirement 1). Null relationships were also reported. The consistency of the positive and negative relationships was often low that compromised the ability to generalize BEF relationships and confident application of BEF within marine monitoring. Equally, some biological components and functions have received little or no investigation.
   Expert judgement was used to attribute biological components using spatial extent, presence and functional rate criteria (requirement 2). This approach highlighted the main biological components contributing the most to specific ecosystem functions, and that many of the particularly influential components were found to have received the least amount of research attention.
   The need for biodiversity to be measureable (requirement 3) is possible for most biological components although difficult within the functionally important microbes. Identity effects underpinned most marine BEF relationships (requirement 4). As such, processes that translated structural biodiversity measures into functional diversity were found to generate better BEF relationships.
   The analysis of the contribution made by biodiversity, over abiotic influences, to the total expression of a particular ecosystem function was rarely measured or considered (requirement 5). Hence it is not possible to determine the overall importance of BEF relationships within the total ecosystem functioning observed. In the few studies where abiotic factors had been considered, it was clear that these modified BEE relationships and have their own direct influence on functional rate.
   Based on the five requirements, the information required for immediate 'operationalization' of BEF relationships within marine functional monitoring is lacking. However, the concept of BEF inclusion within practical monitoring applications, supported by ecological modelling, shows promise for providing surrogate indicators of functioning.

AB IUCN Red Lists are recognized worldwide as powerful instruments for the conservation of species. Quantitative criteria to standardize approaches for estimating population trends, geographic ranges and population sizes have been developed at global and sub-global levels. Little attention has been given to the data needed to estimate species trends and range sizes for IUCN Red List assessments. Few regions collect monitoring data in a structured way and usually only for a limited number of taxa. Therefore, opportunistic data are increasingly used for estimating trends and geographic range sizes. Trend calculations use a range of proxies: (i) monitoring sentinel populations, (ii) estimating changes in available habitat, or (iii) statistical models of change based on opportunistic records. Geographic ranges have been determined using: (i) marginal occurrences, (ii) habitat distributions, (iii) range-wide occurrences, (iv) species distribution modelling (including site-occupancy models), and (v) process-based modelling. Red List assessments differ strongly among regions (Europe, Britain and Flanders, north Belgium). Across different taxonomic groups, in European Red Lists IUCN criteria B and D resulted in the highest level of threat. In Britain, this was the case for criterion D and criterion A, while in Flanders criterion B and criterion A resulted in the highest threat level. Among taxonomic groups, however, large differences in the use of IUCN criteria were revealed. We give examples from Europe, Britain and Flemish Red List assessments using opportunistic data and give recommendations for a more uniform use of IUCN criteria among regions and among taxonomic groups.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Membrane trafficking is key to the cell biological mechanisms underlying development. Rab GTPases control specific membrane compartments, from core secretory and endocytic machinery to lesswell-understood compartments. We tagged all 27 Drosophila Rabs with YFPMYC at their endogenous chromosomal loci, determined their expression and subcellular localization in six tissues comprising 23 cell types, and provide this data in an annotated, searchable image database. We demonstrate the utility of these lines for controlled knockdown and show that similar subcellular localization can predict redundant functions. We exploit this comprehensive resource to ask whether a common Rab compartment architecture underlies epithelial polarity. Strikingly, no single arrangement of Rabs characterizes the five epithelia we examine. Rather, epithelia flexibly polarize Rab distribution, producing membrane trafficking architectures that are tissue-and stage-specific. Thus, the core machinery responsible for epithelial polarization is unlikely to rely on polarized positioning of specific Rab compartments.

AB Pollution caused by particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is now a major environmental problem in many Asian cities. Planting more trees has been suggested as an unconventional approach to alleviate the problem. In this study, we developed a ranking approach to evaluate the PM2.5 removal efficiency, negative impacts on air quality, and the suitability to urban environments of commonly occurring urban tree species. The results showed that the most frequently occurring tree species in global cities were not the best performers in removing PM2.5. Among the ten most frequently occurring tree species, only London plane (Platanus acerifolia (Aiton) Wild.), silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) and honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.) were ranked above average. However, there is great potential for improving the removal of PM2.5 from urban air by using species that have high PM2.5 removal efficiency, especially conifer species. Use of conifer species requires choosing the correct gender and matching trees with appropriate sites. The results from this study can assist environmental management agencies in the selection of tree species for urban greening projects focusing on PM2.5 control.

AB Significant benefits can arise from collaborative forms of governance that foster self-organization and flexibility. Likewise, governance systems that fit with the extent and complexity of the system under management are considered essential to our ability to solve environmental problems. However, from an empirical perspective the fundamental question of whether self-organized (bottom-up) collaborative forms of governance are able to accomplish adequate fit is unresolved. We used new theory and methodological approaches underpinned by interdisciplinary network analysis to address this gap by investigating three governance challenges that relate to the problem of fit: shared management of ecological resources, management of interconnected ecological resources, and cross-scale management. We first identified a set of social-ecological network configurations that represent the hypothesized ways in which collaborative arrangements can contribute to addressing these challenges. Using social and ecological data from a large-scale biodiversity conservation initiative in Australia, we empirically determined how well the observed patterns of stakeholder interactions reflect these network configurations. We found that stakeholders collaborate to manage individual parcels of native vegetation, but not for the management of interconnected parcels. In addition, our data show that the collaborative arrangements enable management across different scales (local, regional, supraregional). Our study provides empirical support for the ability of collaborative forms of governance to address the problem of fit, but also suggests that in some cases the establishment of bottom-up collaborative arrangements would likely benefit from specific guidance to facilitate the establishment of collaborations that better align with the ways ecological resources are interconnected across the landscape. In our case study region, this would improve the capacity of stakeholders to detect both the intended and unintended off-site impacts of management actions. Our approach offers an avenue for empirical evaluations of collaborative governance so that preconditions for effectiveness of environmental programs can be enhanced.

AB In the context of global environmental and social change, with increasing pollution and decline of biodiversity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems having its deep roots in drastic modifications to hydrological mesocycles, there is an urgent need for a new approach for sustainability. The two often contradicting approaches to water resources management, i.e., (1) hydrotechnical, and (2) ecological, can be reconciled within the context of ecohydrology (EH). It seeks for the understanding of the underlying water-biota interactions as well as providing a new tool for management of water resources. While the majority of changes are nonreversible in the framework of ecohydrology it is possible to regulate (dual regulation) the processes, especially in novel ecosystems, as an alternative to conservation and restoration measures, in order to increase their carrying capacity in the four dimensions, as follows: (1) water resources, (2) biodiversity, (3) ecosystem services, and (4) resilience. The proposed approach aims to initiate a discussion and joint efforts of hydrological engineers, hydrologists, and ecologists towards formulation of the comprehensive strategy and scientific background for harmonization of society needs with the enhanced ecosystem potential. It stipulates for a change in paradigm not only in the environmental sciences but also in the global economy, engineering, and education systems.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances are detrimental to the functioning and stability of natural ecosystems. Critical ecosystem processes driven by microbial communities are subjected to these disturbances. Here, we examine the stabilizing role of bacterial diversity on community biomass in the presence of abiotic perturbations such as addition of heavy metals, NaCl and warming. Bacterial communities with a diversity gradient of 1-12 species were subjected to the different treatments, and community biomass ( OD600) was measured after 24 h. We found that initial species richness and phylogenetic structure impact the biomass of communities. Under abiotic perturbations, the presence of tolerant species in community largely contributed in community biomass production. Bacterial diversity stabilized the biomass across the treatments, and differential response of bacterial species to different perturbations was the key reason behind these effects. The results suggest that biodiversity is crucial for maintaining the stability of ecosystem functioning and acts as ecological insurance under abiotic perturbations. Biodiversity in natural ecosystems may also uphold the ecosystem functioning under anthropogenic disturbance.

AB The mid-Cenozoic decline of atmospheric CO2 levels that promoted global climate change was critical to shaping contemporary arid ecosystems. Within angiosperms, two CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs)crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and C(4)evolved from the C-3 photosynthetic pathway, enabling more efficient whole-plant function in such environments. Many angiosperm clades with CCMs are thought to have diversified rapidly due to Miocene aridification, but links between this climate change, CCM evolution, and increased net diversification rates (r) remain to be further understood. Euphorbia (approximate to 2000 species) includes a diversity of CAM-using stem succulents, plus a single species-rich C-4 subclade. We used ancestral state reconstructions with a dated molecular phylogeny to reveal that CCMs independently evolved 17-22 times in Euphorbia, principally from the Miocene onwards. Analyses assessing among-lineage variation in r identified eight Euphorbia subclades with significantly increased r, six of which have a close temporal relationship with a lineage-corresponding CCM origin. Our trait-dependent diversification analysis indicated that r of Euphorbia CCM lineages is approximately threefold greater than C-3 lineages. Overall, these results suggest that CCM evolution in Euphorbia was likely an adaptive strategy that enabled the occupation of increased arid niche space accompanying Miocene expansion of arid ecosystems. These opportunities evidently facilitated recent, replicated bursts of diversification in Euphorbia.

AB AimA major implication of natural selection is that species from different parts of the world will vary in their efficiency in converting resources into offspring for a given type of environment. This insight, articulated by Darwin, is usually overlooked in more recent studies of invasion biology that are often based on the more modern Eltonian perspective of imbalanced ecosystems. We formulate a renewed Darwinian framework for invasion biology, the evolutionary imbalance hypothesis (EIH), based only on the action of natural selection in historically isolated populations operating within a global network of repeated environments. This framework predicts that successful invaders are more likely to come from biotic regions of high genetic potential (with independent lineages of large population size), experiencing a given environment for many generations and under strong competition from other lineages.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe test the predictive power of this framework by examining disparities in recent species exchanges between global biotic regions, including patterns of plant invasions across temperate regions and exchanges of aquatic fauna as a result of modern canal building.
   ResultsOur framework successfully predicts global invasion patterns using phylogenetic diversity of the world's biotic regions as a proxy that reflects their genetic potential, historical stability and competitive intensity, in line with the Darwinian expectation. Floristic regions of higher phylogenetic diversity are more likely to be source areas of invasive plants, and regions of lower phylogenetic diversity are more likely to be invaded. Similar patterns are evident for formerly isolated marine or freshwater assemblages that have been connected via canals.
   Main conclusionsWe advocate an approach to understanding modern species invasions that recognizes the potential significance of both the original Darwinian explanation and the more modern view that emphasizes novel ecological or evolutionary mechanisms arising in the introduced range. Moreover, if biological invasions are a natural outcome of Darwinian evolution in an increasingly connected world, then invasive species should continue to displace native species and drive widespread shifts in the functioning of ecosystems.

AB Invasive Indo-Pacific red lionfish, Pterois volitans, were first reported in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) in summer 2010. To examine potential impacts on native reef fish communities, lionfish density and size distributions were estimated from fall 2010 to fall 2013 with a remotely operated vehicle at natural (n = 16) and artificial (n = 22) reef sites. Lionfish (n = 934) also were sampled via spearfishing to examine effects of habitat type, season, and fish size on their diet and trophic ecology. There was an exponential increase in lionfish density at both natural and artificial reefs over the study period. By fall 2013, mean lionfish density at artificial reefs (14.7 fish 100 m(-2)) was two orders of magnitude higher than at natural reefs (0.49 fish 100 m(-2)), and already was among the highest reported in the western Atlantic. Lionfish diet was significantly different among habitats, seasons, and size classes, with smaller (<250 mm total length) fish consuming more benthic invertebrates and the diet of lionfish sampled from artificial reefs being composed predominantly of non-reef associated prey. The ontogenetic shift in lionfish feeding ecology was consistent with delta N-15 values of white muscle tissue that were positively related to total length. Overall, diet results indicate lionfish are generalist mesopredators in the nGOM that become more piscivorous at larger size. However, lionfish diet was much more varied at artificial reef sites where they clearly were foraging on open substrates away from reef structure. These results have important implications for tracking the lionfish invasion in the nGOM, as well as estimating potential direct and indirect impacts on native reef fish communities in this region.

AB A key component in describing forest carbon (C) dynamics is the change in downed dead wood biomass through time. Specifically, there is a dearth of information regarding the residence time of downed woody debris (DWD), which may be reflected in the diversity of wood (for example, species, size, and stage of decay) and site attributes (for example, climate) across the study region of eastern US forests. The empirical assessment of DWD rate of decay and residence time is complicated by the decay process itself, as decomposing logs undergo not only a reduction in wood density over time but also reductions in biomass, shape, and size. Using DWD repeated measurements coupled with models to estimate durations in various stages of decay, estimates of DWD half-life (T (HALF)), residence time (T (RES)), and decay rate (k constants) were developed for 36 tree species common to eastern US forests. Results indicate that estimates for T (HALF) averaged 18 and 10 years for conifers and hardwoods, respectively. Species that exhibited shorter T (HALF) tended to display a shorter T (RES) and larger k constants. Averages of T (RES) ranged from 57 to 124 years for conifers and from 46 to 71 years for hardwoods, depending on the species and methodology for estimating DWD decomposition considered. Decay rate constants (k) increased with increasing temperature of climate zones and ranged from 0.024 to 0.040 for conifers and from 0.043 to 0.064 for hardwoods. These estimates could be incorporated into dynamic global vegetation models to elucidate the role of DWD in forest C dynamics.

AB With increasing evidence of the destructive impacts of human activities on the ocean there is a growing call for stronger public engagement in marine governance. An understanding of marine issues and pro-environmental values are key elements that influence an individual's engagement in conservation and pro-environmental behaviour. This paper presents a study on public perceptions of sharks and shark conservation in the UK. The study investigated knowledge of and attitudes towards sharks of a group of individuals with a clear interest in the marine environment, as well as possible factors that might influence their perceptions of sharks, in order to make recommendations on how to foster engagement in shark conservation. The key finding was that important prerequisites for engagement in shark conservation exist among parts of the UK public. However, this does not seem to be enough to motivate actual engagement. The study discusses a number of specific challenges with regard to sharks which might be influencing the way in which society connects to shark related issues. It concludes with priority recommendations for further investigation into potential catalysts for public engagement in shark conservation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Estimating the thermal response of streams to a warming climate is important for prioritizing native fish conservation efforts. While there are plentiful estimates of air temperature responses to climate change, the sensitivity of streams, particularly small headwater streams, to warming temperatures is less well understood. A substantial body of literature correlates subannual scale temperature variations in air and stream temperatures driven by annual cycles in solar angle; however, these may be a low-precision proxy for climate change driven changes in the stream energy balance. We analyzed summer stream temperature records from forested streams in the Pacific Northwest for interannual correlations to air temperature and standardized annual streamflow departures. A significant pattern emerged where cold streams always had lower sensitivities to air temperature variation, while warm streams could be insensitive or sensitive depending on geological or vegetation context. A pattern where cold streams are less sensitive to direct temperature increases is important for conservation planning, although substantial questions may yet remain for secondary effects related to flow or vegetation changes induced by climate change.

AB Ecological structures and processes occur at specific spatiotemporal scales, and interactions that occur across multiple scales mediate scale-specific (e.g., individual, community, local, or regional) responses to disturbance. Despite the importance of scale, explicitly incorporating a multi-scale perspective into research and management actions remains a challenge. The discontinuity hypothesis provides a fertile avenue for addressing this problem by linking measureable proxies to inherent scales of structure within ecosystems. Here we outline the conceptual framework underlying discontinuities and review the evidence supporting the discontinuity hypothesis in ecological systems. Next we explore the utility of this approach for understanding cross-scale patterns and the organization of ecosystems by describing recent advances for examining nonlinear responses to disturbance and phenomena such as extinctions, invasions, and resilience. To stimulate new research, we present methods for performing discontinuity analysis, detail outstanding knowledge gaps, and discuss potential approaches for addressing these gaps.

AB Evolutionary biology is a study of life's history on Earth. In researching this history, biologists are often interested in attempting to reconstruct phenotypes for the long extinct ancestors of living species. Various methods have been developed to do this on a phylogeny from the data for extant taxa. In the present article, I introduce a new approach for ancestral character estimation for discretely valued traits. This approach is based on the threshold model from evolutionary quantitative genetics. Under the threshold model, the value exhibited by an individual or species for a discrete character is determined by an underlying, unobserved continuous trait called "liability." In this new method for ancestral state reconstruction, I use Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the liabilities of ancestral and tip species, and the relative positions of two or more thresholds, from their joint posterior probability distribution. Using data simulated under the model, I find that the method has very good performance in ancestral character estimation. Use of the threshold model for ancestral state reconstruction relies on a priori specification of the order of the discrete character states along the liability axis. I test the use of a Bayesian MCMC information theoretic criterion based approach to choose among different hypothesized orderings for the discrete character. Finally, I apply the method to the evolution of feeding mode in centrarchid fishes.

AB In recent years, research in invasion biology has focused increasing attention on understanding the role of phenology in shaping plant invasions. Multiple studies have found non-native species that tend to flower distinctly early or late in the growing season, advance more with warming or have shifted earlier with climate change compared with native species. This growing body of literature has focused on patterns of phenological differences, but there is a need now for mechanistic studies of how phenology contributes to invasions. To do this, however, requires understanding how phenology fits within complex functional trait relationships. Towards this goal, we review recent literature linking phenology with other functional traits, and discuss the role of phenology in mediating how plants experience disturbance and stress-via climate, herbivory and competition-across the growing season. Because climate change may alter the timing and severity of stress and disturbance in many systems, it could provide novel opportunities for invasion-depending upon the dominant climate controller of the system, the projected climate change, and the traits of native and non-native species. Based on our current understanding of plant phenological and growth strategies-especially rapid growing, early-flowering species versus later-flowering species that make slower-return investments in growth-we project optimal periods for invasions across three distinct systems under current climate change scenarios. Research on plant invasions and phenology within this predictive framework would provide a more rigorous test of what drives invader success, while at the same time testing basic plant ecological theory. Additionally, extensions could provide the basis to model how ecosystem processes may shift in the future with continued climate change.

AB Forest biomass is a major store of carbon and thus plays an important role in the regional and global carbon cycle. Accurate forest carbon sequestration assessment requires estimation of both forest biomass and forest biomass dynamics over time. Forest dynamics are characterized by disturbances and recovery, key processes affecting site productivity and the forest carbon cycle. Thus, spatially and temporally explicit knowledge of these processes and their drivers are critical for understanding regional carbon cycles. Here, we present a new method that uses satellite data to estimate changes in forest aboveground biomass associated with forest disturbances and recovery at annual time steps. First yearly maps of aboveground biomass between 1985 and 2010 based on Landsat time series and field data were created. Then, we applied a trajectory-based segmentation and fitting algorithm to the yearly biomass maps to reconstruct the forest disturbance and recovery history over the last 25 years.
   We tested the method over a coniferous forest region in the Western Carpathian Mountains, which experienced long-term environmental changes. Overall, 55% (similar to 30,700 ha) of the total coniferous forest experienced a loss of biomass over the observation period, while similar to 30% showed severe or complete removal of forest biomass. At the same time, 11.2% of the area was reforested or regenerated on previously damaged forest stands. The total coniferous biomass dropped by 15% between 1985 and 2010, indicating negative balance between the losses and the gains. Disturbance hotspots indicate high insect infestation levels in many areas and reveal strong interactions between biomass loss and climate conditions. Our study demonstrates how spatial and temporal estimates of biomass help to understand regional forest dynamics and derive degradation trends in regard to regional climate change.

AB Above-ground forest biomass is a significant variable in the terrestrial carbon budget, but is still estimated with relatively large uncertainty. Remote sensing methods can improve the characterization of the spatial distribution and estimation accuracy of biomass; in this respect, it is important to examine the potential offered by new sensors. To assess the contribution of the TanDEM-X mission, eighteen interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image pairs acquired over the hemi-boreal test site of Remningstorp in Sweden were investigated. Three models were used for interpretation of TanDEM-X signatures and above-ground biomass retrieval: Interferometric Water Cloud Model (IWCM), Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model, and a simple model based on penetration depth (PD). All use an allometric expression to relate above-ground biomass to forest height measured by TanDEM-X. The retrieval was assessed on 201 forest stands with a minimum size of 1 ha, and ranging from 6 to 267 Mg/ha (mean biomass of 105 Mg/ha) equally divided into a model training dataset and a validation test dataset. Biomass retrieved using the IWCM resulted in a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between 17% and 33%, depending on acquisition date and image acquisition geometry (angle of incidence, interferometric baseline, and orbit type). The RMSE in the case of the RVoG and the PD models were slightly higher. A multitemporal estimate of the above-ground biomass using all eighteen acquisitions resulted in an RMSE of 16% with R-2 = 0.93. These results prove the capability of TanDEM-X interferometric data to estimate forest aboveground biomass in the boreal zone.

AB Forest disturbance regimes have intensified in many parts of the world in recent decades, and are an increasing problem for managers concerned with the sustainable and continuous provisioning of forest ecosystem services. In order to address these changes an improved understanding of disturbance regimes is needed, particularly with regard to their main drivers and climate sensitivity. Here, our objectives were to first quantitatively describe the recent disturbance regime of forest ecosystems in Austria (3.99 x 10(6) ha). Second, our aim was to identify the main drivers of the disturbance regime, distinguishing slow, predisposing factors and fast, inciting factors. We utilized district-level disturbance observations from 2002 to 2010, and focused on damage from wind and bark beetles, the most detrimental abiotic and biotic disturbance agents in Europe. In a two-stage approach, we first analyzed the influence of slow, predisposing variables on the spatial variation in mean disturbance damage, using principle component regression. Subsequently, the year-to-year residuals from these average damage levels were regressed against fast, inciting factors related to disturbance occurrence.
   Overall, this two-stage analysis explained 48.7% (wind) and 67.1% (bark beetles) of the spatio-temporal variation in disturbance damage. On average, wind and bark beetles damaged 0.26% and 0.19% of growing stock per year. The analysis of damaged forest areas suggest a mean disturbance rotation period of 746 and 365 years for wind and bark beetle disturbance. Variables related to species composition were the most influential factors on the predisposition to both disturbance agents. Societal factors were found to be of similar importance as climatic variables. Overall, these predisposing (slow) variables had a stronger influence than inciting (fast) drivers, of which weather-related variables and spatio-temporal interactions within the disturbance regime were the most prominent factors.
   Our results indicate that important drivers of the disturbance regime can be influenced by forest management directly, but also underline that response times are likely to be slow. Furthermore, fast, inciting factors - although largely beyond the influence of management - have the potential to be used as early warning indicators of impending disturbance damage. Overall, disturbance regimes were found to be highly sensitive to both climate means and extremes, emphasizing the importance for improved risk management in forestry in the face of climate change.

AB Background: Evolutionary change in individual species has been hypothesized to have far-reaching consequences for entire ecological communities [1-3], and such coupling of ecological and evolutionary dynamics ("eco-evolutionary dynamics") has been demonstrated for a variety systems [4-7]. However, the general importance of evolutionary dynamics for ecological dynamics remains unclear. Here, we investigate how spatial patterns of local adaptation in the stick insect Timema cristinae, driven by the interaction between multiple evolutionary processes, structure metapopulations, communities, and multitrophic interactions.
   Results: Observations of a wild T. cristinae nnetapopulation show that locally imperfect camouflage reduces population size and that the effect of such maladaptation is comparable to the effects of more traditional ecological factors, including habitat patch size and host-plant species identity. Field manipulations of local adaptation and bird predation support the hypothesis that maladaptation reduces population size through an increase in bird predation. Furthermore, these field experiments show that maladaptation in T. cristinae and consequent increase in bird predation reduce the pooled abundance and species richness of the co-occurring arthropod community, and ultimately cascade to decrease herbivory on host plants. An eco-evolutionary model of the observational data demonstrates that the demographic cost of maladaptation decreases habitat patch occupancy by T. cristinae but enhances metapopulation-level adaptation.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate a pervasive effect of ongoing evolution in a spatial context on population and community dynamics. The eco-evolutionary model makes testable predictions about the influence of the spatial configuration of the patch network on metapopulation size and the spatial scale of adaptation.

AB In response to high summer river temperatures, salmonids avoid heat stress by making use of discrete units of cold water termed thermal refuges. Although recent research has documented how their spatial arrangement within a river affects salmonid distribution and behaviour, no information is currently available concerning temporal variation in the abundance and types of thermal refuges. In this study, a FLIR SC660 thermal infrared imaging camera (640 x 480 pixels, NETD <30 mK, 7.5-13 mu m) mounted on a helicopter platform was used to acquire thermal imagery of an Atlantic salmon river in Quebec, Canada on six occasions between 2009 and 2011, with a view to characterising temporal variability in thermal refuges and broader scale water temperature complexity. Thermal refuges detected from TIR imagery were classified into a series of process-based categories, revealing notable inter-survey variability in the absolute counts of each refuge type. Downstream temperature complexity, quantified as the standard deviation of derivatives taken of temperature long profiles of each survey, was highly temporally variable, exposing the presence of several warm and cool reaches which varied in magnitude between surveys. Data from local meteorological and discharge logging stations was used to examine whether hydrometeorological conditions could account for observed temporal variability trends. Temporal variability in the absolute counts of lateral groundwater seeps, the most frequently observed thermal refuge class, was shown to correlate strongly with long duration hydrometeorological metrics such as seasonal mean discharge (R-2 = 0.94, p < 0.01). Conversely, thermal refuges resulting from cold water tributaries were more temporally stable and exhibited a weaker correlation with hydrometeorological metrics. Downstream temperature complexity was shown to correlate best with short duration metrics such as cumulative precipitation depth within a 5-day period prior to each survey (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.01). This study is the first of its kind to link thermal refuge dynamics to hydrometeorological conditions and may offer valuable insights into how changing climatic regimes could influence these important cold water units in the future.

AB Understanding why food chains are relatively short in length has been an area of research and debate for decades. We tested if progressive changes in the nutritional content of arthropods with trophic position limit the availability of a key nutrient, lipid, for carnivores. Arthropods at higher trophic levels had progressively less lipid and more protein in their bodies compared with arthropods at lower trophic levels. The nutrients present in arthropod bodies were directly related to the nutrients that predators extracted when feeding on those arthropods. As a consequence, nutrient assimilation shifted from lipid-biased to protein-biased as arthropods ascended trophic levels from herbivores to secondary carnivores. Successive changes in the nutritional consequences of predation may ultimately set an upper limit on the number of trophic levels in arthropod communities. Further work is needed to examine the influence of lipid and other nutrients on food web traits in a range of ecosystems.

AB Reproduction is a risky affair; a lifespan cost of maintaining reproductive capability, and of reproduction itself, has been demonstrated in a wide range of animal species. However, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Most cost-of-reproduction studies simply ask how reproduction influences age at death, but are blind to the subjects' actual causes of death. Lifespan is a composite variable of myriad causes of death and it has not been clear whether the consequences of reproduction or of reproductive capability influence all causes of death equally. To address this gap in understanding, we compared causes of death among over 40,000 sterilized and reproductively intact domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. We found that sterilization was strongly associated with an increase in lifespan, and while it decreased risk of death from some causes, such as infectious disease, it actually increased risk of death from others, such as cancer. These findings suggest that to understand how reproduction affects lifespan, a shift in research focus is needed. Beyond the impact of reproduction on when individuals die, we must investigate its impact on why individuals die, and subsequently must identify the mechanisms by which these causes of death are influenced by the physiology associated with reproductive capability. Such an approach may also clarify the effects of reproduction on lifespan in people.

AB Climate change affects the abundance, distribution and activity of natural enemies that are important for suppressing herbivore crop pests. Moreover, higher mean temperatures and increased frequency of climatic extremes are expected to induce different responses across trophic levels, potentially disrupting predator-prey interactions. Using field observations, we examined the response of an aphid host-parasitoid system to variation in temperature. Temperature was positively associated with attack rates by parasitoids, but also with a non-significant trend towards increased attack rates by higher-level hyperparasitoids. Elevated hyperparasitism could partly offset any benefit of climate warming to parasitoids, and would suggest that higher trophic levels may hamper predictions of predator-prey interactions. Additionally, the mechanisms affecting host-parasitoid dynamics were examined using controlled laboratory experiments that simulated both temperature increase and drought. Parasitoid fitness and longevity responded differently when exposed to each climatic variable in isolation, compared to the interaction of both variables at once. Although temperature increase or drought tended to positively affect the ability of parasitoids to control aphid populations, these effects were significantly reversed when the drivers were expressed in concert. Additionally, separate warming and drought treatments reduced parasitoid longevity, and although temperature increased parasitoid emergence success and drought increased offspring production, combined temperature and drought produced the lowest parasitoid emergence. The non-additive effects of different climate drivers, combined with differing responses across trophic levels, suggest that predicting future pest outbreaks will be more challenging than previously imagined.

AB Aim The niche conservatism hypothesis proposes that species distribution patterns are, by and large, governed by ancestral climatic affinities. Here, we test this hypothesis by combining information on current diversity gradients among lineages, lineage initiation dates, and palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Location World-wide. Methods We test the niche conservatism hypothesis by comparing slopes of latitudinal diversity gradients among terrestrial and aquatic lineages derived from 343 studies from around the world. The prediction is that clades originating during warm periods should be very species rich in tropical regions, exhibiting a steeper richness gradient from lower to higher latitudes than clades originating during cold periods, which are expected to exhibit shallower latitudinal species richness gradients. Results Latitudinal gradients for clades that originated in warm climates are steeper and with a strong tropical affinity, whereas organisms originating in colder periods exhibit a shallower diversity gradient or no tropical affinity. Conclusions For a broad variety of plants and animals of both marine and terrestrial realms our results are consistent with the idea that higher diversities have arisen among tropical clades because the earth has been predominantly tropical throughout most of its history. Most clades radiated in tropical climates, with subsequent climate changes causing a retraction in distributions. Our study implies that global climate change by itself, even when developing over tens of millions of years, could have shaped the large-scale patterns of diversity prevailing on earth today.

AB The viviparous sea snakes (Hydrophiinae: Hydrophiini) comprise a young but morphologically and ecologically diverse clade distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific. Despite presenting a very promising model for marine diversification studies, many relationships among the 62 species and 16 genera in Hydrophiini remain unresolved. Here, we extend previous taxonomic and genomic sampling for Hydrophiini using three mitochondrial fragments and five nuclear loci for multiple individuals of 39 species in 15 genera. Our results highlight many of the impediments to inferring phylogenies in recent rapid radiations, including low variation at all five nuclear markers, and conflicting relationships supported by mitochondria] and nuclear trees. However, concatenated Bayesian and likelihood analyses, and a multilocus coalescent tree, recovered concordant support for primary clades and several previously unresolved inter-specific groupings. The Aipysurus group is monophyletic, with egg-eating specialists forming separate, early-diverging lineages. All three monotypic semi-aquatic genera (Ephalophis, Parahydrophis and Hydrelaps) are robustly placed as early diverging lineages along the branch leading to the Hydrophis group, with Ephalophis recovered as sister to Parahydrophis. The molecular phylogeny implies extensive evolutionary convergence in feeding adaptations within the Hydrophis group, especially the repeated evolution of small-headed (microcephalic) forms. Microcephalophis (Hydrophis) gracilis is robustly recovered as a relatively distant sister lineage to all other sampled Hydrophis group species, here termed the 'core Hydrophis group'. Within the 'core Hydrophis group', Hydrophis is recovered as broadly paraphyletic, with several other genera nested within it (Pelamis, Enhydrina, Astrotia, Thalassophina, Acalyptophis, Kerilia, Lapemis, Disteira). Instead of erecting multiple new genera, we recommend dismantling the latter (mostly monotypic) genera and recognising a single genus, Hydrophis Latreille 1802, for the core Hydrophis group. Estimated divergence times suggest that all Hydrophiini last shared a common ancestor similar to 6 million years ago, but that the majority of extant lineages diversified over the last similar to 3.5 million years. The core Hydrophis group is a young and rapidly speciating clade, with 26 sampled species and 9 genera and dated at only similar to 1.5-3 million years old. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background & Aims: Diseases of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract are often accompanied by diarrhea with profound alterations in the GI microbiota termed dysbiosis. Whether dysbiosis is due to the disease itself or to the accompanying diarrhea remains elusive. With this study we characterized the net effects of osmotic diarrhea on the composition of the GI microbiota in the absence of disease.
   Methods: We induced osmotic diarrhea in four healthy adults by oral administration of polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG). Stool as well as mucosa specimens were collected before, during and after diarrhea and 16S rDNA-based microbial community profiling was used to assess the microbial community structure.
   Results: Stool and mucosal microbiotas were strikingly different, with Firmicutes dominating the mucosa and Bacteroidetes the stools. Osmotic diarrhea decreased phylotype richness and showed a strong tendency to equalize the otherwise individualized microbiotas on the mucosa. Moreover, diarrhea led to significant relative shifts in the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and to a relative increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria on the mucosa, a phenomenon also noted in several inflammatory and diarrheal GI diseases.
   Conclusions: Changes in microbial community structure induced by osmotic diarrhea are profound and show similarities to changes observed in other GI diseases including IBD. These effects so must be considered when specimens from diarrheal diseases (i.e. obtained by stratification of samples according to diarrheal status) or conditions wherein bowel preparations like PEG (i.e. specimens obtained during endoscopy) are used.

AB As the pace of urbanization accelerates, the conservation of urban biodiversity emerges as a rising concern. Urban ecological research has revealed that some green areas in cities can harbor a rich diversity of species that can be enhanced by certain landscape- and local-scale structural planning variables. However, while most studies have been conducted in large greenspaces (e.g., parks, remnants), less effort was made to understand which variables influence biodiversity within small green patches and the efficiency of management practices has been seldom investigated. Here, we explore how management practices interplayed with landscape and structural variables to influence the diversity of plants, birds, butterflies and other pollinating insects in small public gardens (0.5-2.0 ha) in the center of a large metropolis (Paris, France).
   Small public gardens hosted significant common biodiversity and the ones that employed a conservation program (i.e., differential management) supported a higher diversity of all taxa and less urbanophile communities of birds and butterflies. Local-scale and management variables were more important in enhancing biodiversity than landscape-scale variables. Specifically, lawns rich in wild plants attracted many pollinators and bird richness increased with tree cover. Pesticides had a negative effect on bird richness, while a higher diversity of habitats and soils (i.e. mulching, peat) increased the diversity of all four taxa. We also found that bird richness could serve as a reasonable surrogate for butterflies and other pollinators. Our results highlight how planning and managing public gardens in the center of a large metropolis can benefit biodiversity, regardless of spatial context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Individuals of the same species differ consistently in risky actions. Such 'animal personality' variation is intriguing because behavioural flexibility is often assumed to be the norm. Recent theory predicts that between-individual differences in propensity to take risks should evolve if individuals differ in future fitness expectations: individuals with high long-term fitness expectations (i.e. that have much to lose) should behave consistently more cautious than individuals with lower expectations. Consequently, any manipulation of future fitness expectations should result in within-individual changes in risky behaviour in the direction predicted by this adaptive theory. We tested this prediction and confirmed experimentally that individuals indeed adjust their 'exploration behaviour', a proxy for risk-taking behaviour, to their future fitness expectations. We show for wild great tits (Parus major) that individuals with experimentally decreased survival probability become faster explorers (i.e. increase risk-taking behaviour) compared to individuals with increased survival probability. We also show, using quantitative genetics approaches, that non-genetic effects (i.e. permanent environment effects) underpin adaptive personality variation in this species. This study thereby confirms a key prediction of adaptive personality theory based on life-history trade-offs, and implies that selection may indeed favour the evolution of personalities in situations where individuals differ in future fitness expectations.

AB Beech forests in Central Europe are under strong anthropogenic pressure. Yet they play a fundamental role for biodiversity and are therefore increasingly considered in conservation activities. Sites of high conservation value can be efficiently defined by the use of indicator species, but very few studies have identified indicator species for beech forests on a continental scale. Here we determined the efficacy of saproxylic beetles as indicator species for European beech forests and studied the effect of the amount of dead wood and temperature on their presence. We analyzed data from 988 trap catches from 209 sites in 7 European countries. Using the flexible indicator approach, which allowed combinations of two temperature groups (warm and cool) and three dead-wood amount categories (small, intermediate, high) to be considered, we identified 127 indicator species. Generally, we found more indicator species of beetles at warmer sites and at sites with larger amounts of dead wood. Indicator species at cooler sites were found only in combination with larger amounts of dead wood. We present a comprehensive, data-based list of indicator species of saproxylic beetle for near-natural beech forests, as required in the framework of the European Natura-2000 concept for habitat evaluation. We identified the conspicuous Lucanidae as the family with the highest percentage of indicator species and thus recommend it as a priority indicator group for monitoring. Our results furthermore provide evidence that large amounts of dead wood are particularly important in cool, montane beech forests for maintaining high diversity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wind turbines are increasingly established throughout Europe and North America with often fatal consequences for wildlife, most importantly bats and birds. Yet, it is often unknown over what geographical distances wind farms are affecting animal populations. Based on stable hydrogen isotopes in fur, we assessed the geographic provenance of bats killed in summer and autumn at German wind turbines. We found that killed Pipistrellus nathusii originated from Estonia or Russia, and Pipistrellus pipistrellus from more local populations. Noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) and Leisler's bats (Nyctalus leisleri) were of Scandinavian or northeastern origin. Our isotopic geo-location reveals that wind turbines kill bats not only of sedentary local populations but also of distant populations, thus having potentially a negative impact beyond political borders; an observation that calls for international regulations for implementing mitigation measures to prevent large-scale detrimental effects on endangered bat populations.

AB Human use of ecosystem resources and services is increasing worldwide, generating pressures that alter ecosystem structure, functioning and provision of services. Unexpected ecosystem change is becoming frequent, and the complex ways through which multiple human pressures may interact leave conservation practitioners and natural resource managers faced with high uncertainty. We developed a geospatial approach for modeling the complex relationships between multiple h man pressures and coastal ecosystems status. This framework was then used to produce maps of the expected status of marine coastal ecosystems resulting from variation in the cumulative human pressure. The geospatial modeling approach we developed was tested on an emblematic study case requiring marine spatial planning, i.e. a recently established marine protected area (MPA) that will have to coexist with the expansion of a close commercial harbor. In the study case presented, our modeling approach was used to predict the status of coastal ecosystems resulting from different management alternatives. Results showed that should Port Authority support MPA in reducing human pressures in the area, coastal ecosystems would not be expected to further deteriorate as a consequence of harbor expansion. Our approach proved effective in modeling complex interaction among multiple pressures (e.g. synergisms) and predicting potential future scenarios. The implementation of this approach into geographical information systems (GIS)allows managers to represent the expected outcomes of their planned conservation effort!, thereby representing an important decision-support tool for finding efficient management solutions in the face of complex interactions and high uncertainty.

AB Aim While ecologists have long been interested in diversity in mountain regions, elevational patterns in beta diversity are still rarely studied across different life forms ranging from micro- to macroorganisms. Also, it is not known whether the patterns in turnover among organism groups are affected by the degree to which the environment is modified by human activities. Location Laojun Mountain, Yunnan Province, China. Methods The beta diversity patterns of benthic microorganisms (i.e. diatoms and bacteria) and macroorganisms (i.e. macroinvertebrates) in a stony stream were simultaneously investigated between elevations of 1820 and 4050 m. Data were analysed by using a distance-based approach and variation partitioning based on canonical redundancy analysis. Results Analyses of community dissimilarities between adjacent sampling sites showed comparable small-scale beta diversity along the elevational gradient for the organism groups. However, bacteria clearly showed the lowest elevational turnover when analyses were conducted simultaneously for all pairwise sites. Variation partitioning indicated that species turnover was mostly related to environmental heterogeneity and spatial gradients including horizontal distance and elevation, while purely human impacts were shown to be less important. Main conclusions The elevational beta diversity at large scales was lower for bacteria than for eukaryotic microorganisms or macroorganisms, perhaps indicative of high dispersal ability and good adaptability of bacteria to harsh environmental conditions. However, the small-scale beta diversity did not differ among the groups. Elevation was the major driver for the turnover of eukaryotic organisms, while the turnover of bacteria was correlated more with environmental variation.

AB Despite considerable progress in ecotoxicology, it has become clear that this discipline cannot answer its central questions, such as, "What are the effects of toxicants on biodiversity?" and "How the ecosystem functions and services are affected by the toxicants?". We argue that if such questions are to be answered, a paradigm shift is needed. The current bottom-up approach of ecotoxicology that implies the use of small-scale experiments to predict effects on the entire ecosystems and landscapes should be merged with a top-down macroecological approach that is directly focused on ecological effects at large spatial scales and consider ecological systems as integral entities. Analysis of the existing methods in ecotoxicology, ecology, and environmental chemistry shows that such integration is currently possible. Therefore, we conclude that to tackle the current pressing challenges, ecotoxicology has to progress using both the bottom-up and top-down approaches, similar to digging a tunnel from both ends at once.

AB Chromosomal inversions impact genetic variation and facilitate speciation in part by reducing recombination in heterokaryotypes. We generated multiple whole-genome shotgun sequences of the parapatric species pair Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis and their sympatric outgroup (Drosophila miranda) and compared the average pairwise differences for neutral sites within, just outside and far outside of the three large inversions. Divergence between D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis is high inside the inversions and in the suppressed recombination regions extending 2.5 Mb outside of inversions, but significantly lower in collinear regions further from the inversions. We observe little evidence of decreased divergence predicted to exist in the centre of inversions, suggesting that gene flow through double crossovers or gene conversion is limited within the inversion, or selection is acting within the inversion to maintain divergence in the face of gene flow. In combination with past studies, we provide evidence that inversions in this system maintain areas of high divergence in the face of hybridization, and have done so for a substantial period of time. The left arm of the X chromosome and chromosome 2 inversions appear to have arisen in the lineage leading to D. persimilis approximately 2 Ma, near the time of the split of D. persimilis-D. pseudoobscura-D. miranda, but likely fixed within D. persimilis much more recently, as diversity within D. persimilis is substantially reduced inside and near these two inversions. We also hypothesize that the inversions in D. persimilis may provide an empirical example of the 'mixed geographical mode' theory of inversion origin and fixation, whereby allopatry and secondary contact both play a role.

AB In the early stages of reproductive isolation, genomic regions of reduced recombination are expected to show greater levels of differentiation, either because gene flow between species is reduced in these regions or because the effects of selection at linked sites within species are enhanced in these regions. Here, we study the patterns of DNA sequence variation at 27 autosomal loci among populations of Mus musculus musculus, M. m. domesticus, and M. m. castaneus, three subspecies of house mice with collinear genomes. We found that some loci exhibit considerable shared variation among subspecies, while others exhibit fixed differences. We used an isolation-with-gene-flow model to estimate divergence times and effective population sizes (N-e) and to disentangle ancestral variation from gene flow. Estimates of divergence time indicate that all three subspecies diverged from one another within a very short period of time approximately 350 000 years ago. Overall, N-e for each subspecies was associated with the degree of genetic differentiation: M. m. musculus had the smallest N-e and the greatest proportion of monophyletic gene genealogies, while M. m. castaneus had the largest N-e and the smallest proportion of monophyletic gene genealogies. M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus were more differentiated from each other than either were from M. m. castaneus, consistent with greater reproductive isolation between M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus. F-ST was significantly greater at loci experiencing low recombination rates compared to loci experiencing high recombination rates in comparisons between M. m. castaneus and M. m. musculus or M. m. domesticus. These results provide evidence that genomic regions with less recombination show greater differentiation, even in the absence of chromosomal rearrangements.

AB 1. While positive effects of biodiversity on temporal stability of communities have been demonstrated in theoretical and empirical studies, diversity-stability relationships at the population level remain poorly understood.
   2. We investigated temporal variability of plant populations in experimental grassland plots of varying species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16-60 species), functional group richness and composition (presence /absence of legumes x grasses x small herbs x tall herbs) in a long-term biodiversity experiment from 2003 to 2009 ('Jena Experiment').
   3. Average population stability, defined as the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation of above-ground biomass production over time, differed largely between species but was generally higher in grasses and small herbs than in legumes and tall herbs. Furthermore, population stability was positively related to a species' proportional contribution to community biomass. Thus, an increasing number of subordinate species explained lower average population stabilities at higher diversity levels.
   4. A negative covariance (CV) across all species-richness levels suggested negatively correlated species dynamics. Species belonging to different functional groups fluctuated asynchronously, while species dynamics within functional groups were more synchronous. Community-wide species synchrony decreased with increasing species richness, and temporal stability at the community level increased.
   5. Synthesis: Our results suggest that diversity-stability relationships are driven by fluctuations in the population biomass of individual species which are less synchronized in more diverse than in less diverse mixtures and monocultures. Dominant plant species tend to be more stabilized than subdominant species, independently of community species richness. However, asynchrony of population dynamics outweighs decreasing population stability with increasing species richness, resulting in higher temporal stability at the plant community level.

AB Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) provide an important tool for conservation of marine ecosystems. To be most effective, these areas should be strategically located in a manner that supports ecosystem function. To inform marine spatial planning and support strategic establishment of MPAs within the California Current System, we identified areas predicted to support multispecies aggregations of seabirds ("hotspots''). We developed habitat-association models for 16 species using information from at-sea observations collected over an 11-year period (1997-2008), bathymetric data, and remotely sensed oceanographic data for an area from north of Vancouver Island, Canada, to the USA/Mexico border and seaward 600 km from the coast. This approach enabled us to predict distribution and abundance of seabirds even in areas of few or no surveys. We developed single-species predictive models using a machine-learning algorithm: bagged decision trees. Single-species predictions were then combined to identify potential hotspots of seabird aggregation, using three criteria: (1) overall abundance among species, (2) importance of specific areas ("core areas'') to individual species, and (3) predicted persistence of hotspots across years. Model predictions were applied to the entire California Current for four seasons (represented by February, May, July, and October) in each of 11 years. Overall, bathymetric variables were often important predictive variables, whereas oceanographic variables derived from remotely sensed data were generally less important. Predicted hotspots often aligned with currently protected areas (e.g., National Marine Sanctuaries), but we also identified potential hotspots in Northern California/Southern Oregon (from Cape Mendocino to Heceta Bank), Southern California (adjacent to the Channel Islands), and adjacent to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, that are not currently included in protected areas. Prioritization and identification of multispecies hotspots will depend on which group of species is of highest management priority. Modeling hotspots at a broad spatial scale can contribute to MPA site selection, particularly if complemented by fine-scale information for focal areas.

TI Individual versus systemic risk and the Regulator's Dilemma

   AMERICA

DT Article
DE financial stability; global financial markets; financial regulation
ID DISTRIBUTIONS; EVOLUTION
AB The global financial crisis of 2007-2009 exposed critical weaknesses in the financial system. Many proposals for financial reform address the need for systemic regulation-that is, regulation focused on the soundness of the whole financial system and not just that of individual institutions. In this paper, we study one particular problem faced by a systemic regulator: the tension between the distribution of assets that individual banks would like to hold and the distribution across banks that best supports system stability if greater weight is given to avoiding multiple bank failures. By diversifying its risks, a bank lowers its own probability of failure. However, if many banks diversify their risks in similar ways, then the probability of multiple failures can increase. As more banks fail simultaneously, the economic disruption tends to increase disproportionately. We show that, in model systems, the expected systemic cost of multiple failures can be largely explained by two global parameters of risk exposure and diversity, which can be assessed in terms of the risk exposures of individual actors. This observation hints at the possibility of regulatory intervention to promote systemic stability by incentivizing a more diverse diversification among banks. Such intervention offers the prospect of an additional lever in the armory of regulators, potentially allowing some combination of improved system stability and reduced need for additional capital.

AB Ocean currents are expected to be the predominant environmental factor influencing the dispersal of planktonic larvae or spores; yet, their characterization as predictors of marine connectivity has been hindered by a lack of understanding of how best to use oceanographic data. We used a high-resolution oceanographic model output and Lagrangian particle simulations to derive oceanographic distances (hereafter called transport times) between sites studied for Macrocystis pyrifera genetic differentiation. We build upon the classical isolation-by-distance regression model by asking how much additional variability in genetic differentiation is explained when adding transport time as predictor. We explored the extent to which gene flow is dependent upon seasonal changes in ocean circulation. Because oceanographic transport between two sites is inherently asymmetric, we also compare the explanatory power of models using the minimum or the mean transport times. Finally, we compare the direction of connectivity as estimated by the oceanographic model and genetic assignment tests. We show that the minimum transport time had higher explanatory power than the mean transport time, revealing the importance of considering asymmetry in ocean currents when modelling gene flow. Genetic assignment tests were much less effective in determining asymmetry in gene flow. Summer-derived transport times, in particular for the month of June, which had the strongest current speed, greatest asymmetry and highest spore production, resulted in the best-fit model explaining twice the variability in genetic differentiation relative to models that use geographic distance or habitat continuity. The best overall model also included habitat continuity and explained 65% of the variation in genetic differentiation among sites.

AB Examples of parallel evolution of phenotypic traits have been repeatedly demonstrated in threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) across their global distribution. Using these as a model, we performed a targeted genome scan-focusing on physiologically important genes potentially related to freshwater adaptation-to identify genetic signatures of parallel physiological evolution on a global scale. To this end, 50 microsatellite loci, including 26 loci within or close to (< 6 kb) physiologically important genes, were screened in paired marine and freshwater populations from six locations across the Northern Hemisphere. Signatures of directional selection were detected in 24 loci, including 17 physiologically important genes, in at least one location. Although no loci showed consistent signatures of selection in all divergent population pairs, several outliers were common in multiple locations. In particular, seven physiologically important genes, as well as reference ectodysplasin gene (EDA), showed signatures of selection in three or more locations. Hence, although these results give some evidence for consistent parallel molecular evolution in response to freshwater colonization, they suggest that different evolutionary pathways may underlie physiological adaptation to freshwater habitats within the global distribution of the threespine stickleback.

AB Herbal medicinal materials have been used worldwide for centuries to maintain health and to treat disease. However, adulteration of herbal medicines remains a major concern of users and industry for reasons of safety and efficacy. identification of herbal medicinal materials by DNA technology has been widely applied, started from the mid-1990s. In recent years, DNA barcoding of global plant species using four standard barcodes (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA and ITS) has been a major focus in the fields of biodiversity and conservation. These DNA barcodes can also be used as reliable tools to facilitate the identification of herbal medicinal materials for the safe use of herbs, quality control, and forensic investigation. Many studies have applied these DNA barcodes for the identification of herbal medicinal species and their adulterants. The present article reviews efforts in the identification of herbal medicinal materials using the standard DNA barcodes and other DNA sequence-based markers.

AB Availability and fragmentation of habitat are today identified as key determinants of population maintenance. Disentangling their relative effects is of crucial importance to adequately manage landscapes. However, the classical use of occurrence or abundance data as proxy to assess the responses of populations could be insufficient to detect less drastic impacts than short-term population extinction. We evaluated the effects of both habitat availability and fragmentation at three spatial scales on both the occurrence and two "physiological state" indicators (body condition and level of stress hormone) reflecting the physical state of common toads (Bufo Imp). Our study showed that occurrence was negatively affected only by habitat availability at the largest spatial scale whereas the both physiological state indicators studied at the population scale are significantly altered by both habitat availability and fragmentation at the finest spatial scale. Results obtained with occurrence and physiological state approaches substantially diverge, which highlights the need to also investigate proximal processes to deeply understand how populations are threatened by landscape modifications. The use of physiological state indicators, particularly of body condition, powerful and easy to obtain, could be particularly relevant to detect early warnings of population decline allowing a management before extinction. Only a complete investigation of the potential impacts of landscape on the different population processes could offer a realistic picture of the requirements of populations to avoid drastic alterations.

AB North American and European grasslands consist of relatively young communities that have evolved under human influences. These communities are uniformly sensitive to top-down controls and exhibit rapid changes in plant composition when the intensity and frequency of these controls are altered. These changes are intensifying due to the suite of global change factors, including the continued presence and introduction of new plant species. Establishment of nonnative plant species into grasslands requires resource opportunities generated by natural and human-induced disturbances and by niche differences of the new species. Persistence and spatial expansion require that the traits of the introduced species be compatible with a new regime of competitors, predators, pathogens, and symbionts. Plant traits of the invaders may then further facilitate the invasion process by preempting resources or by restructuring the soil microbial community and trophic food web in ways that directly or indirectly benefit the invading species.

AB Removal of predators can have strong indirect effects on primary producers through trophic cascades. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are major primary producers worldwide that may be influenced by predator removal through changes in grazer composition and biomass. CCA have been most widely studied in Caribbean and temperate reefs, where cover increases with increasing grazer biomass due to removal of competitive fleshy algae. However, each of these systems has one dominant grazer type, herbivorous fishes or sea urchins, which may not be functionally equivalent. Where fishes and sea urchins co-occur, fishing can result in a phase shift in the grazing community with subsequent effects on CCA and other substrata. Kenyan reefs have herbivorous fishes and sea urchins, providing an opportunity to determine the relative impacts of each grazer type and evaluate potential human-induced trophic cascades. We hypothesized that fish benefit CCA, abundant sea urchins erode CCA, and that fishing indirectly reduces CCA cover by removing sea urchin predators. We used closures and fished reefs as a large-scale, long-term natural experiment to assess how fishing and resultant changes in communities affect CCA abundance. We used a short-term caging experiment to directly test the effects of grazing on CCA. CCA cover declined with increasing fish and sea urchin abundance, but the negative impact of sea urchin grazing was much stronger than that of fishes. Abundant sea urchins reduced the CCA growth rate to almost zero and prevented CCA accumulation. A warming event (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) occurred during the 18-year study and had a strong but short-term positive effect on CCA cover. However, the effect of the ENSO on CCA was lower in magnitude than the effect of sea urchin grazing. We compare our results with worldwide literature on bioerosion by fishes and sea urchins. Grazer influence depends on whether benefits of fleshy algae removal outweigh costs of grazer-induced bioerosion. However, the cost-benefit ratio for CCA appears to change with grazer type, grazer abundance, and environment. In Kenya, predator removal leads to a trophic cascade that is expected to reduce net calcification of reefs and therefore reduce reef stability, growth, and resilience.

TI Coding Early Naturalists' Accounts into Long-Term Fish Community Changes

SO PLOS ONE

AB The understanding of fish communities' changes over the past centuries has important implications for conservation policy and marine resource management. However, reconstructing these changes is difficult because information on marine communities before the second half of the 20(th) century is, in most cases, anecdotal and merely qualitative. Therefore, historical qualitative records and modern quantitative data are not directly comparable, and their integration for long-term analyses is not straightforward. We developed a methodology that allows the coding of qualitative information provided by early naturalists into semi-quantitative information through an intercalibration with landing proportions. This approach allowed us to reconstruct and quantitatively analyze a 200-year-long time series of fish community structure indicators in the Northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Our analysis provides evidence of long-term changes in fish community structure, including the decline of Chondrichthyes, large-sized and late-maturing species. This work highlights the importance of broadening the time-frame through which we look at marine ecosystem changes and provides a methodology to exploit, in a quantitative framework, historical qualitative sources. To the purpose, naturalists' eyewitness accounts proved to be useful for extending the analysis on fish community back in the past, well before the onset of field-based monitoring programs.

AB Prey often avoid their predators but may, under certain conditions, remain in or even shift to space where predators are relatively abundant when threatened. Here, we review studies of habitat choices by multiple, sympatric prey species at risk from a shared predator to show that the defensive decision to avoid or select predator-rich space is contingent on prey escape behaviour. We suggest that prey species with escape tactics offering little chance of survival following an encounter should seek predator scarcity, whereas those with tactics whose post-encounter effectiveness is spatially correlated with predator abundance should be most likely to match the distribution of their predators. Furthermore, we argue that the nature of the defensive spatial response of a prey species with a particular escape tactic also depends on the hunting approach used by its predator and the setting of the predator-prey interaction (i.e. landscape features). Accordingly, an integrated approach that accounts for prey escape behaviour and the context provided by predator hunting mode and landscape features should lead to a better understanding of antipredator spatial shifts and improve our ability to anticipate the consequences of changes in predator numbers for prey distributions and ecosystem dynamics. We conclude by encouraging further exploration of contingency in antipredator behaviour and the possibility that generalist predators might indirectly influence prey resources and community properties via diverse pathways that are mediated by spatial shifts of prey species with different escape tactics.

AB A combination of divergent natural and sexual selection is a powerful cause of speciation. This conjunction of evolutionary forces may often occur when divergence is initiated by ecological differences between populations because local adaptation to new resources can lead to changes in sexual selection. The hypothesis that differences in resource use contribute to the evolution of reproductive isolation by altering the nature of sexual selection predicts that: (1) differences in sexual traits, such as signals and preferences, are an important source of reproductive isolation between species using different resources; (2) there are identifiable sources of selection on sexual traits that differ between species using different resources; and (3) signals vary between populations using different resources to a larger extent than between populations using the same resource at different localities. Testing these predictions requires a group of closely-related species or populations that specialize on different resources and for which the traits involved in mate choice are known. The Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) are host plant specialists in which speciation is associated with shifts to novel host plants. Mating in this complex is preceded by an exchange of vibrational signals transmitted through host plant stems, and the signal traits important for mate choice have been identified. In the E. binotata complex, previous work has supported the first two predictions: (1) signal differences between species are important in mate recognition and (2) host shifts can alter both the trait values favoured by sexual selection and the evolutionary response to that selection. In the present study, we tested the last prediction by conducting a large-scale study of mating signal variation within and between the 11 species in the complex. We find that differences in host use are strongly associated with differences in signal traits important for mate recognition. This result supports the hypothesis that hosts shifts have led to speciation in this group in part through their influence on divergence in mate communication systems.

AB The quantitative mapping of food web flows based on empirical data is a crucial yet difficult task in ecology. The difficulty arises from the under-sampling of food webs, because most data sets are incomplete and uncertain. In this article, we review methods to quantify food web flows based on empirical data using linear inverse models (LIM). The food web in a LIM is described as a linear function of its flows, which are estimated from empirical data by inverse modeling. The under-sampling of food webs implies that infinitely many different solutions exist that are consistent with a given data set. The existing approaches to food web LIM select a single solution from this infinite set by invoking additional assumptions: either a specific selection criterion that has no solid ecological basis is used or the data set is artificially upgraded by assigning fixed values to, for example, physiological parameters. Here, we advance a likelihood approach (LA) that follows a different solution philosophy. Rather than singling out one particular solution, the LA generates a large set of possible solutions from which the marginal probability density function (mPDF) of each flow and correlations between flows can be derived. The LA is exemplified with an example model of a soil food web and is made available in the open-source R-software. Moreover, we show how stoichiometric data, stable isotope signatures, and fatty acid compositions can be included in the LIM to alleviate the under-sampling problem. Overall, LIM prove to be a powerful tool in food web research, which can bridge the gap between empirical data and the analysis of food web structures.

AB Phenotypic plasticity has been studied intensively in experimental settings but infrequently in nature, and therefore the relevance of experimental findings is poorly known. This is especially true for morphological plasticity in amphibian larvae induced by predators and competitors. This paper describes a seven-year survey of head and tail shape in eight species of anuran and newt larvae in northern Switzerland, involving 6824 individual larvae and 59 ponds. I tested relationships between geometric measures of size and shape and five habitat gradients: pond permanence, cover by forest canopy and aquatic vegetation, and the densities of predators and competitors. Responses to competitors and predators were often similar to those reported in experiments. High competitor density was associated with small size and a large head in newt larvae, a long or deep head/body in anuran larvae, and a short or shallow tail in newts and some tadpoles. High predator density was correlated with a deep tail fin and tail muscle in many species. In anurans, the change in shape between low-and high-predator ponds in nature closely paralleled the plastic response to nonlethal predators in mesocosm experiments. The survey revealed many previously undescribed relationships between morphology and the other habitat features. Several species had relatively large tails in ponds that were shaded or thickly vegetated. Associations between year-to-year changes in shape and habitat within ponds implicated phenotypic plasticity rather than genetic population divergence, at least in anurans. These results inspire confidence in the relevance of experiments and highlight many new patterns that will merit further study.

AB Climate change is expected to drive species ranges towards the poles and to have a strong influence on species distributions. In this study, we focused on diadromous species that are of economical and ecological importance in the whole of Europe. We investigated the potential distribution of all diadromous fish regularly encountered in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East (28 species) under conditions predicted for twenty-first century climate change. To do so, we investigated the 1900 distribution of each species in 196 basins spread across all of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Four levels were used to semiquantitatively describe the abundance of species, that is missing, rare, common and abundant. We then selected five variables describing the prevailing climate in the basins, the physical nature of the basins and reflecting historical events known to have affected freshwater fish distribution. Logistic regressions with a four-level ordinal response variable were used to develop species-specific models. These predictive models related the observed distribution of these species in 1900 to the most explanatory combination of variables. Finally, we selected the A2 SRES scenario and the HadCM3 (Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3) global climate model (GCM) to obtain climate variables (temperature and precipitation) at the end of this century. We used these 2100 variables in our models and obtained maps of climatically suitable and unsuitable basins, percentages of contraction or expansion for each species. Twenty-two models were successfully built, that is there were five species for which no model could be established because their distribution range was too narrow and the Acipenser sturio model failed during calibration. All the models selected temperature or/and precipitation as explanatory variables. Responses to climate change were species-specific but could be classified into three categories: little or no change in the distribution (five species), expansion of the distribution range (three species gaining suitable basins mainly northward) and contraction of the distribution (14 species losing suitable basins). Shifting ranges were in accordance with those found in other studies and underlined the high sensitivity of diadromous fish to modifications in their environment.

AB The objective of this paper is to examine the scaling-up effect on the relationship between landscape patterns and land surface temperatures based on a case study of Indianapolis. United States. The integration of remote sensing. GIS, and landscape ecology methods was used in this study. Four TERRA ASTER images were acquired to derive the land-use and land-cover (LULC) patterns and land surface temperatures (LST) in different seasons. Each LULC and LST image was resampled to eight spatial scales: 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 250, 500, and 1,000 m. The scaling-up effect on the spatial and ecological characteristics of landscape patterns and LSTs were examined by the use of landscape metrics. Optimal spatial resolutions were determined on the basis of the minimum distance in the landscape metric spaces. The results show that the patch percentages Of LULC and LST patches were not strongly affected by the scaling-up process in different seasons. The patch densities and landscape shape indices and LST patches kept decreasing across the scales without distinct seasonal differences. Thirty meters was found to be the optimal resolution in the study of the relationship between urban LULG and LST clashes. Ninety meters was found to be the optimal spatial resolution for assessing the landscape-level relationship between LULC and LST patterns. This paper may provide useful information for urban planners and environmental practitioners to manage urban landscapes and urban thermal environments as a result of urbanization.

AB Diadromous fish are an important link between marine and freshwater food webs. Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) strongly impact nutrient dynamics in inland waters and anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) may play a similar ecological role along the Atlantic coast. The annual spawning migration of anadromous alewife contributes, on average, 1050 g of nitrogen and 120 g of phosphorus to Bride Brood, Connecticut, USA, through excretion and mortality each year. Natural abundance stable isotope analyses indicate that this influx of marine-derived nitrogen is rapidly incorporated into the stream food web. An enriched delta(15)N signal, indicative of a marine origin, is present at all stream trophic levels with the greatest level of enrichment coincident with the timing of the anadromous alewife spawning migration. There was no significant effect of this nutrient influx on water chemistry, leaf decomposition, or periphyton accrual. Dam removal and fish ladder construction will allow anadromous alewife to regain access to historical freshwater spawning habitats, potentially impacting food web dynamics and nutrient cycling in coastal freshwater systems.

AB Recent empirical and theoretical studies suggest that regions of restricted recombination play an important role in the formation of new species. To test this idea, we studied nucleotide variation in two parapatric subspecies of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We Surveyed five loci near centromeres, where recombination is expected to be suppressed, and five loci near telomeres, where recombination is expected to be higher. We analyzed this multilocus data set using a divergence-with-gene flow framework and we report three main findings. First, we estimated that these subspecies diverged similar to 1.8 MYA and maintained large effective population sizes (O. c. algirus N-e approximate to 1,600,000 and O. c. cuniculus N-e approximate to 780,000). Second, we rejected a strict allopatric model of divergence without gene flow; instead, high rates of gene flow were inferred in both directions. Third, we found different patterns between loci near centromeres and loci near telomeres. Loci near centromeres exhibited higher levels of linkage disequilibrium than loci near telomeres. In addition, while all loci near telomeres showed little differentiation between subspecies, three of five loci near centromeres showed strong differentiation. These results support a view of speciation in which regions of low recombination can facilitate species divergence in the presence of gene flow.

With both longitudinal data from a single social group, and cross-sectional data from multiple groups, we used fecal glucocorticoids (fGC) to examine potential stressors among spotted hyenas. Longitudinal data from adult members of a group living on the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, revealed that fGC concentrations were elevated during two periods of social upheaval among adults, especially among younger females; however, prey availability, rainfall, and presence of lions did not influence fGC concentrations among hyenas. Our results suggested that anthropogenic disturbance in the form of pastoralist activity, but not tourism, influenced fGC concentrations among adult male hyenas; rising concentrations of fGC among males over 12 years were significantly correlated with increasing human population density along the edge of the group's home range. As hyenas from this social group were frequently exposed to anthropogenic disturbance, we compared fGC concentrations among these hyenas with those obtained concurrently from hyenas living in three other groups undisturbed by pastoralist activity. We found that fGC concentrations from the undisturbed groups were significantly lower than those in the disturbed group, and we were able to rule out tourism and ecological stressors as sources of variation in fGC among the populations. Thus it appears that both social instability and anthropogenic disturbance, but not the ecological variables examined, elevate fGC concentrations and represent stressors for wild spotted hyenas. Further work will be necessary to determine whether interpopulation variation in stress physiology predicts population decline in groups exposed to intensive anthropogenic disturbance.

AB Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (as ammonium nitrate) was applied monthly onto the forest floor of one old-growth forest (> 400 years old, at levels of 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and two young forests (both about 70 years old, at levels of 50 and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) over 3 years (2004-2006), to investigate how nitrogen (N) input influenced N leaching output, and if there were differences in N retention between the old-growth and the young forests in the subtropical monsoon region of southern China. The ambient throughfall inputs were 23-27 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the young forests and 29-35 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the old-growth forest. In the control plots without experimental N addition, a net N retention was observed in the young forests (on average 6-11 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), but a net N loss occurred in the old-growth forest (-13 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Experimental N addition immediately increased DIN leaching in all three forests, with 25-66% of added N leached over the 3-year experiment. At the lowest level of N addition (50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), the percentage N loss was higher in the old-growth forest (66% of added N) than in the two young forests (38% and 26%). However, at higher levels of N addition (100 and 150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), the old-growth forest exhibited similar N losses (25-43%) to those in the young forests (28-43%). These results indicate that N retention is largely determined by the forest successional stages and the levels of N addition. Compared to most temperate forests studied in Europe and North America, N leaching loss in these seasonal monsoon subtropical forests occurred mainly in the rainy growing season, with measured N loss in leaching substantially higher under both ambient deposition and experimental N additions.

AB A few recent studies have suggested that glucocorticoid stress hormones can play a role in sexual selection. In terms of mate choice, these studies have shown that individuals can exhibit preferences for mates with either low baseline or peak glucocorticoid levels. This appears to occur because stress hormones can be key mediators of many condition-dependent, sexually selected traits that serve as honest signals of mate quality. We suggest that our understanding of how sexual selection can influence the glucocorticoid stress response will be expanded by studying the interactions among glucocorticoid stress hormones, sex steroids and body condition.

AB The North Bay of Biscay continental shelf is a major French demersal fishery, but little was known on the trophic food web of its benthic communities. In order to determine the benthic trophic web, the objectives of this study are to describe the macro- and megafaunal benthic community structure (species richness, abundance and biomass) and to establish the trophic pathways (food sources and trophic levels) by applying carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic analysis to the main benthic and demersal species (invertebrates and fish). Two distinct benthic communities have been identified: a muddy sand community within the central part of the bay, and an outer Bay of Biscay Ditrupa sand community of higher species richness, abundance and biomass than the muddy sand community. Deposit-feeders, suspension feeders and predators, distributed in three main trophic levels, dominate both communities. Large differences in stable carbon ratio values within the primary consumers provide evidence of two different food sources: i) a pelagic food source made up of recent sedimenting particulate organic matter on which zooplankton and suprabenthos feed and ii) a benthic detrital food source supplying deposit feeders and partly benthic suspension feeders. Differences in isotopic signatures were also observed within the upper trophic levels that allowed estimation of the contribution of each food source component to the diet of the upper consumers. Finally, the use of stable isotopic composition together with the species' feeding strategy allow identification of the main differences between the trophic functioning of the two benthic communities and highlight the importance of the role of detrital pathways in the carbon cycling within the continental shelf benthic trophic web.

AB Climate change is projected to increase stress for many coastal plant communities. Along large portions of the North American coast, habitat degradation from anthropogenic changes to the environment already threaten the community structure of tidal marshes and submerged aquatic grass beds. The potential loss of ecological services historically provided by these communities has been a long-standing rationale for aggressive control of invading plants such as Phragmites australis and Hydrilla verticillata. Increasing evidence of ecological services provided by invasive species such as P. australis and H. verticillata suggest that, in the face of increasing stress, it may be prudent to take a more pragmatic approach regarding the effect of these species on coastal ecosystems. The notable resilience of these species to control efforts and their competitive success and comparative vigor in stressed systems and capacity to provide at least some beneficial services combine to suggest some invasive species may have a useful role in managed coastal ecosystems.

AB Current agri-environmental schemes and subsidies for conservation and restoration of semi-natural grasslands do not explicitly assess land use changes affecting whole landscapes, but have so far focused on single objects and small areas. In this paper, we discuss a landscape perspective versus a "single object" perspective when conserving semi-natural grassland in agricultural landscapes. The focus is on the values biodiversity, cultural heritage, a vital countryside, and effects on economy when land use changes. We conclude that when land use change in the landscape surrounding an object, important additional effects on the different values are found. For example, a countryside where animals graze former arable fields and where marginal habitats are managed will have a positive effect, not only on the biodiversity associated to semi-natural grasslands, but also for the image of a vital and dynamic landscape. An increased number of roads, on the other hand, may negatively affect cultural heritage and decrease biodiversity in grasslands, leading to negative effects on the value of common goods through isolation. Placing objects in a larger spatial context and combining several different aspects into a landscape perspective, will improve long-term preservation of values associated to semi-natural grasslands.

AB Stable isotope ratios act as chemical tracers of animal diet, and are used to study food web dynamics. Because carbon stable isotope values are influenced by tissue lipid content, a number of extraction methods have been used to remove lipid bias, but, in some species and tissues, extractions also alter nitrogen isotope values. We have analyzed delta C-13 and delta N-15 in Atlantic bluefin tuna liver and white muscle, and whole Atlantic herring, fish tissues covering a wide range of lipid content (bulk C:N 3.1-12.5). In order to compare delta C-13 and delta N-15 values from traditional chloroform/methanol extractions with non-polar solvent alternatives, we analyzed samples following (1) no treatment, (2) lipid removal using chloroform/methanol (2:1), and (3) Soxhlet extractions using chloroform, diethyl ether or hexane. Chloroform/methanol and chloroform extractions produced the lowest C:N values and highest delta C-13 values. In bluefin tuna, chloroform and hexane extractions significantly altered liver delta N-15. and all methods significantly altered delta N-15 values in white muscle. Whole Atlantic herring delta N-15 was not altered by any extraction method, while the 2:1 chloroform/methanol extraction most completely removed fish tissue lipid components. Our results indicate that delta N-15 effects are not limited to common chloroform/methanol extractions and suggest that chloroform/methanol is the most effective extraction for delta C-13 correction. Given evidence for delta N-15 alteration among all tested methods, mathematical correction approaches should be further explored as an alternative to lipid correction.

AB The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis predicts that release from natural enemies in the introduced range favors exotic plants evolving to have greater competitive ability and lower herbivore resistance than conspecifics from the native range. We tested the EICA hypothesis in a common garden experiment with Sapium sebiferum in which seedlings from native (China) and invasive (USA) populations were grown in all pairwise combinations in the native range (China) in the presence of herbivores. When paired seedlings were from the same continent, shoot mass and leaf damage per seedling were significantly greater for plants from invasive populations than those from native populations. Despite more damage from herbivores, plants from invasive populations still outperformed those from native populations when they were grown together. Increased competitive ability and higher herbivory damage of invasive populations relative to native populations of S. sebiferum support the EICA hypothesis. Regression of biomass against percent leaf damage showed that plants from invasive populations tolerated herbivory more effectively than those from native populations. The results of this study suggest that S. sebiferum has become a faster-growing, less herbivore-resistant, and more herbivore-tolerant plant in the introduced range. This implies that increased competitive ability of exotic plants may be associated with evolutionary changes in both resistance and tolerance to herbivory in the introduced range. Understanding these evolutionary changes has important implications for biological control strategies targeted at problematic invaders.

AB Background: Clonal marine organisms exhibit high levels of morphological variation. Morphological differences may be a response to environmental factors but also they can be attributed to accumulated genetic differences due to disruption of gene flow among populations. In this study, we examined the extensive morphological variation (of 14 characters) in natural populations observed in the gorgonian Eunicea flexuosa, a widely distributed Caribbean octocoral. Eco-phenotypic and genetic effects were evaluated by reciprocal transplants of colonies inhabiting opposite ends of the depth gradient and analysis of population genetics of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, respectively.
   Results: Significant differences (P < 0.001) in 14 morphological traits were found among colonies inhabiting 12 locations distributed in seven reefs in southwest Puerto Rico. Results from principal component analysis indicated the presence of two groups based on depth distribution, suggesting the presence of two discrete morphotypes (i.e. shallow type < 5 m and deep type > 17 m). A discriminant function analysis based on a priori univariate and multivariate analyses (which separated the colonies in morphotypes) correctly classified 93% of the colonies for each environment. Light, water motion and sediment transport might influence the distribution of the two morphotypes. Reaction norms of morphological characters of colonies reciprocally transplanted showed gradual significant changes through the 15 months of transplantation. Sclerites of shallow water colonies became larger when transplanted to deeper environments and vice versa, but neither of the two transplanted groups overlapped with the residents' morphology. Genetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear genes suggested that such discrete morphology and non-overlapping phenotypic plasticity is correlated with the presence of two independent evolutionary lineages. The distribution of the lineages is non-random and may be related to adaptational responses of each lineage to the environmental demands of each habitat.
   Conclusion: The extensive distribution and ample morphological variation of Eunicea flexuosa corresponds to two distinct genetic lineages with narrower distributions and more rigid phenotypic plasticity than the original description. The accepted description sensu Bayer (1961) of E. flexuosa is a complex of at least two distinct genetic lineages, adapted to different habitats and do not exchange genetic material despite living in sympatry. The present study highlights the importance of correctly defining species, because the unknowingly use of species complexes can overestimate geographical distribution, population abundance, and physiological tolerance.

AB Previous model classification efforts have led to a broad group of models from site-scale (non-spatial) gap models to continental-scale biogeographical models due to a lack of definition of landscape models. Such classifications become inefficient to compare approaches and techniques that are specifically associated with forest landscape modeling. This paper provides definitions of key terminologies commonly used in forest landscape modeling to classify forest landscape models. It presents a set of qualitative criteria for model classification. These criteria represent model definitions and key model implementation decisions, including the temporal resolution, number of spatial processes simulated, and approaches to simulate site-level succession. Four approaches of simulating site level succession are summarized: (1) no site-level succession (spatial processes as surrogates), (2) successional pathway, (3) vital attribute, and (4) model coupling. Computational load for the first three approaches is calculated using the Big O Notation, a standard method. Classification criteria are organized in a hierarchical order that creates a dichotomous tree with each end node representing a group of models with similar traits. The classified models fall into various groups ranging from theoretical and empirical to strategic and tactical. The paper summarizes the applications of forest landscape models into three categories: (1) spatiotemporal patterns of model objects, (2) sensitivities of model object to input parameters, and (3) scenario analyses. Finally, the paper discusses two dilemmas related to the use of forest landscape models: result validation and circular reasoning. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. We investigated patterns in the dispersion (i.e. spread and spacing) of plant species traits that are frequently associated with competitive ability, in an old-field plant community. In contrast with previous studies, we found no evidence for significant over- or under-dispersion of maximum plant height, maximum plant biomass, or seed mass.
   2. These findings hold across three plot sizes (10 x 10 cm, 30 x 30 em, 50 x 50 cm), and when plot size is measured in terms of number of ramets (50 ramets, 250 ramets or 500 ramets) rather than per unit area. Plot size, however, significantly affected the direction of dispersion observed across test statistics, supporting previous studies that have observed that trait dispersion patterns are sensitive to plot size.
   3. While no significant dispersion was detected, dispersion direction, measured as the tendency for a two-tailed test to indicate trends for a given trait, was more frequently observed when analyses were weighted by abundance. Abundance weighted analyses had significantly different dispersion directions compared with presence/absence analyses for one of three traits considered. These findings suggest that abundance weighted analyses may yield more consistent trait dispersion patterns.
   4. Synthesis. Our results may be interpreted as evidence for limited, if any, functional niche partitioning between co-occurring species via size-mediated differences in rooting depth or physical space niches (i.e. limiting similarity). Alternatively, some species with large differences in competitive traits may avoid competition through niche separation, while others may simply compete asymmetrically, leading to overall patterns of dispersion that cannot be distinguished from random. This interpretation supports recent perspectives that niche and neutral theoretical concepts are not mutually exclusive; both, working together, can be applied to the interpretation of plant community assembly and structure.

AB The population genetic structure of the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting in the eastern Mediterranean was assessed by sequencing a fragment of the control region of the mitochondrial DNA (n = 190) and seven microsatellites (n = 112). The two types of markers revealed genetic structuring (mtDNA: gamma(st) = 0.212, P < 0.001; nDNA F (st) = 0.006, P < 0.001), thus indicating that both females and males are philopatric and that gene flow between populations is restricted. Mitochondrial DNA data indicate that the female populations nesting on the islands of Crete and Cyprus have suffered a recent bottleneck or colonization event. However, no bottleneck or founder effect was revealed by nuclear markers, thus indicating male-mediated gene flow from other populations that would increase nuclear genetic variability. Crete, and to a lower extent Cyprus, are thought to play a central role in such male-mediated gene flow that may reduce the negative effect of genetic drift or inbreeding on the small populations of Lebanon and Israel. This population structure indicates that assessing population relevance only on the basis of genetic variability and size would be misleading, as some populations not fulfilling those requirements may play a relevant role in genetic exchange and hence contribute to the overall genetic variability.

AB Community biomass is often less variable than the biomasses of populations within the community, yet attempts to implicate compensatory dynamics between populations as a cause of this relationship often fail. In part, this may be due to the lack of appropriate metrics for variability, but there is also great potential for large-scale processes such as seasonality or longer-term environmental change to obscure important dynamics at other temporal scales. In this study, we apply a scale-resolving method to long-term plankton data, to identify the specific temporal scales at which community-level variability is influenced by synchrony or compensatory dynamics at the population level. We show that variability at both the population and community level is influenced strongly by a few distinct temporal scales: in phytoplankton, ciliate, rotifer, and crustacean communities, synchronous dynamics are predominant at most temporal scales. However, in phytoplankton and crustacean communities, compensatory dynamics occur at a sub-annual scale (and at the annual scale in crustaceans) leading to substantial reductions in community-level variability. Aggregate measures of population and community variability (to not detect compensatory dynamics in these communities; thus, resolving their scale dependence unmasks dynamics that are important for community stability in this system. The methods and results presented herein will ultimately lead to a better understanding of how stability is achieved in communities.

AB Forest canopy height is a critical parameter in better quantifying the terrestrial carbon cycle. It can be used to estimate aboveground biomass and carbon pools stored in the vegetation, and predict timber yield for forest management. Polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) uses polarimetric separation of scattering phase cderived from interferometry to estimate canopy height. A limitation of PollnSAR is that it relies on sufficient scattering phase center separation at each pixel to be able to derive accurate forest canopy height estimates. The effect of wavelength-dependent penetration depth into the canopy is known to be strong, and could potentially lead to a better height separation than relying on polarization combinations at one wavelength alone. Here we present a new method for canopy height mapping using dual-wavelength SAR interferometry (InSAR) at X- and L-band. The method is based on the scattering phase center separation at different wavelengths. It involves the generation of a smoothed interpolated terrain elevation model underneath the forest canopy from repeat-pass L-band InSAR data. The terrain model is then used to remove the terrain component from the single-pass X-band interferometric surface height to estimate forest canopy height. The ability of L-band to map terrain height under vegetation relies on sufficient spatial heterogeneity of the density of scattering elements that scatter L-band electromagnetic waves within each resolution cell. The method is demonstrated with airborne X-band VV polarized single-pass and L-band HH polarized repeat-pass SAR interferometry using data acquired by the E-SAR sensor over Monks Wood National Nature Reserve, UK. This is one of the first radar studies of a semi-natural deciduous woodland that exhibits considerable spatial heterogeneity of vegetation type and density. The canopy height model is validated using airborne imaging LIDAR data acquired by the Environment Agency. The rmse of the LIDAR canopy height estimates compared to theodolite data is 2.15 m (relative error 17.6%). The rmse of the dual-wavelength InSAR-derived canopy height model compared to LIDAR is 3.49 m (relative error 28.5%). From the canopy height maps carbon pools are estimated using allometric equations. The results are compared to a field survey of carbon pools and rmse values are presented. The dual-wavelength InSAR method could potentially be delivered from a spaceborne constellation similar to the TerraSAR system. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The interaction between landscape structure and spatial patterns of plant invasion has been little addressed by ecologists despite the new insights it can provide. Because of their spatial configuration as highly connected networks, linear wetlands such as roadside or agricultural ditches, can serve as corridors facilitating invasion at the landscape scale, but species dynamics in these important habitats are not well known. We conducted a landscape scale analysis of Phragmites australis invasion patterns (1985-2002 and 1987-2002) in two periurban areas of southern Quebec (Canada) focusing on the interaction between the network of linear wetlands and the adjacent land-uses. Results show that, at the beginning of the reference period, the two landscapes were relatively non-invaded and populations occurred mostly in roadside habitats which then served as invasion foci into other parts of the landscape. The intrinsic rates of increase of P. australis populations in linear anthropogenic habitats were generally higher than those reported for natural wetlands. Riparian habitats along streams and rivers were little invaded compared to anthropogenic linear wetlands, except when they intersected transportation rights-of-way. Bivariate spatial point pattern analysis of colonization events using both Euclidian and network distances generally showed spatial dependence (association) to source populations. An autologistic regression model that included landscape and edaphic variables selected transportation rights-of-way as the best predictor of P. australis occurrence patterns in one of the landscapes. Given the high invasion rates observed, managers of linear wetlands should carefully monitor expansion patterns especially when roads intersect landscapes of conservation or economic value.

AB In this study, 40 Atlanto-Mediterranean coastal lagoons were analyzed in order to evaluate the extent to which their ecological characteristics depend on hydrographic, trophic or geomorphologic features. Fish species richness increases with lagoon volume and the openness parameter, which characterizes the potential influence of the sea on general lagoon hydrology and is related to the total transversal area of the inlets, which connect the lagoon to the sea. On the other hand, the number of species decreases exponentially with the phosphate concentration in water. The fishing yield increases with the chlorophyll a concentration in the water column and exponentially with shoreline development. With respect to the fish assemblage composition, geomorphologic features alone explain 22% of the variance in the canonical analyses and an additional 75% when including the hydrographic and trophic characteristics of the lagoon, the latter on its own explaining only 3% of the observed differences.

AB Trophic level interactions between predators create complex relationships such as intraguild predation. Theoretical research has predicted two possible paths to stability in intraguild systems: intermediate predators either outcompete higher-order predators for shared resources or select habitat based on security. The effects of intraguild predation on intermediate mammalian predators such as swift foxes ( Vulpes velox) are not well understood. We examined the relationships between swift foxes and both their predators and prey, as well the effect of vegetation structure on swift fox-coyote ( Canis latrans) interactions, between August 2001 and August 2004. In a natural experiment created by the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in southeastern Colorado, USA, we documented swift fox survival and density in a variety of landscapes and compared these parameters in relation to prey availability, coyote abundance, and vegetation structure. Swift fox density varied significantly between study sites, while survival did not. Coyote abundance was positively related to the basal prey species and vegetation structure, while swift fox density was negatively related to coyote abundance, basal prey species, and vegetation structure. Our results support the prediction that, under intraguild predation in terrestrial systems, top predator distribution matches resource availability ( resource match), while intermediate predator distribution inversely matches predation risk ( safety match). While predation by coyotes may be the specific cause of swift fox mortality in this system, the more general mechanism appears to be exposure to predation moderated by shrub density.

AB Strong pressure on landscapes in South Korea from urbanisation is leading to severe environmental problems, changes in landscape character, and loss and fragmentation of woodlands which threaten biodiversity. Sustainable land use approaches for nature conservation are urgently needed to effectively counter these trends. This research develops and tests a methodological approach to assess the biodiversity potential of landscapes in city regions to provide the necessary information for this purpose. Landscape character assessment, an approach developed in the UK, is adapted and tested in Kwangju, a fast growing city region in the South west of the Korean peninsula. Twelve landscape character types are distinguished and landscape metrics (landscape heterogeneity, patch shape, patch context and patch distance) are customised to provide quantitative information on their biodiversity potential. Only land cover data that could be obtained from existing topographical maps and aerial photographs is required for this approach. It is suggested that the methodology presented in this paper can provide the necessary information to support sustainable land use planning for nature conservation in Korean city regions and elsewhere.

AB An understanding of why introduced species achieve ecological success in novel environments often requires information about the factors that limit the abundance of these taxa in their native ranges. Although numerous recent studies have evaluated the importance of natural enemies in this context, relatively few have examined how ecological success may result from differences in the magnitude of interference competition between communities in the native and introduced ranges of nonnative species. Here we examine how native-range competitive environments may relate to invasion success for two important invasive species, the red imported. re ant ( Solenopsis invicta) and the Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile), in a region of native-range sympatry. At two study sites in northern Argentina, we used stable-isotope analysis, a variety of observational approaches, and two different reciprocal removal experiments to test ( 1) whether S. invicta competes asymmetrically with L. humile ( as suggested by the 20th century pattern of replacement in the southeastern United States) and ( 2) the extent to which these two species achieve behavioral and numerical dominance. Stable-isotope analysis and activity surveys indicated that S. invicta and L. humile are both omnivores and forage during broadly overlapping portions of the diel cycle. Short-term removal experiments at baits revealed no competitive asymmetry between S. invicta and L. humile. Longer-term colony removal experiments illustrated that S. invicta and L. humile experience an approximately equal competitive release upon removal of the other. Our results indicate that neither S. invicta nor L. humile achieves the same degree of behavioral or ecological dominance where they co-occur in native populations as they do in areas where either is common in their introduced range. These results strongly suggest that interspecific competition is an important limiting factor for both S. invicta and L. humile in South America.

AB The impact of environmental change on animal populations is strongly influenced by the ability of individuals to plastically adjust key life-history events. There is therefore considerable interest in establishing the degree of plasticity in traits and how selection acts on plasticity in natural populations. Breeding time is a key life-history trait that affects fitness and recent studies have found that females vary significantly in their breeding time-environment relationships, with selection often favouring individuals exhibiting stronger plastic responses. In contrast, here, we show that although breeding time in the common guillemot, Uria aalge, is highly plastic at the population level in response to a large-scale environmental cue (the North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO), there is very little between-individual variation-most individuals respond to this climate cue very similarly. We demonstrate strong stabilizing selection against individuals who deviate from the average population-level response to NAO. This species differs significantly from those previously studied in being a colonial breeder, in which reproductive synchrony has a substantial impact on fitness; we suggest that counter selection imposed by a need for synchrony could limit individuals in their response and potential for directional selection to act. This demonstrates the importance of considering the relative costs and benefits of highly plastic responses in assessing the likely response of a population to the environmental change.

AB Data from completely sequenced genomes are likely to open the way for novel studies of the genetics of nonmodel organisms, in particular when it comes to the identification and analysis of genes responsible for traits that are under selection in natural populations. Here we use the draft sequence of the chicken genome as a starting point for linkage mapping in a wild bird species, the collared flycatcher-one of the most well-studied avian species in ecological and evolutionary research. A pedigree of 365 flycatchers was established and genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms in 23 genes selected from (and spread over most of) the chicken Z chromosome. All genes were also found to be located on the Z chromosome in the collared flycatcher, confirming conserved synteny at the level of gene content across distantly related avian lineages. This high degree of conservation mimics the situation seen for the mammalian X chromosome and may thus be a general feature in sex chromosome evolution, irrespective of whether there is male or female heterogamety. Alternatively, such unprecedented chromosomal conservation may be characteristic of most chromosomes in avian genome evolution. However, several internal rearrangements were observed, meaning that the transfer of map information from chicken to nonmodel bird species cannot always assume conserved gene orders. Interestingly, the rate of recombination on the Z chromosome of collared flycatchers was only similar to 50% that of chicken, challenging the widely held view that birds generally have high recombination rates.

AB 1. Worldwide, increasing numbers of stream restoration projects are being initiated to rehabilitate waterways modified by urbanisation. However, many of these projects have limited success in restoring stream communities. Prompted by this, we investigated previously unrecognised barriers to aquatic insect colonisation in urban streams.
   2. To investigate whether the availability of suitable substrata for oviposition limited the longitudinal distribution of caddisflies, large boulders were added to the upstream reaches of one stream. Prior to the addition, more egg masses were observed downstream and this longitudinal pattern persisted subsequently.
   3. Malaise trapping revealed that adult caddisfly diversity and abundance was greater downstream than upstream. Furthermore, in a previous study the authors found larval caddisflies reflected the longitudinal distribution of adults.
   4. The only obvious potential obstructions between reaches were roads beneath which the stream flowed through culverted crossings. Malaise trapping was used to examine the effect of road culverts and bridges on caddisfly dispersal. Numbers of caddisflies caught declined upstream and about 2.5 x more individuals were taken in traps immediately below than above five culverts.
   4. Bridges, which had a more open structure than culverts, had no significant effect on the size of catches made above and below them.
   5. Road culverts could act as partial barriers to upstream flight, with consequences for larval recruitment in urban streams. We recommend that urban planners and designers of restoration projects consider possible synergistic effects of poor oviposition habitat and barriers to aquatic insect dispersal, which may be critical for the colonisation of urban headwater streams and for the maintenance of stream insect populations.

AB Hybrid zones provide an excellent opportunity for studying the consequences of genetic changes between closely related taxa. Here we investigate patterns of genetic variability and gene flow at four X-linked loci within and between the two subspecies of European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus and O. c. algirus). Two of these genes are located near the centromere and two are located near the telomeres. We observed a deep split in the genealogy of each gene with the root located along the deepest branch in each case, consistent with the evolution of these subspecies in allopatry. The two centromeric loci showed low levels of variability, high levels of linkage disequilibrium, and little introgression between subspecies. In contrast, the two telomeric loci showed high levels of variability, low levels of linkage disequilibrium, and considerable introgression between subspecies. These data are consistent with suppression of recombination near the centromere of the rabbit X chromosome. These observations support a view of speciation where genomic incompatibilities at different loci in the genome create localized differences in levels of gene flow between nascent species.

AB Ecological "niche modeling'' using presence-only locality data and large-scale environmental variables provides a powerful tool for identifying and mapping suitable habitat for species over large spatial extents. We describe a niche modeling approach that identies a minimum (rather than an optimum) set of basic habitat requirements for a species, based on the assumption that constant environmental relationships in a species' distribution (i.e., variables that maintain a consistent value where the species occurs) are most likely to be associated with limiting factors. Environmental variables that take on a wide range of values where a species occurs are less informative because they do not limit a species' distribution, at least over the range of variation sampled. This approach is operationalized by partitioning Mahalanobis D(2) (standardized difference between values of a set of environmental variables for any point and mean values for those same variables calculated from all points at which a species was detected) into independent components. The smallest of these components represents the linear combination of variables with minimum variance; increasingly larger components represent larger variances and are increasingly less limiting. We illustrate this approach using the California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica Brewster) and provide SAS code to implement it.

AB This study examines the role of surface geomorphic features in tree establishment at the alpine treeline in Glacier National Park, Montana, through the presentation of a multiscale, conceptual model of biogeomorphic relationships at alpine treeline. Empirical observations gathered through a multiscale field methodology over three summers serve as a base for the model. The model highlights the importance of surface geomorphic features, specifically boulders and terrace risers, in creating favorable local site conditions, largely by protecting seedlings from wind. The sheltering effect of surface features enables initial seedling establishment, and in some cases survival, above current treeline locations, thereby initiating a positive feedback effect that encourages subsequent tree establishment. Geomorphic features are therefore important in linking scales of pattern and process at the alpine treeline ecotone.

AB Stable isotopes have been used to analyse food webs and (or) trace movements of animals for about 30 years. There has been some debate on the use of different tissues and treatments before isotope analysis, as well as on seasonal effects. We found different crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) tissues (muscle, hepatopancreas, exoskeleton, gill, and whole body) to have different isotope values. Lipid extraction made whole-body carbon isotope values higher but had no effect on nitrogen isotope values. Acidification made whole-body isotope values lower. For crayfish, there was no seasonal or interannual variation in isotope values. In contrast to studies based on gut content analysis, we found adult crayfish to be at least as carnivorous as young-of-the-year crayfish. Earlier studies often have assumed that each food source contributes both nitrogen and carbon in equal proportions. Omnivores do not fit easily into this view. We suggest that nitrogen and carbon in an organism could come from different sources. Adopting this view for a pond food web could render crayfish both predators and detritivores as crayfish prey on nitrogen sources (other invertebrates) and consume large amounts of detritus to satisfy their carbon demand.

AB Sixteen landscape metrics were evaluated with respect to the effects of spatial aggregation oil six different years of Landsat data for a deforested area in Rondonia, Brazil. Spatial aggregation was performed by two methods. The first method involved varying the window size in texture mean co-occurrence filtering prior to classification. The second method involved aggregating the data post-classification by resampling with a majority filter. The Landscape Shape Index (LSI) and Square Pixel (SqP) metric showed the most predictable behavior of the shape complexity metrics having strong decreases with each increase in aggregation. The Edge Density (ED) and Patch Densh, (PD) metrics showed the most predictable behavior among the edge and patch metrics, decreasing with increasing aggregation. The Mean Nearest Neighbor (MNN) metric also behaved as expected but its results were less consistent than those of ED and PD. Many of the remaining metrics gave inconsistent and unpredictable results with respect to spatial aggregation. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Ancient lakes have long been recognized as evolutionary theatres and hot spots of endemism; the evolution of their morphologically often highly diverse species flocks has received much attention. However, as each ancient lake has its own geological and evolutionary history, modes of speciation may differ from system to system. Ancient lakes can act as evolutionary reservoirs that assure the survival of relict species, but at the same time extant species may evolve through intralacustrine speciation. Other aspects of interest are the actual rates of immigration, diversification or extinction as well as the temporal framework of morphological change. Many of these questions have been addressed in the African (e.g. Lake Tanganyika) and Asian (e.g. Lake Baikal) ancient lakes. For an European ancient lakes (e.g. Lakes Ohrid and Prespa), such studies are largely missing. In the present paper. extraordinarily shaped endemic freshwater limpets of the genus Ancylus from the Balkan Lake Ohrid are used in a phylogeographic and phylogenetic context to test whether they represent an ancient lake species flock, to study the mode of speciation, and to assess the timing of morphological change. Based on DNA data from two mitochondrial genes (COI, LSU rDNA), it has been found that the Lake Ohrid Ancylus species form an endemic monophyletic group. In addition, the lake's feeder springs are inhabited by another, undescribed Ancylus species. All other studied waterbodies within the watershed do not support their own Ancylus lineages but are inhabited by a widespread Mediterranean taxon. The split between the species endemic to the take and its sister taxon is dated to 1.4 +/- 0.6 million years ago. The study presents the first genetic confirmation for the existence of a species flock in a European ancient lake. Contrary to the prevailing opinion it shows that, concerning Ancylus, Lake Ohrid represents a site of intralacustrine speciation rather than an evolutionary reservoir, Moreover, it provides the first evidence for rapid morphological change in an European ancient lake species flock.

AB 1. There is significant concern over the impacts of plant invasions on habitat quality for native fauna. Recent research suggests that non-native Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) invasions may negatively affect the performance of larval American Toad tadpoles (Bufo americanus), and that compounds leached from L. salicaria leaves play a direct or indirect role in this effect.
   2. We raised individual B. americanus and Gray Treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles on high-quality diets in aqueous extracts of senescent leaves from L. salicaria, native Broad-Leaf Cattail (Typha latifolia), and control water to determine whether loosestrife extracts directly affect anuran tadpole performance.
   3. Even at high artificial food levels, B. americanus survival was significantly lower in L. salicaria extracts compared with T. latifolia extracts and a water control. Food level strongly affected B. americanus development, but tadpoles raised in L. salicaria extract were less developed compared with conspecifics raised in cattail extract or water. Unlike B. americanus, Hyla performance was not affected by exposure to any plant extract compared with the water control.
   4. Our study implicates secondary plant compounds as a mechanism underlying the impact of an invasive plant on some but not all native fauna. We hypothesize that high tannin concentrations of L. salicaria leaves have the potential to create environments that are directly toxic to B. americanus tadpoles. We hypothesize that obligate gill breathers such as B. americanus tadpoles are highly sensitive to gill damage caused by high concentrations of phenolics. Other anuran species such as H. versicolor that develop well-functioning lungs early may be less affected by high tannin concentrations.

AB Habitat fragmentation is often considered a major threat to biodiversity; however, our understanding of bow fragmentation impacts populations is poor. Identifying appropriate models for such studies is difficult. Tree squirrels are dependent on mature forests for food, cover and nests; these are habitats that are being fragmented rapidly and that are easily defined by humans. Squirrels represent excellent models for study of fragmentation. The literature on tree squirrels was reviewed to glean data on density and home-range size in forest fragments. Sufficient data were available on four species (Sciurus carolinensis, S. niger S. vulgaris, Tamiascittrus hudsonicus). Density was negatively related to fragment size for S. carolinensis and S. niger and marginally so for T hudsonicus. Sciurus vulgaris did not exhibit this relationship. Home-range size was analysed for three species of Scittrus and was positively related to forest fragment size for S. carolinensis and S. niger. Again, only S. vulgaris did not to show this relationship. Sciurus vulgaris is rarely found in small forest fragments and is believed to be especially sensitive to fragmentation; other tree squirrels appear to be sensitive to fragmentation in more subtle ways. Home range compaction provides a mechanism by which densities may increase in small fragments. The demographic consequences resultant from the high densities of squirrels found in small woodlots are not known but may explain the forest damage, avian nest predation and reduced diversity often cited to occur in woodland fragments.

AB This article presents an analysis of plant species richness and diversity and its association with climatic and soil variables along a 1300-m elevation gradient on the Cerro Tlaloc Mountain in the northern Sierra Nevada in Mexico. Two 1000-m(2) tree sampling plots were created at each of 21 selected sampling sites, as well as two 250-m(2) plots for shrubs and Six 9-m(2) plots for herbaceous plants. Species richness and diversity were estimated for each plant life form, and beta diversity between sites was estimated along the gradient. The relationship between species richness and diversity and environmental variables was modelled using simple linear correlation and regression trees. Species richness and diversity showed a unimodal pattern with a bias towards high values in the lower half of the elevation gradient under study. This response was consistent for all three life forms. Beta diversity increased steadily along the elevation gradient, being lower between contiguous sites at intermediate elevations and high - the species replacement rate was nearly 100%-between sites at the extremes of the gradient. Few species were adapted to the full spectrum of environmental variation along the elevation gradient studied. The regression tree suggests that differences in species richness are mainly influenced by elevation (temperature and humidity) and sod variables, namely A(2) permanent wilting point, organic matter and horizon field capacity and A(1) horizon Mg2+.

AB Animals show a variety of antipredator strategies in response to the presence of chemical cues from mammalian predators. Nevertheless, there is no general agreement as to whether recognition of predator odours is dependent upon experience. We conducted an experiment on European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus naive to any contact with predators and we investigated (1) whether they possessed a mechanism for the recognition of the odour of a predator, and (2) how they responded behaviourally and physiologically to that odour. We used fox Vulpes vulpes faeces as the source of the predator odour and sheep Ovis aries faeces as a nonpredator control odour. The experiments were conducted in small outdoor enclosures where the animals were kept singly. We recorded patterns of vigilance, activity and feeding, and changes in glucocorticoids and body mass. The rabbits showed a clear antipredator response to the presence of fox faeces, whereas they behaved neutrally in response to sheep odour. The response consisted of increased avoidance and vigilance while feeding and more investigation before feeding. Furthermore, the rabbits showed a physiological alarm response, that is, an increased responsiveness of their adrenocortical system and weight loss. However, the total activity budget, measured as time spent outside the burrow, the time spent feeding, and the amount of food ingested remained largely stable during the experiment. We conclude that rabbits recognised predator odours and that this recognition was independent of experience. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although it has been suggested that Pleistocene climate changes drove population differentiation and speciation in many groups of organisms, population genetic evidence in support of this scenario has been ambiguous, and it has often been difficult to distinguish putative vicariance from simple isolation by distance. The sky island communities of the American Southwest present an ideal system in which to compare late Pleistocene range fragmentations documented by palaeoenvironmental studies with population genetic data from organisms within these communities. In order to elucidate the impact of Pleistocene climate fluctuations on these environments, biogeographic patterns in the flightless longhorn cactus beetle, Moneilema appressum were examined using mitochondrial DNA sequence data. Gene tree relationships between haplotypes were inferred using parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian analysis. Nested clade analysis, Mantel tests, and coalescent modelling were employed to examine alternative biogeographic scenarios, and to test the hypothesis that Pleistocene climate changes drove population differentiation in this species. The program MDIV was used to estimate migration and divergence times between populations, and to measure the statistical support for isolation over ongoing migration. These analyses showed significant geographic structure in genetic relationships, and implicated topography as a key determinant of isolation. However, although the coalescent analyses suggested that a history of past habitat fragmentation underlies the observed geographic patterns, the nested clade analysis indicated that the pattern was consistent with isolation by distance. Estimated divergence times indicated that range fragmentation in M. appressum is considerably older than the end of the most recent glacial, but coincided with earlier interglacial warming events and with documented range expansions in other, desert-dwelling species of Moneilema.

AB Evolutionary lineages differ with regard to the variety of forms they exhibit. We investigated whether comparisons of morphological diversity can be used to identify differences in ecological diversity in two sister clades of centrarchid fishes. Species in the Lepomis clade (sunfishes) feed on a wider range of prey items than species in the Micropterus clade (black basses). We quantified disparity in morphology of the feeding apparatus as within-clade variance on principal components and found that Lepomis exhibits 4.4 and 7.4 times more variance than Micropterus on the first two principal components. However, lineages are expected to diversify morphologically and ecologically given enough time, and this pattern could have arisen due to differences in the amount of time each clade has had to accumulate variance. Despite being sister groups, the age of the most recent common ancestor of Lepomis is approximately 14.6 million years ago and its lineages have a total length of 86.4 million years while the age of the most recent common ancestor of Micropterus is only about 8.4 million years ago, and it has a total branch length of 42.9 million years. We used the Brownian motion model of character evolution to test the hypothesis that time of independent evolution of each clade's lineages accounts for differences in morphological disparity and determined that the rates of evolution of the first two principal components are 4.4 and 7.7 times greater in Lepomis. Thus, time and phylogeny do not account for the differences in morphological disparity observed in Lepomis and Micropterus, and other diversity-promoting mechanisms should be investigated.

AB We introduce the use of systematic, combinatorial, multiobjective optimization models to analyse ecological-economic tradeoffs and to support complex decision-making associated with dam removal in a river system. The model's ecological objective enhances salmonid migration and spawning by maximizing drainage area reconnected to the sea. The economic objective minimizes loss of hydropower and storage capacity. We present a proof-of-concept demonstration for the Willamette River watershed (Oregon, USA). The case study shows a dramatic tradeoff in which removing twelve dams reconnects 52% of the basin while sacrificing only 1.6% of hydropower and water-storage capacity. Additional ecological gains, however, come with increasingly steeper economic costs. A second model incorporates existing fish-passage systems. Because of data limitations and model simplifications, these results are intended solely for the purpose of illustrating a novel application of multiobjective programming to dam-removal issues. Far more work would be needed to make policy-relevant recommendations. Nevertheless, this research suggests that the current practice of analysing dam-removal decisions on a dam-by-dam, basis be supplemented by evaluation on a river-system basis, trading off economic and ecological goals.

AB In this review we argue that theories and methodology arising from the field of complex systems form a new paradigm for ecology. Patterns and processes resulting from interactions between individuals, populations, species and communities in landscapes are the core topic of ecology. These interactions form complex networks, which are the subject of intense research in complexity theory, informatics and statistical mechanics. This research has shown that complex natural networks often share common structures such as loops, trees and clusters. The observed structures contribute to widespread processes including feedback, non-linear dynamics, criticality and self-organisation. Simulation modelling is a key tool in studying complex networks and has become popular in ecology, especially in adaptive management. Important techniques include cellular automata and individual-based models. The complex systems paradigm has led to advances in landscape ecology, including a deeper understanding of the dynamics of spatial pattern formation, habitat fragmentation, epidemic processes, and genetic variation. Network analysis reveals that underlying patterns of interactions, such as small worlds and clusters, in food webs and ecosystems have strong implications for their stability and dynamics. These investigations illustrate how complexity theory and associated methodologies are transforming ecological research, providing new perspectives on old questions as well as raising many new ones.

AB We evaluated the impact of marine materials on the diet and abundance of arthropodivorous lizards inhabiting islands and the coast of the Gulf of California. Here, marine materials are brought onto land by seabirds and by tidal action, and both subsidy pathways cause arthropod abundance to increase. We evaluated Uta stansburiana (side-blotched lizard) diets in three habitats defined by having: (1) no marine subsidies available, (2) only seabird-derived subsidies, and (3) only tidal-derived subsidies. Stable isotope data indicated that lizard diets are subsidized indirectly by seabird and tidal activity. For example, in coastal areas we determined that 40% of a lizard's diet contains arthropods that have consumed algae. Such subsidies may explain why we found that lizards in coastal areas occupy a significantly higher trophic position than lizards in unsubsidized areas. We analyzed eight years of survey data on all arthropodivorous lizards to determine if diet subsidies result in increased lizard abundance. We found that lizards were more abundant in coastal areas than they were in inland habitats, and that they were more abundant on islands with seabirds than on islands without seabird populations. This study provides insight into the importance and effect of marine-derived nutrients from multiple sources on vertebrate consumers inhabiting islands and coastal areas.

AB The human genome is particularly rich in low-copy repeats (LCRs) or segmental duplications (5%-10%), and this characteristic likely distinguishes us from lower mammals such as rodents. How and why the complex human genome architecture consisting of multiple LCRs has evolved remains an open question. Using molecular and computational analyses of human and primate genomic regions, we analyzed the structure and evolution of LCRs that resulted in complex architectural features of the human genome in proximal 17p. We found that multiple LCRs of different origins are situated adjacent to one another, whereas each LCR changed at different time points between >25 to 3-7 million years ago (Mya) during primate evolution. Evolutionary studies in primates suggested communication between the LCRs by gene conversion. The DNA transposable element MERI-Charlie3 and retroviral ERVL elements were identified at the breakpoint of the t(4;19) chromosome translocation in Gorilla gorilla, suggesting a potential role for transpositions in evolution of the primate genome. Thus, a series of consecutive segmental duplication events during primate evolution resulted in complex genome architecture in proximal 17p. Some of the more recent events led to the formation of novel genes that in human are expressed primarily in the brain. Our observations support the contention that serial segmental duplication events might have orchestrated primate evolution by the generation of novel fusion/fission genes as well as potentially by genomic inversions associated with decreased recombination rates facilitating gene divergence.

AB The rationale behind this research concerns the need to better understand relationships between vegetation characteristics and hydrological processes. Changes in vegetation patterns could provide sensitive indicators of both desertification and water availability. This paper presents a methodology to use vegetation-bare soil patterns as indicators for identifying the extent, distribution and connectivity of runoff and sediment source and sink areas. During field studies it has been found that biological indicators can be used as evidence that areas are functioning as a source or sink for runoff and sediment. It has also been found that the locations of such source and sink areas are tightly linked to the spatial distribution of vegetation patches within the vegetation-bare soil mosaic. Therefore, patterns in vegetation and soil can be important indicators for ecosystem health and hillslope hydrology. Four pattern indices are introduced to describe the degree of contagion and bare area distribution within the vegetation mosaic and the degree of connectivity between different source areas. Binary pattern maps retrieved from a digital aerial photograph are used as examples to illustrate the behaviour of the indices. It is concluded that the indices yield important information on the spatial structure of the patterns studied and can be used to understand the interactions between pattern and its underlying processes.

AB With fire suppression, many western forests are expected to have fewer gaps and higher stem density of shade-tolerant species as light competition becomes a more significant influence on stand pattern and composition. We compared species composition, structure, spatial pattern, and environmental factors such as light and soil moisture between two old-growth forests: Pacific Northwest western hemlock/Douglas-fir at the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility exhibiting gap-phase replacement and southern Sierra Nevada mixed conifer at the Teakettle Experimental Forest after 135 years without a fire. We hypothesized that fire suppression at Teakettle would create a current tree composition and distribution more like Wind River where light is an important influence on stand dynamics. Wind River has nearly continuous canopy cover and a high foliage volume that severely reduces understory light and stratifies the canopy composition by shade tolerance. Large trees are regularly spaced from 0 to 15 m and shade-tolerant and intolerant species are "repelled." In contrast, Teakettle's canopy cover is discontinuous, foliage volume is one-fifth that of Wind River, and understory light is 15 times higher. Trees at Teakettle are significantly clustered in groups containing a mix of shade-tolerant and -intolerant species, separated by large gaps. Although Teakettle's gaps have higher moisture and a thinner litter layer than tree groups, regeneration in gaps is scarce. Fire suppression has increased stem density at Teakettle but it has not filled in gaps, stratified the canopy by shade tolerance, or produced a composition consistent with patterns at Wind River. Teakettle's distinctly clustered stem distribution may result from a minimum canopy cover threshold needed for tree establishment. If high temperatures produced by direct sunlight inhibit stem patterns, traditional stand management that reduces canopy cover to release regeneration should be applied with caution in the southern Sierra Nevada.

AB Metapopulations may be very sensitive to global climate change, particularly if temperature and precipitation change rapidly. We present an analysis of the role of climate and other factors in determining metapopulation structure based on presence and absence data. We compared existing and historical population distributions of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) to determine whether regional climate patterns were correlated with local extinction. To examine all mountain ranges known to hold or to have held desert bighorn populations in California and score for variables describing climate, metapopulation dynamics, human impacts, and other environmental factors, we used a geographic information system (GIS) and paper maps. We used logistic regression and hierarchical partitioning to assess the relationship among these variables and the current status of each population (extinct or extant). Parameters related to climate-elevation, precipitation, and presence of dependable springs-were strongly correlated with population persistence in the twentieth century. Populations inhabiting lower, drier mountain ranges were more likely to go extinct. The presence of domestic sheep grazing allotments was negatively correlated with population persistence. We used conditional extinction probabilities generated by the logistic-regression model to rank native, naturally recolonized, and reintroduced populations by vulnerability to extinction under several climate-change scenarios. Thus risk of extinction in metapopulations can be evaluated for global-climate-change scenarios even when few demographic data are available.

AB The Hierarchical Patch Dynamics Paradigm provides a conceptual framework for linking pattern, process and scale in ecosystems, but there have been few attempts to test this theory because most ecological studies focus on only one spatial scale, or are limited in their temporal scope. Here I use palaeoecological techniques (analysis of fossil pollen and stable carbon isotopes) to compare vegetation heterogeneity in an east African savanna at three spatial scales, over hundreds of years. The data show that patterns of vegetation change are different at the three spatial scales of observation, and suggest that different ecological processes dominate tree abundance at micro, local and landscape scales. Interactions between plants, disturbance (e.g., by fire and herbivores), climate and soil type may influence tree density at differing spatial and temporal scales. This hierarchical explanation of savanna vegetation dynamics could inform future biodiversity conservation and management in savannas.

AB Population genetics theory predicts that genetic drift should eliminate shared polymorphism, leading to monophyly or exclusivity of populations, when the elapsed time between lineage-splitting events is large relative to effective population size. We examined patterns of nucleotide variation in introns at four nuclear loci to relate processes affecting the history of genes to patterns of divergence among natural populations and species. Ancestral polymorphisms were shared among three recognized species, Gryllus firmus, G. pennsylvanicus, and G. ovisopis, and genealogical patterns suggest that successive speciation events occurred recently and rapidly relative to effective population size. High levels of shared polymorphism among these morphologically, behaviorally, and ecologically distinct species indicate that only a small fraction of the genome needs to become differentiated for speciation to occur. Among the four nuclear gene loci there was a 10-fold range in nucleotide diversity, and patterns of polymorphism and divergence suggest that natural selection has acted to maintain or eliminate variation at some loci. While nuclear gene genealogies may have limited applications in phylogeography or other approaches dependent on population monophyly, they provide important insights into the historical, demographic, and selective forces that shape speciation.

AB Induced defenses are widespread in nature, and in amphibian larvae they Lire often expressed as altered behavior and changes in tail shape. color, and size, Theory predicts that induced defenses should be costly in the absence of a predator threat. No costs have been found for these defenses after metamorphosis. In this study. we tested for induced defenses in western toads, Bufo boreas. and measured larval and postmetamorphic consequences of these responses. Larvae were raised in either the presence or absence of nonlethal predator cues. Defense responses to these larval treatments were measured during the larval stage and shortly after metamorphosis using both predator bioassays and quantification of the putative chemical defense common in toads, bufadienolides. We found no differences in larval morphology, growth rate, or development rate between the predator and control treatments. In the larval bioassays, some types of invertebrate predator, consumed significantly fewer of the B. boreas larvae that were reared with predator Cues compared to the control treatments. Bufadienolides were not present in B. boreas larvae. In the postmetamorphic bioassays, tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) had longer handling times when consuming B. boreas that had developed in larval environments without predator cues compared to predator-treatment B. boreas. However, postmetamorphic B. boreas from predator cue larval environments had significantly higher concentrations of bufadienolides than did those from larval environments without predators. suggesting that these defenses are ineffective against tiger salamanders. Our results demonstrate that there is plasticity in the chemical defenses of toads and Suggest that induced larval defenses may incur costs that are only apparent after metamorphosis.

AB Aim The study examined the potential for change in biome representation within Canada's national park system under multiple climate change scenarios and subsequent potential vulnerabilities in Parks Canada policy and planning frameworks.
   Location The study was conducted for Canada's 39 national parks.
   Methods The vegetation change scenarios were based on modelling results from the BIOME3 and MAPSS equilibrium process-based global vegetation models (GVM), run with multiple doubled-CO2 climate change scenarios. The six vegetation distribution scenarios were calculated at 0.5degrees latitude-longitude resolution and the boundaries of 39 national parks superimposed in a geographic information system (GIS). Park management plans and other planning documents were also reviewed as part of the analysis.
   Results The proportional distribution of biomes in Canada's national park system was very similar (within 3% of area for each biome) using BIOME3 and MAPSS under the current climate. Regardless of the GVM and climate change scenario used, the modelling results suggest the potential for substantial change in the biome representation in Canada's national park system. In five of six vegetation scenarios, a novel biome type appeared in more than half of the national parks and greater than 50% of all vegetation grid boxes changed biome type. The proportional representation of tundra and taiga/tundra in the national park system declined in each of the vegetation scenarios, while more southerly biomes (temperate forests and savanna/woodland) increased (in some scenarios doubling to quadrupling). Results for boreal forest varied among the climate change scenarios. A range of potential vulnerabilities in existing policy and planning frameworks were identified, including the national park system plan, individual park objectives, and fire and exotic species management plans.
   Conclusions Climate change represents an unprecedented challenge to Parks Canada and its ability to achieve its conservation mandate as presently legislated. Research is needed not only on ecosystem responses to climate change, but also on the capacity of conservation systems and agencies to adapt to climate change.

AB Predation pressure during early life stages is often high, but few studies have examined antipredator responses at these stages. We studied the effects of an egg predator (leech, Haemopis sanguisuga) and two tadpole predators (dragonfly larvae, Aeshna spp.; and three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus) on the timing of hatching and morphology of hatchlings and young tadpoles in two anuran amphibians [Rana arvalis (RA) and R. temporaria (RT)] in a factorial laboratory experiment. We also compared the responses of two geographically separated RA populations on the Baltic island of Gotland and in Uppland on the Swedish mainland. We found inconsistent evidence for the predictions that the presence of an egg predator induces earlier hatching, and the presence of a larval predator delays hatching. RT hatched later in the presence of stickleback than in the control treatment, but RA hatched earlier, less developed and at smaller size in the leech, dragonfly, and stickleback treatments. There was no indication of predator-induced morphology in hatchlings of either of the species. However, young RA tadpoles had shorter tails and deeper bodies in the stickleback treatment and RT had shorter tails in the leech, dragonfly and stickleback treatments. Irrespective of treatment, RA from Gotland hatched with relatively longer bodies than Uppland individuals and had relatively deeper and short tails as young tadpoles. Our results highlight the diversity of induced responses to predators in anuran amphibians: predator presence affects the timing of hatching and morphology of young tadpoles, but these responses vary depending on the species and predator considered.

AB Determining the habitat requirements of a species is fundamental to effective conservation, particularly if the species is declining in areas where its habitat is being modified. Multi-scaled investigations of habitat use are essential because different selection processes may operate at different scales. I examined the habitat use of a declining woodland passerine, the rufous treecreeper (Climacteris rufa), at three spatial scales (landscape, woodland and territory) in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. Preferential habitat use was exhibited at all scales. At the landscape scale, wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) woodland was used at a significantly greater rate than three other common vegetation types. Territory use within woodlands was positively related to the density of hollow-bearing logs, the density of nest sites, and tree age. Within an individual territory, nest sites (hollows) were favoured if they had a spout angle of greater than or equal to50degrees to the horizontal and an entrance size of between 5 and 10 cm. The rufous treecreeper preferentially used habitat with traits characteristic of old-growth wandoo woodland. Degradation of wandoo through habitat modification (e.g. grazing, logging, fire and removal of deadwood) represents a significant threat to the persistence of treecreepers.

AB We discuss how fragmentation of resources and habitat operate differently on species diversity across spatial scales, ranging from positive effects on local species coexistence to negative effect on intermediate spatial scales, to again positive effects on large spatial and temporal scales. Species with different size and mobility can be regulated by different processes at the same spatial scale. a principle that may contribute to diversity. Differences in species richness between local communities may be differentially regulated at larger spatial scales. This causal connection between local and regional processes has several practical conservation implications. We furthermore show that fractal geometry can be a valuable tool in the separation of the effects of habitat loss (percentage cover), habitat fragmentation (contiguity) and habitat (texture). Especially important may be the notion that the same effective degree of fragmentation can exist at in a very aggregated habitat (one big patch) and a very sparse, random landscape (many small, nearby patches). The geometric behaviour and covariance of these three basic parameters of spatial configuration needs further investigation. The fractal approach is tested using data on heathland habitat configuration and biodiversity in 36 Dutch landscapes of each 9 km x 9 km. Fractal geometry was indeed successful in separating the patterns of habitat loss from habitat fragmentation in a subset of the landscapes, despite covariance across all landscapes. Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation both had a negative effect on diversity of heathland breeding birds, while only habitat loss seemed to affect butterfly species richness. We conclude that fractal geometry seems to be a promising approach for linking population and community processes to landscape spatial structure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The species pool concept has been used as a theoretical framework for understanding local community richness. A significant problem in putting the concept into practice is the lack of methods for determining the size of the species pool. We tested the hypothesis that species composition of recent forests is primarily determined by the species composition of neighbouring older forests against the null-hypothesis that species are a random sample of the species occurring in the study area. Forest plant species composition of recently established fragments was significantly correlated with species composition in neighbouring older forests (i.e. the local species pool). When older forest within a neighbourhood of 1000m radius is considered, seed dispersal sources can be found for 91% of the flora in the recent forests. For an individual fragment, dispersal is a much more important determinant of species presence than the environment, with an average of 46% of the total pool excluded from local pools by dispersal limitation and only 8% excluded by environmental limitations. The species richness of recent forests is on average 23% of the local species pool. Several hypotheses are proposed for this low percentage, such as asymmetric competition due to the early successional state or the limited colonization period.

AB A fundamental concern in analyzing a spatial data set is to identify the presence and nature of Spatial autocorrelation. Global measures can be used to summarize file typical features of spatial autocorrclation for the entire data set. However. if the data set has large spatial coverage. it is likely that there will be one or more subareas, possibly of. pleat situation. Further, unless prior information is available. we are variable sizes and shapes, that are different from the typical unlikely to have strong expectations about the number. locations, sizes, and shapes of such anomalies. Local measures of spatial autocorrelation have been developed to provide a way of revealing, such peculiarities. By identifying anomalous subareas, local measures provide information that is useful in modelling the spatial processes that are thought to give rise to the data, especially since they give an indication of the spatial scales at which such processes might be operating. In addition the information they provide is of potential value in other activities such as identifying, patches and delimiting boundaries. This paper reviews the development and use of local measures of spatial autocorrelation and presents a summary of the findings for all existing measures. It also explores unresolved issues in their application and considers likely directions for future work.

AB Disturbances such as drought have immediate impacts on ecosystem functioning, but little is known about long-term dynamic consequences of disturbance. Here, we show that a major drought perturbed prairie grassland from nearly constant average annual production, and induced 9 years of oscillations with a 2-year period. This pattern occurred in unmanipulated plots in man. widely separated fields that were part of two different long-term studies. Using direct and indirect tests, we could reject the hypothesis that the oscillations were externally imposed by climate or herbivores. Weak evidence supported the hypothesis that oscillations were internally generated, caused by a litter and nitrogen dependent feedback on productivity, This hypothesis was supported by the results of two other long-term studies, in which burning and, separately, nitrogen addition eliminated the 2-year oscillations in plant production. However, more direct evidence failed to support the litter hypothesis. A final, but untested hypothesis was suggested by the observation that production tended to be synchronized amongst dominant plants. Drought may have synchronized production dynamics amongst plant,; with biennially greater allocation to above-ground growth. Regardless of the specific mechanism, our results show that a single disturbance may have long-lasting effects on the dynamics of plant production.

AB On 22 September 1998, Hurricane Georges passed over the Dominican Republic causing extensive damage to a 4700 ha mangrove forest that has been the site of a detailed study of vegetation and ecosystem dynamics since 1994. We resurveyed the vegetation in permanent plots at 7 and IS months after the hurricane to document structural damage of the forest and evaluate early recovery patterns. The intensity of damage was patchy across the landscape. Mortality (greater than or equal to5 cm DBH) ranged from 14 to 100 percent (by density) among the 23 different plots and averaged 47.7 percent across all plots. Reductions in total basal area ranged from 9 to 100 percent, averaging 42.4 percent. Mortality increased by 9 percent between surveys at 7 and IS months post-hurricane. Interspecific. differences in susceptibility to wind damage appeared to be a primary factor contributing to spatial patterns in mortality. Laguncularia racemosa experienced much less mortality (26%) than either Rhizophora mangle (50%) or Avicennia germinans (64%), and plot-level mortality was strongly associated with differences in species composition. There were no clear relationships between canopy height and tree damage at this site. Over 80 percent of the of the surviving R. mangle trees exhibited less than 50 percent crown damage, whereas ca 60 percent of the L. racemosa survivors suffered almost complete (75-100%) crown loss. By IS months after the hurricane, the percentage of L. racemosa trees in the 75 to 100 percent damage class was reduced to 20 percent; in contrast, the health of many R. mangle individuals appeared to be declining, as the percentage of trees in the 50 to 100 percent damage class increased from 16 to 56 percent. Understory light levels, as measured by the gap light index, increased from an average value of 3 percent in the pre-hurricane forest to 51 percent at 7 months after the hurricane and decreased slightly to 47 percent at 18 months. Few saplings (>1 in call and <5 cm DBH) survived the hurricane; 72 percent of the tagged individuals in transect-based plots and 66 percent of saplings in pre-hurricane canopy gaps were killed. Seedling and sapling populations of all three species appear to be recovering rapidly although their densities stilt are lower than in the pre-hurricane forest. It is too early to predict the trajectory of forest recovery, and continued monitoring of the spatial and temporal patterns of forest development is needed to improve our understanding of the role that large-scale disturbance events play on the dynamics of mangrove forest ecosystems.

AB 1. Does enhanced whole-plant CO2 exchange in moderately low to high light occur at the cost of greater CO2 loss rates at very-low light levels? We examined this question for first-year seedlings of intolerant Populus tremuloides and Betula papyrifera, intermediate Betula alleghaniensis, and tolerant Ostrya virginiana and Acer saccharum grown in moderately low (7.3% of open-sky) and low (2.8%) light. We predicted that, compared with shade-tolerant species, intolerant species would have characteristics leading to greater whole-plant CO2 exchange rates in moderately low to high light levels, and to higher CO2 loss rates at very-low light levels.
   2. Compared with shade-tolerant A. saccharum, less-tolerant species grown in both light treatments had greater mass-based photosynthetic rates, leaf, stem and root respiration rates, leaf mass:plant mass ratios and leaf area:leaf mass ratios, and similar whole-plant light compensation points and leaf-based quantum yields.
   3. Whole-plant CO2 exchange responses to light (0.3-600 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) indicated that intolerant species had more positive CO2 exchange rates at all but very-low light (< 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). In contrast, although tolerant A. saccharum had a net CO2 exchange disadvantage at light > 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1), its lower respiration resulted in lower CO2 losses than other species at light < 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1).
   4. Growth scaled closely with whole-plant CO2 exchange characteristics and especially with integrated whole-plant photosynthesis (i.e. leaf mass ratio x in situ leaf photosynthesis). In contrast, growth scaled poorly with leaf-level quantum yield, light compensation point, and light-saturated photosynthetic rate.
   5. Collectively these patterns indicated that: (a) no species was able to both minimize CO2 loss at very-low light (i.e. < 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) and maximize CO2 gain at higher light (i.e. > 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)), because whole-plant respiration rates were positively associated with whole-plant photosynthesis at higher light; (b) shade-intolerant species possess traits that maximize whole-plant CO2 exchange (and thus growth) in moderately low to high light levels, but these traits may lead to long-term growth and survival disadvantages in very-low light (< 2.8%) owing, in part, to high respiration. In contrast, shade-tolerant species may minimize CO2 losses in very-low light at the expense of maximizing CO2 gain potential at higher light levels, but to the possible benefit of long-term survival in low light.

AB Architecture and leaf display were compared in saplings of six rain forest tree species differing in shade tolerance. Saplings were selected along the whole light range encountered in a forest environment. Species differed largely in realized height and crown expansion per unit support biomass, but this could not be related to differences in shade tolerance. The results demonstrate that there exist various solutions to an effective expansion of plant height and crown area. It is argued that choice of the study species and the ontogenetic trajectory regarded determine to a large extent the outcome of interspecific comparisons. No evidence was found that pioneers were characterized by a multilayered and shade tolerants by a monolayered leaf distribution. Yet, sun plants had a similar crown area, a deeper crown, and a higher leaf area index compared to shade plants and their leaves were more evenly distributed along the stem. This suggests that differences in leaf layering are found between plants growing in different light environments, rather than between species differing in shade tolerance.

AB Results from several physiologically based manipulations were synthesized to investigate two selective trade-offs involving offspring number versus offspring quality and costs of reproduction in an annual lizard Uta stansburiana. Lifetime reproductive success of experimentally size-altered progeny was studied to address the offspring number and offspring quality trade-off Causes of natural selection on adult reproductive costs were assessed with three complementary manipulations of clutch size, egg size, and total clutch mass. Selective trade-offs between offspring size and number arose from two opposing episodes of directional selection. Fecundity selection favored female parents that laid large clutches of small offspring, but fecundity selection was balanced by survival selection that favored large offspring. Thus, the offspring number and quality tradeoff had a strong stabilizing effect on mean egg size across generations. However, strength and direction of selection arising from adult reproductive costs varied among years. Because reproductive traits were heritable (h(2) = 0.61), selection on adult reproduction led to a large evolutionary response to natural selection. Patterns of selection detected in natural phenotypic variation were largely corroborated by phenotypic manipulations. However, maturational costs of reproduction that were detected with phenotypic manipulations were missed by traditional selection analysis of natural phenotypic variation.

AB Habitat ranking is often assumed to reflect food availability, but habitat selection may involve trade-offs, for example, between selecting for food or cover. We tested whether the habitat selection of 27 radio-collared European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and 10 free-ranging domestic sheep (Ovis aries) on a forest range in southern Norway reflected resource availability. We predicted that ruminants of different feeding types would use habitats according to the main forage class, but that antipredator behavior might remove the correlation between habitat selection and food availability, thus making temporal and spatial scaling crucial. As predicted, habitat selection by sheep was highly correlated with grass availability on both the home-range and study-area scales. The habitat ranking of roe deer habitat selection did not correlate with the availability of herbs on either scale, but rather was correlated with the availability of canopy cover. We found a clear effect of temporal scale on habitat selection by roe deer. During summer, roe deer used forest habitats with more forage to a greater extent when they were active than when they were inactive, and tended to use habitats with greater availability of herbs at night. We conclude that scale-dependent trade-offs in habitat selection may cause inconsistent habitat rankings when pooled across temporal and spatial scales.

AB We undertook a quantitative literature review to assess implicit scaling choices made in the design of enclosed experimental aquatic ecosystems (mesocosms). A database was constructed with information on temporal scale, spatial scale, and other design characteristics for 360 experiments reported in the literature. We found that key scaling variables such as complete physical dimensions were often not reported. Overall mesocosm experiments had a median volume of 1.7 m(3) and median duration of 49 d. Volume and duration varied by habitat type, experimental treatment, number of trophic levels included, and the response variable under investigation. A number of experimental design characteristics varied with mesocosm size. For instance, characteristics that decreased with increasing mesocosm size included the number of replicates and treatments: and the degree of experimental control over species composition and the physical environment. We also found a bias towards scaling cylindrical containers for a constant ratio of radius to depth as size was increased. This design choice inevitably alters surface-area-to-volume relationships as well as associated ecological variables such as gas and light energy flux, benthicpelagic coupling, and the relative dominance of periphyton growth on mesocosm walls. Our results indicate the need for both 'scale sensitive' experiments, that explicitly consider scale in design and interpretation of results, and;'multi-scale' experiments that manipulate temporal and spatial attributes in order to test specific hypotheses regarding the ecological impact of modification in scale. Both types of experiments are prerequisites for improved mesocosm design and for the systematic extrapolation of information from experimental ecosystems to nature.

AB 1. We examined positive associations and trade-offs of maternal and reproductive traits in a population of Columbian ground squirrels, Spermophilus columbianus.
   2. Structural size, body condition, mother's personal allocation to body mass during reproduction, and timing of littering were estimated for live-trapped reproductive females that were observed during an 8-year period, and were compared to litter mass, litter size, and average pup mass using path analyses.
   3. Mothers exhibited age-structured traits that influenced reproductive patterns. Yearling mothers were significantly smaller, bred later, and had smaller litters than older females. Mothers that gained more body mass during reproduction and older mothers in good body condition that were structurally large had larger litters.
   4. Early seasonal timing of littering was an important positive influence on successful reproduction by older mothers only in early breeding seasons and in years when conditions for reproduction were good for all females.
   5. The number of offspring that survived to 1 year of age was most strongly associated with litter mass and litter size; date of breeding was of secondary influence, with earlier litters exhibiting greater success.
   6. In general, mothers that gained the most in body mass during reproduction were concurrently more successful in weaning large litters (perhaps due to better quality of foraging habitat).
   7. In addition to expected reproductive trade-offs, reproduction by Columbian ground squirrels exhibited positive associations of life-history traits that may reflect evolutionary increasing returns.

AB Semivariance analysis is potentially useful to landscape ecologists for detecting scales of variability in spatial data. We used semivariance analysis to compare spatial patterns of winter foraging by large ungulates with those of environmental variables that influence forage availability in northern Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. In addition, we evaluated (1) the ability of semivariograms to detect known scales of variability in artificial maps with one or more distinct scales of pattern, and (2) the influence of the amount and spatial distribution of absent data on semivariogram results and interpretation. Semivariograms of environmental data sets (aspect, elevation, habitat type, and slope) for the entire northern Yellowstone landscape clearly identified the dominant scale of variability in each map layer, while semivariograms of ungulate foraging data from discontinuous study areas were difficult to interpret. Semivariograms of binary maps composed of a single scale of pattern showed clear interpretable results: the range accurately reflected the size of the blocks of which the maps were constructed. Semivariograms of multiple scale maps and hierarchical maps exhibited pronounced inflections which could be used to distinguish two or three distinct scales of pattern. To assess the sensitivity of semivariance analysis to absent data, often the product of cloud interference or incomplete data collection, we deliberately masked (deleted) portions of continuous northern Yellowstone map layers, using single scale artificial maps as masks. The sensitivity of semivariance analysis to random deletions from the data was related to both the size of the deleted blocks, and the total proportion of the original data set that was removed. Small blocks could be deleted in very high proportions without degrading the semivariogram results. When the size of deleted blocks was large relative to the size of the map, the corresponding variograms became sensitive to the total proportion of data removed: variograms were difficult or impossible to interpret when the proportion of data deleted was high. Despite success with artificial maps, standard semivariance analysis is unlikely to detect multiple scales of pattern in real ecological data. Semivariance analysis is recommended as an effective technique for quantifying some spatial characteristics of ecological data, and may provide insight into the scales of processes that structure landscapes.

AB Using a top-down modeling approach, published mass-balance models of trophic interactions and state variables in the western central Pacific Ocean and the northern Gulf of Mexico shelf were used to explore how large increases in top predator biomasses can be accommodated with given primary productions. It appears that the biomasses of top predators in these models can be increased an order of magnitude, which leads to a six- to sevenfold increase in overall consumer biomasses. This results in changes in food web structures that are in agreement with major aspects of E.P. Odum's theory of ecosystem development, particularly with regard to features associated with the retention and recycling of detritus. Based on the simulations and Odum's theory, we propose a functional definition of carrying capacity: the upper limit of biomass that can be supported by a set primary production and within a variable food web structure is reached when total system respiration equals the sum of primary production and detritus import. The theory supported by the simulations has a number of corollaries relevant to sustainable management of ecosystems.

   RISK; STORAGE; WINTER; STARVATION; DOMINANCE; SPARROW
AB Many passerines wintering in temperate regions rely on their energy reserves for survival during periods when foraging is not possible. Excessive fat reserves, however, increase body mass and thus reduce agility and speed in flight, imposing a survival cost when the bird tries to escape from predators. If fat reserves reflect a trade-off between starvation and predation risks, the size of reserves could be expected to vary with the perceived level of predation risk. The hypothesis that increasing the relative risk of predation results in decreased body mass was tested experimentally using captive greenfinches, Carduelis chloris. Greenfinches show winter fattening and take flight when disturbed and are therefore suitable for testing the hypothesis. The perceived predation risk, a stuffed predator moved in the birds' environment, resulted in lower body mass. Handling the birds had the same effect. These results support theoretical predictions and some field data regarding the adjustment of body mass to variation in the predation risk. They further suggest, in line with other studies, that birds are able to change body mass in response to proximate factors.

AB How a predator responds to fluctuating prey abundances determines its capacity to regulate the prey's population levels. Unlike many terrestrial and a few marine arthropods, key intertidal invertebrate predators, e.g., sea stars and whelks, have been portrayed as lacking rapid behavioral responses that would permit them to control episodes of massive prey recruitment. Our field experiments demonstrated that intertidal sea stars, Pisaster ochraceus, rapidly change densities and alter diet in response to varying recruitment of their prey, the mussels Mytilus spp. Densities of Pisaster foraging at high tide were positively correlated with an index of recruitment of Mytilus californianus. The sea stars aggregated in episodes of massive mussel recruitment and dispersed as local abundances of juvenile mussels declined. Aggregation and dispersal were reproduced in field experiments by adding or removing masses of 1st-yr Mytilus spp. to naturally occurring mussel beds.
   Over the 7 yr of the study, the lower margins of the mussel beds, a distributional limit set at least in some circumstances by the sea stars, remained relatively constant, despite significant year-to-year variation in mussel recruitment rates. We speculate that aggregation acts in concert with previously hypothesized long-term responses to stabilize thp lower distributional limits of the mussels.

ID WATER TIDAL WETLAND; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; HISTORY; LAKE
AB The abundance and composition of the submerged macrophyte seed bank in the Donana marsh (southwestern Spain) was evaluated to assess its relationship with the overlying vegetation. The results obtained demonstrate the existence of a dense seed-bank, both in terms of the number of seeds and their biomass, which represented about 10 % (5 % for angiosperms and > 20 % for Charophyta) of the total plant biomass, which ensures the maintenance of the annual submerged macrophyte populations of the seasonally inundated Donana marsh. Seed bank and established vegetation were coupled, as reflected in the existence of significant correlations between their structure and abundance. This coupling was lacking for Charophyta, whose oospores are widespread and abundant across the marsh, even at locations where they are absent, or rare, in the established vegetation. These differences between the seed bank of annual angiosperms and Charophyta appear to reflect, in part, structural differences between angiosperm seeds and Charophyta oospores, with important ecological consequences. An important aspect of these differences is the allocation of Charophyta reproductive effort to many small propagules lacking embryo storage, compared to those of angiosperms, which ensures their efficient dispersal and numerical abundance in the seed bank.

AB Microbial life in marine sediment contributes substantially to global biomass and is a crucial component of the Earth system. Subseafloor sediment includes both aerobic and anaerobic microbial ecosystems, which persist on very low fluxes of bioavailable energy over geologic time. However, the taxonomic diversity of the marine sedimentary microbial biome and the spatial distribution of that diversity have been poorly constrained on a global scale. We investigated 299 globally distributed sediment core samples from 40 different sites at depths of 0.1 to 678 m below the seafloor. We obtained similar to 47 million 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences using consistent clean subsampling and experimental procedures, which enabled accurate and unbiased comparison of all samples. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations between taxonomic composition, sedimentary organic carbon concentration, and presence or absence of dissolved oxygen. Extrapolation with two fitted species-area relationship models indicates taxonomic richness in marine sediment to be 7.85 x 10(3) to 6.10 x 10(5) and 3.28 x 10(4) to 2.46 x 10(6) amplicon sequence variants for Archaea and Bacteria, respectively. This richness is comparable to the richness in topsoil and the richness in seawater, indicating that Bacteria are more diverse than Archaea in Earth's global biosphere.

AB Climate-change adaptation focuses on conducting and translating research to minimize the dire impacts of anthropogenic climate change, including threats to biodiversity and human welfare. One adaptation strategy is to focus conservation on climate-change refugia (that is, areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time that enable persistence of valued physical, ecological, and sociocultural resources). In this Special Issue, recent methodological and conceptual advances in refugia science will be highlighted. Advances in this emerging subdiscipline are improving scientific understanding and conservation in the face of climate change by considering scale and ecosystem dynamics, and looking beyond climate exposure to sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We propose considering refugia in the context of a multifaceted, long-term, network-based approach, as temporal and spatial gradients of ecological persistence that can act as "slow lanes" rather than areas of stasis. After years of discussion confined primarily to the scientific literature, researchers and resource managers are now working together to put refugia conservation into practice.

AB Bacteriophages have been proposed as an alternative to pesticides to kill bacterial pathogens of crops. However, the efficacy of phage biocontrol is variable and poorly understood in natural rhizosphere microbiomes. We studied biocontrol efficacy of different phage combinations on Ralstonia solanacearum infection in tomato. Increasing the number of phages in combinations decreased the incidence of disease by up to 80% in greenhouse and field experiments during a single crop season. The decreased incidence of disease was explained by a reduction in pathogen density and the selection for phage-resistant but slow-growing pathogen strains, together with enrichment for bacterial species that were antagonistic toward R. solanacearum. Phage treatment did not affect the existing rhizosphere microbiota. Specific phage combinations have potential as precision tools to control plant pathogenic bacteria.

AB Temperate reefs from around the world are becoming tropicalised, as warm-water species shift their distribution towards the poles in response to warming. This is already causing profound shifts in dominant foundation species and associated ecological communities as canopy seaweeds such as kelp are replaced by tropical species. Here, we argue that the cascading consequences of tropicalisation for the ecosystem properties and functions of warming temperate reefs depend largely on the taxa that end up dominating the seafloor. We put forward three potential tropicalisation trajectories, that differ in whether seaweeds, turf or corals become dominant. We highlight potential gains to certain ecosystem functions for some tropicalisation endpoints. For example, local benthic fish productivity may increase in some tropicalised reefs as a higher proportion of primary production is directly consumed, but this will be at the expense of other functions such as carbon export. We argue that understanding these changes in flows of energy and materials is essential to formulate new conservation strategies and management approaches that minimise risks as well as capture potential opportunities. Regardless of which trajectory is followed, tropicalised systems represent largely novel ecosystem configurations. This poses major challenges to traditional conservation and environmental management approaches, which typically focus on maintaining or returning species to particular locations. We outline management practices that may either mitigate predicted structural and functional changes or make the most of potential new opportunities in tropicalised reefs. These include marine protected areas to increase resilience and connectivity, the development of new fisheries that target range-expanding invaders, and assisted evolution and migration strategies to facilitate the dominance of large habitat formers like corals or seaweeds. We highlight important ecological and ethical challenges associated with developing novel approaches to manage tropicalised reefs, which may need to become increasingly interventionist. As technological innovations continue to emerge, having clear goals and considering the ethics surrounding interventions among the broader community are essential steps to successfully develop novel management approaches. A plain language summary is available for this article.

AB Despite the major importance of soil biota in nutrient and energy fluxes, interactions in soil food webs are poorly understood. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of application, normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in C-13 as compared to plant litter. This 'detrital shift' likely reflects preferential uptake of C-13-enriched microbial biomass and underlines the importance of microorganisms, in contrast to dead plant material, as a major food resource for the soil animal community. Soil organic matter is enriched in N-15 and C-13 relative to leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore might be enriched in N-15 resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast, C-13 content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in mineral soil, suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e. little decomposed organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients in animals and in basal resources can be a valuable tool to assess trophic interactions and dynamics of organic matter in soil. As indicated by stable isotope composition, direct feeding on living plant material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare among soil invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food web. However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and non-vascular plants may play an important role in fuelling soil food webs. The trophic niche of most high-rank animal taxa spans at least two trophic levels, implying the use of a wide range of resources. Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food webs, low-rank taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups reflects differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources. Different taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely linked to different pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting different functional roles and indicating that trophic niches in soil animal communities are phylogenetically structured. During last two decades studies using stable isotope analysis have elucidated the trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food resources of the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to a wider range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a larger array of ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive understanding of the structure and functioning of soil food webs.

AB The land sparing-sharing model provides a powerful heuristic and analytical framework for understanding the potential of agricultural landscapes to support wild species. However, its conceptual and analytical strengths and limitations remain widely contested or misunderstood. Here, I review what inferences can and cannot be derived from the framework, and discuss eight specific points of contention and confusion. The land sparing-sharing framework is underpinned by an ethic that seeks to minimise harm to non-human species. It is used to quantify how good farmland is for different species, in relation to appropriate reference land uses, and at what opportunity cost. The results of empirical studies that have used the model indicate that most species will have larger populations if food is produced on as small an area as possible, while sparing as large an area of native vegetation as possible. The potential benefits of land sharing or intermediate strategies for wild species are more limited. I review disagreements about the scope of analysis (food production cf. food security), the value of high-yield farmland for wildlife, the (ir)relevance of the Borlaug hypothesis, scale and heterogeneity, fostering human connections to nature, the prospects for land sparing in heavily-modified landscapes, the role of land sparing in improving connectivity, and the political implications of the model. Interpreted alongside insights from social, political and economic studies, the model can help us to understand how decisions about land-use will affect the persistence of wild species populations into the future.

AB Leaf turgor loss point (pi(tlp)) indicates the capacity of a plant to maintain cell turgor pressure during dehydration, which has been proven to be strongly predictive of the plant response to drought. In this study, we compiled a data set of a pi(tlp) for 1752 woody plant individuals belonging to 389 species from nine major woody biomes in China, along with reduced sample size of hydraulic and leaf carbon economics data. We aimed to investigate the variation of pi(tlp) across biomes varying in water availability. We also tested two hypotheses: (i) pi(tlp) predicts leaf hydraulic safety margins and (ii) it is correlated with leaf carbon economics traits. Our results showed that there was a positive relationship between pi(tlp )and aridity index: biomes from humid regions had less negative values than those from arid regions. This supports the idea that pi(tlp )may reflect drought tolerance at the scale of woody biomes. As expected, pi(tlp) was significantly positively correlated with leaf hydraulic safety margins that varied significantly across biomes, indicating that this trait may be useful in modelling changes of forest components in response to increasing drought. Moreover, pi(tlp) was correlated with a suite of coordinated hydraulic and economics traits; therefore, it can be used to predict the position of a given species along the 'fast-slow' whole-plant economics spectrum. This study expands our understanding of the biological significance of pi(tlp )not only in drought tolerance, but also in the plant economics spectrum.

AB AmeriFlux scientists were early adopters of a network-enabled approach to ecosystem science that continues to transform the study of land-atmosphere interactions. In the 20 years since its formation, AmeriFlux has grown to include more than 260 flux tower sites in the Americas that support continuous observation of ecosystem carbon, water, and energy fluxes. Many of these sites are co-located within a similar climate regime, and more than 50 have data records that exceed 10 years in length. In this prospective assessment of AmeriFlux's strengths in a new era of network-enabled ecosystem science, we discuss how the longevity and spatial distribution of AmeriFlux data make them exceptionally well suited for disentangling ecosystem response to slowly evolving changes in climate and land-cover, and to rare events like droughts and biological disturbances. More recently, flux towers have also been integrated into environmental observation networks that have broader scientific goals; in North America these include the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Critical Zone Observatory network (CZO), and Long-Term Ecological Research network (LTER). AmeriFlux stands apart from these other networks in its reliance on voluntary participation of individual sites, which receive funding from diverse sources to pursue a wide, transdisciplinary array of research topics. This diffuse, grassroots approach fosters methodological and theoretical innovation, but also challenges network-level data synthesis and data sharing to the network. While AmeriFlux has had strong ties to other regional flux networks and FLUXNET, better integration with networks like NEON, CZO and LTER provides opportunities for new types of cooperation and synergies that could strengthen the scientific output of all these networks.

AB We review geological evidence on the origin of the modern transcontinental Amazon River, and the paleogeographic history of riverine connections among the principal sedimentary basins of northern South America through the Neogene. Data are reviewed from new geochronological datasets using radiogenic and stable isotopes, and from traditional geochronological methods, including sedimentology, structural mapping, sonic and seismic logging, and biostratigraphy. The modern Amazon River and the continental-scale Amazon drainage basin were assembled during the late Miocene and Pliocene, via some of the largest purported river capture events in Earth history. Andean sediments are first recorded in the Amazon Fan at about 10.1-9.4 Ma, with a large increase in sedimentation at about 4.5 Ma. The transcontinental Amazon River therefore formed over a period of about 4.9-5.6 million years, by means of several river capture events. The origins of the modern Amazon River are hypothesized to be linked with that of mega-wetland landscapes of tropical South America (e.g. varzeas, pantanals, seasonally flooded savannahs). Mega-wetlands have persisted over about 10% northern South America under different configurations for >15 million years. Although the paleogeographic reconstructions presented are simplistic and coarse-grained, they are offered to inspire the collection and analysis of new sedimentological and geochronological datasets.

AB Interest in planting mixtures of cover crop species has grown in recent years as farmers seek to increase the breadth of ecosystem services cover crops provide. As part of a multidisciplinary project, we quantified the degree to which monocultures and mixtures of cover crops suppress weeds during the fall-to-spring cover crop growing period. Weed-suppressive cover crop stands can limit weed seed rain from summer-and winter-annual species, reducing weed population growth and ultimately weed pressure in future cash crop stands. We established monocultures and mixtures of two legumes (medium red clover and Austrian winter pea), two grasses (cereal rye and oats), and two brassicas (forage radish and canola) in a long fall growing window following winter wheat harvest and in a shorter window following silage corn harvest. In fall of the long window, grass cover crops and mixtures were the most weed suppressive, whereas legume cover crops were the least weed suppressive. All mixtures also effectively suppressed weeds. This was likely primarily due to the presence of fast-growing grass species, which were effective even when they were seeded at only 20% of their monoculture rate. In spring, weed biomass was low in all treatments due to winter kill of summer-annual weeds and low germination of winter annuals. In the short window following silage corn, biomass accumulation by cover crops and weeds in the fall was more than an order of magnitude lower than in the longer window. However, there was substantial weed seed production in the spring in all treatments not containing cereal rye (monoculture or mixture). Our results suggest that cover crop mixtures require only low seeding rates of aggressive grass species to provide weed suppression. This creates an opportunity for other species to deliver additional ecosystem services, though careful species selection may be required to maintain mixture diversity and avoid dominance of winter-hardy cover crop grasses in the spring.

AB Conservation biology and applied ecology increasingly recognize that natural resource management is both an outcome and a driver of social, economic, and ecological dynamics. Protected areas offer a fundamental approach to conserving ecosystems, but they are also social-ecological systems whose ecological management and sustainability are heavily influenced by people. This editorial, and the papers in the invited feature that it introduces, discuss three emerging themes in social-ecological systems approaches to understanding protected areas: (1) the resilience and sustainability of protected areas, including analyses of their internal dynamics, their effectiveness, and the resilience of the landscapes within which they occur; (2) the relevance of spatial context and scale for protected areas, including such factors as geographic connectivity, context, exchanges between protected areas and their surrounding landscapes, and scale dependency in the provision of ecosystem services; and (3) efforts to reframe what protected areas are and how they both define and are defined by the relationships of people and nature. These emerging themes have the potential to transform management and policy approaches for protected areas and have important implications for conservation, in both theory and practice.

AB In this paper, we examine some basic properties of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity as compared with other distance and dissimilarity functions applied to ecological abundance data. We argue that the ability of every coefficient to measure species-level contributions is a fundamental requirement. By suggesting an additive decomposition formula for the Bray-Curtis coefficient we derive a general formula of dissimilarity, which includes the Canberra distance and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity as special cases. A similar general formula is also proposed for the Marczewski-Steinhaus coefficient. Finally, using a modified version of Dalton's principle of transfers, we show that the Bray-Curtis coefficient and the city block distance exhibit a linear response to the transfer of species abundances from an abundant plot to a less abundant plot. At the other extreme, the chord and the Hellinger distances show an irregular and non-monotonic behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Species compositions of gut microbiomes impact host health [1-3], but the processes determining these compositions are largely unknown. An unexplained observation is that gut species composition varies widely between individuals but is largely stable over time within individuals [4, 5]. Stochastic factors during establishment may drive these alternative stable states (colonized versus non-colonized) [6, 7], which can influence susceptibility to pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile. Here we sought to quantify and model the dose response, dynamics, and stability of bacterial colonization in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) gut. Our precise, high-throughput technique revealed stable between-host variation in colonization when individual germ-free flies were fed their own natural commensals (including the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum). Some flies were colonized while others remained germ-free even at extremely high bacterial doses. Thus, alternative stable states of colonization exist even in this low-complexity model of host-microbe interactions. These alternative states are driven by a fundamental asymmetry between the inoculum population and the stably colonized population that is mediated by spatial localization and a population bottleneck, which makes stochastic effects important by lowering the effective population size. Prior colonization with other bacteria reduced the chances of subsequent colonization, thus increasing the stability of higher-diversity guts. Therefore, stable gut diversity may be driven by inherently stochastic processes, which has important implications for combatting infectious diseases and for stably establishing probiotics in the gut.

AB Resistance values based on habitat suitability are frequently the basis for modeling landscape connectivity and designing wildlife corridors to facilitate dispersal movements. However, animals may use the landscape differently during dispersal movements than in the home range. We hypothesized that (1) habitat features that are avoided within an animal's home range offer little resistance to animals during natal or breeding dispersal and more specifically that (2) resistance to dispersal is a negative exponential function of habitat suitability within the home range. To test these hypotheses, we used field movement data of kinkajous (Potos flavus), a neotropical, arboreal mammal, to parameterize alternative resistance surfaces based on home range resource use, home range movement data, parent-offspring locations, and breeding pair locations. We used correlation analysis to compare performance of these surfaces. Our results suggest that kinkajous perceive the fragmented landscape as more connected during dispersal than while in the home range. Although kinkajous are tightly linked to forest during movements in the home range, farms and pastures did not pose higher resistance to dispersal movements than forests. Similar tolerance for low-quality habitat has now been observed in dispersal movements of several wildlife species. A negative exponential relationship between habitat suitability and resistance characterizes landscape connectivity perception of mobile species during dispersal movements.

AB Insects harbor a tremendous diversity of sex determining mechanisms both within and between groups. For example, in some orders such as Hymenoptera, all members are haplodiploid, whereas Diptera contain species with homomorphic as well as male and female heterogametic sex chromosome systems or paternal genome elimination. We have established a large database on karyotypes and sex chromosomes in insects, containing information on over 13 000 species covering 29 orders of insects. This database constitutes a unique starting point to report phylogenetic patterns on the distribution of sex determination mechanisms, sex chromosomes, and karyotypes among insects and allows us to test general theories on the evolutionary dynamics of karyotypes, sex chromosomes, and sex determination systems in a comparative framework. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that male heterogamety is the ancestral mode of sex determination in insects, and transitions to female heterogamety are extremely rare. Many insect orders harbor species with complex sex chromosomes, and gains and losses of the sex-limited chromosome are frequent in some groups. Haplodiploidy originated several times within insects, and parthenogenesis is rare but evolves frequently. Providing a single source to electronically access data previously distributed among more than 500 articles and books will not only accelerate analyses of the assembled data, but also provide a unique resource to guide research on which taxa are likely to be informative to address specific questions, for example, for genome sequencing projects or large-scale comparative studies.

AB Agricultural soils have experienced large anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs in recent decades. Our mechanistic understanding of the effects of added N on the carbon (C) cycle in agricultural soils, especially in the rhizosphere (C excess and N limitation), remains incomplete. The effects of increasing N fertilization on soil CO2 emissions and microbial biomass in a wheat rhizosphere were investigated in a 56-day incubation experiment. The rhizosphere soil was amended with increasing NH4+ rates of 0 (Control), 52 (Low N), 104 (Medium N), and 208 mu g N g(-1) soil (High N). N fertilization exponentially decreased soil CO2 emissions by 27-42% compared to the control. Microbial biomass was decreased by N fertilization, but depended on the amount of added N and the timing of measurements. N additions caused pronounced negative priming effects ranging from -72 to -113 mu g C g(-1) over 56 days, corresponding to a decrease in basal respiration of 27%, 35% and 42% for Low, Medium and High N, respectively. The CO2 fluxes per unit of microbial biomass decreased exponentially with N addition (R-2 = 0.84), indicating increased microbial carbon use efficiency under higher N availability. A literature review and own results showed that negative PEs occurred in the most cases and getting more negative exponentially with increasing N fertilization (n = 158, P < 0.001). In conclusion, increasing N fertilization facilitates C sequestration in soil not only by higher root biomass production, but also by reducing the SOM decomposition in the rhizosphere because of decreased N limitation.

AB Biotic homogenization goes beyond the increase in taxonomic similarity among communities. It also involves the loss of biological differences in any organizational level (e.g., populations or communities) in terms of functional, taxonomic or genetic features. There are many ways to measure biotic homogenization, and the results depend on temporal and spatial scales, the biological group, and the richness of the communities. In freshwater ecosystems, the main investigated causes of biotic homogenization correspond to the introduction of non-native species, damming, and changes in land use. However, other natural and anthropogenic causes also increase similarity among aquatic biota, such as climatic change, changes in productivity, and flood and drought events. The consequences of biotic homogenization in freshwater ecosystems are less explored than its causes, despite its severe implications, such as lesser resistant/resilient communities, loss of ecosystem functions, and higher vulnerability to diseases. Finally, biotic homogenization is a complex process that requires attention in conservation strategies, especially because forecasts suggest that freshwater biotas will continue to become more homogeneous in the future.

AB Increasing human population interacts with local and global environments to deplete biodiversity and resources humans depend on, thus challenging societal values centered on growth and relying on technology to mitigate environmental stress. Although the need to address the environmental crisis, central to conservation science, generated greener versions of the growth paradigm, we need fundamental shifts in values that ensure transition from a growth-centered society to one acknowledging biophysical limits and centered on human well-being and biodiversity conservation. We discuss the role conservation science can play in this transformation, which poses ethical challenges and obstacles. We analyze how conservation and economics can achieve better consonance, the extent to which technology should be part of the solution, and difficulties the "new conservation science" has generated. An expanded ambition for conservation science should reconcile day-today action within the current context with uncompromising, explicit advocacy for radical transitions in core attitudes and processes that govern our interactions with the biosphere. A widening of its focus to understand better the interconnectedness between human wellbeing and acknowledgment of the limits of an ecologically functional and diverse planet will need to integrate ecological and social sciences better. Although ecology can highlight limits to growth and consequences of ignoring them, social sciences are necessary to diagnose societal mechanisms at work, how to correct them, and potential drivers of social change.

AB As a primary limiting factor in arid and semiarid regions, precipitation strongly influences soil microbial properties. However, the patterns and mechanisms of soil microbial responses to precipitation have not been well documented. In this study, changes in soil microorganisms along an experimental precipitation gradient with seven levels of precipitation manipulation (i.e., ambient precipitation as a control, and +/- 20%, +/- 40%, and +/- 60% of ambient precipitation) were explored in a semiarid temperate steppe in northern China. Soil microbial biomass carbon and respiration as well as the ratio of fungal to bacterial biomass varied along the experimental precipitation gradient and peaked under the +40% precipitation treatment. The shifts in microbial community composition could be largely attributable to the changes in soil water and nutrient availability. The metabolic quotient increased (indicating reduced carbon use efficiency) with increasing precipitation due to the leaching of dissolved organic carbon. The relative contributions of microbial respiration to soil and ecosystem respiration increased with increasing precipitation, suggesting that heterotrophic respiration will be more sensitive than autotrophic respiration if precipitation increases in the temperate steppe as predicted under future climate-change scenarios.

AB Range shifts are among the most ubiquitous ecological responses to anthropogenic climate change and have large consequences for ecosystems. Unfortunately, the ecophysiological forces that constrain range boundaries are poorly understood, making it difficult to mechanistically project range shifts. To explore the physiological mechanisms by which drought stress controls dry range boundaries in trees, we quantified elevational variation in drought tolerance and in drought avoidance-related functional traits of a widespread gymnosperm (ponderosa pine - Pinus ponderosa) and angiosperm (trembling aspen - Populus tremuloides) tree species in the southwestern USA. Specifically, we quantified tree-to-tree variation in growth, water stress (predawn and midday xylem tension), drought avoidance traits (branch conductivity, leaf/needle size, tree height, leaf area-to-sapwood area ratio), and drought tolerance traits (xylem resistance to embolism, hydraulic safety margin, wood density) at the range margins and range center of each species. Although water stress increased and growth declined strongly at lower range margins of both species, ponderosa pine and aspen showed contrasting patterns of clinal trait variation. Trembling aspen increased its drought tolerance at its dry range edge by growing stronger but more carbon dense branch and leaf tissues, implying an increased cost of growth at its range boundary. By contrast, ponderosa pine showed little elevational variation in drought-related traits but avoided drought stress at low elevations by limiting transpiration through stomatal closure, such that its dry range boundary is associated with limited carbon assimilation even in average climatic conditions. Thus, the same climatic factor (drought) may drive range boundaries through different physiological mechanisms - a result that has important implications for process-based modeling approaches to tree biogeography. Further, we show that comparing intraspecific patterns of trait variation across ranges, something rarely done in a range-limit context, helps elucidate a mechanistic understanding of range constraints.

AB Diets estimated from different proxies such as stable isotopes, stomach contents, and dental microwear often disagree, leading to nominally well-supported but greatly differing estimates of diet for both extinct and extant species that complicate our understanding of ecology. We show that these perceived incongruences can be caused by proxies recording diet over vastly different time-scales. Field observations reveal a diet averaged over minutes or hours, whereas dental morphology may reflect the diet of a lineage over millions of years of evolution. Failing to explicitly consider the scale of proxies and the potentially large temporal variability in diet can cause erroneous predictions in any downstream analyses such as conservation planning or paleohabitat reconstructions. We propose a cross-scale framework for conceptualizing diet suitable for both modern ecologists and paleontologists and provide recommendations for any studies involving dietary data. Treating diet in this temporally explicit framework and matching the scale of our questions with the scale of our data will lead to a much richer and clearer understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes.
