AB When environmental processes cut across socioeconomic boundaries, traditional top-down government approaches struggle to effectively manage and conserve ecosystems. In such cases, governance arrangements that foster multiactor collaboration are needed. The effectiveness of such arrangements, however, depends on how well any ecological interdependencies across governed ecosystems are aligned with patterns of collaboration. This inherent interdisciplinary and complex problem has impeded progress in developing a better understanding of how to govern ecosystems for conservation in an increasingly interconnected world. We argue for the development of empirically informed theories, which are not only able to transcend disciplinary boundaries, but are also explicit in taking these complex social-ecological interdependences into account. We show how this emerging research frontier can be significantly improved by incorporating recent advances in stochastic modeling of multilevel social networks. An empirical case study from an agricultural landscape in Madagascar is reanalyzed to demonstrate these improvements.

AB Evolutionary hypotheses to explain the greater numbers of species in the tropics than the temperate zone include greater age and area, higher temperature and metabolic rates, and greater ecological opportunity. These ideas make contrasting predictions about the relationship between speciation processes and latitude, which I elaborate and evaluate. Available data suggest that per capita speciation rates are currently highest in the temperate zone and that diversification rates (speciation minus extinction) are similar between latitudes. In contrast, clades whose oldest analyzed dates precede the Eocene thermal maximum, when the extent of the tropics was much greater than today, tend to show highest speciation and diversification rates in the tropics. These findings are consistent with age and area, which is alone among hypotheses in predicting a time trend. Higher recent speciation rates in the temperate zone than the tropics suggest an additional response to high ecological opportunity associated with low species diversity. These broad patterns are compelling but provide limited insights into underlying mechanisms, arguing that studies of speciation processes along the latitudinal gradient will be vital. Using threespine stickleback in depauperate northern lakes as an example, I show how high ecological opportunity can lead to rapid speciation. The results support a role for ecological opportunity in speciation, but its importance in the evolution of the latitudinal gradient remains uncertain. I conclude that per capita evolutionary rates are no longer higher in the tropics than the temperate zone. Nevertheless, the vast numbers of species that have already accumulated in the tropics ensure that total rate of species production remains highest there. Thus, tropical evolutionary momentum helps to perpetuate the steep latitudinal biodiversity gradient.

AB Leaf waxes (e.g. n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids) and their carbon isotopes (delta C-13) are commonly used to track past changes in the carbon cycle, water availability, and plant ecophysiology. Previous studies indicated that conifers have lower n-alkane concentrations than angiosperms and that C-13 fractionation during n-alkane synthesis (epsilon(n-alkane)) is smaller than in angiosperms. These prior studies, however, sampled a limited phylogenetic and geographic subset of conifers, leaving out many important subtropical and Southern Hemisphere groups that were once widespread and common components of fossil assemblages. To expand on previous work, we collected 43 conifer species (and Ginkgo biloba) from the University of California Botanical Garden at Berkeley, sampling all extant conifer families and almost two-thirds of extant genera. We find that Pinaceae, including many North American species used in previous studies, have very low or no n-alkanes. However, other conifer groups have significant concentrations of n-alkanes, especially Southern Hemisphere Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae (monkey puzzles, Norfolk Island pines, and yellowwoods), and many species of Cupressaceae (junipers and relatives). Within the Cupressaceae, we find total n-alkane concentrations are high in subfamilies Cupressoideae and Callitroideae, but significantly lower in the early diverging taxodioid lineages (including bald cypress and redwood). Individual n-alkane chain lengths have a weak phylogenetic signal, except for n-C-29 alkane, but when combined using average chain length (ACL), a strong phylogenetic signal emerges. The strong phylogenetic signal in ACL, observed in the context of a common growth environment for all plants we sampled, suggests that ACL is strongly influenced by factors other than climate. An analysis of epsilon(n-alkane) indicates a strong phylogenetic signal in which the smallest biosynthetic fractionation occurs in Pinaceae and the largest in Taxaceae (yews and relatives). The relationship between phylogeny and epsilon(n-alkane) may be related to differences in carbon metabolism among conifer clades. These results have important implications for interpreting n-alkane delta C-13 values in sedimentary archives, especially outside of North America. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Radiocarbon analyses are commonly used in a broad range of fields, including earth science, archaeology, forgery detection, isotope forensics, and physiology. Many applications are sensitive to the radiocarbon (C-14) content of atmospheric CO2, which has varied since 1890 as a result of nuclear weapons testing, fossil fuel emissions, and CO2 cycling between atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial carbon reservoirs. Over this century, the ratio C-14/C in atmospheric CO2 (Delta(CO2)-C-14 ) will be determined by the amount of fossil fuel combustion, which decreases Delta(CO2)-C-14 because fossil fuels have lost all C-14 from radioactive decay. Simulations of Delta(CO2)-C-14 using the emission scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, the Representative Concentration Pathways, indicate that ambitious emission reductions could sustain Delta(CO2)-C-14 near the preindustrial level of 0% through 2100, whereas "business-as-usual" emissions will reduce Delta(CO2)-C-14 to -250%, equivalent to the depletion expected from over 2,000 y of radioactive decay. Given current emissions trends, fossil fuel emission-driven artificial "aging" of the atmosphere is likely to occur much faster and with a larger magnitude than previously expected. This finding has strong and as yet unrecognized implications for many applications of radiocarbon in various fields, and it implies that radiocarbon dating may no longer provide definitive ages for samples up to 2,000 y old.

AB No-take marine reserves are increasingly popular tools for conservation and fisheries management. While much attention has been paid to evaluating the effects of design aspects (size, location, etc.) in achieving reserve objectives, less emphasis has been placed on the role of stakeholder compliance. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to evaluate the state of compliance literature and examine the methods used to measure compliance in reserves. The state of compliance literature is limited, although publications with compliance information have increased sixfold in the last decade. However, most studies containing compliance information (63%) fail to provide quantitative estimates. Furthermore, most (95%) quantitative estimates of compliance were reported using a single method, which is problematic because each method has biases and limited applicability. Methods used to indicate compliance include (i) direct observation; (ii) indirect observation; (iii) law enforcement records; (iv) direct questioning; (v) expert opinion; and (vi) modelling. Our second aim was to empirically demonstrate the critical role of compliance in reserve outcomes by comparing a mixed-effects model on compliance data synthesized from 63 marine reserves to that of a null model. The model of best fit demonstrated a negative relationship between non-compliance and target species biomass response ratios. Thus, without incorporating any aspects of reserve design, compliance data predicted reserve response ratios of fish biomass. Accordingly, researchers should explore ways to better understand and measure non-compliance. Therefore, future research should triangulate multiple sources of quantitative compliance data collected using standardized techniques and conduct baseline surveys before reserve implementation.

AB Growing season conditions are widely recognized as the main driver for tundra shrub radial growth, but the effects of winter warming and snow remain an open question. Here, we present a more than 100years long Betulanana ring-width chronology from Disko Island in western Greenland that demonstrates a highly significant and positive growth response to both summer and winter air temperatures during the past century. The importance of winter temperatures for Betulanana growth is especially pronounced during the periods from 1910-1930 to 1990-2011 that were dominated by significant winter warming. To explain the strong winter importance on growth, we assessed the importance of different environmental factors using site-specific measurements from 1991 to 2011 of soil temperatures, sea ice coverage, precipitation and snow depths. The results show a strong positive growth response to the amount of thawing and growing degree-days as well as to winter and spring soil temperatures. In addition to these direct effects, a strong negative growth response to sea ice extent was identified, indicating a possible link between local sea ice conditions, local climate variations and Betula nana growth rates. Data also reveal a clear shift within the last 20years from a period with thick snow depths (1991-1996) and a positive effect on Betulanana radial growth, to a period (1997-2011) with generally very shallow snow depths and no significant growth response towards snow. During this period, winter and spring soil temperatures have increased significantly suggesting that the most recent increase in Betulanana radial growth is primarily triggered by warmer winter and spring air temperatures causing earlier snowmelt that allows the soils to drain and warm quicker. The presented results may help to explain the recently observed greening of the Arctic' which may further accelerate in future years due to both direct and indirect effects of winter warming.

AB Empirical phylogeographic studies have progressively sampled greater numbers of loci over time, in part motivated by theoretical papers showing that estimates of key demographic parameters improve as the number of loci increases. Recently, next-generation sequencing has been applied to questions about organismal history, with the promise of revolutionizing the field. However, no systematic assessment of how phylogeographic data sets have changed over time with respect to overall size and information content has been performed. Here, we quantify the changing nature of these genetic data sets over the past 20years, focusing on papers published in Molecular Ecology. We found that the number of independent loci, the total number of alleles sampled and the total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per data set has improved over time, with particularly dramatic increases within the past 5years. Interestingly, uniparentally inherited organellar markers (e.g. animal mitochondrial and plant chloroplast DNA) continue to represent an important component of phylogeographic data. Single-species studies (cf. comparative studies) that focus on vertebrates (particularly fish and to some extent, birds) represent the gold standard of phylogeographic data collection. Based on the current trajectory seen in our survey data, forecast modelling indicates that the median number of SNPs per data set for studies published by the end of the year 2016 may approach similar to 20000. This survey provides baseline information for understanding the evolution of phylogeographic data sets and underscores the fact that development of analytical methods for handling very large genetic data sets will be critical for facilitating growth of the field.

AB Recent evidence suggests that natural selection operating on hosts to maintain their microbiome contributes to the emergence of new species, that is, the 'hologenomic basis of speciation'. Here we analyse the gut microbiota of two house mice subspecies, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus, across their Central European hybrid zone, in addition to hybrids generated in the lab. Hybrid mice display widespread transgressive phenotypes (that is, exceed or fall short of parental values) in a variety of measures of bacterial community structure, which reveals the importance of stabilizing selection operating on the intestinal microbiome within species. Further genetic and immunological analyses reveal genetic incompatibilities, aberrant immune gene expression and increased intestinal pathology associated with altered community structure among hybrids. These results provide unique insight into the consequences of evolutionary divergence in a vertebrate 'hologenome', which may be an unrecognized contributing factor to reproductive isolation in this taxonomic group.

AB In this paper, a new method, detrended partial-cross-correlation analysis (DPCCA), is proposed. Based on detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA), this method is improved by including partial-correlation technique, which can be applied to quantify the relations of two non-stationary signals (with influences of other signals removed) on different time scales. We illustrate the advantages of this method by performing two numerical tests. Test I shows the advantages of DPCCA in handling non-stationary signals, while Test II reveals the "intrinsic" relations between two considered time series with potential influences of other unconsidered signals removed. To further show the utility of DPCCA in natural complex systems, we provide new evidence on the winter-time Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the winter-time Nino3 Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (Nino3-SSTA) affecting the Summer Rainfall over the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River (SRYR). By applying DPCCA, better significant correlations between SRYR and Nino3-SSTA on time scales of 6 similar to 8 years are found over the period 1951 similar to 2012, while significant correlations between SRYR and PDO on time scales of 35 years arise. With these physically explainable results, we have confidence that DPCCA is an useful method in addressing complex systems.

AB Beta diversity, the spatial or temporal variability of species composition, is a key concept in community ecology. However, our ability to predict the relative importance of the main drivers of beta diversity (e. g., environmental heterogeneity, dispersal limitation, and environmental productivity) remains limited. Using a comprehensive data set on stream invertebrate assemblages across the continental United States, we found a hump-shaped relationship between beta diversity and within-ecoregion nutrient concentrations. Within-ecoregion compositional dissimilarity matrices were mainly related to environmental distances in most of the 30 ecoregions analyzed, suggesting a stronger role for species-sorting than for spatial processes. The strength of these relationships varied considerably among ecoregions, but they were unrelated to within-ecoregion environmental heterogeneity or spatial extent. Instead, we detected a negative correlation between the strength of species sorting and nutrient concentrations. We suggest that eutrophication is a major mechanism disassembling invertebrate assemblages in streams at a continental scale.

AB We investigated how the legacy of warming and summer drought affected microbial communities in five different replicated long-term (>10years) field experiments across Europe (EU-FP7 INCREASE infrastructure). To focus explicitly on legacy effects (i.e., indirect rather than direct effects of the environmental factors), we measured microbial variables under the same moisture and temperature in a brief screening, and following a pre-incubation at stable conditions. Specifically, we investigated the size and composition of the soil microbial community (PLFA) alongside measurements of bacterial (leucine incorporation) and fungal (acetate in ergosterol incorporation) growth rates, previously shown to be highly responsive to changes in environmental factors, and microbial respiration. We found no legacy effects on the microbial community size, composition, growth rates, or basal respiration rates at the effect sizes used in our experimental setup (0.6 degrees C, about 30% precipitation reduction). Our findings support previous reports from single short-term ecosystem studies thereby providing a clear evidence base to allow long-term, broad-scale generalizations to be made. The implication of our study is that warming and summer drought will not result in legacy effects on the microbial community and their processes within the effect sizes here studied. While legacy effects on microbial processes during perturbation cycles, such as drying-rewetting, and on tolerance to drought and warming remain to be studied, our results suggest that any effects on overall ecosystem processes will be rather limited. Thus, the legacies of warming and drought should not be prioritized factors to consider when modeling contemporary rates of biogeochemical processes in soil.

AB Speciation of fungal plant pathogens has been associated with host jumps, host domestication, clonal divergence, and hybridization. Although we have substantial insight into the speciation histories of several important plant pathogens, we still know very little about the underlying genetics of reproductive isolation. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, and nonfungal model systems illustrate that reproductive barriers can evolve by different mechanisms, including genetic incompatibilities between neutral and adaptive substitutions, reinforcement selection, and chromosomal rearrangements. Advances in genome sequencing and sequence analyses provide a new framework to identify those traits that have driven the divergence of populations or caused reproductive isolation between species of fungal plant pathogens. These traits can be recognized based on signatures of strong divergent selection between species or through the association of allelic combination conferring hybrid inferiority. Comparative genome analyses also provide information about the contribution of genome rearrangements to speciation. This is particularly relevant for species of fungal pathogens with extreme levels of genomic rearrangements and within-species genome plasticity.

AB Two conflicting hypotheses have been proposed to explain large-scale species diversity patterns and dynamics. The unbounded hypothesis proposes that regional diversity depends only on time and diversification rate and increases without limit. The bounded hypothesis proposes that ecological constraints place upper limits on regional diversity and that diversity is usually close to its limit. Recent evidence from the fossil record, phylogenetic analysis, biogeography, and phenotypic disparity during lineage diversification suggests that diversity is constrained by ecological processes but that it is rarely asymptotic. Niche space is often unfilled or can be more finely subdivided and still permit coexistence, and new niche space is often created before ecological limits are reached. Damped increases in diversity over time are the prevalent pattern, suggesting the need for a new 'damped increase hypothesis'. The damped increase hypothesis predicts that diversity generally increases through time but that its rate of increase is often slowed by ecological constraints. However, slowing due to niche limitation must be distinguished from other possible mechanisms creating similar patterns. These include sampling artifacts, the inability to detect extinctions or declines in clade diversity with some methods, the distorting effects of correlated speciation-extinction dynamics, the likelihood that opportunities for allopatric speciation will vary in space and time, and the role of undetected natural enemies in reducing host ranges and thus slowing speciation rates. The taxonomic scope of regional diversity studies must be broadened to include all ecologically similar species so that ecological constraints may be accurately inferred. The damped increase hypothesis suggests that information on evolutionary processes such as time-for-speciation and intrinsic diversification rates as well as ecological factors will be required to explain why regional diversity varies among times, places and taxa.

AB Most species are superbly and intricately adapted to the environments in which they live. Adaptive evolution by natural selection is the primary force shaping biological diversity. Differences between closely related species in ecologically selected characters such as habitat preference, reproductive timing, courtship behavior, or pollinator attraction may prevent interbreeding in nature, causing reproductive isolation. But does ecological adaptation cause reproductive incompatibilities such as hybrid sterility or lethality? Although several genes causing hybrid incompatibilities have been identified, there is intense debate over whether the genes that contribute to ecological adaptations also cause hybrid incompatibilities. Thirty years ago, a genetic study of local adaptation to copper mine soils in the wildflower Mimulus guttatus identified a locus that appeared to cause copper tolerance and hybrid lethality in crosses to other populations. But do copper tolerance and hybrid lethality have the same molecular genetic basis? Here we show, using high-resolution genome mapping, that copper tolerance and hybrid lethality are not caused by the same gene but are in fact separately controlled by two tightly linked loci. We further show that selection on the copper tolerance locus indirectly caused the hybrid incompatibility allele to go to high frequency in the copper mine population because of hitchhiking. Our results provide a new twist on Darwin's original supposition that hybrid incompatibilities evolve as an incidental by-product of ordinary adaptation to the environment.

AB Competing spatial claims and conflicts between maritime economic activities and biodiversity in Europe's seas continue to challenge governments and non-governmental actors. Responses to these problems have resulted in a fragmented patchwork of EU policies, private initiatives, and regulations on different levels. It is clear that the different sets of problems in each sea and the existing institutional arrangements (often created in an ad hoc fashion) require different responses and that a regional approach to marine governance is more flexible than a pan-European one.
   This paper explores whether and how it is possible to develop integrated maritime governance arrangements for Europe's regional seas. It explores the sui generis institutional setting of the EU - a fragmented system in constant flux and the roles of the Regional Sea Commissions, Member States and other stakeholders. This, together with Wallace's concept of the swinging pendulum of governance, provides us with the basis to identify the conditions for more effective and legitimate EU marine governance arrangements and examine whether it is possible to turn the tide of marine governance to the level of the regional sea? Using concepts from institutional theory, such as institutional ambiguity, institutional layering and conversion and institutional capacity building, this paper develops six building blocks that could help to turn the tide, help to develop legitimate regional-level marine governance arrangements and strengthen the capacity of marine institutions and governance.

AB Leaching losses of nitrogen (N) from soil and atmospheric N deposition have led to widespread changes in plant community and microbial community composition, but our knowledge of the factors that determine ecosystem N retention is limited. A common feature of extensively managed, species-rich grasslands is that they have fungal-dominated microbial communities, which might reduce soil N losses and increase ecosystem N retention, which is pivotal for pollution mitigation and sustainable food production. However, the mechanisms that underpin improved N retention in extensively managed, species-rich grasslands are unclear. We combined a landscape-scale field study and glasshouse experiment to test how grassland management affects plant and soil N retention. Specifically, we hypothesised that extensively managed, species-rich grasslands of high conservation value would have lower N loss and greater N retention than intensively managed, species-poor grasslands, and that this would be due to a greater immobilisation of N by a more fungal-dominated microbial community. In the field study, we found that extensively managed, species-rich grasslands had lower N leaching losses. Soil inorganic N availability decreased with increasing abundance of fungi relative to bacteria, although the best predictor of soil N leaching was the C/N ratio of aboveground plant biomass. In the associated glasshouse experiment we found that retention of added N-15 was greater in extensively than in intensively managed grasslands, which was attributed to a combination of greater root uptake and microbial immobilisation of N-15 in the former, and that microbial immobilisation increased with increasing biomass and abundance of fungi. These findings show that grassland management affects mechanisms of N retention in soil through changes in root and microbial uptake of N. Moreover, they support the notion that microbial communities might be the key to improved N retention through tightening linkages between plants and microbes and reducing N availability.

AB We investigated here the demographical history of Tabebuia impetiginosa (Bignoniaceae) to understand the dynamics of the disjunct geographical distribution of South American seasonally dry forests (SDFs), based on coupling an ensemble approach encompassing hindcasting species distribution modelling and statistical phylogeographical analysis. We sampled 17 populations (280 individuals) in central Brazil and analysed the polymorphisms at chloroplast (trnS-trnG, psbA-trnH, and ycf6-trnC intergenic spacers) and nuclear (ITS nrDNA) genomes. Phylogenetic analyses based on median-joining network showed no haplotype sharing among population but strong evidence of incomplete lineage sorting. Coalescent analyses showed historical constant populations size, negligible gene flow among populations, and an ancient time to most recent common ancestor dated from 4.7 +/- 1.1 Myr BP. Most divergences dated from the Lower Pleistocene, and no signal of important population size reduction was found in coalescent tree and tests of demographical expansion. Demographical scenarios were built based on past geographical range dynamic models, using two a priori biogeographical hypotheses (Pleistocene Arc and Amazonian SDF expansion) and on two additional hypotheses suggested by the palaeodistribution modelling built with several algorithms for distribution modelling and palaeoclimatic data. The simulation of these demographical scenarios showed that the pattern of diversity found so far for T. impetiginosa is in consonance with a palaeodistribution expansion during the last glacial maximum (LGM, 21 kyr BP), strongly suggesting that the current disjunct distribution of T. impetiginosa in SDFs may represent a climatic relict of a once more wide distribution.

AB 1. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are recognized as having significant social, economic and ecological costs, threatening human health, food security, wildlife conservation and biodiversity. We review the processes underlying the emergence of infectious disease, focusing on the similarities and differences between conceptual models of disease emergence and biological invasions in general.
   2. Study of the IUCN's list of the world's worst invaders reveals that disease is cited as a driver behind the conservation, medical or economic impact of nearly a quarter of the species on the data base.
   3. The emergence of novel diseases in new host species are, in essence, examples of invasions by parasites. Many of the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence and classical invasions are also shared, with environmental change and global transport providing opportunities for the introduction and spread of invaders and novel parasites.
   4. The phases of disease emergence and biological invasions have many parallels; particularly the early and late phases, where demographic and anthropogenic factors are key drivers. However, there are also differences in the intermediate phases, where hostparasite co-evolution plays a crucial role in determining parasite establishment in novel hosts.
   5. Similar opportunities and constraints on control and management occur at the different phases of invasions and disease emergence. However, exploitation of host immune responses offers additional control opportunities through contact control and vaccination against EIDs. We propose that cross-fertilization between the disciplines of disease emergence and invasion biology may provide further insights into their prediction, control and management.

AB The delta N-15 values of organisms are commonly used across diverse ecosystems to estimate trophic position and infer trophic connectivity. We undertook a novel cross-basin comparison of trophic position in two ecologically well-characterized and different groups of dominant mid-water fish consumers using amino acid nitrogen isotope compositions. We found that trophic positions estimated from the delta N-15 values of individual amino acids are nearly uniform within both families of these fishes across five global regions despite great variability in bulk tissue delta N-15 values. Regional differences in the delta N-15 values of phenylalanine confirmed that bulk tissue delta N-15 values reflect region-specific water mass biogeochemistry controlling delta N-15 values at the base of the food web. Trophic positions calculated from amino acid isotopic analyses (AA-TP) for lanternfishes (family Myctophidae) (AA-TP similar to 2.9) largely align with expectations from stomach content studies (TP similar to 3.2), while AA-TPs for dragonfishes (family Stomiidae) (AA-TP similar to 3.2) were lower than TPs derived from stomach content studies (TP similar to 4.1). We demonstrate that amino acid nitrogen isotope analysis can overcome shortcomings of bulk tissue isotope analysis across biogeochemically distinct systems to provide globally comparative information regarding marine food web structure.

Although there are 30 enzymes in this protein kinase family, their conservation across the fungi, plant, and animal kingdom confirms their evolutionary importance. Already, a large volume of work has accumulated on the tissue distribution, binding partners, signaling cascades, and physiological roles of mammalian SPAK and OSR1 in multiple organ systems. After reviewing this basic information, we will examine newer studies that demonstrate the pathophysiological consequences to SPAK and/or OSR1 disruption, discuss the development and analysis of genetically engineered mouse models, and address the possible role these serine/threonine kinases might have in cancer proliferation and migration.

AB Fire is a major force driving the evolution of plants and the structure and function of ecosystems globally. It thus likely operates as an important environmental filter that selects for species that have evolved to tolerate and depend on fire. Across a 40-year experimental fire gradient from frequently burned open savanna to unburned dense woodland in Minnesota, USA, we examined the relationships among community assembly, evolutionary history, and functional trait composition. Close relatives had similar abundance patterns across the fire gradient, providing evidence for phylogenetic conservatism in fire adaptation and highlighting the importance of shared ancestry in predicting species responses to fire.
   Phylogenetic beta diversity was greatest between the most extreme fire treatments across the gradient, indicating that species in the most contrasting fire regimes were most distantly related. Fire strongly influenced diversity, co-occurrence patterns, and leaf trait means and variances within communities. The most frequently burned communities had the highest species richness, exhibited the most resource-conservative leaf traits, and spanned the greatest number of phylogenetic lineages but harbored more close relatives within those lineages than other communities. In contrast, unburned communities had the lowest species diversity, the most acquisitive leaf traits, and the fewest phylogenetic lineages, but close relatives co-occurred less frequently. The largest difference in abundance between treatments occurred within the Rosales, Asteraceae, Vitaceae, and the Poaceae; woody Rosales were strongly selected for in unburned communities, while composites and grasses of the Poaceae were strongly selected for under frequent burning.
   A major climatic perturbation of consecutive hot, dry summers in the late 1980s prompted a significant shift in the functional and phylogenetic composition of communities. Greater than expected turnover in species composition occurred following the drought years, and then again during the subsequent five-year rebound period. Just after the drought year, turnover was greatest among recently diverged taxa, whereas during the rebound period turnover was greater among taxa that diverged deep in the phylogeny. The drought years also caused a short-term shift in functional traits, including declines in specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content and an increase in leaf length. These results indicate that the phylogenetic and functional trait composition of communities are responsive both to fire gradients and to shocks to the system, such as climatic perturbation.

AB 1. Many recent studies have quantified the relative importance of environmental variables and dispersal limitations in shaping the structure of stream communities. However, the relative importance of these factors at different spatial extents has been seldom evaluated. 2. We analysed the distribution of caddisfly species in 89 Amazonian streams in relation to stream characteristics and spatial variables representing overland dispersal routes. The streams occur in three regions that differ in spatial extent and environmental characteristics. We analysed the data using partial redundancy analysis with two predictor data sets, one environmental and one spatial, to evaluate the variation in assemblage composition. We also separated caddisflies into good and poor dispersers to evaluate possible differences in the responses of these two groups. 3. The environmental component explained a higher proportion of variance in assemblage composition than did the spatial component. Spatial effects were evident only when data from all three regions were analysed together, although the exclusive spatial fraction was quite low. Good dispersers responded similarly to the community as a whole, while poor dispersers were related to environmental variables only in one region and also were not related to spatial variables. 4. Caddisflies were most affected by environmental factors. The large environmental effect and small spatial effect are in accord with the use of these stream insects as good indicators of site properties and disturbances in monitoring programmes.

AB Disturbance processes of various types substantially modify ecosystem carbon dynamics both temporally and spatially, and constitute a fundamental part of larger landscape-level dynamics. Forests typically lose carbon for several years to several decades following severe disturbance, but our understanding of the duration and dynamics of post-disturbance forest carbon fluxes remains limited. Here we capitalize on a recent North American Carbon Program disturbance synthesis to discuss techniques and future work needed to better understand carbon dynamics after forest disturbance. Specifically, this paper addresses three topics: (1) the history, spatial distribution, and characteristics of different types of disturbance (in particular fire, insects, and harvest) in North America; (2) the integrated measurements and experimental designs required to quantify forest carbon dynamics in the years and decades after disturbance, as presented in a series of case studies; and (3) a synthesis of the greatest uncertainties spanning these studies, as well as the utility of multiple types of observations (independent but mutually constraining data) in understanding their dynamics. The case studies-in the southeast U. S., central boreal Canada, U. S. Rocky Mountains, and Pacific Northwest-explore how different measurements can be used to constrain and understand carbon dynamics in regrowing forests, with the most important measurements summarized for each disturbance type. We identify disturbance severity and history as key but highly uncertain factors driving post-disturbance carbon source-sink dynamics across all disturbance types. We suggest that imaginative, integrative analyses using multiple lines of evidence, increased measurement capabilities, shared models and online data sets, and innovative numerical algorithms hold promise for improved understanding and prediction of carbon dynamics in disturbance-prone forests.

AB Pastoral production systems in the Spanish Pyrenees have changed dramatically in recent decades, leading to the loss of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). We documented TEK of pastoralists from two valleys in the western Central Pyrenees of Aragn and explored its potential applications to resource management and adaptation. Pyrenean pastoralists possess extensive knowledge of relationships between terrain, climate, vegetation and animal nutrition and behavior. TEK could contribute to sustainable stewardship and facilitate adaptation by informing pasture monitoring; providing traditional practices to manage mountain vegetation; and preserving knowledge of extensive livestock production strategies, such as transhumance. Institutional barriers to applying TEK include weak economic cooperation among stockmen, their dependence on EU subsidies, and lack of voice in regional government decisions about local resources. A more collaborative, place-based stewardship of the Central Pyrenees might begin with direct involvement of pastoralists in designing monitoring of pasture conditions and vegetation type changes.

AB In West Africa, lineage splitting between the M and S molecular forms of the major Afro-tropical malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae), is thought to be driven by ecological divergence, occurring mainly at the larval stage. Here, we present evidence for habitat segregation between the two molecular forms in and around irrigated rice fields located within the humid savannahs of western Burkina Faso. Longitudinal sampling of adult mosquitoes emerging from a range of breeding sites distributed along a transect extending from the heart of the rice field area into the surrounding savannah was conducted from June to November 2009. Analysis revealed that the two molecular forms and their sibling species Anopheles arabiensis are not randomly distributed in the area. A major ecological gradient was extracted in relation to the perimeter of the rice fields. The M form was associated with larger breeding sites mostly consisting of rice paddies, whereas the S form and An. arabiensis were found to depend upon temporary, rain-filled breeding sites. These results support hypotheses about larval habitat segregation and confirm the suggestion that the forms have different larval habitat requirements. Segregation appears to be clearly linked to anthropogenic permanent habitats and the community structure they support.

AB The long residence time of carbon in forests and soils means that both the current state and future behavior of the terrestrial biosphere are influenced by past variability in climate and anthropogenic land use. Over the last half-millennium, European terrestrial ecosystems were affected by the cool temperatures of the Little Ice Age, rising CO2 concentrations, and human induced deforestation and land abandonment. To quantify the importance of these processes, we performed a series of simulations with the LPJ dynamic vegetation model driven by reconstructed climate, land use, and CO2 concentrations. Although land use change was the major control on the carbon inventory of Europe over the last 500years, the current state of the terrestrial biosphere is largely controlled by land use change during the past century. Between 1500 and 2000, climate variability led to temporary sequestration events of up to 3Pg, whereas increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the 20th century led to an increase in carbon storage of up to 15Pg. Anthropogenic land use caused between 25Pg of carbon emissions and 5Pg of uptake over the same time period, depending on the historical and spatial pattern of past land use and the timing of the reversal from deforestation to afforestation during the last two centuries. None of the currently existing anthropogenic land use change datasets adequately capture the timing of the forest transition in most European countries as recorded in historical observations. Despite considerable uncertainty, our scenarios indicate that with limited management, extant European forests have the potential to absorb between 5 and 12Pg of carbon at the present day.

AB There is a long tradition in ecology of evaluating the relative contribution of the regional species pool and local interactions on the structure of local communities. Similarly, a growing number of studies assess the phylogenetic structure of communities, relative to that in the regional species pool, to examine the interplay between broad-scale evolutionary and fine-scale ecological processes. Finally, a renewed interest in the influence of species source pools on communities has shown that the definition of the source pool influences interpretations of patterns of community structure. We use a continent-wide dataset of local ant communities and implement ecologically explicit source pool definitions to examine the relative importance of regional species pools and local interactions for shaping community structure. Then we assess which factors underlie systematic variation in the structure of communities along climatic gradients. We find that the average phylogenetic relatedness of species in ant communities decreases from tropical to temperate regions, but the strength of this relationship depends on the level of ecological realism in the definition of source pools. We conclude that the evolution of climatic niches influences the phylogenetic structure of regional source pools and that the influence of regional source pools on local community structure is strong.

AB Water temperature is an important abiotic driver of aquatic ecosystems. It influences many aspects of an organism's existence including its growth, feeding and metabolic rates; emergence; fecundity; behaviour and ultimately survival. All organisms have an optimum temperature range within which they survive and are able to thrive. Determining upper thermal limits provides insight into the relative sensitivity of organisms to elevated temperatures. Thermally sensitive taxa may be useful as bioindicators of thermal alteration and used in the generation of target thermal thresholds for aquatic systems. This study determined the upper thermal limit (CTmax) of a range of aquatic macroinvertebrates from rivers in the south-western Cape, South Africa, using the dynamic Critical Thermal Method. The study focused on the taxonomic level of family as an initial screening tool for ranking thermal sensitivity. Of the 27 families examined, four were both thermally sensitive and highly suitable as test organisms, including Paramelitidae, Notonemouridae, Teloganodidae and Philopotamidae. Five families were moderately sensitive and highly suitable, including Palaemonidae, Heptageniidae, Leptophlebiidae, Corydalidae and Aeshnidae. Preliminary experiments to determine potential sources of variation in CTmax revealed that thermal sensitivity was relatively uniform within families, but that acclimation temperature influenced CTmax. Further investigation of the influence of thermal history, acclimation temperature and rate of temperature change on CTmax is necessary. Target water temperatures for river management will be derived using CTmax data, in addition to longer duration experimental data, which will be linked to in situ temperature data.

AB The Antarctic continent is frequently cited as the last pristine continent on Earth. However, this view is misleading for several reasons. First, there has been a rapid increase in visitors to Antarctica, with large increases at research bases and their environs and to sites of major tourist interest (e.g. historical sites and concentrations of megafauna). Second, although substantial efforts are made to avoid physical disturbance and contamination by chemical, human and other wastes at these sites, little has been done to prevent the introduction of non-indigenous microorganisms. Here, we analyse the extent and significance of anthropogenic introduction of microbial 'contaminants' to the Antarctic continent. We conclude that such processes are unlikely to have any immediate gross impact on microbiological community structure or function, but that increased efforts are required to protect the unique ecosystems of Antarctica from microbial and genetic contamination and homogenisation.

AB The use of silvicultural systems based on the natural disturbance patterns for a given region has been suggested as an approach for promoting late-successional forest characteristics and maintaining native biodiversity in managed forests. To this end, we examined the effectiveness of natural disturbance-based harvest gaps in maintaining and restoring native tree species diversity within second-growth northern hardwood systems in northeastern Minnesota, USA. In particular, tree regeneration and downed coarse woody debris (CWD) were measured 6- and 7-years post-treatment in 46 gaps that emulated the historic range of natural canopy opening sizes for northern hardwood forests in the upper Great Lakes region. Measurements were compared across gap size-classes (>0-0.02, >0.02-0.04, >0.04 ha) and with closed canopy portions of these systems. In addition, the factors affecting the recruitment of Berula alleghaniensis across gaps and within closed canopy were investigated due to the historical importance of this species in these forests.
   Seedling and sapling densities increased in harvest gaps; however, results indicated that these gaps did little to increase tree diversity, including the recruitment of shade mid-tolerant species, such as B. alleghaniensis. Gaps were dominated primarily by Acer saccharum and age distributions of dominant saplings within gaps indicated that most individuals established 10-40 years prior to gap formation. Establishment of B. alleghaniensis was strongly related to highly decayed, large coniferous pieces of CWD with little recruitment occurring on the undisturbed forest floor. Age distributions of B. alleghaniensis established on CWD suggest this species can persist on this substrate for at least a decade. Levels of CWD increased with increasing gap size; however, all gaps had lower levels of CWD compared to the surrounding intact forest. Our results suggest that management regimes based on natural canopy gap sizes within northern hardwood systems will do little to restore native tree diversity if provisions for creating the suitable seedling microsites historically generated by natural disturbance (e.g., exposed mineral soil, highly decayed wood) are not included within management prescriptions.

AB Transcontinental dispersals by organisms usually represent improbable events that constitute a major challenge for biogeographers. By integrating molecular phylogeny, historical biogeography and palaeoecology, we test a bold hypothesis proposed by Vladimir Nabokov regarding the origin of Neotropical Polyommatus blue butterflies, and show that Beringia has served as a biological corridor for the dispersal of these insects from Asia into the New World. We present a novel method to estimate ancestral temperature tolerances using distribution range limits of extant organisms, and find that climatic conditions in Beringia acted as a decisive filter in determining which taxa crossed into the New World during five separate invasions over the past 11 Myr. Our results reveal a marked effect of the Miocene-Pleistocene global cooling, and demonstrate that palaeoclimatic conditions left a strong signal on the ecology of present-day taxa in the New World. The phylogenetic conservatism in thermal tolerances that we have identified may permit the reconstruction of the palaeoecology of ancestral organisms, especially mobile taxa that can easily escape from hostile environments rather than adapt to them.

AB Given that ecological effects of disturbance have been extensively studied in many ecosystems, it is surprising that few quantitative syntheses across diverse ecosystems have been conducted. Multi-system studies tend to be qualitative because they focus on disturbance types that are difficult to measure in an ecologically relevant way. In addition, synthesis of existing studies across systems or disturbance types is challenging because sufficient information needed for analysis is not easily available. Theoretical advances and improved predictions can be advanced by generalizations obtained from synthesis activities that include multiple sites, ecosystems, and disturbance events. Building on existing research, we present a conceptual framework and an operational analog to integrate this rich body of knowledge and to promote quantitative comparisons of disturbance effects across different types of ecosystems and disturbances. This framework recognizes individual disturbance events that consist of three quantifiable components: (1) environmental drivers, (2) initial system properties, and (3) physical and biological mechanisms of effect, such as deposition, compaction, and combustion. These components result in biotic and abiotic legacies that can interact with subsequent drivers and successional processes to influence system response. Through time, a coarse-scale quasi-equilibrial state can be reached where variation in drivers interacting with biotic processes and feedbacks internal to the system results in variability in dynamics. At any time, a driver of sufficient magnitude can push the system beyond its realm of natural variability to initiate a new kind of event. We use long-term data from diverse terrestrial ecosystems to illustrate how our approach can facilitate cross-system comparisons, and provide new insights to the role of disturbance in ecological systems. We also provide key disturbance characteristics and measurements needed to promote future quantitative comparisons across ecosystems.

AB Host use by vectors is important in understanding the transmission of zoonotic diseases, which can affect humans, wildlife and domestic animals. Here, a synthesis of host exploitation patterns by kissing-bugs, vectors of Chagas disease, is presented. For this synthesis, an extensive literature review restricted to feeding sources analysed by precipitin tests was conducted. Modern tools from community ecology and multivariate statistics were used to determine patterns of segregation in host use. Rather than innate preferences for host species, host use by kissing-bugs is influenced by the habitats they colonise. One of the major limitations of studies on kissing-bug foraging has been the exclusive focus on the dominant vector species. We propose that expanding foraging studies to consider the community of vectors will substantially increase the understanding of Chagas disease transmission ecology. Our results indicate that host accessibility is a major factor that shapes the blood-foraging patterns of kissing-bugs. Therefore, from an applied perspective, measures that are directed at disrupting the contact between humans and kissing-bugs, such as housing improvement, are among the most desirable strategies for Chagas disease control.

AB The food web structure of two sandy beach ecosystems with contrasting morphodynamics (dissipative vs. reflective) was examined using stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis. Organic matter sources (POM: particulate organic matter; SOM: sediment organic matter) and consumers (zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fishes) were sampled seasonally in both sandy beaches. Food webs significantly differed between beaches: even though both webs were mainly supported by POM, depleted delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for food sources and consumers were found in the dissipative system (following the reverse pattern in delta C-13 values for consumers) for all the four seasons. Primary consumers (zooplankton and benthic invertebrates) use different organic matter sources on each beach and these differences are propagated up in the food web. The higher productivity found in the dissipative beach provided a significant amount of food for primary consumers, notably suspension feeders. Thus, the dissipative beach supported a more complex food web with more trophic links and a higher number of prey and top predators than the reflective beach. Morphodynamic factors could explain the contrasting differences in food web structure. The high degree of retention (nutrients and phytoplankton) recorded for the surf zone of the dissipative beach would result in the renewed accumulation of POM that sustains a more diverse and richer fauna than the reflective beach. Further studies directed to assess connections between the macroscopic food web, the surf-zone microbial loop and the interstitial compartment will provide a deeper understanding on the functioning of sandy beach ecosystems.

AB Two models of a density dependent predator-prey system with Beddington-DeAngelis functional response are systematically considered. One includes the time delay in the functional response and the other does not. The explorations involve the permanence, local asymptotic stability and global asymptotic stability of the positive equilibrium for the models by using stability theory of differential equations and Lyapunov functions. For the permanence, the density dependence for predators is shown to give some negative effect for the two models. Further the permanence implies the local asymptotic stability for a positive equilibrium point of the model without delay. Also the global asymptotic stability condition, which can be easily checked for the model is obtained. For the model with time delay, local and global asymptotic stability conditions are obtained.

AB The long-term changes of tropical intertidal seagrass, mainly Halodule uninervis and Halophila ovalis meadows and their relationship to climate are poorly documented. Developing a greater understanding of the effects of climate on seagrass meadows is critical for estimating the effects of future climate change scenarios. Here we document the temporal dynamics of coastal intertidal seagrass in tropical northeast Australia over 16 yr of detailed monitoring. This study is the first to directly relate such change to long-term climate variability in the Indo-Pacific region and southern hemisphere. Regression modelling was used to relate seagrass biomass and meadow area measurements to climate data. The aboveground biomass and area of the meadow were correlated with the interacting factors of air temperature, precipitation, daytime tidal exposure and freshwater runoff from nearby rivers. Elevated temperature and reduced flow from rivers were significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.6, p < 0.001) with periods of lower seagrass biomass. Results of this study have important implications for the long-term viability of seagrasses with regard to climate change scenarios. Modelling of our findings indicates that future higher temperatures could be detrimental to Indo-Pacific intertidal, coastal and estuarine seagrass meadows.

AB Genome scan approaches to detect footprints of directional selection in the genomes of wild animal and plant populations have become popular tools to study local adaptation and speciation at the molecular level. Most studies thus far have used random molecular markers and found footprints of directional selection at, on average, 5% (range: 1-15%) of the examined loci. We focused on physiologically important genes that exhibit transcriptional responses to specific environmental or developmental conditions and assessed if these genes have been subject to directional selection and are responsible for local adaptation in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Using microsatellite markers located within or closely linked to (< 6 kb) target genes, we investigated footprints of directional selection for 157 genes with known physiological functions in three marine and six freshwater populations. A high incidence (16.6%) of footprints of directional selection for these genes was revealed by four different outlier tests. In a subset of four populations screened with both physiologically important and random genes, footprints of directional selection were more frequent in physiologically important genes (13.4%) as compared with random genes (2.4%). In general, our findings indicate strong selective pressures on physiologically important genes, suggesting that these genes have significant functions in evolutionary adaptation to environmental heterogeneity.

AB Phylogeographic methods facilitate inference of the geographical history of genetic lineages. Recent examples explore human migration and the origins of viral pandemics. There is longstanding disagreement over the use and validity of certain phylogeographic inference methodologies. In this paper, we highlight three distinct frameworks for phylogeographic inference to give a taste of this disagreement. Each of the three approaches presents a different viewpoint on phylogeography, most fundamentally on how we view the relationship between the inferred history of a sample and the history of the population the sample is embedded in. Satisfactory resolution of this relationship between history of the tree and history of the population remains a challenge for all but the most trivial models of phylogeographic processes. Intriguingly, we believe that some recent methods that entirely avoid inference about the history of the population will eventually help to reach a resolution.

AB Ecosystem modifiers have the ability to significantly alter the ecosystem they inhabit sometimes with serious consequences for their own populations. We evaluated the ability of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) to modify seagrass ecosystems by their foraging activity. This study was conducted in a seagrass-dominated lagoon in the Lakshadweep Islands, Indian Ocean, where a stable high-density congregation of green turtles is present. We determined a gradient of turtle density in the lagoon and measured the intensity of turtle herbivory across the gradient. We then measured the impact of increasing grazing on seagrass structural parameters, growth and flowering along this gradient. Our results indicate that turtles substantially change seagrass meadow structure (canopy height, shoot length, width and density), reduce flowering and can potentially even cause changes in the species composition of the meadow. We discuss the implications of these results for seagrass ecosystem function, green turtle movement and human attitudes. When conserving ecosystem modifiers like the green turtle, any management strategy needs to include a detailed knowledge of the roles these species play in the ecosystems they inhabit.

AB Despite a long-standing belief that insect pollinators can select for certain flower colors, there are few experimental demonstrations that free-flying insects choose between natural flowers based on color. We investigated responses of insect visitors to experimental manipulations of flower color in the New Zealand alpine. Native syrphid flies (Allograpta and Platycheirus) and solitary bees (Hylaeus and Leioproctus) showed distinct preferences for visiting certain flower species. These responses were determined, in part, by flower color, as insects also responded to experimental manipulations of visible petal color in 7 out of 11 tests with different combinations of flower species and insect type. When preferences were detected, syrphid flies chose yellow over white petals regardless of flower species, whereas Hylaeus chose white over yellow Ourisia glandulosa. In some cases, the strength and direction of color preference depended on the context of other floral traits, in which case the response usually favored the familiar, normal combination of traits. Syrphid flies also visited in response to floral morphological traits but did not show preference based on UV reflectance. The unusually high preponderance of white flowers in the New Zealand alpine is not explained by complete generalization of flower color choice. Instead, the insect visitors show preferences based on color, including colors other than white, along with other floral traits. Furthermore, they can respond in complex ways to combinations of floral cues, suggesting that traits may act in nonadditive ways in determining pollinator visitation.

AB Background: Ecological speciation is a process in which a transiently resource-polymorphic species divides into two specialized sister lineages as a result of divergent selection pressures caused by the use of multiple niches or environments. Ecology-based speciation has been studied intensively in plant-feeding insects, in which both sympatric and allopatric shifts onto novel host plants could speed up diversification. However, while numerous examples of species pairs likely to have originated by resource shifts have been found, the overall importance of ecological speciation in relation to other, non-ecological speciation modes remains unknown. Here, we apply phylogenetic information on sawflies belonging to the 'Higher' Nematinae (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) to infer the frequency of niche shifts in relation to speciation events.
   Results: Phylogenetic trees reconstructed on the basis of DNA sequence data show that the diversification of higher nematines has involved frequent shifts in larval feeding habits and in the use of plant taxa. However, the inferred number of resource shifts is considerably lower than the number of past speciation events, indicating that the majority of divergences have occurred by non-ecological allopatric speciation; based on a time-corrected analysis of sister species, we estimate that a maximum of c. 20% of lineage splits have been triggered by a change in resource use. In addition, we find that postspeciational changes in geographic distributions have led to broad sympatry in many species having identical host-plant ranges.
   Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that the importance of niche shifts for the diversification of herbivorous insects is at present implicitly and explicitly overestimated. In the case of the Higher Nematinae, employing a time correction for sister-species comparisons lowered the proportion of apparent ecology-based speciation events from c. 50-60% to around 20%, but such corrections are still lacking in other herbivore groups. The observed convergent but asynchronous shifting among dominant northern plant taxa in many higher-nematine clades, in combination with the broad overlaps in the geographic distributions of numerous nematine species occupying near-identical niches, indicates that host-plant shifts and herbivore community assembly are largely unconstrained by direct or indirect competition among species. More phylogeny-based studies on connections between niche diversification and speciation are needed across many insect taxa, especially in groups that exhibit few host shifts in relation to speciation.

AB Resprouting is an important persistence strategy for woody species and represents a dominant pathway of regeneration in many plant communities, with potentially large consequences for vegetation dynamics, community composition, and species coexistence. Most of our knowledge of resprouting strategies comes from fire-prone systems, but this cannot be readily applied to other systems where disturbances are less intense. In this study we evaluated sapling responses to stem snapping for 49 moist-forest species and 36 dry-forest species from two Bolivian tropical forests. To this end we compared in a field experiment the survival and height growth of clipped and control saplings for a two-year period, and related this to the shade tolerance, carbohydrate reserves, and the morphological traits (wood density, leaf size) of the species.
   Nearly all saplings resprouted readily after stem damage, although dry-forest species realized, on average, a better survival and growth after stem damage compared to moist-forest species. Shade-tolerant species were better at resprouting than light-demanding species in moist forest. This resprouting ability is an important prerequisite for successful regeneration in the shaded understory, where saplings frequently suffer damage from falling debris. Survival after stem damage was, surprisingly, only modestly related to stem reserves, and much more strongly related to wood density, possibly because a high wood density enables plants to resist fungi and pathogens and to reduce stem decay. Correlations between sapling performance and functional traits were similar for the two forest types, and for phylogenetically independent contrasts and for cross-species analyses. The consistency of these results suggests that tropical forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions. A high resprouting ability, as well as investments in stem defense and storage reserves, form part of a suite of co-evolved traits that underlies the growth-survival trade-off, and contributes to light gradient partitioning and species coexistence. These links with shade tolerance are important in the moist evergreen forest, which casts a deep, more persistent shade, but tend to diminish in dry deciduous forest where light is a less limiting resource.

AB Generating electricity from waves is predicted to be a new source of renewable energy conversion expanding significantly, with a global potential in the range of wind and hydropower. Several wave power techniques are on the merge of commercialisation, and thus evoke questions of environmental concern. Conservation matters are to some extent valid independent of technique but we mainly focus on point absorbing linear generators. By giving examples from the Lysekil project, run by Uppsala University and situated on the Swedish west coast, we demonstrate ongoing and future environmental studies to be performed along with technical research and development. We describe general environmental aspects generated by wave power projects; issues also likely to appear in Environmental Impact Assessment studies. Colonisation patterns and biofouling are discussed with particular reference to changes of the seabed and alterations due to new substrates. A purposeful artificial reef design to specially cater for economically important or threatened species is also discussed. Questions related to fish, fishery and marine mammals are other examples of topics where, e.g. no-take zones, marine bioacoustics and electromagnetic fields are important areas. In this review we point out areas in which studies likely will be needed, as ventures out in the oceans also will give ample opportunities for marine environmental research in general and in areas not previously studied. Marine environmental and ecological aspects appear to be unavoidable for application processes and in post-deployment studies concerning renewable energy extraction. Still, all large-scale renewable energy conversion will cause some impact mainly by being area demanding. An early incorporation of multidisciplinary and high quality research might be a key for new ocean-based techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated aquatic insect utilization and PCB exposure in riparian spiders at the Lake Hartwell Superfund site (Clemson, SC). We sampled sediments, adult chironomids, terrestrial insects, riparian spiders (Tetragnathidae, Araneidae, and Mecynogea lemniscata), and upland spiders (Araneidae) along a sediment contamination gradient Stable isotopes (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) indicated that riparian spiders primarily consumed aquatic insects whereas upland spiders consumed terrestrial insects. PCBs in chironomids (mean 1240 ng/g among sites) were 2 orders of magnitude higher than terrestrial insects (15.2 ng/g), similar to differences between riparian (820-2012 ng/g) and upland spiders (30 ng/g). Riparian spider PCBs were positively correlated with sediment concentrations for all taxa (r(2) = 0.44-0.87). We calculated spider-based wildlife values (WVs, the minimum spider PCB concentrations causing physiologically significant doses in consumers) to assess exposure risks for arachnivorous birds. Spider concentrations exceeded WVs for most birds at heavily contaminated sites and were similar to 14-fold higher for the most sensitive species (chickadee nestlings, Poecile spp.). Spiders are abundant and ubiquitous in riparian habitats, where they depend on aquatic insect prey. These traits, along with the high degree of spatial correlation between spider and sediment concentrations we observed, suggest that they are model indicator species for monitoring contaminated sediment sites and assessing risks associated with contaminant flux into terrestrial ecosystems.

AB We propose a fundamental geographic distribution for the wolverine (Golo gulo (L., 1758)) based on the hypothesis that the occurrence of wolverines is constrained by their obligate association with persistent spring snow cover for successful reproductive denning and by an upper limit of thermoneutrality. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed a composite of MODIS classified satellite images representing persistent snow cover from 24 April to 15 May. which encompasses the end of the wolverine's reproductive denning period. To investigate the wolverine's spatial relationship with average maximum August temperatures, we used interpolated temperature maps. We then compared and correlated these climatic factors with spatially referenced data on wolverine den sites and telemetry locations from North America and Fennoscandia, and our contemporary understanding of the wolverine's circumboreal ranee. All 562 reproductive dens from Fennoscandia and North America occurred at sites with persistent spring snow cover. Ninety-five percent of summer and 86% of winter telemetry locations were concordant with spring snow coverage. Average maximum August temperature was a less effective predictor of wolverine presence. although wolverines preferred summer temperatures lower than those available. Reductions in spring snow cover associated with climatic warming will likely reduce the extent of wolverine habitat, with an associated loss of connectivity.

AB Biodiversity conservation does predominantly focus on protected natural areas, but has to consider also the usually Human-dominated matrix in which these natural areas are embedded. Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The Nme family, previously known as Nm23 or NDPK, is involved in various molecular processes including tumor metastasis and some members of the family, but not all, exhibit a Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase (NDPK) activity. Ten genes are known in humans, in which some members have been extensively studied. In non-mammalian species, the Nme protein family has received, in contrast, far less attention. The picture of the vertebrate Nme family remains thus incomplete and orthology relationships with mammalian counterparts were only partially characterized. The present study therefore aimed at characterizing the Nme gene repertoire in vertebrates with special interest for teleosts, and providing a comprehensive overview of the Nme gene family evolutionary history in vertebrates.
   Results: In the present study, we present the evolutionary history of the Nme family in vertebrates and characterize the gene family repertoire for the first time in several non-mammalian species. Our observations show that vertebrate Nme genes can be separated in two evolutionary distinct groups. Nme1, Nme2, Nme3, and Nme4 belong to Group I while vertebrate Nme5, Nme6, Nme7, Nme8, and Nme9 belong to Group II. The position of Nme10 is in contrast more debatable due to its very specific evolutionary history. The present study clearly indicates that Nme5, Nme6, Nme7, and Nme8 originate from duplication events that occurred before the chordate radiation. In contrast, Nme genes of the Group I have a very different evolutionary history as our results suggest that they all arise from a common gene present in the chordate ancestor. In addition, expression patterns of all zebrafish nme transcripts were studied in a broad range of tissues by quantitative PCR and discussed in the light of the function of their mammalian counterparts.
   Conclusion: This work offers an evolutionary framework that will pave the way for future studies on vertebrate Nme proteins and provides a unified vertebrate Nme nomenclature that is consistent with the nomenclature in use in mammals. Based on protein structure and expression data, we also provide new insight into molecular functions of Nme proteins among vertebrates and raise intriguing questions on the roles of Nme proteins in gonads.

AB P>1. Species differ widely in the size and ecological characteristics of their geographic ranges. This variation reflects, in part, differences in ecological tolerance among taxa, but the influence of phylogeny and evolutionary divergence through genome duplication remains controversial.
   2. Here, we examine the evolutionary sources of variation in species range area, latitudinal position and overlap, and six range climatic variables (maximum, minimum and breadth of temperature and precipitation) for North American angiosperms. We sampled two diploid and one polyploid species from each of 144 genera and examined sources of variation in a nested taxonomic analysis and congeneric species pairs comparison.
   3. For all range characteristics studied, a significant portion of the variance among species (mean 53%, range 37-60%) was attributable to taxonomic membership above species (i.e. genus, family and order). Four of the seven range attributes were significantly correlated between diploid congeners (e.g. range area r(s) = 0.65) and between heteroploid (diploid and polyploid) congeners (e.g. range area r(s) = 0.62). The strength of correlations between heteroploid relatives was not consistently different than correlations between diploids.
   4. No differences in mean range breadth (range area, temperature breadth, precipitation breadth) or climatological position (minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation) were observed between diploid and polyploid congeners. Polyploids were not more likely to occupy northern latitudinal positions and were no more displaced from diploids than other congeneric diploids.
   5.Synthesis. Our results suggest that, at the scale of North America, the geographical and ecological aspects of species ranges are influenced by phylogenetic history. Furthermore, genome duplication does not cause or allow greater divergence in species range characteristics than occurs between related diploid species.

AB Despite two decades of research into the earliest Eocene fossils of the Rocky Mountain interior of North America, almost nothing is known of the squamates (lizards and snakes) from this time, nor of the response of this component of the terrestrial biota to climate change near the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. The present study addresses this lacuna. Sixteen squamate species are described in the earliest Eocene (Wao) Castle Gardens local fauna of the tower-most Willwood Formation of the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. These include: two new iguanids, a species similar to Geiseltaliellus on the stem of Corytophaninae (basilisks and relatives) and a polychrotine (anoles and relatives); new stem representatives of the xantusiid (night lizard) clades Lepidophyma and Xantusia; a 'higher' amphisbaenian (worm lizard) of indeterminate affinities; six anguids, including a new species on the stem of Anniella (California legless lizards), a ?stern diploglossine (galliwasps), a ?stern gerrhonotine (alligator lizards) and a new glyptosaurine morphologically intermediate between 'melanosaurins' and Glyptosaurini; a new anguimorph of undetermined affinities; and two species compared to the varanid (monitor lizard) taxon Saniwa.
   At least seven species at Castle Gardens were recent immigrants. The nearest relatives of one of these is obscure, but the other six (three iguanids, stem Lepidophyma, stem Anniella, ?stem Diploglossinae) have living relatives exclusively or almost exclusively confined to warm and frost-free (megathermal) parts of the New World. Among lizards, dispersal coincident with climatic warming near the Paleocene/Eocene boundary was predominantly intracontinental. It is argued that when habitat tracking occurs and phylogenetic niche conservatism obtains, species within a clade could migrate in broad concert in response to climate change. Mid-latitude fossil groups may have contributed directly to the modern tropical biota, making palaeontological data of direct relevance to evaluating historical influences on modern biodiversity patterns.

AB Recent studies show that intraspecific genetic variation in asexual species may have large effects on community and ecosystem functions, increasing their stability, productivity, and species richness. However, major questions regarding its population-level impact remain empirically unanswered: (a) How does intraspecific genetic diversity affect the ecological characteristics of sexual species, in which recombination can alter the outcome of causal mechanisms such as selection and niche diversification? (b) Does genetic diversity increase population dynamic stability? (c) Is the impact of genetic diversity dependent on the selective environment? To answer these questions, I founded replicate flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) populations with different degrees of ecologically relevant, heritable trait variation and monitored their dynamics for approximately eight generations. I show that population stability and persistence increased with greater genetic variation but that the stabilizing effect was independent of the selective habitat (different proportions of ancestral and novel resources). Alleles from a single founding strain underwent a selective sweep in the homogeneous ancestral habitat but not in a novel heterogeneous habitat. These results expand current understanding of the ecological impacts of genetic diversity by showing that genetically more diverse sexual populations persist longer and are more stable but that the selective environment determines the mechanistic basis of increased stability.

AB Determining the relative roles of vicariance and selection in restricting gene flow between populations is of central importance to the evolutionary process of population divergence and speciation. Here we use molecular and morphological data to contrast the effect of isolation (by mountains and geographical distance) with that of ecological factors (altitudinal gradients) in promoting differentiation in the wedge-billed woodcreeper, Glyphorynchus spirurus, a tropical forest bird, in Ecuador. Tarsus length and beak size increased relative to body size with altitude on both sides of the Andes, and were correlated with the amount of moss on tree trunks, suggesting the role of selection in driving adaptive divergence. In contrast, molecular data revealed a considerable degree of admixture along these altitudinal gradients, suggesting that adaptive divergence in morphological traits has occurred in the presence of gene flow. As suggested by mitochondrial DNA sequence data, the Andes act as a barrier to gene flow between ancient subspecific lineages. Genome-wide amplified fragment length polymorphism markers reflected more recent patterns of gene flow and revealed fine-scale patterns of population differentiation that were not detectable with mitochondrial DNA, including the differentiation of isolated coastal populations west of the Andes. Our results support the predominant role of geographical isolation in driving genetic differentiation in G. spirurus, yet suggest the role of selection in driving parallel morphological divergence along ecological gradients.

AB Character evolution that affects ecological community interactions often occurs contemporaneously with temporal changes in population size, potentially altering the very nature of those dynamics. Such eco-evolutionary processes may be most readily explored in systems with short generations and simple genetics. Asexual and cyclically parthenogenetic organisms such as microalgae, cladocerans and rotifers, which frequently dominate freshwater plankton communities, meet these requirements. Multiple clonal lines can coexist within each species over extended periods, until either fixation occurs or a sexual phase reshuffles the genetic material. When clones differ in traits affecting interspecific interactions, within-species clonal dynamics can have major effects on the population dynamics. We first consider a simple predator-prey system with two prey genotypes, parametrized with data from a well-studied experimental system, and explore how the extent of differences in defence against predation within the prey population determine dynamic stability versus instability of the system. We then explore how increased potential for evolution affects the community dynamics in a more general community model with multiple predator and multiple prey genotypes. These examples illustrate how microevolutionary 'details' that enhance or limit the potential for heritable phenotypic change can have significant effects on contemporaneous community-level dynamics and the persistence and coexistence of species.

AB What is the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the spread rate of populations? Several spatially explicit simulation models address this question for particular cases and find qualitative insights (e. g., extinction thresholds) but no quantitative relationships. We use a time-discrete analytic model and find general quantitative relationships for the invasion threshold, i.e., the minimal percentage of suitable habitat required for population spread. We investigate how, on the relevant spatial scales, this threshold depends on the relationship between dispersal ability and fragmentation level. The invasion threshold increases with fragmentation level when there is no Allee effect, but it decreases with fragmentation in the presence of an Allee effect. We obtain simple formulas for the approximate spread rate of a population in heterogeneous landscapes from averaging techniques. Comparison with spatially explicit simulations shows an excellent agreement between approximate and true values. We apply our results to the spread of trees and give some implications for the control of invasive species.

AB The light-use efficiency (LUE) of a mature Canadian Douglas-fir forest (DF49) was studied using high-resolution in situ temporal, spatial, and spectral measurements in conjunction with fluxes acquired from an instrumented tower. We examined the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), a spectral index responsive to high light conditions that alters reflectance at 531 nm, in combination with several alternative reference bands at 551, 570, and 488 nm. These indices were derived from directional reflectance spectra acquired by a hyperspectral radiometer system mounted on the DF49 tower, viewing the canopy through almost 360 rotations multiple times an hour daily throughout the 2006 growing season. From canopy structure information, three foliage sectors within the canopy were delineated according to instantaneous illumination conditions (sunlit, shaded, and mixed shaded-sunlit). On sunny days, the PRI indices for the sunlit foliage sector captured high light-induced stress responses, expressed as significantly different PRI values for sunlit versus shaded foliage. This difference was not observed on highly diffuse or overcast days. PRIs on sunny days tracked the diurnal photoregulation responses throughout the growing season in concert with illumination intensity. We computed the effective instantaneous LUE for the three foliage groups (LUEfoliage) using modeled and measured information. We provide convincing evidence that LUEfoliage can be well described and strongly related to all variations of the PRI within this coniferous forest under relatively clear skies (0.59 > r(2) > 0.80, P < 0.0001). LUEfoliage varied through the growing season between 0.015 and 0.075 mu mol C mu mol(-1) absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), and the lowest daily values were associated with the sunlit foliage group. The mixed sunlit-shaded foliage was the only group to exhibit monthly averages close to the maximum ecosystem LUE parameter (epsilon(max)) used in LUE models for evergreen needle forests (0.0196 mu mol C mu mol(-1) APAR). Implications for remote sensing of carbon uptake dynamics and the interaction of canopy structure and physiology are discussed.

AB We develop a statistical method to infer the parameters of Hubbell's neutral model of biodiversity using data on local species abundances and their phylogenetic relatedness. This method uses the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach, where the data are summarized into a small number of informative summary statistics. We used three statistics: the number of species in the sample, Shannon H index of evenness and Shao and Sokal's B-1 index of phylogenetic tree imbalance. Our approach was found to outperform previous methods, illustrating the potential of ABC methods in ecology. Applying it to four large tropical forest tree data sets, the best-fit immigration rates m were found to be two orders of magnitude smaller and regional diversities theta larger than previously reported for the same data. This implies that neutral-compatible regional pools of tropical trees should extend over continental scales, and that m measures, in this context, mostly the frequency of long-distance dispersal events.

AB Sedges (Carex: Cyperaceae) exhibit remarkable agmatoploid chromosome series between and within species. This chromosomal diversity is due in large part to the structure of the holocentric chromosomes: fragments that would not be heritable in organisms with monocentric chromosomes have the potential to produce viable gametes in organisms with holocentric chromosomes. The rapid rate of chromosome evolution in the genus and high species diversification rate in the order (Cyperales Hutch., sensu Dahlgren) together suggest that chromosome evolution may play an important role in the evolution of species diversity in Carex. Yet the other genera of the Cyperaceae and their sister group, the Juncaceae, do not show the degree of chromosomal variation found in Carex, despite the fact that diffuse centromeres are a synapomorphy for the entire clade. Moreover, fission and fusion apparently account for the majority of chromosome number changes in Carex, with relatively little duplication of whole chromosomes, whereas polyploidy is relatively important in the other sedge genera. In this paper, we review the cytologic and taxonomic literature on chromosome evolution in Carex and identify unanswered questions and directions for future research. In the end, an integration of biosystematic, cytogenetic, and genomic studies across the Cyperaceae will be needed to address the question of what role chromosome evolution plays in species diversification within Carex and the Cyperaceae as a whole.

AB We investigated variations in the small- to meso-scale abundance and distribution of the 6 most abundant seabird species in the northern California Current-black-footed albatross Phoebastria nigripes, sooty shearwater Puffinus griseus, pink-footed shearwater Puffinus creatopus, fork-tailed storm-petrel Oceanodroma furcata, common murre Uria aalge, and Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus-during the upwelling season of 2000 and 2002. Covariates (21 total), with importance assessed using logistic and generalized linear modeling and an information theoretic approach, included physical features such as sea surface temperature, dynamic height (apparent water-column pressure), and pycnocline depth; biological factors such as chlorophyll maximum; and food-web factors such as the density of 3 size classes of zooplankton, the density of potential piscine competitors, i.e. Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., and abundance of fish prey such as zooplankton, northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, and the juveniles of salmon and demersal fishes. The most important factors explaining seabird occurrence changed from mesoscale physical features during a food-rich year (2002; exhibited over 15 to 30 km) to smaller-scale occurrence of actual prey patches during a food-poor year (2000; <1 km). Spatial overlap in occurrence of murres and shearwaters with adult salmon was interpreted as co-occurrence and, perhaps, competition for prey species; a negative spatial overlap between shearwaters and abundance of forage fish was interpreted as evidence for prey depletion (or predator-induced alteration of availability) by the birds and other co-occurring predators (salmon). Overall, results and other information indicated the value of adding spatially explicit data on predator and prey species abundance and predator-prey behavior to improve food-web modeling.

AB Twenty-five pairs of North American beavers Castor canadensis Kuhl were introduced to Tierra del Fuego Island in 1946. The population has expanded across the archipelago, arriving at the Chilean mainland by the mid-1990s. Densities range principally between 0.5-2.05 colonies/km. They have an impact on between 30-50% of stream length and occupy 2-15% of landscape area with impoundments and meadows. Beaver impacts constitute the largest landscape-level alteration in subantarctic forests since the last ice age.
   The colonization pattern, colony densities and impacted area indicate that habitat in the austral archipelago is optimal for beaver invasion, due to low predator pressure and suitable food resources. Nothofagus pumilio forests are particularly appropriate habitat, but a more recent invasion is occurring in adjacent steppe ecosystems. Nonetheless, Nothofagus reproductive strategies are not well adapted to sustain high beaver population levels.
   Our assessment shows that at the patch-scale in stream and riparian ecosystems, the direction and magnitude of exotic beaver impacts are predictable from expectations derived from North American studies, relating ecosystem engineering with underlying ecological mechanisms such as the relationships of habitat heterogeneity and productivity on species richness and ecosystem function.
   Based on data from the species' native and exotic range, our ability to predict the effects of beavers is based on: (i) understanding the ecological relationships of its engineering effects on habitat, trophic dynamics and disturbance regimes, and (ii) having an adequate comprehension of the landscape context and natural history of the ecosystem being engineered.
   We conclude that beaver eradication strategies and subsequent ecosystem restoration efforts, currently being considered in southern Chile and Argentina, should focus on the ecology of native ecosystems rather than the biology of this invasive species per se. Furthermore, given the nature of the subantarctic landscape, streams will probably respond to restoration efforts more quickly than riparian ecosystems.

AB Although ecologists have recognized the importance of spatial structure within food webs, this aspect of ecosystems remains difficult to characterize quantitatively. Stable-isotope techniques have recently been used to provide evidence of spatial structure within aquatic food webs. Here, I review current literature on spatial patterns of autochthonous and allochthonous resources in aquatic food webs in lakes and rivers. Across various habitats and ecosystems, the factors determining the major resources of aquatic food webs are primarily phytoplanktonic productivity, benthic algal productivity, and amount of subsidization from terrestrial habitats. Autochthonous and allochthonous resource availability in food webs shifts with gradients in water depth, nutrient concentrations, degree of canopy cover, and distance from terrestrial habitats. Size of lake and river ecosystem (i.e., lake volume and stream width) also affects the relative contribution of the resources to the food webs, as this factor determines the system primary productivity and linkage to terrestrial habitats. Human activities have fragmented river and lake ecosystems and have subsequently modified the structure of aquatic food webs. The responses of food webs to anthropogenic effects differ across ecosystems, and stable isotope techniques can help to quantitatively assess the effects of human impacts on aquatic food webs.

AB Speciation and the maintenance of recently diverged species has been subject of intense research in evolutionary biology for decades. Although the concept of ecological speciation has been accepted, its mechanisms and genetic bases are still under investigation. Here, we present a mechanism for speciation that is orchestrated and strengthened by parasite communities acting on polymorphic genes of the immune system. In vertebrates, these genes have a pleiotropic role with regard to parasite resistance and mate choice. In contrasting niches, parasite communities differ and thus the pools of alleles of the adapted major histocompatibility complex (MHC) also differ between niches. Mate choice for the best-adapted MHC genotype will favour local adaptations and will accelerate separation of both populations: thus immune genes act as pleiotropic speciation genes -'magic traits'. This mechanism should operate not only in sympatric populations but also under allopatry or parapatry. Each individual has a small subset of the many MHC alleles present in the population. If all individuals could have all MHC alleles from the pool, MHC-based adaptation is neither necessary nor possible. However, the typically small optimal individual number of MHC loci thus enables MHC-based speciation. Furthermore, we propose a new mechanism selecting against species hybrids. Hybrids are expected to have super-optimal individual MHC diversity and should therefore suffer more from parasites in all habitats.

AB Ecosystems around the world are experiencing unprecedented rates of extinction and species decline. The question of how community disassembly-the ongoing process of nonrandom species losses and declines-affects ecosystem functions, including those that influence persistence of other species, is addressed. The order in which species disappear from a community depends on their vulnerability to specific stressors and on traits associated with inherent susceptibility to decline. Information on species characteristics associated with vulnerability (response traits) is synthesized, and it is asked whether they are associated with characteristics that underpin significant contributions to ecosystem functioning (effect traits). Direct evidence that community disassembly affects ecosystem functioning comes from a variety of sources, ranging from documentation of long-term changes following the loss of an initial species or fragmentation of a landscape, to modeling and manipulative experiments that simulate species losses and observe their consequences. The usefulness to conservation and restoration practice of community disassembly as a concept is evaluated, and it is asked whether and how community disassembly can provide guidance about species loss order, its consequences, what each of these depends on, and whether a positive link exists between vulnerability and contribution to function-a link that would exacerbate the consequences of the ongoing extinction crisis.

AB 1. Tourism and leisure activities have increased continuously all over the world during the past decades, exerting a growing pressure upon naturally fragile ecosystems, such as mountainous habitats. Recent studies have established that disturbance by outdoor winter sports (e.g. skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing) is a source of stress for wildlife. This may in turn affect its abundance, but we still lack quantitative evidence.
   2. We tested the effect of outdoor winter sports (ski lifts and related recreational activities) on the abundance of the alpine black grouse Tetrao tetrix, a vulnerable indicator species of the timberline ecosystem, the favoured habitat for outdoor winter sports in the European Alps.
   3. Generalized linear models and a model selection approach were used to rank environmental factors influencing black grouse abundance and to make predictions about population status in the theoretical absence of ski resorts. We modelled the number of displaying cocks along census transects in spring, as a function of habitat characteristics (vegetation structure and typology), ski lift density and hunting pressure at 15 natural sites (none or a very low level of anthropogenic disturbance) and 15 ski resorts in the south-western Swiss Alps.
   4. Ski lift density and habitat typology were the principal determinants of black grouse abundance, whereas hunting pressure had no discernable effect. Ski lifts and related winter sport activities had a strong negative effect on the number of displaying cocks, which may have led to a mean 36% reduction of local abundance in ski lift areas, as determined after controlling for the confounding effect of habitat type.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Conservation action plans for black grouse should aim at reducing the multiple negative effects generated by outdoor winter sports (ski facilities and related winter sport activities). First, vegetation patchiness (i.e. a mosaic of grassy shrubland with scattered trees) should be maintained along ski runs. Secondly, wintering preserves where human access is banned or strictly limited should be promoted within ski resorts. Spatially explicit human-wildlife conflict maps can be constructed from the present model to allow delineation of those areas likely to become effective protection areas.

AB 1. Competition is considered a key factor structuring many communities, and has been described as the 'hallmark' of ant ecology. Dominant species are thought to play a key role structuring local ant assemblages through competitive exclusion.
   2. However, while there have been many studies demonstrating competitive exclusion and consequently reduced richness at baits, it is not clear whether such regulation of 'momentary' diversity at clumped food resources can scale up to the regulation of richness at the site or assemblage level.
   3. In this study, ant assemblages were sampled in three different savanna habitats in South Africa using both baiting and pitfall trapping.
   4. As has been found in previous studies, there was a unimodal relationship between dominant ants and species richness at baits, with high abundances of dominant ants regulating species richness through competitive exclusion. Analysis of pitfall samples revealed strong convergence in pattern, and results from null model co-occurrence analyses supported the findings.
   5. The importance of competition in structuring local ant assemblages was, however, only apparent at one of the three savanna habitats suggesting that a full range of extreme environments is needed to produce the full unimodal relationship at the assemblage level.
   6. Although the relative importance of competition varied with habitat type, the study demonstrated that in some habitats, dominant ants can control species richness at the assemblage level.

AB The Coral Triangle is the global center of marine biodiversity; however, its coral reefs arc, critically threatened. Because of The bipartite life history of many marine species with sedentary adults and dispersive pelagic larvae, designing effective marine protected areas requires an understanding of patterns of larval dispersal and connectivity among geographically discrete populations. We used mtDNA sequence data to examine patterns of genetic connectivity in the boring giant clam (Tridacna crocea) in an effort to guide conservation efforts within the Coral Triangle. We collected an approximately 485 base pair fragment of mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) from 414 individuals at 26 sites across Indonesia. Genetic structure was strong between regions (phi(ST) = 0.549, p < 0.00001) with 3 strongly supported clades: one restricted to western Sumatra, another distributed across central Indonesia, and a third limited to eastern Indonesia and Papua. Even within the single largest clade, small but significant genetic structure was documented (phi(ST) = 0.069, p < 0.00001), which indicates limited gene flow within and among phylogeographic regions. Significant patterns of isolation by distance indicated an average dispersal distance of only 25-50 km, which is far below dispersal predictions of 406-708 km derived from estimates of passive dispersal over 10 days via surface currents. The strong regional genetic structure we found indicates potent limits to genetic and demographic connectivity for this species throughout the Coral Triangle and provides a regional context for conservation planning. The recovery of 3 distinct evolutionarily significant units within a well-studied taxonomic group suggests that biodiversity in this region may be significantly underestimated and that Tridacna taxa may be more endangered than currently recognized.

AB SAM is a Windows program designed to detect candidate loci for selection in whole-genome scans. It also gives valuable clues as regards the ecological factors at stake in the selection process. The method used is based on multiple univariate logistic regression models to test for association between allelic frequencies at marker loci and environmental variables. The software reads matrices constituted of presence/absence of molecular markers, and of the corresponding environmental parameters at sampling locations. It provides dynamic analysis tables to process the results. The tool is freely available for download at www.econogene.eu/software/sam/.

AB 1. Plant communities in natural ecosystems are changing and species are being lost due to anthropogenic impacts including global warming and increasing nitrogen (N) deposition. We removed dominant species, combinations of species and entire functional types from Alaskan tussock tundra, in the presence and absence of fertilization, to examine the effects of non-random species loss on plant interactions and ecosystem functioning.
   2. After 6 years, growth of remaining species had compensated for biomass loss due to removal in all treatments except the combined removal of moss, Betula nana and Ledum palustre (MBL), which removed the most biomass. Total vascular plant production returned to control levels in all removal treatments, including MBL. Inorganic soil nutrient availability, as indexed by resins, returned to control levels in all unfertilized removal treatments, except MBL.
   3. Although biomass compensation occurred, the species that provided most of the compensating biomass in any given treatment were not from the same functional type (growth form) as the removed species. This provides empirical evidence that functional types based on effect traits are not the same as functional types based on response to perturbation. Calculations based on redistributing N from the removed species to the remaining species suggested that dominant species from other functional types contributed most of the compensatory biomass.
   4. Fertilization did not increase total plant community biomass, because increases in graminoid and deciduous shrub biomass were offset by decreases in evergreen shrub, moss and lichen biomass. Fertilization greatly increased inorganic soil nutrient availability.
   5. In fertilized removal treatments, deciduous shrubs and graminoids grew more than expected based on their performance in the fertilized intact community, while evergreen shrubs, mosses and lichens all grew less than expected. Deciduous shrubs performed better than graminoids when B. nana was present, but not when it had been removed.
   6. Synthesis. Terrestrial ecosystem response to warmer temperatures and greater nutrient availability in the Arctic may result in vegetative stable-states dominated by either deciduous shrubs or graminoids. The current relative abundance of these dominant growth forms may serve as a predictor for future vegetation composition.

AB An important problem in principal component analysis (PCA) is the estimation of the correct number of components to retain. PCA is most often used to reduce a set of observed variables to a new set of variables of lower dimensionality. The choice of this dimensionality is a crucial step for the interpretation of results or subsequent analyses, because it could lead to a loss of information (underestimation) or the introduction of random noise (overestimation). New techniques are proposed to evaluate the dimensionality in PCA. They are based on similarity measurements, singular value decomposition and permutation procedures. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the relative merits of the proposed approaches. Results showed that one method based on the RV coefficient is very accurate and seems to be more efficient than other existing approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Trade-offs between competitive ability and tolerance of abiotic stress are widespread in the literature. Thus, condition-specific competition may explain spatial variability in the success of some biological invaders and why, in environments where there is small-scale environmental variability, competitively inferior and superior species can coexist.
   2. We tested the hypothesis that differences in abiotic stress alter the outcome of competitive interactions between the native Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata and exotic Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas by experimentally testing patterns of intra- and interspecific competition across a tidal elevation gradient of abiotic stress at three sites on the east coast of Australia.
   3. At low and mid-intertidal heights, exotic C. gigas were able to rapidly overgrow and smother native S. glomerata, which grew at c. 60% of the exotic's rate. In high intertidal areas, where C. gigas displayed about 80% mortality but similar growth rates to S. glomerata, the native oyster was not affected by the presence of the exotic species.
   4. Asymmetrical effects of the exotic species on the native could not be replicated by manipulating densities of conspecifics, confirming that effects at low and mid-intertidal heights were due to interspecific competition.
   5. Our results suggest that the more rapid growth of C. gigas than S. glomerata comes at the cost of higher mortality under conditions of abiotic stress. Thus, although C. gigas may rapidly overgrow S. glomerata at low and mid tidal heights, the native oyster will not be competitively excluded by the exotic due to release from competition at high intertidal elevations.
   6. The success of trade-offs in explaining spatial variation in the outcome of competitive interactions between C. gigas and S. glomerata strengthen the claim that these may be a useful tool in the quest to produce general predictive models of invasion success.

AB It is recognized that human activities, such as fossil fuel burning, land-use change, and forest harvesting at a large scale, have resulted in the-increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the onset of the industrial revolution. The increasing amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 in the atmosphere, is believed to have induced climate change and global warming. With the ability to remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, forests play a critical role in the carbon cycle and carbon sequestration at both global and local scales. It is necessary to understand the relationship between forest soil carbon dynamics and carbon sequestration capacity, and the impact of forest management practices on soil CO2 efflux for sustainable carbon management in forest ecosystems. This paper reviews a number of current issues related to (1) carbon allocation, (2) soil respiration, and (3) carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystems through forest management strategies. The contribution made by forests and forest management in sequestrating carbon to reduce the CO2 concentration level in the atmosphere is now well recognized. The overall carbon cycle, carbon allocation of the above- and belowground compartments of the forests, soil carbon storage and soil respiration in forest ecosystems and impacts of forest management practices on soil respiration are described. The potential influences of forest soils on the buildup of atmospheric carbon are reviewed.

AB In vertebrates, the well established increase in plasma corticosterone in response to food shortage is thought to mediate adjustments of foraging behavior and energy allocation to environmental conditions. However, investigating the functional role of corticosterone is often constrained by the difficulty to track time-activity budget of free-ranging animals. To examine how an experimental increase in corticosterone affects the activity budget of male Black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), we used miniaturized activity loggers to record flying/foraging, presence on the sea surface and nest attendance. To investigate how corticosterone affects allocation processes between self-foraging and foraging devoted to the brood, we monitored body mass change of males from capture (day 0) to recapture (day 3). Among control birds, males in poor condition at day 0 spent significantly more time flying/foraging and less time attending the nest site than did males in good condition. Corticosterone treatment affected time spent flying/foraging in interaction with body condition at day 0: corticosterone-implanted males in good condition spent more time flying foraging than control ones; this was not observed in poor condition males. In control birds, change in body mass was negatively correlated with body condition at day 0. This was reinforced by corticosterone treatment and, on average, corticosterone-implanted males gained much more mass than controls. These results suggest that in Black-legged kittiwakes, body condition and corticosterone levels can interact to mediate foraging decisions and possibly energy allocation: when facing stressful environmental conditions, birds in good body condition may afford to increase the time spent foraging probably to maintain brood provisioning, whereas poor body condition birds seemed rather to redirect available energy from reproduction to self-maintenance.

AB consider an imperfection of real closed-path eddy correlation systems-the decoupling of the water vapour and CO2 concentrations-with respect to the application of the Webb-Pearman-Leuning (WPL) theory. It is described why and how the current application of the WPL theory needs to be adapted to the processes in closed-path sensors. We show the quantitative effects of applying the WPL theory in different ways using CO2 flux measurements taken above the Danish Beech forest CarboEurope site near Soro, Zealand.
   Using the WPL theory in closed-path sensors without taking amplitude damping and decoupling into account, over-corrected the annual flux by 21%, or 31 g m(-2) yr(-1), to which the decoupling effect contributed with 7%. We suggest either converting the raw data point-by-point to mixing ratios or using the uncorrected covariances of water vapour mole fractions with the vertical wind velocity that were calculated with the same time lag as for the scalar concentration when correcting the dilution effect. We showed that the two approaches yielded equivalent flux results. Correct ways of applying spectral corrections to CO2 fluxes calculated in either way are also shown. The findings reported here do not apply to open-path sensors.

AB As whole-genome sequence assemblies accumulate, a challenge is to determine how these can be used to address fundamental evolutionary questions, such as inferring the process of speciation. Here, we use the sequence assemblies of Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis to test hypotheses regarding divergence with gene flow. We observe low differentiation between the two genome sequences in pericen-tromeric and peritelomeric regions. We interpret this result as primarily a remnant of the correlation between levels of variation and local recombination rate observed within populations. However, we also observe lower differentiation far from the fixed chromosomal inversions distinguishing these species and greater differentiation within and near these inversions. This finding is consistent with models suggesting that chromosomal inversions facilitate species divergence despite interspecies gene flow. We also document heterogeneity among the inverted regions in their degree of differentiation, suggesting temporal differences in the origin of each inverted region consistent with the inversions arising during a process of divergence with gene flow. While this study provides insights into the speciation process using two single-genome sequences, it was informed by lower throughput but more rigorous examinations of polymorphism and divergence. This reliance highlights the need for complementary genomic and population genetic approaches for tackling fundamental evolutionary questions such as speciation.

AB Despite the influence that amphibians have on the flow of energy and nutrients in ecological systems, the role that amphibians play in transporting contaminants through food webs has received very little attention. This study was undertaken to investigate bioaccumulation of trace elements in amphibians relative to other small aquatic organisms in a contaminated wetland. We collected bullfrog larvae (Rana catesbeiana) along with three other species of small vertebrates and four species of invertebrates from a site contaminated with a wide array of trace elements and analyzed them for trace element concentrations and stable nitrogen and carbon isotope composition. We found that amphibian larvae accumulated the highest concentrations of most trace elements, possibly due to their feeding ecology. These results suggest that omnivorous amphibian larvae can serve as a critical link for trace element trophic transfer. Their propensity to accumulate trace elements may have important implications for amphibian health in contaminated environments and should be further investigated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The analysis of socio-ecological systems requires new, qualitatively distinct, evaluation schemes and appropriate investigation tools that enable an integrated assessment of ecological, social, and economic factors since human land use is a major force driving landscape change, landscape dynamics can be better understood in the context of complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Tourist resorts are deemed as socio-ecological systems, and tourism is a tool for development but could affect the quality of ecosystem goods and services since it could degrade natural renewable and non-renewable resources. In this paper we develop a minimal descriptive model of socio-ecological systems based on tourism, starting from the work of Casagrandi and Rinaldi [Casagrandi, R., Rinaldi, S., 2002. A theoretical approach to tourism sustainability. Conserv. Ecol. 6 (1), 13 (Online). URL: http://www.consecol.org/vol6/iss1/art33], and based on data from a real tourist destination in southern Italy. We develop the model focusing on the interplay among tourists (T), quality of ecosystem goods and services (E), and capital (C), intended as accommodation and entertainment facilities, to make the model more realistic, and to provide a tool for scenario building to support more effectively sustainable management of tourist destination. In particular, we focus on the interplay between tourism and ecosystem quality, distinguishing two main tourist typologies - mass and eco-tourists - and taking into account ecosystem quality in terms of ecosystem goods and services, with a time dependent function, and defining a degradation coefficient of tourist site to be used as a bifurcation parameter. We explore different scenarios, with regards to coexistence of tourist classes and equilibria stability, as generated by variation of the bifurcation parameter. Finally, we discuss the overall results in terms of basins of attraction and stability landscape, and system resilience together with their implications for sustainable tourist destination management.

AB Species diversity gradients seen today are, to a large degree, a product of history. Spatially nonrandom originations, extinctions, and changes in geographic distributions can create gradients in species and higher- taxon richness, but the relative roles of each of these processes remain poorly documented. Existing explanations of diversity gradients have tended to focus on either macroevolutionary or biogeographic processes; integrative models that include both are largely lacking. We used simple models that incorporate origination and extinction rates along with dispersal of taxa between regions to show that dispersal not only affects regional richness patterns but also has a strong influence on the average age of taxa present in a region. Failure to take into account the effects of dispersal can, in principle, lead to biased estimates of diversification rates and potentially wrong conclusions regarding processes driving latitudinal and other gradients in diversity. Thus, it is critical to include the effects of dispersal when formulating and testing hypotheses about the causes of large-scale gradients in diversity. Finally, the model results, in conjunction with the results of existing empirical studies, suggest that the nature of macroevolutionary and biogeographic processes may differ between terrestrial and marine diversity gradients.

AB 1. Many current biodiversity theories assume that resource competition determines niche segregation and thus coexistence within communities (i.e. at the alpha-scale). However, the action of disturbance, creating heterogeneous environments and suppressing potential dominants, may also be important for biodiversity maintenance.
   2. Hypothesis: subordinate species exhibit primarily opportunistic (ruderal) survival strategies, with increasing disturbance intensity constraining dominant species - favouring opportunistic strategies and thus functional and species diversity.
   3. The diversity, character and frequency of strategies in an alpine sedge-dominated vascular plant community were quantified in situ using CSR (competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal) classification, and compared with a pasture in the same alpine vegetation belt (i.e. with additional disturbance). Adaptive trends were confirmed by independent multivariate analysis [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)].
   4. The extremely stress-tolerant sedge Carex curvula (C : S : R = 17.2 : 72.9 : 9.9%) dominated the relatively undisturbed community (frequency = 52%), with 32 subordinates (typically < 5%) exhibiting a functional spectrum encompassing stress tolerance to ruderalism, but not competitive strategies. With grazing, the community exhibited weaker co-dominance by five species, greater biodiversity (76 species) and greater functional diversity, characterized by larger numbers of ruderals and some competitive-ruderals. The principal variation in both DCA1 and NMDS1 for both communities directly reflected CSR strategy spectra, confirmed by Spearman's correlation.
   5. Dominance by stress-tolerators and restricted functional diversity demonstrates habitat-level (beta-scale) functional convergence in response to stress. A spectrum of S to R strategies demonstrates alpha-scale functional divergence in response to differential stress and disturbance. Grazing suppresses potentially dominant species and favours diversity, with the additional presence of competitive-ruderals suggestive of a more intricate niche topology including more relaxed abiotic opportunities.
   6. Natural communities are not necessarily structured according to the rules of resource competition models, as these fail to account for disturbance and facilitation processes.

AB Community-managed, no-take marine reserves are increasingly promoted as a simple, precautionary measure to conserve biodiversity and sustain coral reef fisheries. However, we need to demonstrate the effects of such reserves to those affected by the loss of potential fishing grounds and the wider scientific community. We surveyed changes in fish communities in five small marine reserves in the central Philippines and three distant Control sites over seven years. We conducted underwater visual censuses of 53 fish families within the reserve (inside), with a kilometre of the boundary (Outside) and at Control sites. We found significant differences between fish communities inside and Outside the reserve only at the two sites with strictest compliance with fishing prohibition, while there were significant differences to distant Control sites in all cases. The strongest responses to reserve protection were found in predatory fishes (groupers and breams) and in butterflyfish. Other abundant fish families showed weak effects of protection. For all taxa analysed, we found significant effects of reserve Site and Site x Treatment interactions. The detection of fish responses to reserves is complicated by potential spillover effects, site-specific factors, particularly compliance, and the difficulty of identifying appropriate control areas.

AB The connection between forests and water resources is well established, but the relationships among controlling factors are only partly understood. Concern over the effects of forestry operations, particularly harvesting, on extreme flooding events is a recurrent issue in forest and watershed management. Due to the complexity of the system, and the cost of installing large-scale hydrologic studies, data are usually limited. Therefore, hydrologic models are employed to evaluate specific land use issues during extreme conditions. Our objectives were to review literature regarding: (1) relevant forest hydrology concepts, (2) the effects of silviculture and forest operations on peak discharges and flood yields, and (3) the suitability of existing modeling approaches for assessing these effects on extreme peak discharges. Numerous studies have shown that the effects of forest operations on streamflow vary, and that the influence of vegetation, soils, and land use on streamflow generation diminishes as larger volumes of water are introduced to the system. The most significant impact forest operations might have on extreme flows is by routing via poorly located and designed road networks. Extreme events appear to have different hydrologic controls than lower-flow events, and that sharp thresholds may exist between these paradigms. There are a large number of hydrologic models currently available that have been developed for a wide variety of applications. Issues such as uncertainty, overparameterization, extrapolation of flood data, and logistic issues limit the use of hydrologic models for evaluating the specific controls and outcome of land-use change on extreme peak discharges.

AB In this study, we investigated whether bird feathers can be used as a non-destructive biomonitor for organic pollutants. We analysed the outermost tail feathers of 8 terrestrial and aquatic bird species from Belgium (8 species, n = 108) for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Every compound class could be quantified in one single tail feather of the birds under study (sum PCBs ranging from 5.5 to 5 10 ng/g feather, sum PBDEs from 0.33 to 53 ng/g feather, sum DDTs from 1.5 to 730 ng/g feather), except for PBDEs in feathers of the common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus). Further, we calculated Pearson correlations between concentrations of organic pollutants in feathers and concentrations in corresponding muscle or liver tissue from the birds. Correlations were found significant in half of the cases of the terrestrial species, but were found not significant for the aquatic species, with the exception of a significant correlation of sum PCBs in the common moorhen. Only for the common buzzard (Buteo buteo) (n=43) all correlations were found significant (0.32 < r < 0.77). In order to cope for low statistical power, we performed a meta-analysis on all bird species together. This led to significant correlations between levels in feathers and corresponding levels in muscle or liver for all terrestrial birds (p < 0.05 in all cases, effect size 0.59 (p,p'-DDE) to 0.71 (Sigma PCB) for levels in feather and muscle). When correlations were recalculated excluding the birds that had died due to starvation, correlation coefficients for the terrestrial birds were found even higher (effect size up to 0.83 (Sigma PCB)). These results have important implications for non-destructive and retrospective biomonitoring. Although our results suggest that exact concentrations in the body cannot be predicted using feathers, bird feathers can give a good estimate of contamination levels in a population and as such are a potential non-destructive biomonitoring tool for organic pollutants.
   Outermost tail feathers and muscle tissue were also examined for nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope content in the different bird species. However, delta N-15/delta C-13 signatures in feather or muscle were not significantly correlated with the corresponding levels of organic pollutants in these tissues. Various confounding factors (such as habitat, condition, age, sex) may have masked a relationship between delta N-15 values and organic pollutant levels in the birds under study.

AB An 835 base pair (bp) fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was sequenced to characterize genetic variation within and among 1,053 samples comprising five regional populations each of longtail macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and one sample each of Japanese (M. fuscata) and Taiwanese (M. cyclopis) macaques. The mtDNA haplotypes of longtail macaques clustered in two large highly structured clades (Fas1 and Fas2) of a neighbor-joining tree that were reciprocally monophyletic with respect to those representing rhesus macaques, Japanese macaques, and Taiwanese macaques. Both clades exhibited haplotypes of Indonesian and Malaysian longtail macaques widely dispersed throughout them; however, longtail macaques from Indochina, Philippines, and Mauritius each clustered in a separate well-defined clade together with one or a few Malaysian and/or Indonesian longtail macaques, suggesting origins on the Sunda shelf. Longtail macaques from Malaysia and Indonesia were far more genetically diverse, and those from Mauritius were far less diverse than any other population studied. Nucleotide diversity between mtDNA sequences of longtail macaques from different geographic regions is, in some cases, greater than that between Indian and Chinese rhesus macaques. Approximately equal amounts of genetic diversity are due to differences among animals in the same regional population, different regional populations, and different species. A greater proportion of genetic variance was explained by interspecies differences when Japanese and Taiwanese macaques were regarded as regional populations of rhesus macaques than when they were treated as separate species. Rhesus macaques from China were more closely related to both Taiwanese and Japanese macaques than to their own conspecifics from India.

AB Investigations utilizing a one-dimensional sediment routing model demonstrate that moderate inputs of water and sediment at tributary junctions greatly increase physical heterogeneity in the recipient channel. Simulated physical heterogeneity is most sensitive to the ratios of tributary to mainstream bed load flux and bed load grain size and is less sensitive to relative discharge. Within the model, aggradation drives the processes that augment habitat variability, and in general, any aggradational confluence will be associated with elevated physical diversity. Model output reveals elevated physical diversity at two scales: between distinctive upstream and downstream zones separated by a confluence step and within each zone as a function of local environmental gradients. Total diversity increases as tributary sediment load and caliber increase relative to the mainstream. The ecological implications of the patterns and magnitude of tributary-induced physical heterogeneity are considered, and testable hypotheses are presented. Results highlight the need to accurately characterise patterns of sediment production, delivery, and routing in order to predict local tributary impacts and thereby understand patterns of habitat diversity and biodiversity at network scales.

AB Using new tools (boosted regression trees) in predictive biogeography, with extensive spatial 23 distribution data for > 19 000 species, we developed predictive models for South African plant species richness patterns. Further, biome level analysis explored possible functional determinants of country-wide regional species richness. Finally, to test model reliability independently, we predicted potential alien invasive plant species richness with an independent dataset. Amongst the different hypotheses generally invoked to explain species 30 diversity (energy, favorableness, topographic heterogeneity, irregularity and seasonality), results revealed topographic heterogeneity as the most powerful single explanatory variable for indigenous South African plant species richness. Some biome-specific responses were observed, i.e. two of the five analyzed biomes (Fynbos and Grassland) had richness best explained by the "species-favorableness" hypothesis, but even in this case, topographic heterogeneity was also a primary predictor. This analysis, the largest conducted on an almost exhaustive species sample in a species-rich region, demonstrates the preeminence of topographic heterogeneity in shaping the spatial pattern of regional plant species richness. Model reliability was confirmed by the considerable predictive power for alien invasive species richness. It thus appears that topographic heterogeneity controls species richness in two main ways: firstly, by providing an abundance of ecological niches in contemporary space (revealed by alien invasive species richness relationships) and secondly, by facilitating the persistence of ecological niches through time. The extraordinary richness of the South African Fynbos biome, a world-renowned hotspot of biodiversity with the steepest environmental gradients in South Africa, may thus have arisen through both mechanisms. Comparisons with similar regions of the world outside South Africa are needed to confirm the generality of topographic heterogeneity and favorableness as predictors of plant richness.

AB Many life-history characteristics of large mammals are scale sensitive. We provide examples where varying temporal and spatial scales can affect interpretation of data concerning life-history characteristics in large herbivores and carnivores and offer recommendations for selecting the most appropriate sampling scale or scales. We also document that some animals make decisions concerning their spatial distribution at scales well beyond the size of the home range. Conversely, other decisions involving sexual segregation of sexes, or where to give birth, may be made at scales below the level of the habitat patch. Such differences in behaviour affect our understanding of habitat selection in large herbivores, and interpreting tradeoffs between acquiring essential resources and avoiding predators. Moreover, some landscape attributes may be selected at one scale, whereas other characteristics of the environment may be selected at another. We argue that even sophisticated models for explaining the ecology and behaviour of mammals benefit from framing specific hypotheses that are related to the to the life-history characteristics of those animals. We also believe that the failure to consider and select the most appropriate scale, or suite of scales, may lead to the mismanagement of critical natural resources. We forge relationships among scale, life-history characteristics of mammals, and biodiversity. Finally, we synthesize the literature on scale for large mammals and make recommendations for future research.

AB Eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange were made above a temperate mixed forest for 16 months in northeastern China. The stand is a natural grown, unmanaged mixture of deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forest and the trees cover a wide range of age classes with a maximum about 450 years. The objective of this study was to test the traditional hypothesis that forests at a late stage of development are insignificant carbon sinks. CO2 exchanges of the ecosystem were studied under conditions of adequate soil water supply. The main results are that:
   (1) Ecosystem respiration and its components, including soil, stem and leaf respiration, all fit exponential correlations with soil or air temperature, but the ratios of these components to total ecosystem respiration varied during the year. When temperature rose, the ratio of soil respiration to total respiration was relatively stable, while that of leaf and stem respiration increased and decreased, respectively. Soil respiration was the biggest component (48% of the whole ecosystem respiration on average, without including the respiration of fallen trees and coarse woody debris). Leaf respiration was the second largest (22-40%) and stem respiration was the least (13-29%).
   (2) The ecosystem has very large assimilation potential as environmental factors are adequate in growing season, but the actual gross ecosystem exchange (G(ee)) was only about 45% of the potential due to the influence of water vapor pressure deficit (VPD). High VPD reduced the photosynthetic capacity and the highest relative reductions occurred in afternoon when VPD was higher, with relative reductions between 0.3 and 0.6 during this time. Bigger reduction occurred in May and July, corresponding the 2 months when VPD are higher.
   (3) Respiration (R-e) and net ecosystem exchange (N-ee) were about 74% and 26% of actual G, during growing season. Net assimilation began in the middle of April and ended in early September. The largest uptake occurred in June, then July and August. Large net CO2 losses occurred in late September and October because of relatively high temperature and leaf fall from most trees in the forest.
   (4) This forest was a carbon sink of 169-187 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over a 12-month-period commencing August 2002. Application of the u* correction decreased the annual uptake of carbon by 24.6 g C m(-2) on average, corresponding to 13.5% of the corrected annual N-ee.
   There are many uncertainties for determination of absolute values of long-term net carbon exchange even in sites with ideal topography using Eddy-covariance. More detailed experiments and related theoretical studies are needed in the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Marine reserves have been identified as an important tool in the management of fishery resources and their number is increasing rapidly, most of them being on islands. However, knowledge on the real effect of protection from fishing on the genetic structure of populations, the spatial scales involved, or the suitability of islands as reserves in terms of connectivity, is scarce. This paper analyses the effects of fishery protection on the genetic structure of populations of Diplodus sargus, a target species, in protected and non-protected areas of the western Mediterranean. Populations studied showed high genetic variability at spatial scales from 10(1) to 10(3) km. Protected areas have significantly higher allelic richness. The lower levels of heterozygosis and higher heterozygote deficit showed by islands compared with coastal areas makes clear the importance of considering the connectivity processes when designing a MPA.

AB The fitness of an evolutionary individual can be understood in terms of its two basic components: survival and reproduction. As embodied in current theory, trade-offs between these fitness components drive the evolution of life-history traits in extant multicellular organisms. Here, we argue that the evolution of germ-soma specialization and the emergence of individuality at a new higher level during the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms are also consequences of trade-offs between the two components of fitness-survival and reproduction. The models presented here explore fitness trade-offs at both the cell and group levels during the unicellular-multicellular transition. When the two components of fitness negatively covary at the lower level there is an enhanced fitness at the group level equal to the covariance of components at the lower level. We show that the group fitness trade-offs are initially determined by the cell level trade-offs. However, as the transition proceeds to multicellularity, the group level trade-offs depart from the cell level ones, because certain fitness advantages of cell specialization may be realized only by the group. The curvature of the trade-off between fitness components is a basic issue in life-history theory and we predict that this Curvature is concave in single-celled organisms but becomes increasingly convex as group size increases in multicellular organisms. We argue that the increasingly convex curvature of the trade-off function is driven by the initial cost of reproduction to Survival which increases as group size increases. To illustrate the principles and conclusions of the model, we consider aspects of the biology of the volvocine green algae, which contain both unicellular and multicellular members.

AB Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) during August 2003 was measured by using eddy covariance above 17 forest and 3 peatland sites along an east-west continental-scale transect in Canada. Measured sites included recently disturbed stands, young forest stands, intermediate-aged conifer stands, mature deciduous stands, mature conifer stands, fens, and an open shrub bog. Diurnal courses of NEP showed strong coherence within the different ecosystem categories. Recently disturbed sites showed the weakest diurnal cycle; and intermediate-aged conifers, the strongest. The western treed fen had a more pronounced diurnal pattern than the eastern shrub bog or the Saskatchewan patterned fen. All but three sites were clearly afternoon C sinks. Ecosystem respiration was highest for the young fire sites. The intermediate-aged conifer sites had the highest maximum NEP (NEPmax) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP(max)), attaining rates that would be consistent with the presence of a strong terrestrial C sink in regions where these types of forest are common. These results support the idea that large-scale C cycle modeling activities would benefit from information on the age-class distribution and disturbance types within larger grid cells. Light use efficiency followed a pattern similar to that of NEPmax and GEP(max). Four of the five recently disturbed sites and all three of the peatland sites had low water use efficiencies.

AB Because forest width is thought to be the most relevant metric to ecological communities, it has persisted as the dominant paradigm and focus of management recommendations for riparian forest conservation. Consequently, managers may overlook important effects of the surrounding landscape matrix. We determined if characteristics of the landscape matrix, particularly the amount of urban development surrounding a forest, were better predictors of bird communities than forest width. We sampled breeding-bird communities 3 times each June 2001-2004 in 33 riparian forest sites (69-565 m wide) in Ohio, USA. We examined if bird community structure and composition were more closely associated with forest width or the amount of urban development within 1 km of each forest using canonical correlation analysis. Results indicate that the landscape matrix surrounding these relatively large forest tracts explained > 94% of the variation in bird communities compared to < 6% explained by forest width. Numbers of Neotropical migrants were negatively associated with urbanization in the landscapes (r = -0.43), whereas residents (r = 0.57) and short-distance migrants (r = 0.41) were positively associated with urbanization. Similar patterns persisted at the individual species level, particularly for Neotropical migrants as 76% of species in this guild were negatively related to urban development. our findings suggest that the traditional approach to conserving riparian forests is not sufficient and that explicit consideration of the surrounding landscape matrix also should be a key component in conservation efforts.

AB Root proliferation into the Oa and Oe soil horizons in tropical forests is often substantial and allows direct cycling of nutrients from the organic matter; this was thought to be an adaptation to the low nutrient supply in infertile soils. In this study, we show that experimentally increased litter inputs promote root proliferation into the Oi and Oe horizons in a relatively fertile soil, suggesting that it is a response to a more readily available nutrient source rather than an adaptation to nutrient shortage, and the absence of root mats on fertile tropical soils is simply a consequence of the lack of persistent organic horizons due to high decomposition rates.

AB Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient, exhibiting a narrow margin between nutritionally optimal and potentially toxic concentrations. Egg-laying vertebrates at the top of aquatic food chains are most at risk in environments with elevated aqueous Se concentrations. The Elk River watershed in British Columbia, Canada receives effluents containing Se from five coal mine operations. This study tested three hypotheses that might account for higher Se concentrations in fish from lentic compared to lotic habitats in the watershed: (1) enhanced uptake by aquatic primary producers, (2) longer food chain length, or (3) greater food web accumulation through sediment-detrital pathways. Stable isotope and Se concentration data demonstrated that Se concentrations in aquatic primary producers and food chain lengths were comparable in lentic and lotic habitats. Enhanced formation of organoselenium and subsequent uptake and cycling via sediment detrital pathways likely account for higher fish tissue Se concentrations in lentic than in lotic areas.

AB We examined 142 papers, which contained 603 separate predator-prey trials, to investigate whether unpalatability is an important defense against predation for amphibian eggs and larvae. Although unpalatability is often cited as an antipredator defense, it was rarely demonstrated that 89% of the trials that we reviewed found prey to be palatable. The most extensively studied taxa, the genera Bufo and Rana, were diagnosed unpalatable at rates comparable to all other taxa. Diagnoses of unpalatability were not always consistent for a prey species across different predators and were influenced by experimental method. Despite these limitations and our conservative definition of unpalatability, several patterns emerged. First, across all taxonomic groups, eggs and hatchlings were unpalatable more often than mobile larval stages. Second, species that breed in temporary ponds were more likely to be palatable to fish predators than those that breed in permanent habitats. Third, fish and caudates were more likely to find amphibian prey unpalatable than insect predators. We conclude that unpalatability is rare, but when it occurs, it is a property of an ensemble (predator, prey, and alternative prey) and a life-history stage in a particular circumstance but is not a species-specific attribute. We suggest methods of experimentation that could strengthen future research on the palatability of amphibian eggs and larvae.

AB Intraspecific phylogeography has been used widely as a tool to infer population history. However, little attention has been paid to Southeast Asia despite its importance in terms of biodiversity. Here we used the cytochrome oxidase I gene of mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) for a phylogeographic study of 147 individuals of the black fly Simulium tani from Thailand. The mtDNA revealed high genetic differentiation between the major geographical regions of north, east and central/south Thailand. Mismatch distributions indicate population expansions during the mid-Pleistocene and the late Pleistocene suggesting that current population structure and diversity may be due in part to the species' response to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. The genealogical structure of the haplotypes, high northern diversity and maximum-likelihood inference of historical migration rates, suggest that the eastern and central/southern populations originated from northern populations in the mid-Pleistocene. Subsequently, the eastern region had had a largely independent history but the central/southern population may be largely the result of recent ( c. 100 000 years ago) expansion, either from the north again, or from a relictual population in the central region. Cytological investigation revealed that populations from the south and east have two overlapping fixed chromosomal inversions. Since these populations also share ecological characteristics it suggests that inversions are involved in ecological adaptation. In conclusion both contemporary and historical ecological conditions are playing an important role in determining population genetic structure and diversity.

AB Geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) technologies offer new opportunities for rapid assessment of endemic areas, provision of reliable estimates of populations at risk, prediction of disease distributions in areas that lack baseline data and are difficult to access, and guidance of intervention strategies, so that scarce resources can be allocated in a cost-effective manner. Here, we focus on the epidemiology and control of schistosomiasis in China and review GIS and RS applications to date. These include mapping prevalence and intensity data of Schistosoma japonicum at a large scale, and identifying and predicting suitable habitats for Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host snail of S. japonicum, at a small scale. Other prominent applications have been the prediction of infection risk due to ecological transformations, particularly those induced by floods and water resource developments, and the potential impact of climate change. We also discuss the limitations of the previous work, and outline potential new applications of GIS and RS techniques, namely quantitative GIS, WebGIS, and utilization of emerging satellite information, as they hold promise to further enhance infection risk mapping and disease prediction. Finally, we stress current research needs to overcome some of the remaining challenges of GIS and RS applications for schistosomiasis, so that further and sustained progress can be made to control this disease in China and elsewhere.

AB Aim To determine the main factors that control the distribution of palm species richness across the Americas, to understand the relative importance of climatic and other environmental factors vs. spatial variables (as substitutes for non-environmental factors such as history), and to evaluate how robust the patterns found are to changes in spatial scale.
   Location Tropical and subtropical America (34 degrees N-34 degrees S; 33 degrees W-120 degrees W).
   Methods We provide a GIS-based analysis of spatial variation in species richness at 10 grain sizes (1 degrees-10 degrees square grid cells). We use multiple regressions and variation partitioning to test patterns of species richness in relation to five environmental descriptors [mean annual temperature (degrees C), mean annual precipitation (mm year(-1)), number of wet days year(-1), topographical range (maximum-minimum elevation), number of vegetation types] and nine spatial variables (the terms of a cubic trend-surface polynomial).
   Results We observe peaks in palm species richness in southern Mesoamerica, the Choco area, western and eastern Amazon basin, and east Andean slopes, and a strong latitudinal richness gradient even within the tropical zone. Pure environmental and pure spatial variation components are of equal magnitude through all spatial scales analysed. Water-related variables such as annual rainfall and number of wet days are the main richness predictors. Spatial variables, notably latitude squared are also important, whereas temperature- and habitat-related variables are relatively unimportant.
   Main conclusions Our analysis suggests that in the Americas, palm species richness at spatial scales from 1 degrees to 10 degrees is most strongly controlled by water availability, although unknown broad-scale factors, perhaps soil, historical processes or geometric constraints, are also important.

AB 1. Additive partitioning of three measures of diversity (species richness, Shannon's diversity index H and Simpson's diversity D) was used to study the relationship between local and regional diversity of benthic macroinvertebrate communities of boreal lakes (littoral habitats) and streams (riffle habitats) across three spatial scales (sampling sites, ecoregions and biogeographic regions).
   2. Alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) diversity are defined as within-habitat and between-habitat diversity, respectively. According to the concept of additive partitioning, diversity can be partitioned across multiple spatial scales such that the total (gamma) diversity on one spatial scale becomes within-habitat (alpha) diversity at the next higher scale. Hence, the total diversity at one scale is determined by the alpha diversity and the between-habitat diversity (beta) at the next lower scale. Consequently, one of the advantages of additive partitioning is that it is possible to study simultaneously beta diversity and the regional-local species relationship and the scale dependence of alpha and beta components.
   3. For both lakes and streams alpha diversity was low for sites and ecoregions, whereas beta diversity was high, indicating that among-site factors are important in describing the variability among the lakes and streams studied here.
   4. Weak, albeit significant, evidence was found for regional and local species saturation patterns. Multiple stepwise regression indicated that local processes might be more important in structuring lake-littoral and stream-riffle species assemblages than regional processes. From these results we conclude that environmental heterogeneity may act as an important factor contributing to species coexistence, resulting in the observed saturation patterns.
   5. Our study supports the use of additive partitioning for identifying specific patterns of macroinvertebrate diversity on multiple spatial scales and the underlying processes generating these patterns. This information is needed to improve understanding of the relation between patterns and processes affecting (decreasing) trends in aquatic biodiversity.

ID WOODLAND CARIBOU; WOLVES; POPULATIONS; MODEL; RISK
AB 1. Few studies have related metrics of fitness to broad-scale, multivariate patterns of resource selection.
   2. Our objective was to relate long-term predation-mortality patterns for adult woodland caribou [Rangifer tarandus caribou (Banfield)] from Alberta, Canada (1991-2002), with patterns of multivariate habitat selection.
   3. We first compared probabilities of radio-tracked caribou dying (n = 55) from predation in habitats within the home range, controlling for habitat availability, with that expected from habitat selection probabilities for the same animals during life. We then compared survival rates of caribou (n = 141) possessing dissimilar patterns of habitat selection using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.
   4. Patterns in habitat-specific predation mortality differed significantly from expected given probabilities of habitat selection during life (P < 0.0001). Cox regression indicated that mortality rates of caribou due to predation were affected significantly by and can be predicted from patterns of selection (P = 0.02).
   5. Our results strongly suggest that uplands (primarily mixed deciduous and coniferous forest) present caribou with higher than expected levels of predation risk, and that caribou can avoid predation by maximizing selection of peatlands (open, conifer-dominated bogs and fens).
   6. Approaches presented in this study may be useful for ecologists interested in assessing the influence of mortality factors on broad-scale, multivariate resource selection. Linking metrics of fitness to multivariate resource selection will enable us to ask questions of evolutionary ecology once restricted to only the finest ecological scales.

AB Experimental data on the relationship between plant patch size and population density of herbivores within fields often deviates from predictions of the theory of island biogeography and the resource concentration hypothesis. Here we argue that basic features of foraging behaviour can explain different responses of specialist herbivores to habitat heterogeneity. In a combination of field and simulation studies, we applied basic knowledge on the foraging strategies of three specialist herbivores: the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), the cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae L.) and the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.), to explain differences in their responses to small scale fragmentation of their habitat. In our field study, populations of the three species responded to different sizes of host plant patches (9 plants and 100 plants) in different ways. Densities of winged cabbage aphids were independent of patch size. Egg-densities of the cabbage butterfly were higher in small than in large patches. Densities of diamondback moth adults were higher in large patches than in small patches. When patches in a background of barley were compared with those in grass, densities of the cabbage aphid and the diamondback moth were reduced, but not cabbage butterfly densities. To explore the role of foraging behaviour of herbivores on their response to patch size, a spatially explicit individual-based simulation framework was used. The sensory abilities of the insects to detect and respond to contact, olfactory or visual cues were varied. Species with a post-alighting host recognition behaviour (cabbage aphid) could only use contact cues from host plants encountered after landing. In contrast, species capable with a pre-alighting recognition behaviour, based on visual (cabbage butterfly) or olfactory (diamondback moth) cues, were able to recognise a preferred host plant whilst in flight. These three searching modalities were studied by varying the in flight detection abilities, the displacement speed and the arrestment response to host plants by individuals. Simulated patch size - density relationships were similar to those observed in the field. The importance of pre- and post- alighting detection in the responses of herbivores to spatial heterogeneity of the habitat is discussed.

AB Land use change is one of the most important anthropogenic factors affecting terrestrial ecosystems, causing habitat loss, fragmentation, and interactions with other components of global change, such as biological invasions of non-native species. In southern California, population growth and economic expansion are the primary drivers of land use change, and the population is expected to double in 40 years. Although directly adjacent to the region's largest metropolitan area, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA) remains mostly undeveloped, with 50 % of the area protected as parkland. In this study, a cellular automaton (CA) model was calibrated using historical growth patterns in the region, and used to forecast three scenarios of urban growth in the SMMNRA from 2000 to 2050, with development prohibited on slopes greater than 25 %, 30 %, and 60 % slope. Habitat pattern and extent under these scenarios was assessed using several landscape metrics, then compared to results from a GIS overlay model developed for the same region. The CA model predicted urbanization to increase from 11 % of the landscape in 2000 to 26 %, 35 %, and 47 % in 2050, respectively, for the three slope scenarios. In 2000, the majority of vegetation constituted one large, interconnected patch. With development prohibited beyond 25 % and 30 % slope, this patch will become, by 2050, increasingly perforated, but should stay relatively intact. However, if growth is permitted up to 60 % slope, the patch breaks apart, resulting in a shift in spatial pattern dynamics on the landscape (as reflected by other landscape metrics). General growth patterns predicted by the GIS overlay model resembled those generated by the CA, but the CA model produced more patches and edge in the landscape. Because it is temporally explicit, the CA model was able to capture non-linear, emergent behavior and a phase transition in the type of growth occurring in the landscape that was not apparent in the GIS overlay predictions.

AB Viewing primary care as merely one of the many niches in individual patient care fosters a narrow perspective that neither accounts for the full value of primary care nor offers proper guidance for reforming it. Instead, a systems view better articulates primary care's essential role in increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of other health care services. Primary care improves health care system functioning through such services as managing and triaging undifferentiated symptoms, matching patient needs to health care resources, and enhancing the system's ability to adapt to new circumstances. By acting as an appropriate filter for high-technology care, primary care helps ensure that it is appropriately applied, a major determinant of outcomes. Furthermore, because primary care is the most financially and geographically accessible arm of the health care system, it reduces socioeconomic and geographic disparities across the population. Even in the de facto health system that exists in the United States, these functions are necessary for the efficient, equitable, and sustainable delivery of health care and the adaptability and resilience of the system as a whole. As primary care reforms proceed, it will be important to explicitly consider how to support and strengthen its system-level benefits. Needed reforms include enabling universal access to primary care and providing the leadership, training, and infrastructure support to improve its performance as a central hub in the network of patients, clinicians, and communities. It is important that health systems realize the essential integrative function of primary care.

AB This special issue of Diversity and Distributions presents six papers that contribute to the assembly of a general research agenda for studying long-distance dispersal (LDD) across a variety of taxonomic groups (e.g. birds, fish, aquatic invertebrates and plants), ecosystems (e.g. terrestrial and marine ecosystems, wetlands and grasslands) and thematic fields (e.g. biological transport, marine biology, biogeochemistry and biodiversity conservation). This editorial emphasizes the need to develop a network integrating different research approaches ('yellow brick roads') to address the great challenge ('finding the end of the rainbow') of quantifying, understanding and predicting LDD and its implications. I review the key avenues for future research suggested in the special issue contributions, and stress the critical importance of properly considering the spatial and temporal scales relevant to the process and system of interests. I propose combining absolute and proportional definitions of LDD as a default practice in any investigation of LDD processes. When LDD is defined primarily by an absolute critical distance that characterizes key feature(s) of the system of interest, a quantitative assessment of the proportion of dispersal events expected to move beyond this critical threshold distance should also be provided. When LDD is defined primarily by a certain small fraction of dispersal events that travel longer than all others, an estimate of the absolute distance associated with this high percentile at the tail of the dispersal curve should also be added.

AB The soil-microbe system is one of the most diverse components of the terrestrial ecosystem. The origin of this diversity, and its relation to the life-sustaining processes that are mediated by the resident microbial community, is still poorly understood. The inherent complexities necessitate a theoretical framework that integrates ecological and evolutionary approaches and which embraces the physical heterogeneity of the soil environment. Such a framework is currently lacking, although recent advances in theory and experimentation are beginning to identify the essential ingredients. Here, we review and evaluate the relevance of current modelling approaches, and propose a new synthesis of an evolutionary ecology of life in soil. Key elements include an account of dispersal, horizontal gene transfer, and the consideration of the physical and biological components of soil as an integrated complex adaptive system.

AB This paper examines the linkage between the drainage network and the patterns of soil water balance components determined by the organization of vegetation, soils and climate in a semiarid river basin. Research during the last 10 years has conclusively shown an increasing degree of organization and unifying principles behind the structure of the drainage network and the three-dimensional geometry of river basins. This cohesion exists despite the infinite variety of shapes and forms one observes in natural watersheds. What has been relatively unexplored in a quantitative and general manner is the question of whether or not the interaction of vegetation, soils, and climate also display a similar set of unifying characteristics among the very different patterns they presents in river basins. A recently formulated framework for the water balance at the daily level links the observed patterns of basin organization to the soil moisture dynamics. Using available geospatial data, we assign soil, climate, and vegetation properties across the basin and analyze the probabilistic characteristics of steady-state soil moisture distribution. We investigate the presence of organization through the analysis of the spatial patterns of the steady-state soil moisture distribution, as well as in the distribution of observed vegetation patterns, simulated vegetation dynamic water stress and hydrological fluxes such as transpiration. Here we show that the drainage network acts as a template for the organization of both vegetation and hydrological patterns, which exhibit self-affine characteristics in their distribution across the river basin. Our analyses suggest the existence of a balance between the large-scale determinants of vegetation pattern reflecting optimality in the response to water stress and the random small-scale patterns that arise from local factors and ecological legacies such as those caused by dispersal, disturbance, and founder effects.

AB We examined the genetics of hybrid incompatibility between two closely related diploid hermaphroditic plant species. Using a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) representing 85% of the genome of the wild species Lycopersicon hirsutum (Solanum habrachaites) in the genetic background of the cultivated tomato L. esculentum (S. lycopersicum), we found that hybrid pollen and seed infertility are each based on 5-11 QTL that individulally reduce hybrid fitness by 36-90%. Seed infertility QTL act additively or recessively, consistent with findings in other systems where incompatibility loci have largely been recessive. Genetic lengths of introgressed chromosomal segments explain little of the variation for hybrid incompatibility among NILs, arguing against an infinitesimal model of hybrid incompatibility and reinforcing our inference of a limited number of discrete in compatibility factors between these species. In addition, male (pollen) and other (seed) incompatibility factors are roughly comparable in number. The latter two findings contrast strongly with data from Drosophila where hybrid incompatibility can be highly polygenic and complex, and male sterility, evolves substantially faster than female sterility or hybrid inviability. The observed differences between Lycopersicon and Drosophila might be due to differences in sex determination system, reproductive and mating biology, and/or the prevalence of sexual interactions such as sexual selection.

AB The grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger Jordan and Gilbert, 1880) Is a non-migratory, benthic, near shore species distributed along rocky reefs and sea grass beds. It occurs from Baja California, Mexico, to Oregon, USA, spanning the Oregonian and Californian biogeographic provinces. In California this fish receives intense fishing pressure from an expanding and loosely regulated live-fish fishery. It is not known whether or by what mechanism larvae and juveniles are retained locally or dispersed widely during the early life-history phase. Tissue samples of S. rastrelliger were collected between 1996 and 2001 from 405 adult fish at eight sites (42.70degreesN: 124.50degreesW to 32.67degreesN; 117.25degreesW) spanning the species' range. Individuals were surveyed for polymorphism at six microsatellite loci. Allele frequency heterogeneity was not significant among all sites (F-ST=0.001; P = 0.18), nor in pairwise comparisons, but a clear correlation of genetic and geographic distance was detected (P=0.019). Fit of genetic and geographic distance was stronger within biogeographic provinces than at a range-wide scale. suggesting that populations north and south of the Point Conception biogeographic boundary are not in equilibrium with respect to migration and genetic drift. Estimates of mean coastal dispersal distances associated with the isolation-by-distance relationship are on the order of 10 km generation(-1). Such limited disc persal in a species with a pelagic early life history suggests active retention mechanisms near the shore. This has important implications for coastal management zones and design of marine reserves.

AB Sets of reference sites often are used to create a benchmark for biological assessment of river condition. Unfortunately, human modification of river systems is now so widespread and complex that this practice can result in comparisons against a reference condition that embodies an appreciable and poorly defined degree of human impact. Our paper describes an alternative means of deriving reference conditions that does not require the use of reference sites. Instead, the tolerances and preferences of each taxon in the regional taxon pool are established for various environmental factors. These factors can be regarded as filters that exclude members of the regional pool from sites where environmental conditions are incompatible with their tolerances and preferences. The suite of taxa that can occupy an assessment site under natural conditions can be estimated if the natural values of the environmental filters at that site can be determined. A comparison between this suite of potential taxa and the taxa actually collected at an assessment site provides an indication of human impact on taxonomic richness. This approach is illustrated for aquatic macroinvertebrate families in rivers in northeastern New South Wales, Australia, and the environmental filters of annual water temperature range, flow regime, and river bed type. An assessment based on this approach showed substantial correlation with several independent measures of human influence, in contrast to very little correlation for a previous macroinvertebrate bioassessment based on reference sites. The performance of the filters approach probably could be improved with further development of the underlying techniques and data.

AB 1. An experiment was carried out to determine whether the community composition of root-colonizing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) influences the growth and nutrient status of two congeneric Pulsatilla species, one rare and one common in Estonia. We hypothesized that: (i) establishment and growth of plants is influenced by the composition of native AMF communities; (ii) growth of congeneric plant species with different abundances differs due to their response to specific AMF communities; and (iii) distribution of a plant species may depend on the composition of local root symbiotic AMF communities.
   2. Rare Pulsatilla patens and common Pulsatilla pratensis were grown in pots, under homogeneous soil nutrient and microbial community conditions, containing either one from two (grassland and forest sites) of natural AMF soil inocula, or no AMF.
   3. Lower establishment was observed in the non-mycorrhizal soil compared to AMF inoculated soils. Plant biomass, phosphorus concentration and root AMF colonization of both species were higher, and nitrogen concentration lower, in grassland as opposed to forest inoculum.
   4. The common species displayed more vigorous growth than the rare counterpart in the presence of grassland inoculum. Conversely, slightly better growth of a rare species was recorded in the forest inoculum, in which plant biomass was an order of magnitude lower compared to the grassland inoculum.
   5. As Pulsatilla spp. roots hosted site-characteristic AMF small-subunit rDNA sequence groupings, we suggest that the presence of AM fungi that are more beneficial for the common species may be one factor behind the observed differential distribution and performance of the two plant species.

AB Darwin's finches are well known for their remarkable diversity in beak form and function. Field studies have shown that beaks evolve by natural selection in response to variation in local ecological conditions. We posit anew hypothesis: As a consequence of beak evolution, there have been changes in the structure of finch vocal signals. We base this hypothesis on the discovery that beaks play a functional role in song production in songbirds. Recentfield studies provide support for a link between beak morphology and song structure in Darwin's finches, although much remains to be learned. Because song plays a significant role in finch mating dynamics, we suggest that the functional link between beaks and song may have contributed to the process of speciation and adaptive radiation in these birds.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the main processes that determine changes in landscape patterns and vegetation cover from 1957-1994 to develop a model for land cover dynamics. Land cover and landscape patterns were assessed and compared using aerial photographs taken in 1957, 1985, and 1994. Over this period, tall grass steppe and arid garrigues increased by 6% and 4%, respectively, while crop fields decreased by 15% and tall arid brush remained the same. Over the same period, tall grass steppes and arid garrigues became less fragmented. Changes in land use were triggered by socioeconomic forces, which were constrained by the underlying structure of the physical landscape. The best preserved vegetation (tall arid brushes) was concentrated at higher elevations, with a pronounced slope, not oriented towards the sea, and in volcanic substrate. Communities tended to be better preserved further away from towns and at lower house densities. Tall grass steppe was present on more gradual sea-oriented slope and in calcareous substrate, and increased at higher elevations, although not far from the town but away from high anthropogenic influence. Previous studies have revealed that traditional land uses of this landscape, particularly grazing, favoured the transition from tall arid brush to tall grass steppe. In this study, we analyzed to what extent the underlying structure of the physical landscape imposes limitations to the vulnerability to human activity of the main vegetation types. According to the data on the probability of vegetation transition over the 37-year period, the shift from tall arid brush to tall grass steppe appeared to be favoured by gradual slopes. Tall arid brush recovered from either arid garrigues or tall grass steppes at steeper slopes. Thus, steep terrain had a favourable effect on the formation of brushwood and more gradual terrain favoured tall grass steppe. The prevalent trends were confirmed by a projection of a transition matrix over 100 years.

AB We present a mathematical analysis of the consequences of spatial interactions between vegetation patches by means of water flow for the functioning of arid systems. Our model results suggest that spatial exchange of water improved the resilience to disturbances and increased the resistance to human-induced loss of cover. Furthermore, spatial exchange of water allowed vegetation to persist at lower rainfall levels compared to systems that lack spatial interactions. Our analysis stresses the general importance of spatial interactions for the functioning of ecological systems.

AB The relationship between trophic position through delta(13)C and delta(15)N and trace metal concentrations (Zn, Cd, Cu and Hg) was investigated in the tissues of six marine mammal species from the Northeast Atlantic: striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba, common dolphin, Delphinus delphis. Atlantic white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus, harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena, white beaked-dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris, grey seal Halichoerus grypus stranded on French Channel and Irish coasts. White-beaked dolphins, harbour porpoises, white-sided dolphins, common and striped dolphins display the same relative and decreasing trophic position, as measured by delta(15)N values, along both the Irish and French channel coasts, reflecting conservative trophic habits between these two places. Hepatic and renal Cd concentrations were significantly correlated to muscle delta(13)C and delta(15)N values while Hg, Zn and Cu did not. These results suggest that Cd accumulation is partly linked to the diet while other factors Such as age or body condition might explain Hg, Zn or Cu variability in marine mammals. Combined stable isotope and trace metal analyses appear to be useful tools for the study of marine mammal ecology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In densely populated northwestern Europe, native large mammals are confronted with a very fragmented landscape, and most of the areas they inhabit are island-like reserves threatened with total isolation from other reserves. The only way to counteract the threat of further decline in the numbers of large-mammal species is to restore their habitats. The appropriate size of future reserves could be estimated from the habitat requirements of wild ungulates that are considered key species for ecosystem functioning. The species selected to guide the design of large nature reserves in northwestern Europe is the red deer (Cervus elaphus) because of its widespread distribution, key role in ecosystem functioning, and home-range size. We describe a network analysis of the Netherlands, Belgium, and adjacent parts of France and Germany, performed with the LARCH landscape ecology model, that was conducted in order to identify the structure of the ecological network for red deer and the spatial connectivity of the landscape. The resulting maps show areas that could support viable populations and indicate habitat areas that will support persistent populations only if they are in a network of linked habitats. The gaps and barriers that prevent connectivity in such networks guide the design of effective corridors to increase spatial connectivity. The results of our analysis can be used for policy decisions on nature conservation and spatial planning, and the method is applicable to other regions and species.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted with Daphnia magna and Hyalella sp. grown on a single food source of known isotopic composition at a range of temperatures spanning the physiological optima for each species. Daphnia raised at 26.5degreesC were enriched in delta(13)C and delta(15)N by 3.1 and 2.8parts per thousand, respectively, relative to diet. Daphnia raised at 12.8degreesC were enriched 1.7 and 5.0parts per thousand in delta(13)C and delta(15)N, respectively. Results imply a significant negative relationship between the delta(13)C and delta(15)N of primary consumers when a temperature gradient exists. Similar responses were observed for Hyalella. Results indicate a general increase in delta(13)C enrichment and decrease in delta(15)N enrichment as temperature rises. Deviations from the commonly applied isotopic enrichment values used in aquatic ecology were attributed to changes in temperature-mediated physiological rates. Field data from a variety of sources also showed a general trend toward delta(13)C enrichment with increasing temperature in marine and lacustrine zooplankton. Multivariate regression models demonstrated that, in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes, zooplankton delta(13)C was related to lake-specific POM delta(13)C, lake surface temperature and latitude. Temperature-dependent isotopic separation (enrichment) between predator and prey should be taken into consideration when interpreting the significance of isotopic differences within and among aquatic organisms and ecosystems, and when assigning organisms to food-web positions on the basis of observed isotope values.

AB Establishment of the Kyoto Protocol has resulted in an effort to look towards living biomass and soils for carbon sequestration. In order for carbon credits to be meaningful, sustained carbon sequestration for decades or longer is required. It has been speculated that improved land management could result in sequestration of a substantial amount of carbon in soils within several decades and therefore can be an important option in reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, evaluation of soil carbon sources and sinks is difficult because the dynamics of soil carbon storage and release is complex and still not well understood. There has been rapid development of quantitative techniques over the past two decades for measuring the component fluxes of the global carbon cycle and for studying the soil carbon cycle. Most significant development in the soil carbon cycle study is the application of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) in radiocarbon measurements. This has made it possible to unravel rates of carbon cycling in soils, by studying natural levels of radiocarbon in soil organic matter and soil CO2. Despite the advances in the study of the soil carbon cycle in the recent decades, tremendous uncertainties exist in the sizes and turnover times of soil carbon pools. The uncertainties result from lack of standard methods and incomplete understanding of soil organic carbon dynamics, compounded by natural variability in soil carbon and carbon isotopic content even within the same ecosystem. Many fundamental questions concerning the dynamics of the soil carbon cycle have yet to be answered. This paper reviews and synthesizes the isotopic approaches to the study of the soil carbon cycle. We will focus on uncertainties and limitations associated with these approaches and point out areas where more research is needed to improve our understanding of this important component of the global carbon cycle.

AB We focus this mini-review on how naturally occurring chemical cues mediate ecological interactions, especially interspecific competition and predation in freshwater communities. Although freshwater chemical ecology lags behind terrestrial and marine chemical ecology, we identify recent progress toward: (1) identifying the chemical composition of cues important in food web interactions, e. g., specific glucosinolates, benzyl succinoates, and lignoids as deterrents to herbivory on freshwater macrophytes; (2) employing a nonreductionist approach that tests for emergent responses to suites of multiple chemical cues, e. g., trade-offs in snail refuge-seeking behavior in the presence of chemical cues from both fish and crayfish; (3) investigating how abiotic forces, such as hydrodynamics, impact chemical communication across a broad spatial and temporal scale, e. g., drift responses of mayfly nymphs to whole-stream additions of trout cue; and (4) quantifying the importance of genetic variability, e. g., how chemical cues change selective pressures of local environments. The questions of interest in freshwater chemical ecology cross taxonomic boundaries; traverse broad spatial and temporal scales; demonstrate nonlinear, unpredictable results; and necessitate a multidisciplinary approach for adequate understanding.

AB 1. Dispersal ability is an important ecological factor that can influence population structure. In an attempt to determine the extent that the pattern of genetic differentiation is correlated with dispersal ability in stream-dwelling aquatic insects, we used the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique to characterise genetic variation in four aquatic insect species: Gumaga griseola (Trichoptera: Sericostomatidae), Helicopsyche mexicana (Trichoptera: Helicopsychidae), Psephenus montanus (Coleoptera: Psephenidae) and Ambrysus thermarum (Hemiptera: Naucoridae). Individuals were sampled from several sites within two adjacent catchments in the Arizona White Mountains. In addition to the genetic analyses, a 20-week-long trapping study was used to determine the relative dispersal ability of adults of the four species examined.
   2. We obtained hierarchical indicators of genetic differentiation for catchments, sites within catchments and sites across the region examined. Overall, average estimators of genetic differentiation (F -statistics) were consistent with direct observations of organismal movement, although it was our direct observations on adult insect flight that permitted us to interpret our results correctly. This was because of the fact that a lack of genetic differentiation across watersheds can be interpreted in two ways.
   3. In contrast to F -statistics, patterns of genetic isolation by distance for each species more clearly reflected dispersal ability, suggesting that such analytical approaches provide less ambiguous information about the importance of gene flow in the hierarchical partitioning of genetic variation in stream organisms.

AB Angiosperm diversification has been associated with plant-animal interactions such as seed dispersal and pollination and life-history characters such as rapid growth and fast reproduction. This paper relates a life-history character (age at maturity) to woody angiosperm diversification. Here I present a comparative analysis of data drawn from the literature, indicating that time to first reproduction is shorter in woody angiosperms than in gymnosperms. In addition, age at maturity is negatively correlated with the rate of diversification (measured as the number of species per genus) at all the taxonomic levels analyzed and also when phylogenetically independent contrasts were conducted. This correlation suggests that early reproduction promotes diversification in woody angiosperms. Furthermore, this correlation is not a confounding effect of the association between age at maturity and other ecological factors that promote angiosperm diversification, such as pollination and seed dispersal systems.

AB Why are some ecosystems so rich, yet contain so many rare species? High species diversity, together with rarity, is a general trend in neotropical forests and coral reefs. However, the origin of such diversity and the consequences of food web complexity in both species abundances and temporal fluctuations are not well understood. Several regularities are observed in complex, multispecies ecosystems that suggest that these ecologies might be organized close to points of instability. We explore, in greater depth, a recent stochastic model of population dynamics that is shown to reproduce: (i) the scaling law linking species number and connectivity; (ii) the observed distributions of species abundance reported from field studies (showing long tails and thus a predominance of rare species); (iii) the complex fluctuations displayed by natural communities (including chaotic dynamics); and (iv) the species-area relations displayed by rainforest plots. It is conjectured that the conflict between the natural tendency towards higher diversity due to immigration, and the ecosystem level constraints derived from an increasing number of links, leaves the system poised at a critical boundary separating stable from unstable communities, where large fluctuations are expected to occur. We suggest that the patterns displayed by species-rich communities, including rarity, would result from such a spontaneous tendency towards instability.

AB Morgan made detailed descriptions of 24 major Moroccan wetlands visited in 1978, with a total area of 4529 ha (Morgan, N.C., 1982a. An ecological survey of standing waters in North West Africa: III. Site descriptions for Morocco. Biological Conservation, 24, 161-182.). We revisited these sites, and found that 25% of the wetland area had been destroyed by 1999. This loss was concentrated in wetland types of low salinity (<5 g/l NaCl), with a 98% loss of seasonal mesohaline sites, 41% loss of mountain lakes and 33% loss of seasonal Phragmites/Scirpus lacustris marshes. Surviving mountain lakes showed increased conductivities, suggesting reduced inflow. No loss of area of other wetland types was recorded, although degradation has occurred at all sites due to hydrological impacts, overgrazing or excessive reed-cutting, sedimentation, urban development, pollution, introduction of exotic fish and other causes. Similar threats face another 23 major Moroccan wetlands reviewed in this study. Of the 47 wetlands studied in total, only 10 have some kind of protection status. We assess the importance of these wetlands for waterbirds and aquatic submerged or floating plants, The number of plant species recorded is strongly correlated with the number of threatened waterbird species (but not the total number of waterbird species). Natural, freshwater wetlands most affected by wetland loss hold more species of aquatic plants and invertebrates, and are of great value for threatened waterbirds such as marbled teal (Marmaronetta angustrirostris), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and especially the crested coot (Fulica cristata). Most surviving natural, fresh wetlands are unprotected, and measures to conserve them are urgently required. Human-made wetlands such as reservoirs have some value for threatened waterbirds (especially ruddy shelduck and marbled teal), but hold much lower densities of waterbirds than natural wetlands, and support fewer plant species. Thus, they do not compensate for the continuing loss of natural wetlands. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a perspective on the ecology of trematodes in snail hosts based on recent evidence. Because flukes use snails almost obligatorily as first intermediate hosts, we highlight the role of gastropods as keystone species for trematodes and their communities. After reviewing recent developments in the transmission of trematodes to and from snails, we discuss trematode communities within individual snails (infracommunities) and in snail populations (component communities). Results garnered using various protocols at the infracommunity level are reviewed. The few data available, all from marine systems, indicate that low colonization rates characterize infracommunities, suggesting that trematode infracommunities tend to be isolationist in character rather than interactive. The variety of trematode species present in a component community seems to be determined by spatial overlap of definitive hosts. Relative abundance of species in a component community shows little dependence on negative interspecific interactions at the level of the infracommunity. Temporal aspects of trematode communities are related to the life history of the host snail. The component communities of long-lived snails (mostly marine) integrate many infection episodes whereas shorter-lived snails (mostly freshwater) acquire new component communities each time host cohorts turnover.

AB The effect of plant species diversity on productivity and competitive ability was studied in an experiment carried out simultaneously in five European countries: Czech Republic (CZ), the Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE), Spain (SP), and United Kingdom (UK). The aim was to separate the 'chance' or 'sampling effect' (increasing the number of sown species increases the probability that a species able 'to do a job' will be included) from the complementarity effect (species-rich communities are better able to exploit resources and to take care of ecosystem functions than species-poor communities). In the experiment, low diversity (LD) and high diversity (HD) mixtures of grassland species were sown into fields taken out of arable cultivation. The HD mixture consisted of five grass species, five legumes and five other forbs. The LD mixtures consisted of two grasses, one legume and one other forb, with different plant species combinations in each replicate block. The design of the experiment was constructed in such a way that the total number of seeds of each species over all the replications was exactly the same in HD and LD treatments, and the total number of grass seeds, leguminous seeds and other forb seeds were the same in both LD and HD. The responses measured were the total above-ground biomass las a measure of productivity) and the average number of naturally establishing species in a plot las a measure of the competitive ability of the mixture), both measured in the third year of the experiment. The results show that, on average, the HD plots performed better (i.e., attained higher biomass, had better weed suppression), but that the best LD mixture was as good as the best HD mixture. On the contrary, the worst LD mixture was always less successful than the worst HD replicate. The performance of particular species in the HD mixtures was a good predictor of the success of a certain species combination in a LD mixture (explaining 61% of variability between particular LD mixtures). In all sites, the LD mixture composed of species which were the most abundant in HD mixtures was as efficient in suppressing weeds as the HD mixture itself. It is argued that the performance of a species assemblage is influenced mostly by the identity of species and the diversity effect is mainly due to the 'chance' or 'sampling' effect with increasing number of species the probability that an important species will be included in the mixture increases. Caution is urged in interpreting experiments with manipulated diversity and the possible limitations of such experiments are discussed.

AB Species are not equally important for the functioning of communities. This fact is widely recognized and the term "keystone species" has been introduced for the most important members of communities. In a recent paper, Power et al. called for methods suitable for a priori identification of keystone species, which is an urgent problem in conservation biology. Another problem is the scarcity of their quantitative description. In this paper, we propose an index for characterizing keystone species reflecting their role in food web flow networks. We present some calculations for characterizing the role of keystones in weighted webs and discuss some problems of food web dynamics. Our keystone index refers well to keystones only if trophic interactions are of prime importance in a community. We further analyse the relationship between keystone species and the reliability of network flow. Keystones make network flow less reliable. Finally, we discuss some problems of stability and reliability in ecological systems.

AB The role of biotic interactions including vertebrate predation and interspecific competition was studied among members of a semiarid small mammal assemblage in a long-term field manipulation in north central Chile. Fences and netting selectively excluded from large, replicated grids. Small mammal populations were censused monthly over >4 yr, and effects of predator and degu exclusions on numbers and survival of small mammals were assessed with repeated measures ANOVAs. Marginally significant predator exclusion effects were detected on O. degus, and highly significant year x predation interactions in both wet and dry seasons; degu survival (= persistence) was also significantly longer on exclusion grids. Predation had significant effects on numbers of Phyllotis darwini, and a significant month X predator interaction existed in the wet season; survival was also significantly higher on predator exclusion grids. There was a marginally significant year x competitor interaction in the dry season for this species. Akodon olivaceus had significant month x predator and month x competitor interactions in the wet season only; survival was significantly longer on degu exclusion grids. An irruptive species, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, showed no significant predator or competitor effects in 1991-1992; however, survival was significantly longer on predator + competitor exclusion (vs. control) grids. An uncommon species, Abrothrix longipilis, had marginally nonsignificant time x competitor interactions but no treatment differences in survival. Finally, a second uncommon rodent, Abrocoma bennetti (not analyzed numerically) had significantly longer survival on predator exclusion grids with degus. Degus and P. darwini were significantly overrepresented (relative to availability) in diets of culpeo foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and three nocturnal owls, respectively, whereas A. bennetti was significantly overrepresented in predator diets generally, Vertebrate predation has pervasive effects on some species that, however, may be related to their intrinsic demographic characteristics. Competition may be mediated by subtle behavioral interactions among assemblage members. Long-term studies are necessary to elucidate the role of biotic and abiotic factors in semiarid environments.

AB Efforts to understand fluctuations in northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) abundance illustrate inadequate knowledge of demographic processes.  Therefore, we estimated seasonal survival, annual survival, and cause-specific mortality of 1,001 radio-marked bobwhite in northern Missouri.  Annual survival was 5.3 +/- 0.5% and did not differ between ages (P = 0.33) or sexes (P = 0.48).  Fall-spring survival (15.9 +/- 0.8%) was less than spring-fall survival (33.2 +/- 2.7%, P < 0.001).  Females had lower fall-spring survival (13.7 +/- 1.1%) than males (17.6 +/- 1.1%, P = 0.02).  Male-biased sex ratios likely result from differential fall and winter survival.  Avian (28.7%) and mammalian (25.7%) predators were primary natural mortality agents.  Hunter-retrieved (22.9%) and -unretrieved (5.3%) kill resulted in 28.2% harvest-related mortality.  During springfall, males experienced higher avian mortality (26.5%) than females (20.0%) (P = 0.09).  Greater vulnerability of males to avian predators may represent a cost of displaying.  Each incubation and brood-rearing attempt reduced survival by 16% when compared with nonreproductively active birds during a similar period.  Bobwhites must be highly productive to replace annual population losses.

AB Context Grasslands provide a variety of ecosystem services (ESs) for humans. While much ES research has focused on forests and wetlands, synthesizing the currently somewhat sporadic studies of grassland ecosystem services (GESs) is much needed. Objectives We aimed to review the scope, major methods, and key findings of GESs, and identify knowledge gaps and future directions. Methods We conducted a systematic review of articles published during 1970-2018 (including 380 peer-reviewed articles from Web of Science and 32 book chapters from Google Scholar). Results The number of GES studies has accelerated in recent decades, with China (31%) and the United States (18%) together accounting for almost half of them. A total of 33 GESs were mentioned in the searched articles, of which carbon sequestration, forage production, and water erosion control had the highest frequencies. Methods for evaluating GESs include field survey, field experiments, and statistical and process-based modeling. Grasslands are the primary source of meat and dairy products, account for about one-third of the total carbon of all terrestrial ecosystems, and provide numerous other ESs, such as night cooling, soil erosion control, and flood mitigation. Conclusions This review presents the state-of-the-science of GESs, and identifies several future research directions. To move forward, we propose a framework with a 3-M methodology: (1) "Multi-scales"-understanding GESs from various spatiotemporal scales; (2) "Multi-methods"-evaluating GESs with multiple statistical and modeling techniques using multiple data sources; and (3) "Multi-perspectives"-assessing GESs from ecological, social, and economic perspectives for sustainability.

AB Restoring gene flow into small, isolated populations can alleviate genetic load and decrease extinction risk (i.e., genetic rescue), yet gene flow is rarely augmented as a conservation strategy. Due to this discrepancy between opportunity and action, a recent call was made for widespread genetic rescue attempts. However, several aspects of augmenting gene flow are poorly understood, including the magnitude and duration of beneficial effects and when deleterious effects are likely to occur. We discuss the remaining uncertainties of genetic rescue in order to promote and direct future research and to hasten progress toward implementing this potentially powerful conservation strategy on a broader scale.

AB Due to rapid urbanization, China's urban morphology has undergone tremendous changes, resulting in an increased urban heat island (UHI) effect and negative impact of thermal environment, especially in summer. Studying the scale effect between urban wind and thermal environment can provide the best scale for the wind environment planning on mitigating UHI effect. Taking Dalian as an example, using multi-source data, a nonlinear correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between the frontal area index (FAI) and land 77uuyyhsurface temperature (LST) under different grids. The results show that first, FAI is sensitive to grid-size changes. When the grid size increases from 25 x 25m to 150 x 150m with a step size of 25 m, in July, the numbers of grids with FAI > 1 are 19,992, 1538, 153, 20, 4, and 0 (0%) accounting for 2.106%, 0.645%, 0.081%, 0.019%, 0.006%, and 0% of the total, respectively. In September, the numbers of grids with FAI > 1 are 17,633, 1643, 164, 22, 8, and 0, accounting for 1.849%, 0.689%, 0.155%, 0.037%, 0.021%, and 0% of the total, respectively. When the grid size is greater than or equal to 150 x 150 m, there is no grid with FAI > 1. Second, the most effective grid size to study the relationship between FAI and LST is 25 m. When the grid size increases from 25m to 300m with a step size of 25 m, the correlation between FAI and LST shows a significant decrease. When the grid size is 25 m, the correlation is the strongest.

AB To predict the threat of biological invasions to native species, it is critical that we understand how increasing abundance of invasive alien species (IAS) affects native populations and communities. The form of this relationship across taxa and ecosystems is unknown, but is expected to depend strongly on the trophic position of the IAS relative to the native species. Using a global metaanalysis based on 1,258 empirical studies presented in 201 scientific publications, we assessed the shape, direction, and strength of native responses to increasing invader abundance. We also tested how native responses varied with relative trophic position and for responses at the population vs. community levels. As IAS abundance increased, native populations declined non-linearly by 20%, on average, and community metrics declined linearly by 25%. When at higher trophic levels, invaders tended to cause a strong, nonlinear decline in native populations and communities, with the greatest impacts occurring at low invader abundance. In contrast, invaders at the same trophic level tended to cause a linear decline in native populations and communities, while invaders at lower trophic levels had no consistent impacts. At the community level, increasing invader abundance had significantly larger effects on species evenness and diversity than on species richness. Our results show that native responses to invasion depend critically on invasive species' abundance and trophic position. Further, these general abundance-impact relationships reveal how IAS impacts are likely to develop during the invasion process and when to best manage them.

AB Species distribution is strongly driven by local and global gradients in water availability but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Vulnerability to xylem embolism (P-50) is a key trait that indicates how species cope with drought and might explain plant distribution patterns across environmental gradients. Here we address its role on species sorting along a hydro-topographical gradient in a central Amazonian rainforest and examine its variance at the community scale.
   We measured P-50 for 28 tree species, soil properties and estimated the hydrological niche of each species using an indicator of distance to the water table (HAND).
   We found a large hydraulic diversity, covering as much as 44% of the global angiosperm variation in P-50. We show that P-50: contributes to species segregation across a hydro-topographic gradient in the Amazon, and thus to species coexistence; is the result of repeated evolutionary adaptation within closely related taxa; is associated with species tolerance to P-poor soils, suggesting the evolution of a stress-tolerance syndrome to nutrients and drought; and is higher for trees in the valleys than uplands.
   The large observed hydraulic diversity and its association with topography has important implications for modelling and predicting forest and species resilience to climate change.

AB Climate change is an immediate and future threat to food security globally. The consequences for fisheries and agriculture production potential are well studied, yet the possible outcomes for aquaculture (that is, aquatic farming)-one of the fastest growing food sectors on the planet-remain a major gap in scientific understanding. With over one-third of aquaculture produced in marine waters and this proportion increasing, it is critical to anticipate new opportunities and challenges in marine production under climate change. Here, we model and map the effect of warming ocean conditions (Representative Concentration Pathway scenario 8.5) on marine aquaculture production potential over the next century, based on thermal tolerance and growth data of 180 cultured finfish and bivalve species. We find heterogeneous patterns of gains and losses, but an overall greater probability of declines worldwide. Accounting for multiple drivers of species growth, including shifts in temperature, chlorophyll and ocean acidification, reveals potentially greater declines in bivalve aquaculture compared with finfish production. This study addresses a missing component in food security research and sustainable development planning by identifying regions that will face potentially greater climate change challenges and resilience with regards to marine aquaculture in the coming decades. Understanding the scale and magnitude of future increases and reductions in aquaculture potential is critical for designing effective and efficient use and protection of the oceans, and ultimately for feeding the planet sustainably.

AB Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are spread by direct and/or indirect contacts between a pathogen or parasite and their hosts. Arthropod vectors have evolved as excellent bloodsuckers, providing an elegant transportation mode for a wide number of infectious agents. The nature of pathogen and parasite transfer and the models used to predict how a disease might spread are magnified in complexity when an arthropod vector is part of the disease cycle. One Health is a worldwide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment. It would benefit from a structured analysis to address vectoring of arthropod-borne diseases as a dynamic transactional process. This review focused on how arthropod vector data can be used to better model and predict zoonotic disease outbreaks. With enhanced knowledge to describe arthropod vector disease transfer, researchers will have a better understanding about how to model disease outbreaks. As public health research evolves to include more social-ecological systems, the roles of society, ecology, epidemiology, pathogen/parasite evolution and animal behavior can be better captured in the research design. Overall, because of more collaborative data collection processes on arthropod vectors, disease modeling can better predict conditions where EIDs will occur.

AB Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has enhanced soil carbon (C) stocks in temperate forests. Most research has posited that these soil C gains are driven primarily by shifts in fungal community composition with elevated N leading to declines in lignin degrading Basidiomycetes. Recent research, however, suggests that plants and soil microbes are dynamically intertwined, whereby plants send C subsidies to rhizosphere microbes to enhance enzyme production and the mobilization of N. Thus, under elevated N, trees may reduce belowground C allocation leading to cascading impacts on the ability of microbes to degrade soil organic matter through a shift in microbial species and/or a change in plant-microbe interactions. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which couplings among plant, fungal, and bacterial responses to N fertilization alter the activity of enzymes that are the primary agents of soil decomposition. We measured fungal and bacterial community composition, root-microbial interactions, and extracellular enzyme activity in the rhizosphere, bulk, and organic horizon of soils sampled from a long-term (> 25 years), whole-watershed, N fertilization experiment at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA. We observed significant declines in plant C investment to fine root biomass (24.7%), root morphology, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization (55.9%). Moreover, we found that declines in extracellular enzyme activity were significantly correlated with a shift in bacterial community composition, but not fungal community composition. This bacterial community shift was also correlated with reduced AM fungal colonization indicating that declines in plant investment belowground drive the response of bacterial community structure and function to N fertilization. Collectively, we find that enzyme activity responses to N fertilization are not solely driven by fungi, but instead reflect a whole ecosystem response, whereby declines in the strength of belowground C investment to gain N cascade through the soil environment.

AB Environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are often consequences of human activity; however, the effects of EEDs are not limited to humans. A primary focus over the past 30 years has been on chemical EEDs, but the repercussions of non-chemical EEDs, such as artificial light at night (LAN), are of increasing interest. The sensitivity of the circadian system to light and the influence of circadian organization on overall physiology and behavior make the system a target for disruption with widespread effects. Indeed, there is increasing evidence for a role of LAN in human health, including disruption of circadian regulation and melatonin signaling, metabolic dysregulation, cancer risk, and disruption of other hormonally-driven systems. These effects are not limited to humans; domesticated animals as well as wildlife are also exposed to LAN, and at risk for disrupted circadian rhythms. Here, we review data that support the role of LAN as an endocrine disruptor in humans to be considered in treatments and lifestyle suggestions. We also present the effects of LAN in other animals, and discuss the potential for ecosystem-wide effects of artificial LAN. This can inform decisions in agricultural practices and urban lighting decisions to avoid unintended outcomes.

AB This review summarizes current understanding of five key plant traits: seed mass, plant height, wood density, leaf mass per unit area and leaf size, emphasizing ways in which our understanding of large-scale patterns in plant traits have improved over the last two decades. Notable advances include: (1) large-seeded species have greater seed dispersal distances than do small-seeded species, (2) leaf mass per unit area is not strongly or consistently related to plant traits outside the leaf economics spectrum, or to broad gradients in environmental conditions, and (3) fleshy fruit could not have first evolved for seed dispersal, as the first fleshy fruit appeared millions of years before the first potential seed dispersers. While quantifying large-scale patterns in plant traits has yielded many important discoveries, it is clear that the next major leap in understanding will not come from simply including ever more variables in our analyses. I suggest that we build upon Harper's Darwinian approach to plant ecology and apply evolutionary ideas to large-scale trait ecology. For example, quantifying trait impacts on lifetime fitness rather than on particular stages of plant regeneration can allow us to understand the coordination between seemingly disparate traits. I use this approach to bring seed mass and plant height together as integrated parts of a species' life-history spectrum. I then point out problems associated with the implicit assumption that selection acts on species' mean trait values and show how considering the way selection acts can improve our understanding of the effects of climate on plant traits. A goal for the future is to quantify the full suite of biotic and abiotic factors that shape plant strategy in complex, real-world situations.Synthesis. Enormous data availability and ever more powerful computational and statistical tools have given ecologists unprecedented power to quantify large-scale patterns in plant ecology. However, there is a limit to how far big data alone can take us. The time is ripe for a new generation of hypotheses and ecological theory built on strong evolutionary foundations. Let the creativity begin!

AB The measurement of community disaster resilience through the development of a comprehensive set of composite indicators is becoming increasingly commonplace. Despite this growing trend, there is neither an agreement upon a standard procedure nor a comprehensive assessment of existing measurement frameworks in the relevant literature. To tackle these challenges, this study (1) proposes an overarching eight-step procedure for composite indicator building and (2) develops a meta-level assessment framework to allow for a systematic review of existing disaster resilience measurement frameworks in application of composite indicator building. This meta-level framework was established on the basis of the proposed eight-step composite indicator building procedure and qualified with the introduction of 19 dimensions and 36 metrics for quality assessment. In order to select relevant disaster resilience measures for this analysis, the study applied a systematic survey to collect measures based on four inclusion criteria: community-based, multifaceted, quantitative, and operationalized. Accordingly, 17 resilience measurement frameworks were chosen for further analysis in this review. The results of the quality assessment demonstrated that, from the theoretical perspective, resilience assessments originate from either the socio-ecological or engineering fields and can be classified into two main types of resilience indices and tools. This differs from results of the methodological perspective, which indicate that resilience measures can be characterized as deductive or similar to hierarchical and inductive assessments.

AB Over the last decades there have been a considerable number of deforestation studies in Latin America reporting lower rates compared with other regions; although these studies are either regional or local and do not allow the comparison of the intraregional variability present among countries or forest types. Here, we present the results obtained from a systematic review of 369 articles (published from 1990 to 2014) about deforestation rates for 17 countries and forest types (tropical lowland, tropical montane, tropical and subtropical dry, subtropical temperate and mixed, and Atlantic forests). Drivers identified as direct or indirect causes of deforestation in the literature were also analysed. With an overall annual deforestation rate of -1.14 (+/- 0.092 SE) in the region, we compared the rates per forest type and country. The results indicate that there is a high variability of forest loss rates among countries and forest types. In general, Chile and Argentina presented the highest deforestation rates (-3.28 and -2.31 yearly average, respectively), followed by Ecuador and Paraguay (-2.19 and -1.89 yearly average, respectively). Atlantic forests (-1.62) and tropical montane forests (-1.55) presented the highest deforestation rates for the region. In particular, tropical lowland forests in Ecuador (-2.42) and tropical dry forests in Mexico (-2.88) and Argentina (-2.20) were the most affected. In most countries, the access to markets and agricultural and forest activities are the main causes of deforestation; however, the causes vary according to the forest types. Deforestation measurements focused at different scales and on different forest types will help governments to improve their reports for international initiatives, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) but, more importantly, for developing local policies for the sustainable management of forests and for reducing the deforestation in Latin America.

AB Adaptation to local conditions is a fundamental process in evolution; however, mechanisms maintaining local adaptation despite high gene flow are still poorly understood. Marine ecosystems provide a wide array of diverse habitats that frequently promote ecological adaptation even in species characterized by strong levels of gene flow. As one example, populations of the marine fish Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua) are highly connected due to immense dispersal capabilities but nevertheless show local adaptation in several key traits. By combining population genomic analyses based on 12K single nucleotide polymorphisms with larval dispersal patterns inferred using a biophysical ocean model, we show that Atlantic cod individuals residing in sheltered estuarine habitats of Scandinavian fjords mainly belong to offshore oceanic populations with considerable connectivity between these diverse ecosystems. Nevertheless, we also find evidence for discrete fjord populations that are genetically differentiated from offshore populations, indicative of local adaptation, the degree of which appears to be influenced by connectivity. Analyses of the genomic architecture reveal a significant overrepresentation of a large similar to 5 Mb chromosomal rearrangement in fjord cod, previously proposed to comprise genes critical for the survival at low salinities. This suggests that despite considerable connectivity with offshore populations, local adaptation to fjord environments may be enabled by suppression of recombination in the rearranged region. Our study provides new insights into the potential of local adaptation in high gene flow species within fine geographical scales and highlights the importance of genome architecture in analyses of ecological adaptation.

AB Social networks are frequently cited as vital for facilitating successful adaptation and transformation in linked social-ecological systems to overcome pressing resource management challenges. Yet confusion remains over the precise nature of adaptation vs. transformation and the specific social network structures that facilitate these processes. Here, we adopt a network perspective to theorize a continuum of structural capacities in social-ecological systems that set the stage for effective adaptation and transformation. We begin by drawing on the resilience literature and the multilayered action situation to link processes of change in social-ecological systems to decision making across multiple layers of rules underpinning societal organization. We then present a framework that hypothesizes seven specific social-ecological network configurations that lay the structural foundation necessary for facilitating adaptation and transformation, given the type and magnitude of human action required. A key contribution of the framework is explicit consideration of how social networks relate to ecological structures and the particular environmental problem at hand. Of the seven configurations identified, three are linked to capacities conducive to adaptation and three to transformation, and one is hypothesized to be important for facilitating both processes. We discuss how our theoretical framework can be applied in practice by highlighting existing empirical examples from related environmental governance contexts. Further extension of our hypotheses, particularly as more data become available, can ultimately help guide the design of institutional arrangements to be more effective at dealing with change.

AB Soil microorganisms play an essential role in soil ecosystem processes such as organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant nutrient availability. The land use for greenhouse cultivation has been increasing continuously, which involves an intensive input of agricultural materials to enhance productivity; however, relatively little is known about bacterial communities in greenhouse soils. To assess the effects of environmental factors on the soil bacterial diversity and community composition, a total of 187 greenhouse soil samples collected across Korea were subjected to bacterial 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis. A total of 11,865 operational taxonomic units at a 97% similarity cutoff level were detected from 847,560 sequences. Among nine soil factors evaluated; pH, electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+), available P2O5, organic matter, and NO3-N, soil pH was most strongly correlated with bacterial richness (polynomial regression, pH: R-2 = 0.1683, P < 0.001) and diversity (pH: R-2 = 0.1765, P < 0.001). Community dissimilarities (Bray-Curtis distance) were positively correlated with Euclidean distance for pH and EC (Mantel test, pH: r = 0.2672, P < 0.001; EC: r = 0.1473, P < 0.001). Among dominant phyla (> 1%), the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes were also more strongly correlated with pH and EC values, compared with other soil cation contents, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+. Our results suggest that, despite the heterogeneity of various environmental variables, the bacterial communities of the intensively cultivated greenhouse soils were particularly influenced by soil pH and EC. These findings therefore shed light on the soil microbial ecology of greenhouse cultivation, which should be helpful for devising effective management strategies to enhance soil microbial diversity and improving crop productivity.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is known to relate directly to leaf and canopy scale photosynthesis. Retrieving SIF from space can thus provide an indication on the temporal and spatial patterns of the terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Recent studies have successfully demonstrated the serendipitous retrieval of SIF from satellite remote sensing instruments originally destined to atmospheric studies. However, the finest spatial resolution achieved by these products is 0.5 degrees, which remains too coarse for many applications, including the early detection of drought impacts on vegetation and the integration with ground GPP measurements from flux towers. This paper proposes a methodology to spatially disaggregate the information contained within each coarse SIF pixels by using a non-linear model based on the concept of light use efficiency (LUE). The strategy involves the aggregation of high-resolution (0.05 degrees) remote sensing biophysical variables to calibrate the downscaling model locally and independently at each time step, which can then be applied to non-aggregated data to create a new layer, denoted SIF*, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. A global SIF* dataset is generated by applying this methodology globally to 7 years of monthly GOME-2 SIF data. SIP is shown to be a better proxy for GPP than the original coarse spatial resolution product according to flux-tower eddy covariance measurements. Its performance is comparable to dedicated GPP products despite that (unlike SIF*) these are calibrated based on the same flux towers, driven by meteorological data and not hampered by the large noise caused by the SIF retrieval. To further illustrate the added-value of the global SIF* product, this paper also presents: (1) an ecosystem level assessment showing a considerable reduction of noise with respect to the original SIF; (2) a spatio-temporal inter comparison with existing GPP products; and (3) estimations of global terrestrial productivity per selected vegetation types based on SIF*.

AB The attine ant-fungus agricultural symbiosis evolved over tens of millions of years, producing complex societies with industrial-scale farming analogous to that of humans. Here we document reciprocal shifts in the genomes and transcriptomes of seven fungus-farming ant species and their fungal cultivars. We show that ant subsistence farming probably originated in the early Tertiary (55-60 MYA), followed by further transitions to the farming of fully domesticated cultivars and leaf-cutting, both arising earlier than previously estimated. Evolutionary modifications in the ants include unprecedented rates of genome-wide structural rearrangement, early loss of arginine biosynthesis and positive selection on chitinase pathways. Modifications of fungal cultivars include loss of a key ligninase domain, changes in chitin synthesis and a reduction in carbohydrate-degrading enzymes as the ants gradually transitioned to functional herbivory. In contrast to human farming, increasing dependence on a single cultivar lineage appears to have been essential to the origin of industrial-scale ant agriculture.

AB Host population density is positively associated with the strength of social interactions or the frequency of physical contacts, and thus potentially influences microbial transmission among individuals. However, the relationship between host density and gut microbiota remains unknown. Here, we characterized the gut microbiota of plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) in wild experimental fields with different host population densities. The abundance of some gut microbes significantly correlated with host density, such as Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Staphylococcaceae. Intriguingly, host density was positively correlated with alpha diversity (Shannon diversity and observed species) of gut microbial communities. The inter-individual gut microbiota within high-density groups were more similar to each other than those of low-density groups. Host density significantly explained the variations in the gut microbiota, even after controlling sex, weight, diet and geographical locations. Based on the PICRUSt metagenome prediction, positive correlations were observed between host density and the relative abundances of 12 gene functions involved in cellular processes, environmental information processing and metabolism. These results indicate the importance of host density as a factor in shaping gut microbial composition and diversity in plateau pikas, and may further help us understand the social transmission of gut microbiota.

AB Surveys of bumble bees and the plants they visit, carried out in 1974 near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado, were repeated in 2007, thus permitting the testing of hypotheses arising from observed climate change over the intervening 33-yr period. As expected, given an increase in average air temperature with climate warming and a declining temperature with increasing elevation, there have been significant shifts toward higher elevation for queens or workers or both, for most bumble bee species, for bumble bee queens when species are combined, and for two focal plant species, with no significant downward shifts. However, contrary to our hypotheses, we failed to observe significant altitudinal changes for some bumble bee species and most plant species, and observed changes in elevation were often less than the upward shift of 317m required to maintain average temperature. As expected, community flowering phenology shifted toward earlier in the season throughout our study area, but bumble bee phenology generally did not change, resulting in decreased synchrony between bees and plants. However, we were unable to confirm the narrower expectation that phenologies of bumble bee workers and community flowering coincided in 1974 but not in 2007. As expected, because of reduced synchrony between bumble bees and community flowering, bumble bee abundance was reduced in 2007 compared with 1974. Hence, climate change in our study area has apparently resulted primarily in reduced abundance and upward shift in distribution for bumble bees and shift toward earlier seasonality for plant flowering. Quantitative disagreements between climate change expectations and our observations warrant further investigation.

AB Context The variation in spatial distribution between ecosystem services can be high. Hence, there is a need to spatially identify important sites for conservation planning. The term 'ecosystem service hotspot' has often been used for this purpose, but definitions of this term are ambiguous.
   Objectives We review and classify methods to spatially delineate hotspots. We test how spatial configuration of hotspots for a set of ecosystem services differs depending on the applied method. We compare the outcomes to a heuristic site prioritisation approach (Marxan).
   Methods The four tested hotspot methods are top richest cells, spatial clustering, intensity, and richness. In a conservation scenario we set a target of conserving 10 % of the quantity of five regulating and cultural services for the forest area of Telemark county, Norway.
   Results Spatial configuration of selected areas as retrieved by the four hotspots and Marxan differed considerably. Pairwise comparisons were at the lower end of the scale of the Kappa statistic (0.11-0.27). The outcomes also differed considerably in mean target achievement, cost-effectiveness in terms of land-area needed per unit target achievement and compactness in terms of edge-to-area ratio.
   Conclusions An ecosystem service hotspot can refer to either areas containing high values of one service or areas with multiple services. Differences in spatial configuration among hotspot methods can lead to uncertainties for decision-making. This also has consequences for analysing the spatial co-occurrence of hotspots of multiple services and of services and biodiversity.

AB This review paper integrates the current knowledge, based on available literature, on the physical and biological conditions of the Amerasian and Eurasian basins (AB, EB) of the deep Arctic Ocean (AO) in a comparative fashion. The present day (Holocene) AO is a mediterranean sea that is roughly half continental shelf and half basin and ridge complex. Even more recently it is roughly two thirds seasonally and one third perennially ice-covered, thus now exposing a portion of basin waters to sunlight and wind. Basin boundaries and submarine ridges steer circulation pathways in overlying waters and limit free exchange in deeper waters. The AO is made integral to the global ocean by the Northern Hemisphere Thermohaline Circulation (NHTC) which drives Pacific-origin water (PW) through Bering Strait into the Canada Basin, and counter-flowing Atlantic-origin water (AW) through Fram Strait and across the Barents Sea into the Nansen Basin. As a framework for biogeography within the AO, four basic, large-scale circulation systems (with L > 1000 km) are noted; these are: (1) the large scale wind-driven circulation which forces the cyclonic Trans-Polar Drift from Siberia to the Fram Strait and the anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre in the southern Canada Basin; (2) the circulation of waters that comprise the halocline complex, composed largely of waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that are modified during passage over the Bering/Chukchi and Barents/Siberian shelves, respectively; (3) the topographically-trapped Arctic Circumpolar Boundary Current (ACBC) which carries AW cyclonically around the boundaries of the entire suite of basins, and (4) the very slow exchange of Arctic Ocean Deep Waters. Within the basin domain two basic water mass assemblies are observed, the difference between them being the absence or presence of PW sandwiched between Arctic Surface Waters (ASW) above and the AW complex below; the boundary between these domains is the Atlantic/Pacific halocline front. Both domains have vertical stratification that constrains the transfer of nutrients to the surface layer (euphoric zone), thus leading to their oligotrophic state, particularly in the more strongly stratified Pacific Arctic where, despite high nutrient values in the inflow, convective reset of surface layer nutrients by haline convection in winter is virtually absent. First and multi-year sea ice drastically alters albedo and insulates the underlying water column from extreme winter heat loss while its mechanical properties (thickness, concentration, roughness, etc.) greatly affect the efficiency of momentum transfer from the wind to the underlying water. Biologically, sea ice algal growth in the basins is proportionally almost equal to or exceeding phytoplankton production, and is a habitat and transport platform for sympagic (ice-associated) fauna. Owing to nutrient limitation due to strong stratification and light limitation due to snow and ice cover and extreme sun angle, primary production in the two basin domains is very low compared to the adjacent shelves. Severe nutrient limitation and complete euphotic zone drawdown in the AB favors small phytoplankton, a ubiquitous deep chlorophyll maximum layer, a low f-ratio of new to recycled carbon fixation, and a low energy food web. In contrast, nutrients persist -albeit in low levels- in the western EB, even in summer, suggesting light limitation, heavy grazing or both. The higher stocks of nutrients in the EB are more conducive to marginal ice blooms than in the AB.
   The large-scale ocean currents (NHTC and ACBC) import substantial expatriate, not locally reproducing zooplankton biomass especially from the adjoining subarctic Atlantic (primarily Calanus finmarchicus), but also from the Pacific (e.g., Pseudocalanus spp., Neocalanus spp. and Metridia pacifica). These advective inputs serve both as source of food to resident pelagic and benthic biota within the basins, and
   [GRAPHICS]
   as potential grazers exerting top down control on limited phytoplankton resources. Benthic organisms within the AO basin show previously unappreciated biodiversity and surprising dispersion of species given the isolation of individual basins and low vertical carbon flux and resulting biomass. Larval dispersion is aided by the large-scale flows and perhaps, we hypothesize in the deep benthos by convective updrafts driven by geothermal heating. Zooplankton diversity, in contrast, is low, but again faunal assemblages are equally distributed between the EB and AB. Species pools of both pelagic and benthic communities change more with water depth rather than laterally, with the exception of expatriates and rare species, with close ties to today's North Atlantic biogeographic region. Climate related change in the AO is thus manifest at significantly differing time scales. Throughout similar to 90% of the Pleistocene the AO has existed in glacial mode, with narrow continental shelves, greatly restricted river inflow, thicker and perhaps immobile sea ice, and total blockage of exchange with the Pacific Ocean. During the Holocene, on shorter time scales of 1000-100 years, significant changes in high latitude climate are tied to changes in temperature and perhaps moisture delivery patterns. The Arctic also experiences significant multi-decadal variability; however, the pace of change over the past three decades has been without precedent. Within the basin interior the ice is now thinner and less compact, and thus more responsive to wind stress (forcing and mixing). Concurrent with sea ice melt and increased river flow, the accumulation of fresh water and the stratification have increased, thus constraining vertical nutrient flux affecting phytoplankton size distributions, limiting primary production in parts of the basins now and likely in the future, and increasing vulnerability to acidification. In addition, sea ice is now retreating on an annual basis past the shelf break, exposing basin waters directly to sunlight and wind forcing. Thus, upwelling favorable winds (generally from east to west) can now directly and efficiently drive shelf-break upwelling, and draw nutrients from subsurface basin waters onto the shelf; at the same time upwelling favorable winds will also create onshore pressure gradients over the slope and basin which will act to slow or block the flow of waters in the ACBC, and thus alter advective pathways of both abiotic and biotic materials. Given the opening of a new ocean to multiple user groups, we expect that the central AO will play an increasing larger role both in the research and political arenas in the future, and we encourage pan-Arctic international collaboration over focus on territorial boundaries.

AB Background: Some yeasts have evolved a methylotrophic lifestyle enabling them to utilize the single carbon compound methanol as a carbon and energy source. Among them, Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella sp.) is frequently used for the production of heterologous proteins and also serves as a model organism for organelle research. Our current knowledge of methylotrophic lifestyle mainly derives from sophisticated biochemical studies which identified many key methanol utilization enzymes such as alcohol oxidase and dihydroxyacetone synthase and their localization to the peroxisomes. C1 assimilation is supposed to involve the pentose phosphate pathway, but details of these reactions are not known to date.
   Results: In this work we analyzed the regulation patterns of 5,354 genes, 575 proteins, 141 metabolites, and fluxes through 39 reactions of P. pastoris comparing growth on glucose and on a methanol/glycerol mixed medium, respectively. Contrary to previous assumptions, we found that the entire methanol assimilation pathway is localized to peroxisomes rather than employing part of the cytosolic pentose phosphate pathway for xylulose-5-phosphate regeneration. For this purpose, P. pastoris (and presumably also other methylotrophic yeasts) have evolved a duplicated methanol inducible enzyme set targeted to peroxisomes. This compartmentalized cyclic C1 assimilation process termed xylose-monophosphate cycle resembles the principle of the Calvin cycle and uses sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate as intermediate. The strong induction of alcohol oxidase, dihydroxyacetone synthase, formaldehyde and formate dehydrogenase, and catalase leads to high demand of their cofactors riboflavin, thiamine, nicotinamide, and heme, respectively, which is reflected in strong up-regulation of the respective synthesis pathways on methanol. Methanol-grown cells have a higher protein but lower free amino acid content, which can be attributed to the high drain towards methanol metabolic enzymes and their cofactors. In context with up-regulation of many amino acid biosynthesis genes or proteins, this visualizes an increased flux towards amino acid and protein synthesis which is reflected also in increased levels of transcripts and/or proteins related to ribosome biogenesis and translation.
   Conclusions: Taken together, our work illustrates how concerted interpretation of multiple levels of systems biology data can contribute to elucidation of yet unknown cellular pathways and revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology.

AB Although there is mounting evidence that biodiversity is an important and widespread driver of ecosystem multifunctionality, much of this research has focused on small-scale biodiversity manipulations. Hence, which mechanisms maintain patches of enhanced biodiversity in natural systems and if these patches elevate ecosystem multifunctionality at both local and landscape scales remain outstanding questions. In a 17 month experiment conducted within southeastern United States salt marshes, we found that patches of enhanced biodiversity and multifunctionality arise only where habitat-forming foundation species overlap-i.e. where aggregations of ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) form around cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) stems. By empirically scaling up our experimental results to the marsh platform at 12 sites, we further show that mussels-despite covering only approximately 1% of the marsh surface-strongly enhance five distinct ecosystem functions, including decomposition, primary production and water infiltration rate, at the landscape scale. Thus, mussels create conditions that support the co-occurrence of high densities of functionally distinct organisms within cordgrass and, in doing so, elevate salt marsh multifunctionality from the patch to landscape scale. Collectively, these findings suggest that patterns in foundation species' overlap drive variation in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning within and across natural ecosystems. We therefore argue that foundation species should be integrated in our conceptual understanding of forces that moderate biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, approaches for conserving species diversity and strategies to improve the multifunctionality of degraded ecosystems.

AB Tropical rainforest hyperdiversity is often suggested to have evolved over a long time-span (the museum' model), but there is also evidence for recent rainforest radiations. The mahoganies (Meliaceae) are a prominent plant group in lowland tropical rainforests world-wide but also occur in all other tropical ecosystems. We investigated whether rainforest diversity in Meliaceae has accumulated over a long time or has more recently evolved. We inferred the largest time-calibrated phylogeny for the family to date, reconstructed ancestral states for habitat and deciduousness, estimated diversification rates and modeled potential shifts in macro-evolutionary processes using a recently developed Bayesian method. The ancestral Meliaceae is reconstructed as a deciduous species that inhabited seasonal habitats. Rainforest clades have diversified from the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene onwards. Two contemporaneous Amazonian clades have converged on similar ecologies and high speciation rates. Most species-level diversity of Meliaceae in rainforest is recent. Other studies have found steady accumulation of lineages, but the large majority of plant species diversity in rainforests is recent, suggesting (episodic) species turnover. Rainforest hyperdiversity may best be explained by recent radiations from a large stock of higher level taxa.

AB Background: Small-scale topographic complexity is a characteristic feature of alpine landscapes, with important effects on alpine plant distribution.
   Aims: We investigated the links between small-scale topographic complexity and resultant microclimatic heterogeneity, vascular-plant species richness and beta diversity, and realised niche width and trait variation of some target species.
   Methods: We recorded temperature and soil moisture within 10 sites (40mx40m) of differing topographic complexity in alpine terrain at Finse, Norway (N 60 degrees 36MODIFIER LETTER PRIME, E 7 degrees 33MODIFIER LETTER PRIME). Plant species occurrence and traits of target species were recorded in 16 sample plots at each site.
   Results: Sites differed significantly in microclimatic heterogeneity, and topographically rough sites were always more heterogeneous than flatter ones. Greater species richness and turnover was associated with greater microclimatic heterogeneity, and rough sites contained 15-55% more species than flatter ones. Plant species had on average wider realised niches when growing at rough sites. Individuals of Bistorta vivipara, but not those of Luzula spicata, tended to exhibit greater phenotypic variation at rough sites.
   Conclusions: Rough alpine terrains create small-scale variation in microclimate, promoting species richness and beta diversity. In the event of climate change, small-scale microclimatic heterogeneity might allow plant species to escape from regional climate change by short-distance migration to local micro-refugia. This study suggests that the opportunity for such responses would be greater in topographically complex terrains.

AB Global plant trait studies have revealed fundamental trade-offs in plant resource economics. We evaluated such trait trade-offs during secondary succession in two species-rich tropical ecosystems that contrast in precipitation: dry deciduous and wet evergreen forests of Mexico. Species turnover with succession in dry forest largely relates to increasing water availability and in wet forest to decreasing light availability. We hypothesized that while functional trait trade-offs are similar in the two forest systems, the successful plant strategies in these communities will be different, as contrasting filters affect species turnover. Research was carried out in 15 dry secondary forest sites (5-63 years after abandonment) and in 17 wet secondary forest sites (<1-25 years after abandonment). We used 11 functional traits measured on 132 species to make species-trait PCA biplots for dry and wet forest and compare trait trade-offs. We evaluated whether multivariate plant strategies changed during succession, by calculating a 'Community-Weighted Mean' plant strategy, based on species scores on the first two PCA-axes. Trait spectra reflected two main trade-off axes that were similar for dry and wet forest species: acquisitive versus conservative species, and drought avoiding species versus evergreen species with large animal-dispersed seeds. These trait associations were consistent when accounting for evolutionary history. Successional changes in the most successful plant strategies reflected different functional trait spectra depending on the forest type. In dry forest the community changed from having drought avoiding strategies early in succession to increased abundance of evergreen strategies with larger seeds late in succession. In wet forest the community changed from species having mainly acquisitive strategies to those with more conservative strategies during succession. These strategy changes were explained by increasing water availability during dry forest succession and increasing light scarcity during wet forest succession. Although similar trait spectra were observed among dry and wet secondary forest species, the consequences for succession were different resulting from contrasting environmental filters.

AB Despite continued discussion about market distortions and environmental impacts, agricultural subsidies continue to be a key component of European Union policy. About 10% of the agro-forestry subsidies are targeted at supporting agri-environment schemes, and at supporting farming in Less Favoured Areas (LFA) such as mountain regions. One of the main justifications for these agri-environmental subsidies towards marginally productive land is that they promote the conservation of biodiversity by maintaining low-intensity farming practices. Here, we critically examine this assumption and argue instead for a two-tier approach to Europe's agri-environmental policy based on inherent land fertility and spatial scale: (i) at a local, single-farm scale, fertile agricultural land should preferentially be intensively but sustainably farmed with a focus on high yields, (ii) while simultaneously and at larger, regional scales, less-productive land, and especially protected areas, may be ecologically restored into 'wild' and resiliently functioning ecosystems. As such, agri-environmental subsidies towards fertile land should support the implementation of measures that benefit biodiversity while allowing, and even helping, the achievement of high agricultural yields. In contrast, agri-environmental and LFA subsidies towards marginal land and protected areas should also promote rewilding and the management of natural succession. In order for this approach to be successful, a higher proportion of the Common Agricultural Policy subsidies would need to be allocated to environmental goals.

AB Under projections of global climate change and other stressors, significant changes in the ecology, structure and function of coral reefs are predicted. Current management strategies tend to look to the past to set goals, focusing on halting declines and restoring baseline conditions. Here, we explore a complementary approach to decision making that is based on the anticipation of future changes in ecosystem state, function and services. Reviewing the existing literature and utilizing a scenario planning approach, we explore how the structure of coral reef communities might change in the future in response to global climate change and overfishing. We incorporate uncertainties in our predictions by considering heterogeneity in reef types in relation to structural complexity and primary productivity. We examine 14 ecosystem services provided by reefs, and rate their sensitivity to a range of future scenarios and management options. Our predictions suggest that the efficacy of management is highly dependent on biophysical characteristics and reef state. Reserves are currently widely used and are predicted to remain effective for reefs with high structural complexity. However, when complexity is lost, maximizing service provision requires a broader portfolio of management approaches, including the provision of artificial complexity, coral restoration, fish aggregation devices and herbivore management. Increased use of such management tools will require capacity building and technique refinement and we therefore conclude that diversification of our management toolbox should be considered urgently to prepare for the challenges of managing reefs into the 21st century.

AB Movement is influenced by landscape structure, configuration and geometry, but measuring distance as perceived by animals poses technical and logistical challenges. Instead, movement is typically measured using Euclidean distance, irrespective of location or landscape structure, or is based on arbitrary cost surfaces. A recently proposed extension of spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models resolves this issue using spatial encounter histories of individuals to calculate least-cost paths (ecological distance: Ecology, 94, 2013, 287) thereby relaxing the Euclidean assumption. We evaluate the consequences of not accounting for movement heterogeneity when estimating abundance in highly structured landscapes, and demonstrate the value of this approach for estimating biologically realistic space-use patterns and landscape connectivity. We simulated SCR data in a riparian habitat network, using the ecological distance model under a range of scenarios where space-use in and around the landscape was increasingly associated with water (i.e. increasingly less Euclidean). To assess the influence of miscalculating distance on estimates of population size, we compared the results from the ecological and Euclidean distance based models. We then demonstrate that the ecological distance model can be used to estimate home range geometry when space use is not symmetrical. Finally, we provide a method for calculating landscape connectivity based on modelled species-landscape interactions generated from capture-recapture data. Using ecological distance always produced unbiased estimates of abundance. Explicitly modelling the strength of the species-landscape interaction provided a direct measure of landscape connectivity and better characterised true home range geometry. Abundance under the Euclidean distance model was increasingly (negatively) biased as space use was more strongly associated with water and, because home ranges are assumed to be symmetrical, produced poor characterisations of home range geometry and no information about landscape connectivity. The ecological distance SCR model uses spatially indexed capture-recapture data to estimate how activity patterns are influenced by landscape structure. As well as reducing bias in estimates of abundance, this approach provides biologically realistic representations of home range geometry, and direct information about species-landscape interactions. The incorporation of both structural (landscape) and functional (movement) components of connectivity provides a direct measure of species-specific landscape connectivity.

AB The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has become widely used because it bridges ecology and economics and links nature to society. ES may evolve over time in dynamic landscapes driven by myriad processes. However, the consequences of changes in key ES has not been considered adequately in current ES research. Here we propose a framework for linking ES with landscape history, which can help us better understand the evolution of ES over time. We illustrate the framework by a case study from Switzerland. Both the capacity of landscapes to supply ES and the realization and recognition of key ES are likely to change over time. This insight should have important implications for landscape sustainability and related scenario studies.

AB As the most widely distributed freshwater fish worldwide, common carp Cyprinus carpio can be either invasive or "naturalized" in most areas of introduction. This leads to different levels of perception regarding the species' role in freshwater ecosystems, with experimental research focusing either on its "middle-out" impacts or overall function in limnological processes. At the same time, the large scales at which carp dynamics operate may severely limit the validity of laboratory and, oftentimes, field experiments in extrapolating results to real-world ecosystems. In this study, 129 laboratory, field, and "natural" experiments were systematically reviewed through causal criteria analysis, and within an historical/biogeographical and risk-assessment context. Of the 19 countries where experiments were conducted, only 4 were considered as "low risk" and one as "no risk," the other being "medium" to "high risk." Experimental findings from 373 component-wise assessments supported the framework of effects on water quality, vegetation, invertebrates, and vertebrates, with the latter including also amphibians and waterfowl, previously unreported. Stronger evidence was provided by natural and field relative to laboratory experiments, reflecting the reductionism of the latter. Critical biomass for an impact was highly dependent on experimental setup, even though the overall threshold of approximate to 200 kg ha(-1) under natural conditions supported recent findings. Management of carp should reflect the level of current and potential risk posed by the species in its different areas of distribution, thereby accounting for projections of further spread but also for unsuccessful colonization. Future experimentation should favor a holistic -> reductionist over a reductionist -> holistic approach.

AB Contaminated land remediation has traditionally been viewed as sustainable practice because it reduces urban sprawl and mitigates risks to human being and the environment. However, in an emerging green and sustainable remediation (GSR) movement, remediation practitioners have increasingly recognized that remediation operations have their own environmental footprint. The GSR calls for sustainable behaviour in the remediation industry, for which a series of white papers and guidance documents have been published by various government agencies and professional organizations. However, the relationship between the adoption of such sustainable behaviour and its underlying driving forces has not been studied. This study aims to contribute to sustainability science by rendering a better understanding of what drives organizational behaviour in adopting sustainable practices. Factor analysis (FA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to investigate the relationship between sustainable practices and key factors driving these behaviour changes in the remediation field. A conceptual model on sustainability in the environmental remediation industry was developed on the basis of stakeholder and institutional theories. The FA classified sustainability considerations, institutional promoting and impeding forces, and stakeholder's influence. Subsequently the SEM showed that institutional promoting forces had significant positive effects on adopting sustainability measures, and institutional impeding forces had significant negative effects. Stakeholder influences were found to have only marginal direct effect on the adoption of sustainability; however, they exert significant influence on institutional promoting forces, thus rendering high total effect (i.e. direct effect plus indirect effect) on the adoption of sustainability. This study suggests that sustainable remediation represents an advanced sustainable practice, which may only be fully endorsed by both internal and external stakeholders after its regulatory, normative and cognitive components are institutionalized.

AB 1. Network analysis is a useful approach for investigating complex and relational data in many fields including ecology, molecular and evolutionary biology. Here, we introduce enaR , an r package for Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA). ENA is an analytical tool set rooted in ecosystem ecology with over 30 years of development that examines the structure and dynamics of matter and energy movement between discrete ecological compartments (e.g. a food web). In addition to describing the primary functionality of the package, we highlight several features including a library of 100 empirical ecosystem models, the ability to analyse and compare multiple models simultaneously, and connections to other ecological network analysis tools in R.

AB A fundamental hypothesis for the evolution and maintenance of ornamental traits is that ornaments convey information to choosing females about the quality of prospective mates. A diverse array of ornaments (e. g., colors, morphological features, and behaviors) has been associated with a wide range of measures of individual quality, but decades of study of such indicator traits have failed to produce general mechanisms of honest signaling. Here, I propose that efficiency of cellular respiration, as a product of mitochondrial function, underlies the associations between ornamentation and performance for a broad range of traits across taxa. A large biomedical literature documents the fundamental biochemical links between oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the process of metabolism, the function of the immune system, the synthesis of proteins, and the development and function of the nervous system. The production of virtually all ornaments whose expressions have been demonstrated to be condition-dependent is directly affected by the efficiency of cellular respiration, suggesting that the signaling of respiratory efficiency may be the primary function of such traits. Furthermore, the production of ornaments links to stress-response systems, including particularly the neuroendocrine system, through mitochondrial function, thereby makes ornamental traits effective signals of the capacity to withstand environmental perturbations. The identification of a unifying mechanism of honest signaling holds the potential to connect many heretofore-disparate fields of study related to stress and ornamentation, including neuroendocrinology, respiratory physiology, metabolic physiology, and immunology.

AB Urban green areas improve the standard of living in cities and affect people's attitude to nature and conservation. Zoological knowledge may provide data that will help designers to enhance bird diversity in gardens. We studied the effect of plant species richness and structure on bird species-richness, diversity and community structure in 25 public gardens in Tel-Aviv city and, neighboring suburbs, Israel. A total of 65 bird species were observed, of which nine were urban, exploiters or alien species. These latter species composed 54% of all individuals seen. Additional 13 bird species, mostly migrants, were observed in gardens further from the observation fixed radius. We found that shrubs species richness positively affected bird species diversity. Most bird species were found where trees and shrubs species richness was high, and trees and lawn cover were medium or low. High trees or high lawn cover attracted only a few bird species, mostly aliens and urban exploiters. Native birds preferred to forage on native trees and alien birds preferred to feed on alien trees. Bird species diversity was higher during spring and fall because of the presence of migrating bird species. Dogs and people had a negative effect on bird presence. Accordingly, we recommend that when planning new gardens, designers will avoid large lawns, prefer diverse and dense shrubberies, native trees, and will create some areas that will not be accessible to dogs and people. Finally, we emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary studies conducted in collaboration between landscape designers and zoologists. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Animals select habitat resources at multiple spatial scales. Thus, explicit attention to scale dependency in species-habitat relationships is critical to understand the habitat suitability patterns as perceived by organisms in complex landscapes. Identification of the scales at which particular environmental variables influence habitat selection may be as important as the selection of variables themselves. In this study, we combined bivariate scaling and Maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling to investigate multiscale habitat selection of endangered brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations in northwest Spain. Bivariate scaling showed that the strength of apparent habitat relationships was highly sensitive to the scale at which predictor variables are evaluated. Maxent models on the optimal scale for each variable suggested that landscape composition together with human disturbances was dominant drivers of bear habitat selection, while habitat configuration and edge effects were substantially less influential. We found that explicitly optimizing the scale of habitat suitability models considerably improved single-scale modeling in terms of model performance and spatial prediction. We found that patterns of brown bear habitat suitability represent the cumulative influence of habitat selection across a broad range of scales, from local resources within habitat patches to the landscape composition at broader spatial scales.

AB Plant invasions represent a threat not only to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning but also to the character of traditional landscapes. Despite the worldwide efforts to control and eradicate invasive species, their menace grows. New techniques enabling fast and precise monitoring and providing information on spatial structure of invasions are needed for efficient management strategies to be implemented. We present remote sensing assessment of a noxious invasive species Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) that integrates different data sources, spatial and spectral resolutions, and image processing techniques. Panchromatic, multispectral and color very high spatial resolution (VHR) aerial photography (1947-2006, resolution 0.5 m), and medium spatial resolution satellite data (Rapid Eye 2010, resolution 5 m) were analyzed to assess their potential for hogweed monitoring by using pixel- (both supervised and unsupervised) and object-based image analysis (OBIA, automated hierarchical, iterative, and rule-based). Both point and grid based accuracy assessment was carried out. Described methods of object-based image analysis of VHR data enabled monitoring of hogweed at high classification accuracies measured by various means, regardless of the spectral resolution of the data provided that the data came from the species flowering period. Although the proposed automated processing of VHR data is relatively time-effective and standardized, application over large areas would be rather demanding due to the size of datasets, and multispectral satellite data of medium spatial resolution (lower than the size of individuals) was therefore tested. On such imagery, only larger stands could be identified but still the pixel-based supervised classification achieved moderate accuracy. Depending on the size of the area of interest and the detail needed the very high or medium spatial resolution data (acquired at the species flowering period) are to be used. High accuracies achieved for VHR data indicate the possible application of described methodology for monitoring invasions and their long-term dynamics elsewhere, making management measures comparable precise, fast and efficient.

AB Carry-over effects relate to events or processes that influence individual performance in a subsequent season, but their occurrence in the annual cycle of migratory avian taxa is seldom studied. We investigated if different levels of resource allocation to reproduction may result in carry-over effects that change the timing and destination of long-distance migration. We reduced the parental investment of Cory's Shearwaters Calonectris diomedea by removing their chick at an early stage. When compared to individuals with greater parental investment (controls that raised chicks to close to fledging), manipulated birds started most stages of migration sooner and returned to the colony earlier at the start of the following breeding season. Late arrival in the subsequent nesting season increased the probability of skipping a breeding year. Manipulated males were less likely to engage in long-distance migration, which supports the idea that partial migration is condition dependent. Our study demonstrates experimentally that energetic or time-dependent costs of reproduction may have an enduring impact on migration schedule and on nonbreeding geographical distribution of long-distance migrants, which may also influence the ability to breed in the following season.

AB Instances of parallel ecotypic divergence where adaptation to similar conditions repeatedly cause similar phenotypic changes in closely related organisms are useful for studying the role of ecological selection in speciation. Here we used a combination of traditional and next generation genotyping techniques to test for the parallel divergence of plants from the Senecio lautus complex, a phenotypically variable groundsel that has adapted to disparate environments in the South Pacific. Phylogenetic analysis of a broad selection of Senecio species showed that members of the S.lautus complex form a distinct lineage that has diversified recently in Australasia. An inspection of thousands of polymorphisms in the genome of 27 natural populations from the S.lautus complex in Australia revealed a signal of strong genetic structure independent of habitat and phenotype. Additionally, genetic differentiation between populations was correlated with the geographical distance separating them, and the genetic diversity of populations strongly depended on geographical location. Importantly, coastal forms appeared in several independent phylogenetic clades, a pattern that is consistent with the parallel evolution of these forms. Analyses of the patterns of genomic differentiation between populations further revealed that adjacent populations displayed greater genomic heterogeneity than allopatric populations and are differentiated according to variation in soil composition. These results are consistent with a process of parallel ecotypic divergence in face of gene flow.

AB Many animals use olfaction to find food and avoid predators, and must negotiate environments containing odors of varying compositions, strengths, and ages to distinguish useful cues from background noise. Temporal variation in odor cues (i.e., "freshness") seems an obvious way that animals could distinguish cues, yet there is little experimental evidence for this phenomenon. Fresh cues provide a more reliable indicator of donor presence than aged cues, but we hypothesize that the benefits of responding to aged cues depend on whether the cue indicates the proximity of a predator or a potential meal. As prey cannot remain eternally risk averse in response to predator odor, we predict that antipredator responses should diminish as predator cues age. In contrast, animals searching for food should investigate aged prey cues if investigation costs are sufficiently low and the potential benefit (a meal) sufficiently high; thus, we predict that predators will maintain interest in aged prey cues. We tested these ideas using free-ranging rats (Rattus spp.) in two separate experiments; firstly assessing giving-up densities in the presence of predator odor, and secondly examining investigation rates of prey odors. As predicted, giving-up densities dropped once predator odor had aged, but investigation rates remained similar for aged and fresh prey odor. Thus, rats used temporal variation in odor cues to evaluate the cost-benefit relationship of responding to predator and prey odors. We suggest that the ecological significance of variable cue age needs more research and should be considered when interpreting behavioral responses to olfactory information.

AB Changes in snow cover depth and duration predicted by climate change scenarios are expected to strongly affect high-altitude ecosystem processes. This study investigates the effect of an exceptionally short snow season on the phenology and carbon dioxide source/sink strength of a subalpine grassland. An earlier snowmelt of more than one month caused a considerable advancement (40 days) of the beginning of the carbon uptake period (CUP) and, together with a delayed establishment of the snow season in autumn, contributed to a two-month longer CUP. The combined effect of the shorter snow season and the extended CUP led to an increase of about 100% in annual carbon net uptake. Nevertheless, the unusual environmental conditions imposed by the early snowmelt led to changes in canopy structure and functioning, with a reduction of the carbon sequestration rate during the snow-free period.

AB Aim When faced with dichotomous events, such as the presence or absence of a species, discrimination capacity (the ability to separate the instances of presence from the instances of absence) is usually the only characteristic that is assessed in the evaluation of the performance of predictive models. Although neglected, calibration or reliability (how well the estimated probability of presence represents the observed proportion of presences) is another aspect of the performance of predictive models that provides important information. In this study, we explore how changes in the distribution of the probability of presence make discrimination capacity a context-dependent characteristic of models. For the first time, we explain the implications that ignoring the context dependence of discrimination can have in the interpretation of species distribution models. Innovation In this paper we corroborate that, under a uniform distribution of the estimated probability of presence, a well-calibrated model will not attain high discrimination power and the value of the area under the curve will be 0.83. Under non-uniform distributions of the probability of presence, simulations show that a well-calibrated model can attain a broad range of discrimination values. These results illustrate that discrimination is a context-dependent property, i.e. it gives information about the performance of a certain algorithm in a certain data population. Main conclusions In species distribution modelling, the discrimination capacity of a model is only meaningful for a certain species in a given geographic area and temporal snapshot. This is because the representativeness of the environmental domain changes with the geographical and temporal context, which unavoidably entails changes in the distribution of the probability of presence. Comparative studies that intend to generalize their results only based on the discrimination capacity of models may not be broadly extrapolated. Assessment of calibration is especially recommended when the models are intended to be transferred in time or space.

AB Theory predicts that different. components of species diversity should increase with environmental heterogeneity. Our main aim was to examine the relationship between beta-diversity and environmental heterogeneity in a system with high habitat heterogeneity and very small spatial distances between sites. This system allowed us to examine the effect of habitat heterogeneity on beta-diversity in the absence of dispersal limitation. We surveyed 100 riffle sites (10 riffles in each of 10 streams) for benthic macroinvertebrates in a boreal drainage basin. Streams differed in average community composition (based on canonical analysis of principal coordinates) and heterogeneity in community composition (based on test of homogeneity of dispersion). These results were robust regardless of the distance measures used in distance-based multivariate analyses. beta-diversity was not significantly correlated with stream habitat heterogeneity, despite the fact that the latter was quantified by a large set of environmental variables deemed important for species occurrence in our study streams. Thus, we suggest that the relationship between beta-diversity and habitat heterogeneity was masked by individual species environment responses and mass effects. Thus, the beta-diversity habitat heterogeneity relationship may not always be significant, a result that may have important consequences for understanding the structure of community patterns. Despite the absence of a significant beta-diversity habitat heterogeneity relationship, community structure was significantly associated with environmental factors (e.g., moss cover, stream width, velocity) across the streams in distance-based redundancy analysis. This finding suggests that different ways to associate beta-diversity, community structure, and environmental conditions may yield different insights into the structure of biotic communities.

AB The challenge of reaching common understanding of the processes and significance of environmental change amounts to a procedural vulnerability in climate change research that hinders successfully translating knowledge into equitable and effective adaptation policy. This article presents findings from research with Indigenous participants in West Arnhem, Australia, and identifies a procedural vulnerability to climate change research, where perceptions of change and their meaning have their context in Dreaming that supersedes and parallels Western scientific discourses of hazard and risk, but that are marginalised in studies and policies on climate change. This paper argues that moves to adapt remote Indigenous Australian communities to climate change risk missing the mark if they (a) assume that a strong reliance on particular ecosystem configurations makes Indigenous cultures universally vulnerable to environmental change, (b) do not recognise cosmologically embedded risks that are determined by Indigenous capacity to take care of country, and (c) do not recognise colonisation as an ongoing disaster in Indigenous Nations, and therefore treat secondary disasters such as poverty, ill health and welfare dependence as primary contributors to high climate change vulnerability. Procedural vulnerabilities contribute to policy failure, and in Australian contexts pose a risk of conceiving solutions to climate change vulnerability that involve moving people out of the way of environmental risks as they are conceived within colonial traditions, while moving them into the way of risks as conceived through the eyes of remote Indigenous communities. This research joins recent publications that encourage researchers and policy-makers to epistemologically ground proof risk assessments and to listen and engage in conversations that create ways of 'seeing with both eyes', while not being blind to the hazards of colonisation.

AB Most of the world's grasslands are managed for livestock production. A critical component of the long-term sustainability and profitability of rangelands (e. g., grazed grassland ecosystems) is the maintenance of plant production. Amending grassland soils with organic waste has been proposed as a means to increase net primary productivity (NPP) and ecosystem carbon (C) storage, while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from waste management. Few studies have evaluated the effects of amendments on the C balance and greenhouse gas dynamics of grasslands. We used field manipulations replicated within and across two rangelands (a valley grassland and a coastal grassland) to determine the effects of a single application of composted green waste amendments on NPP and greenhouse gas emissions over three years. Amendments elevated total soil respiration by 18% +/- 4% at both sites but had no effect on nitrous oxide or methane emissions. Carbon losses were significantly offset by greater and sustained plant production. Amendments stimulated both above-and belowground NPP by 2.1 +/- 0.8 Mg C/ha to 4.7 +/- 0.7 Mg C/ha (mean +/- SE) over the three-year study period. Net ecosystem C storage increased by 25-70% without including the direct addition of compost C. The estimated magnitude of net ecosystem C storage was sensitive to estimates of heterotrophic soil respiration but was greater than controls in five out of six fields that received amendments. The sixth plot was the only one that exhibited lower soil moisture than the control, suggesting an important role of water limitation in these seasonally dry ecosystems. Treatment effects persisted over the course of the study, which were likely derived from increased water-holding capacity in most plots, and slow-release fertilization from compost decomposition. We conclude that a single application of composted organic matter can significantly increase grassland C storage, and that effects of a single application are likely to carry over in time.

AB Among the main greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O), N2O has the highest global warming potential. N2O emission is mainly connected to agricultural activities, increasing as nitrogen concentrations increase in the soil with nitrogen fertilizer application. We evaluated N2O emissions due to application of increasing doses of ammonium nitrate and urea in two sugarcane fields in the mid-southern region of Brazil: Piracicaba (Sao Paulo state) and Goianesia (Goias state). In Piracicaba, N2O emissions exponentially increased with increasing N doses and were similar for urea and ammonium nitrate up to a dose of 107.9 kg ha(-1) of N. From there on, emissions exponentially increased for ammonium nitrate, whereas for urea they stabilized. In Goianesia, N2O emissions were lower, although the behavior was similar to that at the Piracicaba site. Ammonium nitrate emissions increased linearly with N dose and urea emissions were adjusted to a quadratic equation with a maximum amount of 113.9 kg N ha(-1). This first effort to measure fertilizer induced emissions in Brazilian sugarcane production not only helps to elucidate the behavior of N2O emissions promoted by different N sources frequently used in Brazilian sugarcane fields but also can be useful for future Brazilian ethanol carbon footprint studies.

AB Questions How does spatial scale (extent and grain) influence the relative importance of different environmental factors as determinants of plant community composition? Are there general scale thresholds that mark the transition from primarily edaphic to primarily climatic control of plant communities? Location Global. Methods We surveyed the empirical literature and identified 89 analyses from 63 published studies that analysed vegetationenvironment relationships involving at least two categories of predictor variables (edaphic, climatic, topographic, biotic, spatial or disturbance-related). For each analysis, we identified the primary predictor variable (i.e. the variable that explained the most variation in community composition) and the relative effect size of the best predictor variable from each category. We defined primacy as the proportion of times a variable category was primary when it was measured, and analysed primacy and the relative effect size of each category as a function of spatial extent and grain. We also analysed the subset of studies that measured both edaphic and climatic variables to identify spatial extent and grain thresholds for the primacy of these factors. We surveyed the empirical literature and identified 89 analyses from 63 published studies that analysed vegetationenvironment relationships involving at least two categories of predictor variables (edaphic, climatic, topographic, biotic, spatial or disturbance-related). For each analysis, we identified the primary predictor variable (i.e. the variable that explained the most variation in community composition) and the relative effect size of the best predictor variable from each category. We defined primacy as the proportion of times a variable category was primary when it was measured, and analysed primacy and the relative effect size of each category as a function of spatial extent and grain. We also analysed the subset of studies that measured both edaphic and climatic variables to identify spatial extent and grain thresholds for the primacy of these factors. Results Edaphic variables had the highest primacy in the overall data set and at fine grain sizes (<200 similar to m2), but there were no strong trends in primacy across studies of varying spatial extent. We detected trends of increasing relative effect size of climatic variables with increasing spatial extent, and decreasing relative effect size of edaphic variables with increasing spatial grain, although these patterns were not statistically significant. Among studies that measured both edaphic and climatic variables, the importance of climate factors relative to edaphic factors increased with increasing spatial extent and grain, with scale thresholds of 1995 similar to km2 for extent and 295 similar to m2 for grain. Conclusions Our study illustrates that vegetationenvironment relationships depend on the spatial scale (extent and grain) of observation and provide empirical support for the view that there is a transition from a primarily edaphic influence to a primarily climatic influence on plant community composition with increasing spatial scale.

AB Most of the recent framework directives and environmental policies argue for the development and the use of indicators - notably trophodynamic indicators - that should be able to follow ecosystems' evolution in space and time, particularly under anthropogenic perturbations. In the last decades, the use of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes ratios has increased exponentially, particularly in studies of marine ecosystems' trophic structure and functioning. This method is principally based on the assumption that the isotopic composition of a consumer directly reflects that of its food. Nevertheless, few studies have attempted to define the limits of this tool, before using it and drawing ecological conclusions from isotopic analysis. This study aimed to assess the importance of considering spatio-temporal variations in isotopic signatures of consumers when using delta C-13 and especially delta N-15 values in open ecosystems with complex food webs, using the Bay of Biscay (North-East Atlantic) as a case study. To this end, more than 140 species from this marine ecosystem were analysed for the isotopic signatures in their muscle tissue. They were sampled from coastal to oceanic and deep-sea areas and at different latitudes, to evaluate spatial variations of isotopic signatures. Selected species were also sampled over several years and in two seasons to account for inter-annual and seasonal variations. In the Bay of Biscay temperate ecosystem, which is subject to both coastal and oceanic influences - two main river inputs and upwelling areas - , delta C-13 and delta N-15 values significantly decreased from inshore to offshore species, and to a lesser extent from benthic to pelagic organisms. River discharges appeared to be the first factor influencing delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in consumers. From the important spatial variations detected in delta N-15 values in particular, we suggest that in such contrasted ecosystem, nitrogen isotopic ratios may also be revisited as an indicator of the feeding area. Moreover, we demonstrate that several baselines should be used when calculating trophic levels from delta N-15 values. From the temporal variations detected, we recommend concentrating on a short time scale for the sampling most organisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contrary to image classification, spectral unmixing techniques allow to derive abundance/fractional cover estimates for selected endmembers within the volume of a pixel. Mathematically the solution to the mixing problem is resolving a set of linear equations using least squares approaches. Practically this is done using singular value deconvolution of the endmember matrix inversion. This solution assumes orthogonality of the endmembers which determines the orthogonality of the matrix. If endmembers are highly correlated (thus collinearity or multi-collinearity occurs), the matrix becomes non-orthogonal, the inversion unstable and the inverse or estimated fractions highly sensitive to random error (e.g., noise). In practice, collinearity almost always exists but it is typically overlooked or ignored, hence with this overview we wish to create awareness to the issue and offer approaches to deal with the problem. The first part of the paper highlights the problem using a numerical example. It is shown how collinearity amplifies the error in the endmember matrix inversion. In the next paragraph we propose measures to quantify the level of (multi)collinearity in the endmember matrix: a weighted multiple correlation measure, the variance inflation factor, the partial regression coefficient. The remainder of the paper is dedicated to approaches to mitigate the problem: excluding endmembers, decorrelating endmembers, iterative approaches for endmember selection and we propose an adjustment to the unmixing equation which could be further explored. In conclusion, collinearity hampers the use of fractional abundance estimates. There is no single recipe to successfully combat this problem but in all mixture models collinearity should be tested and avoided as much as possible. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In central Argentina, the Chinese tree glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum) is an aggressive invasive species replacing native forests, forming dense stands, and is thus a major conservation concern. Mapping the spread of biological invasions is a necessary first step toward understanding the factors determining invasion patterns. Urban areas may function as propagule sources for glossy privet because it has been used as a landscaping tree for over a century. The objectives of this paper were to 1) map the patterns of glossy privet expansion from 1983 to 2006 using a time series of Landsat TM/ETM + images, and 2) analyze the spatial pattern of glossy privet stands with regard to urban extent. Using six summer Landsat TM images (1983, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2001, and 2006) the expansion of glossy privet was analyzed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a non-parametric classifier which we applied to a stack of all images simultaneously, a novel approach in its application to monitor non-native tree invasions. We then measured the area of glossy privet in a series of 200-m buffers at increasing distances around urban areas in 1983 and 2006, and compared it with the amount of privet expected in proportion to buffer area Glossy privet in the study area has spread very rapidly during the 23 years that we studied and the SVM resulted in highly accurate classifications (Kappa Index 0.88, commission error 0.07, omission error 0.16). Between 1983 and 2006 glossy privet area increased 50 times (from 50 to 2500 ha), and 20% of all forest in the study area is now dominated by glossy privet Most of the glossy privet dominated stands were located within 600 m of urban areas. However, the rate of glossy privet expansion accelerated substantially after 1992 and new glossy privet dominated stands tend to be located away from urban areas. This suggests that glossy privet is now self-sustaining, but expected urban growth in the area could further foster glossy privet invasion. Management and development plans should include mitigation efforts to contain this species and prevent invasion into native forests, and citizens should be informed about the risk of invasion associated with the use of glossy privet for landscaping.

AB Coevolutionary arms races are a powerful force driving evolution, adaptation, and diversification. They can generate phenotypic polymorphisms that render it harder for a coevolving parasite or predator to exploit any one individual of a given species. In birds, egg polymorphisms should be an effective defense against mimetic brood parasites and are extreme in the African tawny-flanked prinia (Prinia subflava) and its parasite, the cuckoo finch (Anomalospiza imberbis). Here we use models of avian visual perception to analyze the appearance of prinia and cuckoo finch eggs from the same location over 40 years. We show that the two interacting populations have experienced rapid changes in egg traits. Egg colors of both species have diversified over time, expanding into avian color space as expected under negative frequency-dependent selection. Egg pattern showed signatures of both frequency-dependent and directional selection in different traits, which appeared to be evolving independently of one another. Host and parasite appear to be closely tracking one another's evolution, since parasites showed closer color mimicry of contemporaneous hosts. This correlational evidence suggests that hosts and parasites are locked in an ongoing arms race in egg appearance, driven by constant change in the selective advantage of different phenotypes, and that coevolutionary arms races can generate remarkably rapid phenotypic change.

AB The environmental modeller faces a dilemma. Science often demands that more and more process representations are incorporated into models (particularly to avoid the possibility of making missing process errors in predicting future response). Testing the causal representations in environmental models (as multiple working hypotheses about the functioning of environmental systems) then depends on specifying boundary conditions and model parameters adequately. This will always be difficult in applications to a real system because of the heterogeneities, non-stationarities, complexities and epistemic uncertainties inherent in environmental prediction. Thus, it can be difficult to define the information content of a data set used in model evaluation and any consequent measures of belief or verisimilitude. A limit of acceptability approach to model evaluation is suggested as a way of testing models, implying that thought is required to define critical experiments that will allow models as hypotheses to be adequately differentiated.

AB 1. Metapopulation and metacommunity theories occupy a central role in ecology, but can be difficult to apply to plants. Challenges include whether seed dispersal is sufficient for population connectivity, the role of seed banks and problems with studying colonization and extinction in long-lived and clonal plants. Further, populations often do not occupy discrete habitat patches. Despite these difficulties, we present case studies to illustrate explicit integration of spatial and temporal data in plant ecology.

AB Aims We assessed the effects of native and exotic tree leaf litter on soil properties in two contrasting scenarios. The native Quercus robur and Pinus pinaster tree species coexist with the aliens Eucalyptus globulus and Acacia dealbata in acid soils of NW Spain. The native trees Fraxinus angustifolia and Ulmus minor coexist with the aliens Ailanthus altissima, Robinia pseudoacacia and Ulmus pumila in eutrophic basic riparian soils in Central Spain.
   Methods Four plastic trays per species were filled with homogenized top-soil of the site and covered with leaf litter. Before and after 9 months of incubation, litter mass, soil pH, organic matter, mineral and total N were measured. Available mineral N (NO (3) (-) -N and NH (4) (+) -N) was assessed every 2 months.
   Results Soil biological activity was higher in the basic than in the acid soil. Litter of the exotic trees tended to decompose less than litter of native species, probably due to the presence of secondary metabolites in the former. Soil pH, mineral and total N responded differently to different litter types, irrespective of their exotic or native origin (acid soil), or was similar across litter treatments (basic riparian soil). The similar response of the basic soil to the addition of different litter types may be due to the low contrast of litter quality between the species. E. globulus litter inhibitied soil microbial activity much more than the rest of the studied litter types, leading to a drastic impoverishment of N in soils.
   Conclusion Litter of exotic N-fixing trees (A. dealbata and R. pseudoacacia) did not increase soil N pools because of the inhibition of microbial activity by secondary compounds. Therefore, secondary metabolites of the litter played a major role explaining exotic litter impact on soil properties.

AB Comparisons among species have been a standard tool in animal physiology to understand how organisms function and adapt to their surrounding environment. During the last two decades, conceptual and methodological advances from different fields, including evolutionary biology and systematics, have revolutionized the way comparative analyses are performed, resulting in the advent of modern phylogenetic statistical methods. This development stems from the realization that conventional analytical methods assume that observations are statistically independent, which is not the case for comparative data because species often resemble each other due to shared ancestry. By taking evolutionary history explicitly into consideration, phylogenetic statistical methods can account for the confounding effects of shared ancestry in interspecific comparisons, improving the reliability of standard approaches such as regressions or correlations in comparative analyses. Importantly, these methods have also enabled researchers to address entirely new evolutionary questions, such as the historical sequence of events that resulted in current patterns of form and function, which can only be studied with a phylogenetic perspective. Here, we provide an overview of phylogenetic approaches and their importance for studying the evolution of physiological processes and mechanisms. We discuss the conceptual framework underlying these methods, and explain when and how phylogenetic information should be employed. We then outline the difficulties and limitations inherent to comparative approaches and discuss potential problems researchers may encounter when designing a comparative study. These issues are illustrated with examples from the literature in which the incorporation of phylogenetic information has been useful, or even crucial, for inferences on how species evolve and adapt to their surrounding environment.

AB Based in part on a symposium held at the first World Seabird Conference in September, 2010 in Victoria, BC, Canada, we present a Theme Section (TS) on the topic of seabirds and climate change. We introduce this TS with a meta-analysis of key attributes of the current seabird-climate literature, based on 108 publications representing almost 3000 seabird-climate associations (mostly correlations) published up to 2011. Using the papers in this TS and our meta-analysis, a brief roadmap for the future of seabird-climate change research is presented. Seabird studies have contributed substantially to the literature on marine climate effects. To improve our understanding of climate change effects on seabirds at the global scale, however, additional low-latitude, mechanistic, and 'end-to-end' modeling studies, including integration of climatic, oceanographic, food web, and population dynamics models, should be conducted. This approach will enhance our understanding of the relationship between climate and population dynamics, and facilitate seabird conservation in a changing world.

AB Aim The complex palaeogeography of the Malesian archipelago, characterized by the evolution of an ever-changing mosaic of terrestrial and marine areas throughout the Cenozoic, provides the geographic backdrop for the remarkable diversification of Malesian Begonia (> 450 species). This study aimed to investigate the origin of Malesian Begonia, the directionality of dispersal events within the Malesian archipelago and the impact of ancient water gaps on colonization patterns, and to identify drivers of diversification.
   Location Asia, Southeast Asia, Malesia.
   Methods Plastid DNA sequence data of representatives of all families of the Cucurbitales and Fagales (matK, rbcL, trnL intron, trnL-F spacer, 4076 aligned positions, 92 taxa) and a sample of all major Asian Begonia sections (ndhA intron, ndhF-rpl32 spacer, rpl32-trnL spacer, 4059 aligned positions, 112 taxa) were analysed under an uncorrelated-rates relaxed molecular clock model to estimate the age of the Begonia crown group divergence and divergence ages within Asian Begonia. Ancestral areas were reconstructed using a likelihood approach implementing a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis model, and with a Bayesian approach to dispersal-vicariance analysis.
   Results The results indicated an initial diversification of Asian Begonia in continental Asia in the Miocene, and subsequent colonization of Malesia by multiple lineages. There was support for at least six independent dispersal events from continental Asia and western Malesia to Wallacea dating from the late Miocene to the Pleistocene. Begonia section Petermannia (> 270 species) originated in Western Malesia, and subsequently dispersed to Wallacea, New Guinea and the Philippines. Lineages within this section diversified rapidly since the Pliocene, coinciding with rapid orogenesis on Sulawesi and New Guinea.
   Main conclusions The predominant trend of Begonia dispersals between continental Asia and Malesia, and also within Malesia, has been from west to east. The water bodies separating the Sunda Shelf region from Wallacea have been porous barriers to dispersal in Begonia following the emergence of substantial land in eastern Malesia from the late Miocene onwards. We hypothesize two major drivers of the diversification of Malesian Begonia: (1) the formation of topographical heterogeneity and the promotion of microallopatry by orogenesis in the Pliocene and Pleistocene; and (2) cyclic vicariance by frequent habitat fragmentations and amalgamations due to climate and sea-level fluctuations during the Pleistocene.

AB Fruit-eating by fishes represents an ancient (perhaps Paleozoic) interaction increasingly regarded as important for seed dispersal (ichthyochory) in tropical and temperate ecosystems. Most of the more than 275 known frugivorous species belong to the mainly Neotropical Characiformes (pacus, piranhas) and Siluriformes (catfishes), but cypriniforms (carps, minnows) are more important in the Holarctic and Indomalayan regions. Frugivores are among the most abundant fishes in Neotropical floodplains where they eat the fruits of a wide variety of trees and shrubs. By consuming fruits, fishes gain access to rich sources of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and act as either seed predators or seed dispersers. With their often high mobility, large size, and great longevity, fruit-eating fishes can play important roles as seed dispersers and exert strong influences on local plant-recruitment dynamics and regional biodiversity. Recent feeding experiments focused on seed traits after gut passage support the idea that fishes are major seed dispersers in floodplain and riparian forests. Overfishing, damming, deforestation and logging potentially diminish ichthyochory and require immediate attention to ameliorate their effects. Much exciting work remains in terms of fish and plant adaptations to ichthyochory, dispersal regimes involving fishes in different ecosystems, and increased use of nondestructive methods such as stomach lavage, stable isotopes, genetic analyses and radio transmitters to determine fish diets and movements.

AB Geographic variation in the population dynamics of a species can result from regional variability in climate and how it affects reproduction and survival. Identifying such effects for migratory birds requires the integration of population models with knowledge of migratory connectivity between breeding and nonbreeding areas. We used Bayesian hierarchical models with 26 years of Breeding Bird Survey data (1982-2007) to investigate the impacts of breeding-and nonbreeding-season climate on abundance of American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) across the species range. We focused on 15 populations defined by Bird Conservation Regions, and we included variation across routes and observers as well as temporal trends and climate effects. American Redstart populations that breed in eastern North America showed increased abundance following winters with higher plant productivity in the Caribbean where they are expected to overwinter. In contrast, western breeding populations showed little response to conditions in their expected wintering areas in west Mexico, perhaps reflecting lower migratory connectivity or differential effects of winter rainfall on individuals across the species range. Unlike the case with winter climate, we found few effects of temperature prior to arrival in spring (March-April) or during the nesting period (May-June) on abundance the following year. Eight populations showed significant changes in abundance, with the steepest declines in the Atlantic Northern Forest (-3.4%/ yr) and the greatest increases in the Prairie Hardwood Transition (4%/yr). This study emphasizes how the effects of climate on populations of migratory birds are context dependent and can vary depending on geographic location and the period of the annual cycle. Such knowledge is essential for predicting regional variation in how populations of a species might vary in their response to climate change.

AB The struggle for existence occurs through the vital rates of population growth. This basic fact demonstrates the tight connection between ecology and evolution that defines the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics. An effective synthesis of the interdependencies between ecology and evolution is grounded in six principles. The mechanics of evolution specifies the origin and rules governing traits and evolutionary strategies. Traits and evolutionary strategies achieve their selective value through their functional relationships with fitness. Function depends on the underlying structure of variation and the temporal, spatial and organizational scales of evolution. An understanding of how changes in traits and strategies occur requires conjoining ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Adaptation merges these five pillars to achieve a comprehensive understanding of ecological and evolutionary change. I demonstrate the value of this world-view with reference to the theory and practice of habitat selection. The theory allows us to assess evolutionarily stable strategies and states of habitat selection, and to draw the adaptive landscapes for habitat-selecting species. The landscapes can then be used to forecast future evolution under a variety of climate change and other scenarios.

AB Accurate estimation of mineralizable nitrogen (N) from soil organic matter is essential to improve fertilizer management in agricultural systems. Mineralizable N refers to the amount of N in soil that is released during a certain period (ranging from 1 week to the length of a growing season). It has been estimated from increases in inorganic N during incubation or from N uptake by plants grown in a greenhouse or field. Many chemical soil tests measuring extractable organic N (EON) fractions have been proposed to predict mineralizable N. We evaluated the predictive value of these soil tests, using 2068 observations from 218 papers. Meta-analysis was used to find the best soil test, to analyse differences between field and laboratory experiments, and to determine whether their predictive value is affected by extraction intensity (% of total soil N that is extracted). The concentration of EON was positively related to mineralizable N, explaining on average 47% of the variation. It did not, however, explain more of the variation than total N. Best predictions (57% < R2 < 74%) were obtained when EON was extracted with hot CaCl(2), acid KMnO(4), acid K(2)Cr(2)O(7), hot water or hot KCl. Extraction intensity was not related to the strength of the above-mentioned relationship. Predictions of mineralizable N were significantly worse when mineralization was measured in the field compared with measurements under controlled conditions. We found no evidence of a causal and direct relationship between EON and mineralizable N. Accuracy of soil testing may improve when the current 'single soil test approach' changes to a more complex approach, which includes different soil tests, soil properties and environmental conditions.

AB The role of carrion in food webs is governed by complex competitive interactions among a wide range of taxa. Although this competition is known to be influenced by several biotic and abiotic factors, relatively few data are available from highly altered landscapes. We investigated the fate of mouse carcasses in an intensively farmed region in Indiana, USA, using remote cameras. Vertebrates removed 234 of 266 (88%) carcasses within two weeks after placement. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) were the predominant scavengers, removing 184 of 197 (93%) carcasses for which a scavenger could be identified. Air temperature influenced carcass removal by vertebrates only at higher temperatures, with fewer carcasses removed as temperatures increased over similar to 22 degrees C. Elevated densities of mesopredators, coupled with the reduced search area for carrion due to the sparse distribution of forested habitat, likely were responsible for the rapid discovery and high level of carcass removal by vertebrates compared to previous investigations. Our data suggest that in agricultural landscapes, the competitive balance for carrion can differ substantially from that found in more pristine habitats. Moreover, the monopolization of carrion resources by abundant mesopredators may have negative consequences for other species that use carrion.

AB Many bird species start laying their eggs earlier in response to increasing spring temperatures, but the causes of variation between and within species have not been fully explained. Moreover, synchronization of the nestling period with the food supply not only depends on first-egg dates but also on additional reproductive parameters including laying interruptions, incubation time and nestling growth rate. We studied the breeding cycle of two sympatric and closely related species, the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus and the great tit Parus major in a rich oak-beech forest, and found that both advanced their mean first-egg dates by 11-12 days over the last three decades. In addition, the time from first egg to fledging has shortened by 2-3 days, through a decrease in laying interruptions, incubation time (not statistically significant) and nestling development time. This decrease is correlated with a gradual increase of temperatures during laying, suggesting a major effect of the reduction in laying interruptions. In both species, the occurrence of second clutches has strongly decreased over time. As a consequence, the average time of fledging (all broods combined) has advanced by 15.4 and 18.6 days for blue and great tits, respectively, and variance in fledging dates has decreased by 70-75%. Indirect estimates of the food peak suggest that both species have maintained synchronization with the food supply. We found consistent selection for large clutch size, early laying and short nest time (laying to fledging), but no consistent changes in selection over time. Analyses of within-individual variation show that most of the change can be explained by individual plasticity in laying date, fledging date and nest time. This study highlights the importance of studying all components of the reproductive cycle, including second clutches, in order to assess how natural populations respond to climate change.

AB Extreme weather conditions occur at an increasing rate as evidenced by higher frequency of hurricanes and more extreme precipitation and temperature anomalies. Such extreme environmental conditions will have important implications for all living organisms through greater frequency of reproductive failure and reduced adult survival. We review examples of reproductive failure and reduced survival related to extreme weather conditions. Phenotypic plasticity may not be sufficient to allow adaptation to extreme weather for many animals. Theory predicts reduced reproductive effort as a response to increased stochasticity. We predict that patterns of natural selection will change towards truncation selection as environmental conditions become more extreme. Such changes in patterns of selection may facilitate adaptation to extreme events. However, effects of selection on reproductive effort are difficult to detect. We present a number of predictions for the effects of extreme weather conditions in need of empirical tests. Finally, we suggest a number of empirical reviews that could improve our ability to judge the effects of extreme environmental conditions on life history [Current Zoology 57 (3): 375-389, 2011].

AB Temperature observations at 25 sites in the 2000 km(2) Dee catchment in NE Scotland were used, in conjunction with geographic information system (GIS) analysis, to identify dominant landscape controls on mean monthly maximum stream temperatures. Maximum winter stream temperatures are mainly controlled by elevation, catchment area and hill shading, whereas the maximum temperatures in summer are driven by more complex interactions, which include the influence of riparian forest cover and distance to coast. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the catchment-wide distribution of mean weekly maximum stream temperatures for the hottest week of the 2-year observation period. The results suggested the streams most sensitive to high temperatures are small upland streams at exposed locations without any forest cover and relatively far inland, while lowland streams with riparian forest cover at locations closer to the coast exhibit a moderated thermal regime. Under current conditions, all streams provide a suitable thermal habitat for both, Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Using two climate change scenarios assuming 2.5 and 4 degrees C air temperature increases, respectively, temperature-sensitive zones of the stream network were identified, which could potentially have an adverse effect on the thermal habitat of Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Analysis showed that the extension of riparian forests into headwater streams has the potential to moderate changes in temperature under climate change. Copyright. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A critical variable in the estimation of gross primary production of terrestrial ecosystems is light-use efficiency (LUE), a value that represents the actual efficiency of a plant's use of absorbed radiation energy to produce biomass. Light-use efficiency is driven by the most limiting of a number of environmental stress factors that reduce plants' photosynthetic capacity; these include short-term stressors, such as photoinhibition, as well as longer-term stressors, such as soil water and temperature. Modeling LUE from remote sensing is governed largely by the biochemical composition of plant foliage, with the past decade seeing important theoretical and modeling advances for understanding the role of these stresses on LUE. In this article we provide a summary of the tower-, aircraft-, and satellite-based research undertaken to date, and discuss the broader scalability of these methods, concluding with recommendations for ongoing research possibilities.

AB Agro-ecosystems still retain part of the original biodiversity, although agricultural intensification threatens to eliminate refuge patches from farmland mosaics. Landscape complexity resulting from networks of uncultivated corridors associated with fencerows may play a key role in sustaining biodiversity across scales, and may further influence diversity in adjacent, cultivated fields. We evaluated the relationship between farmland complexity and plant diversity of fencerows and crop fields at local and landscape scales in the Rolling Pampas of Argentina. We surveyed 222 fencerows and fields cultivated with winter or summer crops, and characterised farmland complexity by the perimeter/area ratio of cropland in 2-km diameter circles surrounding each field. Plant diversity was additively partitioned into alpha, beta, and gamma components. Fencerows had noticeably higher richness than cropped fields at local and landscape scales. Gamma and beta diversities of fencerows and fields were positively related to farmland complexity, supporting the role of spatial heterogeneity in maintaining plant diversity in agro-ecosystems. Landscape complexity did not influence alpha diversity of fencerows but significantly increased diversity within fields, a likely result of enhanced mass effects from uncultivated habitats in more varied farmland. More complex landscapes contained greater gamma diversity of exotic perennials in fencerows, and of exotic and native annuals within fields. Importantly, alpha and gamma diversities of native perennials from the pristine Pampa grassland increased with landscape complexity within cropped fields. In the face of ongoing landscape homogenisation under agricultural intensification, maintaining fencerow networks may become critical for conserving habitat heterogeneity and farmland biodiversity.

AB P>1. There is a rapidly growing literature on how climate affects populations of vertebrates. For large herbivorous mammals, most attention has been paid to demographic responses to climate variation. Much less information is available regarding how climate affects animal behaviour, i.e. the climate mechanisms. Further, the appropriate measurement scale of climate variables remains debated. Here, we investigate how local climate variables determine home range sizes at four temporal scales using the Borger-method on GPS telemetry data from 47 female red deer Cervus elaphus L. in Norway.
   2. If local climate operates directly on the immediate activity level of the animal, we predict home range sizes to show season-specific variation on short temporal scale (weekly-daily) related to temperature and precipitation. If local climate operate indirectly through plant growth, we rather predict variation in home range sizes to be apparent on longer time scales (biweekly-monthly), and during summer only.
   3. At all time scales home range size was positively correlated with temperature during winter and negatively during summer, while the effect of precipitation was season- and scale-specific, except when accumulating as snow. Extensive snow cover decreased home range size, indicating direct effects of climate.
   4. The effects of local climate was weaker at the shortest time scales (weekly-daily) compared to the longest time scales (monthly-biweekly), while the effects of day length on home range size was only apparent on the monthly and daily scale. At the longest time scales variation in local climate had a large effect on home range size. This is consistent with climatic variables operating indirectly through plant growth, but we cannot exclude a certain direct effect even at longer time scales.
   5. We show how local climate-home range size correlations measured over different temporal scales can be used to infer direct and indirect climate mechanisms. Insight on the behavioural basis of responses to climate enables more accurate predictions of possible nonlinear relationships to future global warming.

AB There is strong community-wide interest in applying molecular techniques to fungal species delimitation and identification, but selection of a standardized region or regions of the genome has not been finalized. A single marker, the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region, has frequently been suggested as the standard for fungi. We used a group of closely related blue stain fungi associated with the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) to examine the success of such single-locus species identification, comparing the internal transcribed spacer with four other nuclear markers. We demonstrate that single loci varied in their utility for identifying the six fungal species examined, while use of multiple loci was consistently successful. In a literature survey of 21 similar studies, individual loci were also highly variable in their ability to provide consistent species identifications and were less successful than multilocus diagnostics. Accurate species identification is the essence of any molecular diagnostic system, and this consideration should be central to locus selection. Moreover, our study and the literature survey demonstrate the value of using closely related species as the proving ground for developing a molecular identification system. We advocate use of a multilocus barcode approach that is similar to the practice employed by the plant barcode community, rather than reliance on a single locus.

AB We examined variation in glucocorticoid levels in the mandrill, a brightly coloured primate species, to identify major social influences on stress hormones, and investigate relationships among glucocorticoid levels, testosterone and secondary sexual ornamentation. We collected a total of 317 fecal samples for 16 adult male mandrills over 13 months, including mating and non-mating periods and periods of both dominance rank stability and instability, and compared fecal glucocorticoid levels with dominance rank, rank stability, presence of receptive females, gastro-intestinal parasite infection, fecal testosterone and facial red coloration. Glucocorticoid levels did not vary systematically with dominance rank, but increased when the dominance hierarchy was unstable, and increased in the presence of receptive females. The relationship between dominance rank and glucocorticoid levels changed direction according to the stability of the dominance hierarchy: glucocorticoid levels were higher in subordinate males under stable conditions, but under conditions of instability higher ranking males had higher glucocorticoid levels. The influence of dominance rank also interacted with the presence of receptive females: glucocorticoids were higher in dominant males than in subordinates, but only during mating periods, suggesting that dominant males are more stressed than subordinates during such periods. These findings support previous studies showing that the relationship between glucocorticoids and dominance rank in male baboons is dependent on the social environment. We also found that males with higher glucocorticoids suffered a higher diversity of gastrointestinal parasite infection, in line with evidence that glucocorticoids suppress the immune system in other species. However, we found no support for the stress-mediated immunocompetence handicap hypothesis for the evolution of condition-dependent ornaments: glucocorticoid and testosterone levels were positively related, rather than the negative relationship predicted by the hypothesis, and we found no relationship between red colour and glucocorticoid levels, suggesting that glucocorticoids do not play a role in translating social conditions or physical health into ornament expression in this species.

AB The influence of hydrological dynamics on vegetation distribution and the structuring of wetland environments is of growing interest as wetlands are modified by human action and the increasing threat from climate change. Hydrological properties have long been considered a driving force in structuring wetland communities. We link hydrological dynamics with vegetation distribution across Everglades National Park (ENP) using two publicly available datasets to study the probability structure of the frequency, duration, and depth of inundation events along with their relationship to vegetation distribution. This study is among the first to show hydrologic structuring of vegetation communities at wide spatial and temporal scales, as results indicate that the percentage of time a location is inundated and its mean depth are the principal structuring variables to which individual communities respond. For example, sawgrass, the most abundant vegetation type within the ENP, is found across a wide range of time inundated percentages and mean depths. Meanwhile, other communities like pine savanna or red mangrove scrub are more restricted in their distribution and found disproportionately at particular depths and inundations. These results, along with the probabilistic structure of hydropatterns, potentially allow for the evaluation of climate change impacts on wetland vegetation community structure and distribution.

AB Lizards have been model organisms for ecological and evolutionary studies from individual to community levels at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here we highlight lizards as models for phylogeographic studies, review the published population genetics/phylogeography literature to summarize general patterns and trends and describe some studies that have contributed to conceptual advances. Our review includes 426 references and 452 case studies: this literature reflects a general trend of exponential growth associated with the theoretical and empirical expansions of the discipline. We describe recent lizard studies that have contributed to advances in understanding of several aspects of phylogeography, emphasize some linkages between phylogeography and speciation and suggest ways to expand phylogeographic studies to test alternative pattern-based modes of speciation. Allopatric speciation patterns can be tested by phylogeographic approaches if these are designed to discriminate among four alternatives based on the role of selection in driving divergence between populations, including: (i) passive divergence by genetic drift; (ii) adaptive divergence by natural selection (niche conservatism or ecological speciation); and (iii) socially-mediated speciation. Here we propose an expanded approach to compare patterns of variation in phylogeographic data sets that, when coupled with morphological and environmental data, can be used to to discriminate among these alternative speciation patterns.

AB A current focus of ecology is the investigation of spatial effects on population and community dynamics; however, spatiotemporal theory remains largely untested by empirical observations or experimental studies. For example, the segregation hypothesis predicts that intraspecific aggregation should increase the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition, thereby enhancing local coexistence in plant communities. We applied recent methods of point pattern analysis to analyze a unique long-term data set on fully mapped seedling emergence and subsequent survival in a Mediterranean gorse shrubland after experimental. res and simulated torrential rainfall events. Our overall aim was to test if the observed spatial patterns were consistent with the segregation hypothesis during the entire community dynamics from early seedling emergence to the establishment of a mature community, i.e., we explored if the observed initial segregation did indeed prevent interspecific competition from becoming dominant. We used random labeling as the null model and specific test statistics to evaluate different biological effects of the spatial interactions that determine mortality.
   We found that mortality was clearly not random. Comparison of the probability of mortality in dependence on the distance to conspecific and to heterospecific plants showed that mortality was controlled almost entirely by intraspecific interactions, which is consistent with the segregation hypothesis. Dead plants were aggregated and segregated from surviving plants, indicating two-sided scramble competition. Spatial interactions were density dependent and changed their sign over the course of time from positive to negative when plants grew to maturity. The simulated torrential rainfall events and subsequent erosion caused nonspecific mortality of seedlings but did not reduce the prevalence of intraspecific competition. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of plants may profoundly affect competition and can be an important determinant in the coexistence of species and biodiversity.

AB As reflected in the title of his masterwork On the Origin of Species, Darwin proposed that adaptation is the primary mechanism of speciation. On this, Darwin was criticized for his neglect of reproductive isolation, his lack of appreciation for the role of geographic barriers, his failure to distinguish varieties from species, and his typological species concept. Two developments since Darwin, the biological species concept of Ernst Mayr and the methods of Coyne and Orr for estimating the contribution of different barriers to the total reproductive isolation, provide a framework for reconciling Darwin's view on the primacy of adaptation in speciation with later proposals that emphasize reproductive isolation. A review of the few studies that have estimated the contributions of multiple isolating barriers suggests that habitat isolation and other barriers that operate before hybrid formation are much stronger than intrinsic postzygotic isolation. In light of these data, I suggest that Darwin's focus on adaptation in the origin of species was essentially correct, a conclusion that calls for future studies that explore the links between adaptation and speciation, in particular, ecogeographic isolating barriers that result from adaptive divergence in habitat use. The recent revival in thinking about ecological factors and adaptive divergence in the origin of species echoes Darwin's much-criticized "principle of divergence" and suggests that the emerging views from today's naturalists are not so different from those espoused by Darwin some 150 years ago.

AB Ecological risk assessments of pesticides usually focus on risk at the level of individuals, and are carried out by comparing exposure and toxicological endpoints. However, in most cases the protection goal is populations rather than individuals. On the population level, effects of pesticides depend not only on exposure and toxicity, but also on factors such as life history characteristics, population structure, timing of application, presence of refuges in time and space, and landscape structure. Ecological models can integrate such factors and have the potential to become important tools for the prediction of population-level effects of exposure to pesticides, thus allowing extrapolations, for example, from laboratory to field. Indeed, a broad range of ecological models have been applied to chemical risk assessment in the scientific literature, but so far such models have only rarely been used to support regulatory risk assessments of pesticides. To better understand the reasons for this situation, the current modeling practice in this field was assessed in the present study. The scientific literature was searched for relevant models and assessed according to nine characteristics: model type, model complexity, toxicity measure, exposure pattern, other factors, taxonomic group, risk assessment endpoint, parameterization, and model evaluation. The present study found that, although most models were of a high scientific standard, many of them would need modification before they are suitable for regulatory risk assessments. The main shortcomings of currently available models in the context of regulatory pesticide risk assessments were identified. When ecological models are applied to regulatory risk assessments, we recommend reviewing these models according to the nine characteristics evaluated here. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:1006-1012.

AB Accurately predicting terrestrial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage requires understanding how plant invasions alter cycling and storage. A common, highly successful type of plant invasion occurs when the invasive species is of a distinctly different functional type than the native dominant plant, such as shrub encroachment throughout the western United States and annual grass invasions in Mediterranean shrublands, as studied here. Such invasions can dramatically transform landscapes and have large potential to alter C and N cycling by influencing storage in multiple pools. We used a manipulation of non-native annual grass litter within a shrub-dominated habitat in southern California (coastal sage scrub, CSS) to study how grass invasion alters ecosystem C and N storage. We added, removed, or left unchanged grass litter in areas of high and low invasion, then followed soil and vegetation changes. Grass litter greatly increased C and N storage in soil, aboveground native and non-native biomass. Aboveground litter storage increased due to the greater inputs and slower decomposition of grass litter relative to shrub litter; shading by grass litter further reduced decomposition of both non-native and native litter, which may be due to reduced photodegradation. Soil C and N pools in areas of high litter increased similar to 20% relative to low litter areas in the two years following manipulation and were generally sinks for C and N, while areas with low litter were sources. We synthesize our results into a C cycle of invaded and uninvaded areas of CSS and link changes in storage to increases in the soil fungi : bacteria ratio, increased plant inputs, and decreased litter loss. Overall, we show that grasses, especially through their litter, control important abiotic and biotic mechanisms governing C and N storage, with widespread implications for C sequestration and N storage in semiarid systems undergoing grass or shrub invasions.

AB Aim We demonstrate how to integrate two widely used tools for modelling the spread of invasive plants, and compare the performance of the combined model with that of its individual components using the recent range dynamics of the invasive annual weed Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.
   Location Austria.
   Methods Species distribution models, which deliver habitat-based information on potential distributions, and interacting particle systems, which simulate spatio-temporal range dynamics as dependent on neighbourhood configurations, were combined into a common framework. We then used the combined model to simulate the invasion of A. artemisiifolia in Austria between 1990 and 2005. For comparison, simulations were also performed with models that accounted only for habitat suitability or neighbourhood configurations. The fit of the three models to the data was assessed by likelihood ratio tests, and simulated invasion patterns were evaluated against observed ones in terms of predictive discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) and spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I).
   Results The combined model fitted the data significantly better than the single-component alternatives. Simulations relying solely on parameterized spread kernels performed worst in terms of both AUC and spatial pattern formation. Simulations based only on habitat information correctly predicted infestation of susceptible areas but reproduced the autocorrelated patterns of A. artemisiifolia expansion less adequately than did the integrated model.
   Main conclusions Our integrated modelling approach offers a flexible tool for forecasts of spatio-temporal invasion patterns from landscape to regional scales. As a further advantage, scenarios of environmental change can be incorporated consistently by appropriately updating habitat suitability layers. Given the susceptibility of many alien plants, including A. artemisiifolia, to both land use and climate changes, taking such scenarios into account will increasingly become relevant for the design of proactive management strategies.

AB Synchrony has fundamental but conflicting implications for the persistence and stability of food webs at local and regional scales. In a constant environment, compensatory dynamics between species can maintain food web stability, but factors that synchronize population fluctuations within and between communities are expected to be destabilizing. We studied the dynamics of a food web in a metacommunity to determine how environmental variability and dispersal affect stability by altering compensatory dynamics and average species abundance. When dispersal rate is high, weak correlated environmental fluctuations promote food web stability by reducing the amplitude of compensatory dynamics. However, when dispersal rate is low, weak environmental fluctuations reduce food web stability by inducing intraspecific synchrony across communities. Irrespective of dispersal rate, strong environmental fluctuations disrupt compensatory dynamics and decrease stability by inducing intermittent correlated fluctuations between consumers in local food webs, which reduce both total consumer abundance and predator abundance. Strong correlated environmental fluctuations lead to (i) spatially asynchronous and highly correlated local consumer dynamics when dispersal is low and (ii) spatially synchronous but intermediate local consumer correlation when dispersal is high. By controlling intraspecific synchrony, dispersal mediates the capacity of strong environmental fluctuations to disrupt compensatory dynamics at both local and metacommunity scales.

AB A spatial value transfer analysis was performed to generate baseline estimates of the value of ecosystem services in the coastal zone of Catalonia, Spain. The study used the best available conceptual frameworks, data sources, and analytical techniques to generate non-market monetary value estimates that can be used to identify scarce ecosystem services among competing coastal uses. The approach focused on natural and seminatural, terrestrial and marine systems, which provide essential services that are not considered in current economic markets. Results show that in 2004 a substantial economic value of $3,195 million USD/yr was delivered to local citizens by surrounding ecosystems. In a spatially explicit manner, the approach illustrates the contribution made by natural environmental systems to the well being of communities in the coastal zone of Catalonia. It is hoped that this study will highlight the need to consider these coastal systems in future management strategies to ensure their proper maintenance and conservation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Eastern boundary current (EBC) upwelling zones are among the most productive of marine ecosystems globally and have been generalized in terms of their food web structure. Little empirically based evidence exists to suggest that there is any one form of trophic control of EBC systems and, because of logistical constraints, knowledge of food web structure is limited in these large marine ecosystems. To determine principal trophic links within the pelagic food web, we combined stable isotope and diet analysis of 21 dominant species of nekton found within the northern California Current, a highly productive EBC upwelling ecosystem. Samples of nekton and zooplankton were collected in June and August 2000 and 2002 from the shelf-slope waters of northern California to Washington. Results showed most nekton consumed mixed diets of zooplankton and larval-juvenile or adult fishes, indicating the importance of omnivory in this system. Euphausiids were overwhelmingly the most prevalent zooplankton taxa in the diets of nekton across multiple trophic levels, accounting for >50% of the index of relative importance in 10 of 21 nekton species analyzed. Nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15) reflected trophic patterns observed in the diets, with most nekton species (similar to 62%) falling between trophic levels (TL) of full zooplanktivores (TL = 3) and full piscivores (TL = 4). The prevalence of omnivory observed here is probably due to high primary production that supports an abundance of large zooplankton prey, such as euphausiids, which may be a more available prey resource for a broad range of predators. A modification of this form of bottom-up control, termed bottom-up omnivory, is presented.

AB The south-eastern coast of Australia is recognised as a climate-change hotspot; warming over the past 50 years has exceeded the global average. The marine fauna in the region is responding to this warming with several subtidal species showing a pole-ward range expansion. We provide the first evidence for a similar response in intertidal invertebrates, on the basis of surveys from the eastern coast of Tasmania in 2007-2008 that replicated a set from the 1950s. Of 29 species used in the analysis, 55% were detected further south than in the 1950s. The average minimum movement of the southern (pole-ward) range edges was 116 km (range 20-250 km), representing a rate of similar to 29 km per decade for a warming rate of 0.22 degrees C per decade. Barnacles and gastropods showed the greatest range extensions, with one species absent from Tasmania in the 1950s, the giant rock barnacle, Austromegabalanus nigrescens, now recorded widely along the eastern coast of Tasmania. The distance that the southern (pole-ward) range limit moved south for each species was not related to a qualitative dispersal potential index. Local extinction of some species in north-eastern Tasmania may also occur in the coming decades.

AB Although the glucocorticoid response to acute short-term stress is an adaptive physiological mechanism that aids in the response to and survival of noxious stimuli, chronic stress is associated with a negative impact on health. In wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), chronic stress alters the responsiveness of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as measured by the acute corticosterone response. In the present study, we investigated potential underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms by comparing glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA expression in the brains of chronically and nonchronically-stressed starlings. Hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, but not hippocampal, glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression in chronically-stressed birds was significantly lower compared to controls, suggesting changes in the efficacy of corticosterone negative feedback. In addition, chronically-stressed birds showed a significant decrease in hippocampal MR mRNA expression. Together, these results suggest that chronic stress changes the brain physiology of wild birds and provides important information for the understanding of the underlying mechanisms that result in dysregulation of the HPA axis in wild animals by chronic stress.

AB The rate of exchange of CO(2) between the soil and the atmosphere depends on the stability of the organic carbon stored in the soil. Recent studies show that carbon stored in the subsoil is characterised by larger turnover times than the carbon stored in the topsoil. Consequently, identification of the depth at which high/low amounts of SOC are stored is essential for applying sustainable management of the soil in the light of global warming and related threats. This study investigates the depth distribution of SOC in relation to land use and soil type based on a large dataset for Flanders (Belgium). Soil type determines the SOC content along the entire profile. On the contrary, land use appears to have a strong influence on SOC content in the top layers of the profile, but doesn't play a significant role at the bottom of the profile (> 1 m depth). SOC content near the surface of the profile is remarkably higher in fine (clay) textured soils than in coarse (sand) textured soils and tends to increase by increasing soil wetness under sand and silt textured soils. SOC at the bottom of the profile increases as well by increasing soil wetness, but only in fine (clay and silt) textured soils. The rate of decline of SOC content with depth depends on texture and land use. Under forest this decline is remarkably fast, although less so in the more sandy soil types. The overall model predicts the distribution of SOC density by depth using land use and soil type information and allows in its integrated form the estimation of SOC stocks that can be represented on SOC maps until a reference depth free of choice. Applying this model, based on a three-dimensional spatial distribution approach, the total amount of SOC stored in Flanders is calculated at 62.20 +/- 0.72 Mt C for the top 0.3 m and 103.19 +/- 1.27 Mt C for the top 1 m.

AB Decomposing variation in population growth into contributions from both ecological and evolutionary processes is of fundamental concern, particularly in a world characterized by rapid responses to anthropogenic threats. Although the impact of ecological change on evolutionary response has long been acknowledged, the converse has predominantly been neglected, especially empirically. By applying a recently published conceptual framework, we assess and contrast the relative importance of phenotypic and environmental variability on annual population growth in five ungulate populations. In four of the five populations, the contribution of phenotypic variability was greater than the contribution of environmental variability, although not significantly so. The similarity in the contributions of environment and phenotype suggests that neither is worthy of neglect. Population growth is a consequence of multiple processes, which strengthens arguments advocating integrated approaches to assess how populations respond to their environments.

AB Accurate determination of feeding habits using only conventional dietary analysis is usually difficult, due to both biases caused by prey digestibility differences and to the discrete aspect of the sampling. However, combining conventional methods with stable isotope analysis provides an integrated view of the assimilated diet. Here, we measured stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15) and sulphur (delta S-34) in feathers of yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis nestlings from 4 colonies along the western Mediterranean coast, where the gulls consume different proportions of marine, terrestrial and garbage resources. We collected and analysed chicks' regurgitates in each colony, thereby determining the isotopic signatures in a significant sample of prey. By applying a mixing model to our isotopic values, we compared the information provided by the 2 methodologies. According to direct prey sampling and the particular conditions of the breeding areas, populations with more enriched PS values consumed a diet richer in marine prey, with lower delta N-15 signatures indicating garbage consumption. The main pattern resulting from the mixing model agreed with direct diet sampling. However, estimated proportions for small-sized prey were controversial, which indicates that small, soft prey items might be underestimated by regurgitate analysis. We conclude that stable isotope signatures and the use of mixing models are useful tools for the rapid assessment of feeding ecology in certain populations. Solving analytical biases should be considered in future feeding studies, thereby saving time and minimising bird disturbance by using an isotopic methodology.

AB 1. As urbanization accelerates, interest is growing in the traits of urban plants. We classified 822 UK vascular plants on the basis of their occurrence along an urban-rural gradient in 26 710 samples of vegetation from 2508 UK 1-km grid squares, including a wide range of rural habitats and Sheffield and Birmingham, two of the UK's largest cities.
   2. Both alien and native species were classified with respect to mean proportion of urban land cover in the 1-km grid squares in which the species occurs (urbanity), and absolute frequency in highly urban grid squares (urban frequency). Bayesian regression models were then developed for both measures, with a wide range of plant traits as explanatory variables.
   3. Results for aliens and natives and for both urban measures were remarkably similar: the single, coherent picture of 'successful urban species' that emerges from our analysis is of robust plants of relatively fertile, dry, unshaded, base-rich habitats. Only seed mass behaved very differently for natives and aliens; seed mass was related positively to success of urban natives, and negatively to success of urban aliens. Neither clonality, seed dispersal nor seed persistence in the soil were strongly linked to success in urban habitats.
   4. Synthesis. Cities can provide opportunities for surprisingly rich floras, but the traits of species that can persist in cities are quite narrowly circumscribed. More generally, it is clear that analysis of traits reveals important patterns in floristic data that would be far from obvious from a purely floristic analysis.

AB Interbreeding between artificially-selected and wild organisms can have negative fitness consequences for the latter. In the Northwest Atlantic, farmed Atlantic salmon recurrently escape into the wild and enter rivers where small, declining populations of wild salmon breed. Most farmed salmon in the region derive from an ancestral source population that occupies a nonacidified river (pH 6.0-6.5). Yet many wild populations with which escaped farmed salmon might interbreed inhabit acidified rivers (pH 4.6-5.2). Using common garden experimentation, and examining two early-life history stages across two generations of interbreeding, we showed that wild salmon populations inhabiting acidified rivers had higher survival at acidified pH than farmed salmon or F-1 farmed-wild hybrids. In contrast, however, there was limited evidence for reduced performance in backcrosses, and F-2 farmed-wild hybrids performed better or equally well to wild salmon. Wild salmon also survived or grew better at nonacidified than acidified pH, and wild and farmed salmon survived equally well at nonacidified pH. Thus, for acid tolerance and the stages examined, we found some evidence both for and against the theory that repeated farmed-wild interbreeding may reduce adaptive genetic variation in the wild and thereby negatively affect the persistence of depleted wild populations.

AB By taking advantage of a recently developed reference marker set for avian genome analysis we have constructed a gene-based genetic map of the collared flycatcher, an important "ecological model" for studies of life-history evolution, sexual selection, speciation and quantiative genetics. A pedigree of 322 birds from a natural population was genotyped for 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 170 protein-coding genes and 71 microsatellites. Altogether, 147 gene markers and 64 microsatellites form 33 linkage groups with a total genetic distance of 1787 cM. Male recombination rates are, on average, 22% higher than female rates (total distance 1982 vs. 1627 cM). The ability to anchor the collared flycatcher map with the chicken genome via the gene-based SNPs revealed an extraordinary degree of both synteny and gene-order conservation during avian evolution. The great majority of chicken chromosomes correspond to a single linkage group in collared flycatchers with only a few cases of inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements. The rate of chromosomal diversification, fissions/fusions,and inversions combined is thus considerably lower in birds (0.05/ MY) than in mammals (0.6-2.0/MY). A dearth of repeat elements, known to promote chromosomal breakage, in avian genomes may contribute to their stability. The degree of genome stability is likely to have important consequences for general evolutionary patterns and may explain, for example, the comparatively slow rate by which genetic incompatibility among lineage of birds evolves.

AB 1. The mechanisms that structure biological communities hold the key to understanding ecosystem functioning and the maintenance of biodiversity. Patterns of species abundances have been proposed as a means of differentiation between niche-based and neutral processes, but abundance information alone cannot provide unequivocal discrimination.
   2. We combined species niche information and species' relative abundances to test the effects of two opposing structuring mechanisms (environmental filtering and niche complementarity) on species' relative abundances in French lacustrine fish communities. The test involved a novel method comparing the abundance-weighted niche overlap within communities against that expected when relative abundances were randomized among species within the community.
   3. Observed overlap was consistently significantly lower than expected at random for two (swimming ability and trophic status) of four primary niche axes across lakes of differing physical environments. Thus, for these niche axes, pairs of abundant species tended to have relatively low niche overlap, while rare species tended to have relatively high niche overlap with abundant species.
   4. This suggests that niche complementarity may have acted to enhance ecosystem function and that it is important for species coexistence in these fish communities. The method used may be easily applied to any sort of biological community and thus may have considerable potential for determining the generality of niche complementarity effects on community structure.

AB Carbon and Nitrogen stable isotopes and stomach contents analyses were used to investigate an estuarine fish food web and identify the contribution of these two methods to the knowledge and understanding of the food web's structure and its functioning. The nine most abundant fish species during the warm period in the Gironde estuary (southwest France, Europe) are examined. Observation of the stomach contents reflects a variety of feeding modes between fish species that consume a diverse assortment of prey, with limited dietary overlap. Nevertheless, when regarding the whole fish community, few prey species dominate the stomach contents. Nitrogen isotope ratios indicate a high intraspecific variability inducing an interspecific covering of the signatures. However, a tendency to delta N-15 enrichment according to the trophic position of the species studied was observed. Fish assemblages show a trend towards enrichment of their carbon isotopic signatures from the upper estuary (-20.8 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand) towards the lower estuary (-18.3 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand). But whatever the capture zone considered, most of the individual delta C-13 values for each fish analysed are comprised between -22 and -16 parts per thousand. Only few specimens, belonging to migratory amphihaline species, have significantly lighter values.
   The stomach contents method of analysis has the advantage of giving an initial view of the ichthyological trophic structure of the system by describing the food relations between a fish species and its prey. From these results, hypotheses can be drawn about the network's functioning, suggesting a sharing of resources between species and a "wasp-waist" control of this estuarine food web. The stable isotope analysis method enables us to improve our structural knowledge by positioning the different species in a food web, with their position being determined by the number of energy transfers (analysis of delta N-15). Conversely, in environments as complex and changing as estuaries, it appears difficult to precisely identify and quantify the sources of the organic matter at the base of the fish estuarine food webs using analysis of delta C-13 isotopic signatures. Nevertheless, the results obtained by using these two methods in parallel suggest that more detailed functional ecological studies could be carried out in future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Life-history theory posits a fundamental trade-off between number and size of offspring that structures the variability in parental investment across and within species. We investigate this 'quantity-quality' trade-off across primates and present evidence that a similar trade-off is also found across natural-fertility human societies. Restating the classic Smith-Fretwell model in terms of allometric scaling of resource supply and offspring investment predicts an inverse scaling relation between birth rate and offspring size and a -1/4 power scaling between birth rate and body size. We show that these theoretically predicted relationships, in particular the inverse scaling between number and size of offspring, tend to hold across increasingly finer scales of analyses (i.e. from mammals to primates to apes to humans). The advantage of this approach is that the quantity-quality trade-off in humans is placed into a general framework of parental investment that follows directly from first principles of energetic allocation.

AB The knowledge of the processes controlling the spatial distribution of species diversity is one of the main challenges of the present ecological research. Spatial patterns of benthic biodiversity in the deep sea are poorly known in comparison with other ecosystems and this limits our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the distribution and maintenance of high biodiversity in the largest ecosystems of our biosphere. Although the Mediterranean basin covers < 1% of the world ocean surface, none the less it hosts > 7.5% of the global biodiversity. The high biogeographic complexity and the presence of steep ecological gradients contribute in making the Mediterranean a region of very high diversity. Here we report the results of an investigation on the patterns of nematode biodiversity in the deep-Mediterranean Sea, in relation with bathymetric, longitudinal and energetic gradients. Our results indicate that benthic biodiversity in the deep-Mediterranean decreases significantly with increasing depth. Moreover, at equally deep sites, nematode diversity decreased from the western to the eastern basin and longitudinal gradients were evident when comparing sites at 4000-m depth, with 3000-m depth. The analysis of the available energy (measured as labile organic matter content of the sediments) suggests that biodiversity patterns are not controlled by the amounts of food resources, but instead bio-availability is the key factor. A more detailed analysis revealed an extremely high deep-sea beta-diversity (turnover diversity), both among sites at different depths as well as at similar depths of different longitude or within the same basin. This new finding has not only important implications on the estimates of the overall regional diversity (gamma diversity), but also suggests the presence of high biogeographic complexity in the deep benthic domain of the Mediterranean Sea.

AB Intense reproductive competition and social instability are assumed to increase concentrations of glucocorticoids and androgens in vertebrates, as a means of coping with these challenges. In seasonally breeding redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus), the mating and the birth season and the associated increased male competition are predicted to pose such reproductive challenges. In this paper, we investigate seasonal variation in hormone excretion in male redfronted lemurs, and examine whether this variation is associated with social or ecological factors. Although dominance status has been shown to affect individual stress levels across many taxa, we predicted no rank-related differences in glucocorticoids for redfronted lemurs because relatively equal costs are associated with both high and low rank positions (based on patterns of rank acquisition/maintenance and threats toward subordinates). Over a 14-month period, we collected behavioral data (1843 focal hours) and 617 fecal samples from 13 redfronted lemur males in Kirindy Forest/Madagascar. We found no general rank-related pattern of testosterone or glucocorticoid excretion in this species. Both hormones were excreted at significantly higher levels during the mating and the birth season, despite social stability during both periods. The elevated mating season levels may be explained by increased within-group reproductive competition during this time and are in line with previous studies of other seasonally reproducing primates. For the birth season increase, we propose that the predictable risk of infanticide in this highly seasonal species affects male gonadal and adrenal endocrine activity. We evaluate alternative social and ecological factors influencing the production of both hormone classes and conclude based on our preliminary investigations that none of them can account for the observed pattern.

AB 1. The non-indigenous species Corbicula flianinea (Muller, 1774) is one of the most invasive bivalves in freshwater ecosystems. This Asian clam was first reported in the River Minho estuary in 1989. After a short period of time, it became the major component of the local benthic fauna in terms of abundance and biomass.
   2. In the autumn of 2004 and 2005, spatial and temporal variations in abundance, biomass and population structure of C. fluminea were investigated at 16 sites in the freshwater subtidal area of the River Minho estuary. Mean abundance and biomass per site ranged from 80 to 4185 ind. m(-2) and 8.5 to 465.9 g AFDW m(-2), respectively.
   3. The environmental characterization of the area was performed through multivariate analysis, which revealed three distinct areas subjected to different abiotic conditions. C. fluminea population structure is well correlated with these three distinct areas.
   4. The combination of several abiotic variables determining C. fluminea biomass distribution was evaluated through a stepwise multiple regression. This model showed that redox potential, nutrient concentrations, hardness, organic matter and sediment characteristics explained almost 60% of the variation in C. fluminea biomass in the freshwater subtidal area of the River Minho estuary (R-2 = 59.3%, F-[9,F-86] = 13.9, p < 0.001).
   5. Improved ecological knowledge is essential for future C. fluminea management, in order to protect local habitats and biodiversity, and to reduce the economic impact of this non-indigenous invasive species. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Marine conservation programs in Oceania are increasingly turning to precautionary and adaptive management, particularly approaches which emphasize local participation and customary management. Although the application of community-based natural resource management is widespread in the region, the full integration of local knowledge and practices into the design, implementation, and monitoring of community-based conservation programs has been limited. There is also little empirical data to show whether or not community-based conservation projects are meeting their stated objectives. This paper summarizes an integrated method for selecting Marine Protected Area (MPA) sites and presents empirical evidence that illustrates how an MPA that was largely conceived using indigenous ecological knowledge and existing sea tenure governance (i.e., customary management practices), as part of a regional precautionary and adaptive community-based management plan, is showing signs of biological and social success. More generally, the paper shows how hybrid natural and social research approaches in tandem with customary management for designing MPAs can protect coral reefs in Oceania.

AB Invasive species richness often is negatively correlated with native species richness at the small spatial scale of sampling plots, but positively correlated in larger areas. The pattern at small scales has been interpreted as evidence that native plants can competitively exclude invasive species. Large-scale patterns have been understood to result from environmental heterogeneity, among other causes. We investigated species richness patterns among submerged and floating-leaved aquatic plants (87 native species and eight invasives) in 103 temperate lakes in Connecticut (northeastern USA) and found neither a consistently negative relationship at small (3-m(2)) scales, nor a positive relationship at large scales. Native species richness at sampling locations was uncorrelated with invasive species richness in 37 of the 60 lakes where invasive plants occurred; richness was negatively correlated in 16 lakes and positively correlated in seven. No correlation between native and invasive species richness was found at larger spatial scales (whole lakes and counties). Increases in richness with area were uncorrelated with abiotic heterogeneity. Logistic regression showed that the probability of occurrence of five invasive species increased in sampling locations (3 m(2), n = 2980 samples) where native plants occurred, indicating that native plant species richness provided no resistance against invasion. However, the probability of three invasive species' occurrence declined as native plant density increased, indicating that density, if not species richness, provided some resistance with these species. Density had no effect on occurrence of three other invasive species. Based on these results, native species may resist invasion at small spatial scales only in communities where density is high (i.e., in communities where competition among individuals contributes to community structure). Most hydrophyte communities, however, appear to be maintained in a nonequilibrial condition by stress and/or disturbance. Therefore, most aquatic plant communities in temperate lakes are likely to be vulnerable to invasion.

AB 1. The stress gradient hypothesis suggests a shift from predominant competition to facilitation along gradients of increasing environmental severity. This shift is proposed to cause parallel changes from prevailing spatial segregation to aggregation among the species within a community.
   2. We used 904 1-m(2) plots, each subdivided into 100 10 x 10 cm, or 25 20 x 20 cm cells, respectively, from 67 European mountain summits grouped into 18 regional altitudinal transects, to test this hypothesized correlation between fine-scale spatial patterns and environmental severity.
   3. The data were analysed by first calculating standardized differences between observed and simulated random co-occurrence patterns for each plot. These standardized effect sizes were correlated to indicators of environmental severity by means of linear mixed models. In a factorial design, separate analyses were made for four different indicators of environmental severity (the mean temperature of the coldest month, the temperature sum of the growing season, the altitude above tree line, and the percentage cover of vascular plants in the whole plot), four different species groups (all species, graminoids, herbs, and all growth forms considered as pseudospecies) and at the 10 x 10 cm and 20 x 20 cm grain sizes.
   4. The hypothesized trends were generally weak and could only be detected by using the mean temperature of the coldest month or the percentage cover of vascular plants as the indicator of environmental severity. The spatial arrangement of the full species set proved more responsive to changes in severity than that of herbs or graminoids. The expected trends were more pronounced at a grain size of 10 x 10 cm than at 20 x 20 cm.
   5. Synthesis. In European alpine plant communities the relationships between small-scale co-occurrence patterns of vascular plants and environmental severity are weak and variable. This variation indicates that shifts in net interactions with environmental severity may differ among indicators of severity, growth forms and scales. Recognition of such variation may help to resolve some of the current debate surrounding the stress gradient hypothesis.

AB At small scales, areas with high native diversity are often resistant to invasion, while at large scales, areas with more native species harbor more exotic species, suggesting that different processes control the relationship between native and exotic species diversity at different spatial scales. Although the small-scale negative relationship between native and exotic diversity has a satisfactory explanation, we lack a mechanistic explanation for the change in relationship to positive at large scales. We investigated the native-exotic diversity relationship at three scales (range: 1-4000 km(2)) in California serpentine, a system with a wide range in the productivity of sites from harsh to lush. Native and exotic diversity were positively correlated at all three scales; it is rarer to detect a positive relationship at the small scales within which interactions between individuals occur. However, although positively correlated on average, the small-scale relationship between native and exotic diversity was positive at low-productivity sites and negative at high-productivity sites: Thus, the change in the relationship between native and exotic diversity does not depend on spatial scale per se, but occurs whenever environmental conditions change to promote species coexistence rather than competitive exclusion. This occurred within a single spatial scale when the environment shifted from being locally unproductive to productive.

AB Neutral community theory explains biodiversity, i.e. the coexistence of several species, as the result of a stochastic balance between immigration and extinction on a local level, and between speciation and extinction on a regional level. The most popular model, presented by Hubbell in 2001, has seen many analytical developments in recent years, which can be used in model analysis, model testing and model comparison. We review these developments here, and present alternative derivations and shine previously unnoticed lights on them.

AB We used stable C and N isotope ratios of tissues from 29 fish species from a large subtropical lagoon in southern Brazil to examine spatial variability in isotopic composition and vertical trophic structure across freshwater and estuarine habitats. Nitrogen isotope ratios indicated a smooth gradation in trophic positions among species, with most fishes occupying the secondary and tertiary consumer level. Fish assemblages showed a significant shift in their carbon isotopic signatures between freshwater and estuarine sites. Depleted carbon signatures (from -24.7 parts per thousand., to - 17.8 parts per thousand) were found in freshwater, whereas more enriched signatures (from - 19.1 parts per thousand to - 12.3 parts per thousand) were obtained within the estuarine zone downstream. Based on our survey of the C-3 and C-4 plants and isotopic values for phytoplankton and benthic microalgae reported for ecosystems elsewhere, we hypothesized that the observed delta C-13 differences in the fish assemblage between freshwater and estuarine sites is due to a shift from assimilating organic matter ultimately derived from C-3 freshwater marsh vegetation and phytoplankton at the freshwater site (delta C-13 ranging from -25 parts per thousand to - 19 parts per thousand), to C-4 salt-marsh (e.g. Spartina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton at the estuarine sites (from - 18 parts per thousand to - 12 parts per thousand). Our results suggested that fish assemblages are generally supported by autochthonous primary production. Freshwater fishes that likely were displaced downstream into the estuary during periods of high freshwater discharge had depleted delta C-13 values that were characteristic of the upper lagoon. These results suggest that spatial foodweb subsidies can occur within the lagoon. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The results of predictive vegetation models are often presented spatially as GIS-derived surfaces of vegetation attributes across a landscape or region, but spatial information is rarely included in the model itself. Geographically weighted regression (GWR), which extends the traditional regression framework by allowing regression coefficients to vary for individual locations ('spatial non-stationarity'), is one method of utilizing spatial information to improve the predictive power of such models. In this paper, we compare the ability of GWR, a local model, with that of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression, a global model, to predict patterns of montane ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) basal area in Saguaro National Park, AZ, USA on the basis of variables related to topography (elevation, slope steepness, aspect) and fire history (fire frequency, time since fire).
   The localized regression coefficients exhibited significant non-stationarity for four of the five environmental variables, and the GWR model consequently described the vegetation-environment data significantly better, even after accounting for differences in model complexity. GWR also reduced observed spatial autocorrelation of the model residuals. When applied to independent data locations not used in model development, basal areas predicted by GWR had a closer fit to observed values with lower residuals than those from the optimal OLS regression model. GWR also provided insights into fine-scale controls of ponderosa pine pattern that were missed by the global model. For example, the relationship between ponderosa pine basal area and aspect, which was obscured in the OLS regression model due to non-stationarity, was clearly demonstrated by the GWR model. We thus see GWR as a valuable complement to the many other global methods currently in use for predictive vegetation modeling.

The regional model was calibrated with ground surface temperature data and tested using ground temperature data from four shallow boreholes and a rock glacier inventory. The results indicate widespread mountain permafrost at elevations above 800-900 m a.s.l. in northern and eastern Iceland. According to the regional map, the mountain permafrost zone covers c. 8000 km 2 which is about 8% of the country's land area. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Birds are common predators of arthropods in many ecosystems but their impact on spiders has not been assessed. Therefore, the experimental evidence for bird predation effects on spider populations was examined. In particular, the present review focuses on the questions: what are the ecological mechanisms and what are the evolutionary consequences? Data from 17 field experiments, mainly in forest ecosystems, showed that spider communities were often significantly affected by bird predation. Comparisons of experimental effects were based on the ratio of mean density on experimentally enclosed vegetation and on controls. In 27 tests, a significant effect was detected (mean ratio 3.03) but in 9 tests the effect was nonsignificant (mean ratio 1.03). Furthermore, field experimental studies on bird predation effects on certain spider species or certain genera were reviewed. In three investigations, significant predation effects were found on agelenid, linyphiid and theridiid spiders but there were no significant effects on lycosids. Selective bird predation on large individuals has been shown in studies on spider communities and single species. Data on bird predation effects on species richness were lacking although impact on large species was expected to be important. Three field experiments showed that different spider families may experience differences in bird predation pressure. An aviary experiment showed that frequently moving spiders had a higher risk of predation than sedentary individuals, but the evidence from field experiments supporting the hypothesis of high predation pressure on moving spiders was limited. This included sex-specific differences in size and movement, although at least one experiment showed that males had higher winter mortality than females. One experiment showed that bird predation can affect anti-predator behavior. In conclusion, the present evidence showed that bird predation on spiders in several contrasting forest ecosystems is strong. However, there are many hypotheses regarding bird predation on spider populations that should be examined in future field experiments.

AB The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is invasive worldwide, has displaced indigenous species on the west coast of South Africa and now threatens Perna perna on the south coast. We tested the hypothesis that Mytilus will replace Perna by examining changes in their distribution on shores where they co-exist. Total cover, adult density, recruit density, recruit/adult correlations and mean maximum lengths of both species were measured in 2001 at two contrasting sites (Plettenberg Bay and Tsitsikamma) 70 km apart, each including two locations 100 in apart. Cover and density were measured again in 2004. Total mussel abundance was significantly lower in Tsitsikamma, and recruit density was only 17% that of Plettenberg Bay. Abundance and cover increased upshore for Mytilus, but decreased for Perna, giving Mytilus higher adult and recruit density and total cover than Perna in the upper zones. Low shore densities of recruits and adults were similar between species but cover was lower for Mytilus, reflecting its smaller size, and presumably slower growth or higher mortality there. Thus, mechanisms excluding species differed among zones. Recruitment limitation delays invasion at Tsitsikamma and excludes Perna from the high shore, while Mytilus is excluded from the low shore by post-recruitment effects. Recruitment limitation also shapes population structure. Recruit/adult correlations were significant only where adult densities were low, and this effect was species-specific. Thus, at low densities, larvae settle or survive better near adult conspecifics. After 3 years, these patterns remained strongly evident, suggesting Mytilus will not eliminate Perna and that co-existence is possible through partial habitat segregation driven by recruitment limitation of Perna on the high shore and post-settlement effects on Mytilus on the low shore.

AB The extent to which plant communities are determined by resource availability is a central theme in ecosystem science, but patterns of small-scale variation in resource availability are poorly known. Studies of carbon (C) and nutrient cycling provide insights into factors limiting tree growth and forest productivity. To investigate rates of tropical forest litter production and decomposition in relation to nutrient availability and topography in the absence of confounding large-scale variation in climate and altitude we quantified nutrient fluxes via litterfall and leaf litter decomposition within three distinct floristic associations of tropical rain forest growing along a soil fertility gradient at the Sepilok Forest Reserve (SFR), Sabah, Malaysia. The quantity and nutrient content of small litter decreased along a gradient of soil nutrient availability from alluvial forest (most fertile) through sandstone forest to heath forest (least fertile). Temporal variation in litterfall was greatest in the sandstone forest, where the amount of litter was correlated negatively with rainfall in the previous month. Mass loss and N and P release were fastest from alluvial forest litter, and slowest from heath forest litter. All litter types decomposed most rapidly in the alluvial forest. Stand-level N and P use efficiencies (ratios of litter dry mass to nutrient content) were greatest for the heath forest followed by the sandstone ridge, sandstone valley and alluvial forests, respectively. We conclude that nutrient supply limits productivity most in the heath forest and least in the alluvial forest. Nutrient supply limited productivity in sandstone forest, especially on ridge and hill top sites where nutrient limitation may be exacerbated by reduced rates of litter decomposition during dry periods. The fluxes of N and P varied significantly between the different floristic communities at SFR and these differences may contribute to small-scale variation in species composition.

AB One of the more vexing issues in ecology is how historical processes affect contemporary patterns of biodiversity. Accordingly, few models have been presented. Two corollary models (centre of origin, time-for-speciation) can be used to make quantitative predictions characterizing the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis and describe diversification as diffusion and subsequent cladogenesis of species away from the place of origin of a higher taxon in the tropics. Predictions derived from such models are: (i) species richness declines toward the periphery of the range of a higher taxon; (ii) taxa are more derived toward the periphery than the centre; (iii) ages of taxa are lower toward the periphery than the centre; and (iv) ages and measures of derivedness are less variable toward the periphery of the range of a higher taxon. I tested these predictions to better understand the formation of one of the most ubiquitous patterns of biodiversity-the latitudinal gradient in species richness. Results indicate well-supported predictions for New World leaf-nosed bats and that diversification has had strong influences on latitudinal gradients of species richness. A better understanding of how evolutionary diversification of taxa contributes to formation of patterns of species richness along environmental gradients is necessary to fully understand spatial variation in biodiversity.

AB As invasive plants become a greater threat to native ecosystems, we need to improve our understanding of the factors underlying their success and persistence. Over the past 30 years, the C-3 nonnative plant Bromus inermis (smooth brome) has been spreading throughout the central grasslands in North America. Invasion by this grass has resulted in the local displacement of natives, including the tallgrass species Panicum virgatum (switchgrass). To determine if factors related to resource availability and plant-soil interactions were conferring a competitive advantage on smooth brome, field plots were set up under varying nitrogen (N) levels. Plots composed of a 1:1 ratio of smooth brome and switchgrass were located in a restored tallgrass prairie and were randomly assigned one of the following three N levels: (a) NH4NO3 added to increase available N, (b) sucrose added to reduce available N, and (c) no additions to serve as control. In addition, soil N status, soil respiration rates, plant growth, and litter decomposition rates were monitored. Results indicate that by the 2nd year, the addition of sucrose significantly reduced available soil N and additions of NH4NO3 increased it. Further, smooth brome had greater tiller density, mass, and canopy interception of light on N-enriched soils, whereas none of these characteristics were stimulated by added N in the case of switchgrass. This suggests that smooth brome may have a competitive advantage on higher-N soils. Smooth-brome plant tissue also had a lower carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratio and a higher decomposition rate than switchgrass and thus may cycle N more rapidly in the plant-soil system. These differences suggest a possible mechanism for the persistence of smooth brome in the tallgrass prairie: Efficient recycling of nutrient-rich litter under patches of smooth brome may confer a competitive advantage that enables it to persist in remnant or restored prairies. Increased N deposition associated with human activity and changing land use may play a critical role in the persistence of smooth brome and other N-philic exotic species.

AB Distinguishing the roles of propagule limitation and niche requirements in controlling plant species distributions is important for understanding community structure, invasion, and restoration. We used species distribution models based on plant and environmental survey data to assess the strength of species' affinities for particular environmental conditions. We hypothesized that species with statistically detectable environmental requirements were primarily niche-limited, while species with weak habitat affinities were primarily propagule-limited. We tested this hypothesis via a seeding experiment in which we compared species' reproductive fitness in occupied and unoccupied sites. Species that appeared to be niche-limited based on distribution models had lower fitness when planted in unoccupied sites, while species that models suggested were propagule-limited had equivalent fitness when planted in occupied and unoccupied sites. Our results demonstrate that within a single community, both species limited primarily by niche availability or primarily by propagule availability can be identified using observational data.

AB The North American historic phytogeographic distribution of mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) and Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum), two invasive perennial species introduced from Eurasia and East Asia respectively, was recreated using herbarium records. The putative initial introduction of these two species differs by c.a. 400 years, but their patterns of geographic distribution, introduction pathways, and local dispersal pathways are similar. Both species showed the expected logistic growth relationship between range size and the time following introduction, with lag phases of nearly 400 and 50 years for mugwort and Japanese knotweed respectively. The intrinsic growth rate was greater in Japanese knotweed than mugwort for the US, Canada, and North America. Both species were frequently found along waterway, railroad, and road rights-of-way. Introduction pathways differed, with Japanese knotweed commonly labeled as an ornamental escape (151 collections), while mugwort was commonly cited as an inadvertent component of ship ballast (20 collections). These potential founding populations were located across the final distribution for both species, suggesting anthropogenic large-scale dispersal across North America with local secondary spread. Range expansion appears to be active for both species in the US while nearing the carrying capacity in Canada. Managers of mugwort and Japanese knotweed can make use of this information on their range expansion dynamics and dispersal pathways by reducing anthropogenic dispersal and focusing resources on satellite populations and invasion corridors.

AB Large-scale processes are known to be important for patterns of species richness, yet the ways in which local and larger scale processes interact is not clear. I used metacommunities consisting of five interconnected microbial aquatic communities to examine the manner in which processes at different scales affect local and metacommunity richness. Specifically, I manipulated the potential dispersal rate, whether dispersal was localized or global, and variation in initial community composition. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed that a low dispersal rate and intermediate distance dispersal enhanced local richness. Initial assembly variation had no effect on local richness, while a lack of dispersal or global dispersal reduced local richness. At the metacommunity scale, richness was enhanced throughout the time course of the experiment by initial compositional variation and was reduced by high or global dispersal. The effects of dispersal were contingent on the presence of initial compositional variation. The treatments also affected individual species occupancy patterns, with some benefiting from large-scale processes and others being adversely impacted. These results indicate that the effects of dispersal on species richness have a complex relationship with scale and are not solely divisible into "regional" vs. "local" scales. Finally, predictions of the manner in which dispersal rate structures communities appear dependent upon species compositional variation among communities.

AB In contrast to many other western European countries, the knowledge about trends in the Swedish butter-fly fauna is poor. We studied the effects of habitat and species characteristics on species turnover in 13 grassland sites in southern Sweden by comparing species richness and compositions at two separate occasions with an interval of 21 years. The mean number of species per site decreased from 30 to 24, with a large variation between sites. The number of extinctions was highest in sites where the proportion of trees and shrubs had increased most, but there was no detectable effect of area or of the composition of landscapes surrounding the sites. Areas protected as nature reserves had lost as many species as unprotected areas had, indicating both the importance of proper management of nature reserves and that nature reserves alone may not be enough to inhibit regional extinction of butterfly species. Species dependent on nutrient-poor conditions tended to decrease while species dependent on nutrient-rich conditions tended to increase, indicating a negative effect of increased soil nitrogen levels resulting from active fertilizing of pastures and/or atmospheric nitrogen deposition. A regular monitoring program could show whether our results are representative for Sweden or Northern Europe. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Complex vegetation structure and floristic composition heterogeneity increase niche diversity, which is thought to also increase avian diversity. Woodland avifauna from the Sieff a de Guadarrama, Madrid, was studied during spring 2003 to test whether floristic composition and structure of mixed oak-pine forests provided a suitable environment to sustain a specialized avian community that differed in species composition from those of pure pinewoods and oak woodlands. Habitat selection patterns of each species, as well as the intensity with which they selected their preferred habitat were also studied.
   Bird species richness was significantly higher in mixed oak-pine forests than in pinewoods, whereas differences in avian abundance among the three forest types were not clear. No species preferred or exclusively used mixed transitions. Therefore, slight increases in avian abundance and species richness within mixed forests were explained through the assemblage of both typical oakwood and pinewood avifauna. The results are discussed in the context of the general impoverishment of Nearctic-Palaearctic bird species in the southwestern Palaearctic margin, and the high spatiotemporal fluctuations that mixed transitions have suffered since the Quaternary period.
   The results highlighted the importance of forest maturity, low altitudinal position of forests and, diversity and development (cover and height) of the shrub layer for forest birds in the region. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In attempting to determine the traits associated with invasive plant species, ecologists have often used species native to the invaded range as "control species." Because many native species themselves are aggressive colonizers, comparisons using this type of control do not necessarily yield information relevant to distinctions between invasive and noninvasive species. Here we implement an alternative study design that compares phenological, architectural, size, and fitness traits of several introduced invasive species to introduced noninvasive species within two genera of Asteraceae (Crepis and Centaurea). While there were many significant differences between the genera, there were few shared attributes among invasive or noninvasive congeners, even for traits as seemingly important as the number of inflorescences produced and the size of seed heads. Instead, the results suggest that differences in invasiveness between closely related species is better explained as the result of complex trait interactions and specific introduction histories.

AB Eddy covariance records hold great promise for understanding the processes controlling the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE). However, NEE is the small difference between two large fluxes: photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. Consequently, separating NEE into its component fluxes, and determining the process-level controls over these fluxes, is a difficult problem. In this study, we used a model-data synthesis approach with the Simplified PnET (SIPNET) flux model to extract process-level information from 5 years of eddy covariance data at an evergreen forest in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. SIPNET runs at a twice-daily time step, and has two vegetation carbon pools, a single aggregated soil carbon pool, and a soil moisture submodel that models both evaporation and transpiration. By optimizing the model parameters before evaluating model-data mismatches, we were able to probe the model structure independent of any arbitrary parameter set. In doing so, we were able to learn about the primary controls over NEE in this ecosystem, and in particular the respiration component of NEE. We also used this parameter optimization, coupled with a formal model selection criterion, to investigate the effects of making hypothesis-driven changes to the model structure. These experiments lent support to the hypotheses that (1) photosynthesis, and possibly foliar respiration, are down-regulated when the soil is frozen and (2) the metabolic processes of soil microbes vary in the summer and winter, possibly because of the existence of distinct microbial communities at these two times. Finally, we found that including water vapor fluxes, in addition to carbon fluxes, in the parameter optimization did not yield significantly more information about the partitioning of NEE into gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration.

AB 1 The relationship of productivity to species diversity is usually positive at regional scales, but is often neutral, unimodal or negative at local spatial scales. Recent studies have pointed out that beta diversity, or among-locality and within-region variation in species composition, must therefore tend to increase with productivity.
   2 We tested for a positive relationship of productivity to beta diversity in herbaceous plants at 105 widely distributed sites on serpentine soil in California. We also asked whether any such pattern could be explained, as previously proposed, by increased environmental heterogeneity at higher levels of productivity.
   3 We found that one measure of beta diversity (the species dissimilarity between paired 500 m(2) plots on adjacent north and south slopes) was positively related to productivity (as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index, a remotely sensed index). However, this effect was not strong enough to transform the neutral relationship of productivity with alpha (1 m(2)) diversity to a positive relationship of productivity with gamma (1000 m(2)) diversity.
   4 The positive effect of productivity on beta diversity was not related to increasing heterogeneity in coarse measures of vegetation structure (percentage cover of shade, litter, rocks, moss, bare soil, animal disturbance). We speculate that the effect may instead have a 'top-down' explanation: higher beta diversity may be caused by the positive influence of productivity on the size of the regional species pool.
   5 Our study illustrates the principle of a 'scale transition', in which an ecological pattern is qualitatively different at different spatial scales. Careful attention to scale-dependence may help narrow the search for mechanisms for such long-studied ecological puzzles as the latitudinal diversity gradient.

AB Viewing river systems within a landscape context is a relatively new and rapidly developing approach to river ecology. Although the linkages among landscapes and associated physicochemical and biological characteristics of rivers have long been recognized, the development of conceptual frameworks and tools for measuring and synthesizing such linkages is relatively recent. In this book, authors from the United States and Canada explore new ideas about landscape-river relationships, river research, and river management; compile large regional, spatially referenced, survey data sets on river network characteristics; explore and describe patterns and relationships across survey sites, reaches, and catchments; and develop management and decision tools. In synthesizing these chapters, we have identified key challenges to studying and managing landscape-river systems. Key challenges include identifying appropriate units of measurement and interpretation of the river network, understanding how human alterations of land cover modify river characteristics and biological assemblages, understanding and measuring how various spatial-scale factors interactively influence instream habitat and biota, and collecting and gathering appropriate landscape and instream habitat data. This book also reveals the major current knowledge gaps that deserve more attention in landscape-river ecology. These include improving river-landscape classification, capturing appropriate spatial- and temporal-scale data, developing accurate predictive models where study data are limited, and improving our ability to measure connectivity among river segments and their networks. Future research that focuses on overcoming the challenges and filling the knowledge gaps will substantially improve our understanding of river ecosystems, fuel the development of tools for linking the functions and processes operating at different spatial- and temporal-scales, and stimulate the development of new hypotheses and frameworks to provide foundations for the next phases of riverine science and management.

AB Human-caused habitat destruction and modification constitute one of the largest threats to population persistence and biodiversity, and are also suspected to be the major cause behind the global decline of amphibian populations. We assessed the potential role of agriculture-related habitat fragmentation on population size and genetic variability in the common frog (Rana temporaria) by recording the occurrence, population density and genetic diversity in three geographically disparate regions in Sweden - each containing landscapes of high and low agricultural activity - and related these to landscape variables extracted from digital maps. We found a highly significant region-by-landscape interaction in occurrence, population density and genetic diversity revealing a reversed response to agriculture from south to north: while the effects of agriculture on R. temporaria populations were negative in the south, there were no effects in the central region, whereas positive effects were observed in the north. Spatial autocorrelation analyses of genetic data revealed that populations in high agricultural activity areas were more isolated than populations in low activity areas both in the southern and central regions of Sweden. Landscape diversity showed a strong positive correlation with both density and occurrence of frogs in Sweden as a whole, as well as in the southern region. Also, negative effects of roads and positive effects of ditches on genetic diversity were found in the south. Overall, these results suggest clear but regionally opposite effects of habitat structure on the population size and genetic diversity of amphibian populations. This means that the management strategy aiming to maximize the size and genetic diversity of local common frog populations, and perhaps also those of other amphibian populations, should account for regional differences in existing land-use patterns.

AB Matrix quality affects probability of persistence in habitat patches in landscape simulation models while empirical studies show that both urban and agricultural land uses affect forest birds. However, due to the fact that forest bird abundance and species richness can be strongly influenced by local habitat factors, it is difficult to analyze matrix effects without confounding effects from such factors. Given this, our objectives were to (1) relate human-dominated land uses to forest bird abundance and species richness without confounding effects from other factors; (2) determine the scale at which forest birds respond to the matrix; and (3) identify whether certain bird migratory strategies or habitat associations vary in richness or abundance as a function of urban and agriculture land uses. Birds were surveyed at a single point count site 100 m from the edge of 23 deciduous forest patches near Ottawa, Ontario. Land uses surrounding each patch were measured within increasingly large circles from 200 to 5000 m radius around the bird survey site. Regression results suggest that effects of urban and agricultural land uses on forest birds (1) are not uniformly positive or negative, (2) can occur at different spatial scales, and (3) differentially affect certain groups of species. In general, agriculture appeared to affect species at a broad spatial scale (within 5 km), while urban land use had an impact at both a narrower spatial scale (within 1.8 km) and at the broad scale. Neotropical and short distance migrant birds seemed to be the most sensitive to land use intensification within the matrix. Limiting urban land use within approximately 200-1800 m of forest patches would be beneficial for Neotropical migrant birds, which are species of growing conservation concern in temperate North America.

AB Preventing and controlling exotic plants remains a key challenge in any ecological restoration, and most efforts are currently aimed at local scales. We combined local- and landscape-scale approaches to identify factors that were most closely associated with invasion of riparian forests by exotic shrubs (Amur honeysuckle [Lonicera maackii] and Tatarian honeysuckle [L. tatarica]) in Ohio, U.S.A. Twenty sites were selected in mature riparian forests along a rural-urban gradient (< 1-47% urban land cover). Within each site, we measured percent cover of Lonicera spp. and native trees and shrubs, percent canopy cover, and facing edge aspect. We then developed 10 a priori models based on local- and landscape-level variables that we hypothesized would influence percent cover of Lonicera spp. within 25 m of the forest edge. To determine which of these models best fit the data, we used an information-theoretic approach and Akaike's information criterion. Percent cover of Lonicera was best explained by the proportion of urban land cover within 1 km of riparian forests. In particular, percent cover of Lonicera was greater in forests within more urban landscapes than in forests within rural landscapes. Results suggest that surrounding land uses influence invasion by exotic shrubs, and explicit consideration of land uses may improve our ability to predict or limit invasion. Moreover, identifying land uses that increase the risk of invasion may inform restoration efforts.

AB Question: What conditions are required for evolution of predator-specific inducible defences?
   Hypotheses: (1) Prey organisms distinguish among predators to which they are exposed. (2). P Prey individuals with a predator-specific defence must attain higher survivorship than those with a mismatched defensive phenotype.
   Organisms: Prey, anuran tadpoles (Rana pirica); biting type predator, dragonfly larvae (Aeshna nigroflava); swallowing type predator, salamander larvae (Hynobius retardatus).
   Methods: Rana pirica tadpoles were exposed to the predator signal in close proximity to or remote from the dragonfly larvae or the salamander larvae to determine whether the tadpoles develop predator-specific morphologies and whether they utilize predator-specific signals in the induction process. We conducted predation trials to determine whether the tadpoles with induced phenotypes were more resistant to the attack in the corresponding predator environment.
   Results: Rana pirica tadpoles developed predator-specific morphologies in response to exposure to two different types of predator. The tadpoles discriminated between the predators that is, different signals were required to develop the specific phenotypes in the induction process. The survival rate of tadpoles of specific phenotypes was higher than that of tadpoles of mismatched or non-induced phenotypes when exposed to predation by the corresponding predators.

AB 1. The stable carbon isotope ratio delta(13)C is a useful tracer of energy flow in lake food webs, and the zooplankton signature is commonly used to establish a baseline for the pelagic habitat. However, sources of temporal variability in the delta(13)C of different zooplankton taxa are rarely considered.
   2. Here, we investigate to what extent temporal variation in the delta(13)C of particulate organic matter (POM) (<41 mum) and the C : N of zooplankton can explain the temporal variability in delta(13)C of freshwater zooplankton. We compare temporal patterns of delta(13)C and C : N for Daphnia, Hesperodiaptomus franciscanus and Leptodiaptomus tyrelli over a 6-month period at four sites in two oligotrophic lakes.
   3. In all three taxa, seasonal variation in zooplankton C : N explained more of the variation in zooplankton delta(13)C than did the delta(13)C of POM. This suggests that variation in the lipid content of zooplankton can strongly influence temporal variation of delta(13)C in zooplankton.
   4. Using these data, we evaluate procedures that estimate the delta(13)C of only the non-lipid component of zooplankton. If zooplankton lipids are primarily dietary in origin, than extracting lipids or 'normalising'delta(13)C based on C : N will exclude a major dietary source, and therefore may be inappropriate.
   5. We conclude that temporal variation in body composition (C : N) of zooplankton can significantly influence the temporal variation of zooplankton delta(13)C signatures.

AB Most ecologists acknowledge that plants are subject to complex interactions between both below- and aboveground dwelling animals. However, these complex interactions are seldomly investigated simultaneously. In a factorial common garden experiment we tested single and combined effects of decomposers, root herbivores and leaf herbivores on the growth, flower visitation, and abundance of naturally colonizing aphids and parasitoids on wild mustard ( Sinapis arvensis). We found that the individual presence of either root herbivores or decomposers resulted in increased aphid abundance, demonstrating that the same aboveground plant-insect interaction can be released by different belowground processes. Enhanced aphid densities caused higher numbers of parasitoids. Furthermore, decomposers increased plant growth and plant fitness ( measured as the number of seeds produced), indicating that mustard may benefit from nutrients provided by decomposers, regardless whether plants are attacked by root herbivores or leaf herbivores, or both simultaneously. More flower visits were observed in plants attacked by root herbivores but without leaf herbivores than in plants with both herbivores, suggesting that root herbivory can modify flower attractivity to pollinators. Our results suggest that patterns in plant-insect interactions above the ground are not only affected by aboveground factors but also by a wealth of different belowground processes mediated by the plant.

AB The landscape within the Chesapeake Bay watershed has been and continues to be impacted by human modifications. Understanding if such anthropogenic disturbances influence organisms that are dependent upon estuarine wetlands remains unclear. We developed an index of marsh bird community integrity (IMBCI) to evaluate marsh bird communities and wetland condition. During the 2002 and 2003 summers, we detected 30 bird species at 219 point count locations distributed among 96 wetlands. lMBCI scores for each wetland were used to determine whether wetland habitat characteristics and urban/suburban development, agriculture, and forest at three different spatial scales (watershed, 1000-m buffer, and 500-m buffer) influenced marsh bird community integrity. We found no relationship between lMBCI scores and wetland habitat characteristics, implying that marsh bird community integrity is not related to any single plant community. Nonparametric changepoint analysis indicated that marsh bird community integrity was significantly reduced when the amount of urban/suburban development within 500 m and 1000 m of the marsh exceeded 14% and 25%, respectively. There was no effect of urban/suburban development on lMBCI scores at the watershed scale. The results of our study demonstrate that marsh bird community integrity shows a threshold response to urban/suburban development at local scales. lMBCI scores, combined with the identification of a land-use threshold, can be easy to interpret and may help communicate complex ecological data to natural resource managers and conservation planners.

AB Cloud forests are distributed in the Neotropics, from northern Mexico to Argentina, under very specific ecological conditions, namely slopes with high humidity input from clouds and mist. Its distribution in Mesoamerica is highly fragmented, similar to an archipelago, and taxa are thus frequently represented as sets of isolated populations, each restricted to particular mountain ranges and often showing a high degree of divergence, both morphologically and genetically. The common bush-tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus, Aves Thraupidae) inhabits cloud forests from eastern and southern Mexico south to northwestern Argentina. Here we use 676 bp of mtDNA (around the ATPase 8 gene) to explore the genetic variation and phylogeographic structure of the Mexican populations of C ophthalmicus. Phylogenctic analyses of mtDNA sequences indicate deep genetic structure. Five major clades, which segregate according to geographic breaks, are identified (starting from the deepest one in the phylogeny): (1) Southern Chiapas and Northern Central America, (2) Tuxtlas massif, (3) Sierra Madre del Sur, (4) Eastern Oaxaca and Northern Chiapas, and (5) Sierra Madre Oriental. The long history of isolation undergone by each clade, as suggested by the phylogeny, implies that the species status of each of them should be revised. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although predation avoidance is the most commonly invoked explanation for vertebrate social evolution, there is little evidence that individuals in larger groups experience lower predation rates than those in small groups. We compare the morphological and behavioural traits of mammal prey species in the Tai forest, Ivory Coast, with the diet preferences of three of their non-human predators: leopards, chimpanzees and African crowned eagles. Individual predators show marked differences in their predation rates on prey species of different body sizes, but clear patterns with prey behaviour were apparent only when differences in prey habitat use were incorporated into the analyses. Leopard predation rates are highest for terrestrial species living in smaller groups, whereas eagle predation rates are negatively correlated with group size only among arboreal prey. When prey predation rates are summed over all three predators, terrestrial species incur higher predation rates than arboreal species and, within both categories, predation rates decline with increasing prey group size and decreasing density of groups in the habitat. These results reveal that it is necessary to consider anti-predator strategies in the context of a dynamic behavioural interaction between predators and prey.

AB Spatial flows of materials and organisms across ecosystem boundaries are ubiquitous. Understanding the consequences of these flows should be a basic goal of ecosystem science, and yet it has received scant theoretical treatment to date. Here, using a simple, open, nutrient-limited ecosystem model with trophic interactions, we explore theoretically how spatial flows affect the functioning of local ecosystems, how physical mass-balance constraints interact with biological demographic constraints in the regulation of this functioning, and how failure to consider these constraints explicitly can lead to models that are ecologically inconsistent. In particular, we show that standard prey-dependent models for trophic interactions may lead to implausible outcomes when embedded in an ecosystem context with appropriate mass flows and mass-balance constraints. Our analysis emphasizes the need for integration of population, community, and ecosystem perspectives in ecology and the critical consequences of assuming closed versus open systems.

AB The Indochinese box turtle Cuora galbinifrons is a polytypic, critically endangered species from Vietnam, Laos, and Hainan Island, China. We analyze up to 1790 bp of mitochondrial DNA under maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood criteria to test if the five historically recognized subspecies represent evolutionary lineages, and to elucidate the relationship of C galbinifrons to other Cuora. C galbinifrons is composed of three major mitochondrial DNA clades corresponding to the three subspecies galbinifrons, bourreti, and picturata. These three lineages are also morphologically diagnosable, and consequently we recommend elevating each to full species. Cuora galbinifrons hainanensis nests within the galbinifrons clade, and we retain it as a synonym of galbinifrons, as supported by morphology. Cuora "serrata" is known to be a hybrid of male Cuora mouhotii and female C galbinifrons, and our findings show that C "serrata" originates from both female galbinifrons and bourreti. Little or no mitochondrial DNA variation was found among the morphologically distinct species Cuora aurocapitata, Cuora pani, and Cuora trifasciata, for which hypotheses are proposed. Recognizing galbinifrons, bourreti, and picturata as separate species has consequences for ongoing ex situ captive breeding programs and prioritization of in situ conservation activities, particularly in Vietnam.

AB Organisms may respond to changing environments by evading the new conditions or by adapting to them. Recently, a large body of evidence has been collected indicating that phenotypic adaptation to climate change is widespread. Adaptation may be achieved by phenotypic adjustment or by changes in the genetic composition of populations. Both processes can assure the survival of populations in changing environments, but at different time scales and at different costs. Recent studies indicate that the mechanisms leading to adaptive phenotypic changes in birds may be complex, involving both plastic response and genetic change. Changes in the timing of breeding, for instance, seem to be predominantly caused by phenotypic adjustment to environmental conditions. Shifts in the genetic composition of populations have been demonstrated to be involved in recent changes in morphology and migratory behaviour. The presence of considerable amounts of additive genetic variation within and among avian populations, and examples of rapid evolutionary response to rare climatic events suggest that birds have a high potential for adaptive evolutionary change. However, it is presently unclear whether this is a general pattern, and which factors actually limit the adaptability of avian populations. Antagonistic genetic correlations and maladaptive phenotypic responses (evolutionary traps) are probably the most important constrains to microevolutionary change. Furthermore, the loss of genetic variation due to population declines, and gene flow in the presence of among-population variation in the response to climate change may limit the rate of adaptive evolution. Future research should try to identify the targets of selection and gauge the importance of constraints to microevolutionary change.

AB Ecologists have long been fascinated by the morphological changes that species frequently undergo when introduced into new regions. In this study an unusual pattern of size change associated with the invasion of 19 species of marine and estuarine invertebrates is reported. The results show that the majority of species are significantly larger in the introduced range compared with the native range with little evidence for any decrease in size following invasion. This invasion-driven increase in body size sharply contrasts with the pattern observed in many other taxa including plants, mammals and lizards, where invaders frequently exhibit post-invasion decreases and increases in size. These size changes were not influenced by differences in latitude, sample size or length of time since invasion. Although several mechanisms, may explain the results, none have been demonstrated.

AB Correlated evolution of mate signals and mate preference may be constrained if selection pressures acting on mate preference differ from those acting on mate signals. In particular, opposing selection pressures may act on mate preference and signals when traits have sexual as well as nonsexual functions. In the butterfly Colias philodice eriphyle, divergent selection on wing color across an elevational gradient in response to the thermal environment has led to increasing wing melanization at higher elevations. Wing color is also a long-range signal used by mates in mate searching. We conducted experiments to test whether sexual selection on wing melanization via male mate choice acts in the same direction as natural selection on mate signals due to the thermal environment. We performed controlled mate choice experiments in the field over an elevational range of 1500 meters using decoy butterflies with different melanization levels. Also, we obtained a more direct estimate of the relation between wing color and sexual selection by measuring mating success in wild-caught females. Both our experiments showed that wing melanization is an important determinant of female mating success in C. p. eriphyle. However, a lack of elevational variation in male mate preference prevents coevolution of mate signals and mate preference, as males at all elevations prefer lessmelanized females. We suggest that this apparently maladaptive mate choice may be maintained by differences in detectability between the morphs or by preservation of species recognition.

   CONTENTS; TIDAL MARSH; CARBON
AB The invasion of Phragmites australis into tidal marshes formerly dominated by Spartina alterniflora has resulted in considerable interest in the consequences of this invasion for the ecological functions of marsh habitat. We examined the provision of trophic support for a resident marsh fish, Fundulus heteroclitus, in marshes dominated by P. australis, by S. alterniflora, and in restored marshes, using multiple stable isotope analysis. We first evaluated our ability to distinguish among potential primary producers using the multiple stable isotope approach. Within a tidal creek system we found significant marsh and elevation effects on microalgal isotope values, and sufficient variability and overlap in primary producer isotope values to create some difficulty in identifying unique end members. The food webs supporting E heteroclitus production were examined using dual isotope plots. At both sites, the delta(13)C values of E heteroclitus were clustered over values for benthic microalgae (BMI) and approximately midway between delta(13)C values of Spartina and Phragmites. Based on comparisons of fish and primary producer delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S values, and consideration of E heteroclitus feeding habits, we conclude that BMI were a significant component of the food web supporting F heteroclitus in these brackish marshes, especially recently-hatched fish occupying pools on the marsh surface. A 2parts per thousand difference in delta(13)C between Fundulus occupying nearly adjacent Spartina and Phragmites marshes may be indicative of relatively less reliance on BMI and greater reliance on Phragmites production in Phragmites-dominated marshes, a conclusion consistent with the reduced BMI biomass found in Phragmites marshes. The mean delta(13)C value of F heteroclitus from restored marshes was intermediate between values of fish from naturally occurring Spartina marshes and areas invaded by Phragmites. We also examined the isotopic evidence for ontogenetic changes in the trophic position of larval and juvenile F heteroclitus. We found significant positive relationships between E heteroclitus WIN values and total length, reflective of an increase in trophic position as fish grow. F heteroclitus delta(15)N values indicate that these fish are feeding approximately two trophic levels above primary producers.

AB Over the past century, the distribution and abundance of Phragmites australis (common reed) has dramatically increased in both freshwater and brackish wetlands throughout North America. It has been hypothesized that the increased competitive ability of Phragmites could be the result of an introduction of a more aggressive genotype. Sequence data from 2 noncoding regions of the chloroplast genome show that, historically, 11 native haplotypes were found across North America and population-structuring distinguishing samples from the Atlantic Coast, Midwest, West, and Gulf Coast regions of the continent was evident. Today a single genetically-distinct haplotype dominates the Atlantic Coast and is also found across the continent in lower frequencies; this type is common in Europe and Asia and has most likely been introduced to North America. Comparisons of modern populations with historic samples show that, along the Atlantic Coast, this cosmopolitan type has replaced native haplotypes and it is invading new sites throughout the rest of the country. In the Midwest and West, native populations are still common but introduced populations are found along roadsides throughout the area. Gulf Coast populations are dominated by another population type that is genetically distinct from all other North American population types.

AB The structure of the pelagic foodweb in the upwelling ecosystem of Galicia (NW Spain) was studied by means of the enrichment in C-13 and N-15 isotopes in plankton (four size classes from 20 to >1000 mum). sardine (primary consumer) and dolphin (top consumer). Samples k ere collected in March 1998, during the spawning period of sardines at the beginning of the upwelling season. Isotopic enrichment across plankton size classes was lower than either enrichment between plankton and sardine or enrichment between sardine and dolphin, This difference may be attributed to the presence of chain-forming phytoplankton in sonic plankton size classes but also to a large degree of omnivore among zooplankton, Also, there was a size-dependent effect on N-15 enrichment of sardine, Sardines <18 cm had a variable isotopic enrichment but generally higher than those of larger sardines. revealing omnivorous but mostly zoophagous diets. In contrast, sardines greater than or equal to 18 cm showed a linear decrease of N-15 enrichment with length. as a consequence of the increase in the efficiency of filter-feeding and in the amount of phytoplankton ingested. According to N-15 enrichment, we concluded that probably there are no more than four trophic levels in the studied ecosystem. Nevertheless. our results revealed that the pelagic food web in this upwelling area is more complex than expected due to the generalized omnivory in ail organisms. Furthermore, the obtained relationships between delta(15)N and the size of organisms provide the basis for a quantitative analysis of changes in the trophic structure of this ecosystem.

AB Many studies have shown that low dominance status within a social group is associated with elevated glucocorticoid hormone production, a common index of physiological stress. However, the reverse may be true among cooperatively breeding female mammals with high reproductive skew; that is, high dominance status is associated with elevated glucocorticoid levels. Elevated glucocorticoid levels in these dominant females may be a product of their being the only breeder within a group or may result from other challenges associated with high status. To test this difference, we studied fecal corticoid levels in cooperative breeding females with low reproductive skew (i.e., where reproduction is not limited to dominant group members): ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). We collected behavioral and fecal corticoid data from 39 ring-tailed lemur females from eight groups across three sites. In seven of the eight groups, either one or both of the two most dominant females (ranks 1 and 2) exhibited the highest fecal corticoid levels in the groups. The best predictor of corticoid levels in high-ranking females was the proportion of aggressive agonistic interactions they initiated. For the lower-ranking females the best predictors of elevated corticoid levels were being the recipient of aggressive attacks and being relatively close to one's nearest neighbors. These results differ from many studies of caged male mammals where subordinate individuals often exhibit the highest glucocorticoid levels of a group. Furthermore, the results indicate that reproduction itself is not the primary reason for higher glucocorticoid levels among dominant cooperative-breeding females, but that some other factor must account for these elevated levels.

AB Temporal and spatial patterns of phenotypic variation have traditionally been thought to reflect genetic differentiation produced by natural selection. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how natural selection may shape the genetics of phenotypic plasticity to produce patterns of geographic variation and phenotypic evolution. Because the covariance between genetic and environmental influences can modulate the expression of phenotypic variation, a complete understanding of geographic variation requires determining whether these influences covary in the same (cogradient variation) or in opposing (countergradient variation) directions. We focus on marine snails from rocky intertidal shores as an ideal system to explore how genetic and plastic influences contribute to geographic and historical patterns of phenotypic variation. Phenotypic plasticity in response to predator cues, wave action, and water temperature appear to exert a strong influence on small and large-scale morphological variation in marine snails. In particular, plasticity in snail shell thickness: (i) may contribute to phenotypic evolution, (ii) appears to have evolved across small and large spatial scales, and (iii) may be driven by life history trade-offs tied to architectural constraints imposed by the shell. The plasticity exhibited by these snails represents an important adaptive strategy to the pronounced heterogeneity of the intertidal zone and undoubtedly has played a key role in their evolution.

AB In small rodents there is compelling evidence of a lipostatic system of body mass regulation in which peripheral signals of energy storage are decoded in the hypothalamus. The ability of small mammals to defend an appropriate mass against imposed energy imbalance has implicated hypothalamic neuroendocrine systems in body mass regulation. The effect of the neuropeptide systems involved in this regulation is primarily compensatory. However, small mammals can also effect changes in the level of body mass that they will defend, as exemplified by seasonal species. Regulatory control over fat mass may be relatively loose in humans; the sizes of long-term storage depots may not themselves be regulated, but rather may be a consequence of temporal variations in the matching of supply and demand. Whether food intake is regulated to match energy demand, or to match demand and to regulate storage, it is clear that physiological defects or genetic variation in hypothalamic and peripheral feedback systems will have profound implications for fat storage. Study of mechanisms implicated in energy homeostasis in laboratory rodents is likely to continue to identify targets for pharmacological manipulation in the management of human obesity.

AB Life history tradeoffs are often thought to be caused by the allocation of limited resources among competing traits such as reproduction, somatic growth and maintenance. One line of evidence supporting this comes from eliminating reproduction, for example, by surgically removing gonads, However, recent evidence from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that the apparent tradeoffs it shows might not be due to resource allocation at all but rather to the effects of a molecular signal originating in the germ line that represses longevity. These results should cause us to rethink the interpretation of many classic experiments in life history evolution.

AB Spatio-temporal heterogeneity in physico-chemical conditions associated with the annual expansion/contraction cycle in a complex glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps was investigated employing a landscape approach. The diverse and dynamic aquatic habitats of the flood plain were visualized as an aquatic mosaic or riverscape. Based on samples collected at ca. monthly intervals for 1.5 yr along 17 floodplain transects, the 3 components of riverscape heterogeneity, extent, composition, and configuration, were quantified using categorical maps and indices of landscape patterns for turbidity and specific conductance. Changes in the spatial heterogeneity of 13 other physico-chemical parameters were further analyzed by means of a within-dates principal component analysis. Riverscape heterogeneity (RH), quantified by applying several indices of landscape pattern to turbidity and specific conductance data, was minimum during groundwater-dominated base flow in winter. Despite an increase in surface connectivity in the channel network with rising discharge, RH rose in spring and summer as additional chemically-distinct water sources (i.e., snowmelt runoff and glacial ablation) contributed to surface flow within the flood plain. Most other physico-chemical variables measured during this study exhibited the same spatio-temporal heterogeneity as turbidity and specific conductance. Overall, the glacial flood plain shifted from a monotonous physico-chemical riverscape in winter to a complex mosaic in summer, this seasonal pattern being clearly driven by hydrological factors operating at the catchment scale rather than by autogenic processes within individual water bodies. Although RH exhibited a predictable annual pattern in response to the seasonal flow regime, we expect the channel network to undergo future modifications from stochastic factors associated with flood events and long-term changes reflecting movements of the glaciers.

AB Tho phylogenetic relationships of 492 chub (Leuriscus cephalus) belonging to 89 Populations across the species' range were assessed using 600 base pairs of cytochrome b. Furthermore, nine species belonging to the L. cephalus complex were also analysed (over the whole cytochrome b) in order to lest potential allopatric hybridization with L. cephalus sensu stricto (i.e. the chub). Our results show that the chub includes four highly divergent lineages descending from a quick radiation that took place three million years ago. The geographical distribution of these lineages and results of the nested clade analysis indicated that the chub may have originated from Mesopotamia. Chub radiation probably occurred during an important vicariant event such as the isolation of numerous Turkish river systems, a consequence of the uplift of the Anatolian Plateau (formerly covered by a broad inland lake). Dispersion of these lineages arose from the changes in the European hydrographic network and, thus, the chub and endemic species of the L. cephalus complex met by secondary contacts. Our results show several patterns of introgression, fr om Leuciscus lepidus fully introgressed by chub mitochondrial DNA to Leuciscus borythenicus where no introgression at all was detected. We assume that these hybridization events might constitute an important evolutionary process for the settlement of the chub in new environments in the Mediterranean area.

AB Seedlings from 43 native woody species belonging to different successional groups from the Tibagi River Basin, Parana State, South Brazil were studied to obtain information on the importance of colonization by native arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse for 15 to 45 wk, with soil-mix treatments and four successional groups. The mycorrhizal dependency was 90, 48, 12 and 14% of the pioneer, early secondary, late secondary and climax species, respectively. The content of P, Ca and K was 20, 17 and 23 times greater, respectively, in the leaves of the pioneer species than in the other successional groups. The colonization by AM fungi in field was studied in seedlings of 36 native woody species collected in the interior of the forest of the Mata dos Godoy State Park, and in open area at the beginning of arboreal succession. The mycorrhizal colonization in the field was 55.5, 26.9, 6.1 and 2.2% for the pioneer, early secondary, late secondary and climax species, respectively. To assess the mycorrhizal inoculum potential, rhizosphere soil was collected in the interior of the forest and a gap in the same forest and in a cleared area abandoned for natural regeneration. The inoculum potentials and the spore number in the area at the beginning of succession were 5.6 and 53.4 times greater than in the interior of the forest. The results show that the initial growth of the woody species which take part in the initial phases of succession may be more dependent on the AM fungi, in soils poor in minerals, while those that make up the final succession phases may be less dependent. The potential of the AM fungi inoculum decreases throughout the successional process and there is a relation between the inoculum potential found in the field and the occurrence for the different habitats of the species of adult plants belonging to different successional groups.

AB Monitoring programs for harmful algal blooms (HABs) are currently reactive and provide little or no means for advance warning. Given this, the development of algal forecasting systems would be of great use because they could guide traditional monitoring programs and provide a proactive means for responding to HABs. Forecasting systems will require near real-time observational capabilities and hydrodynamic/biological models designed to run in the forecast mode. These observational networks must detect and forecast over ecologically relevant spatial/temporal scales. One solution is to incorporate a multiplatform optical approach utilizing remote sensing and in situ moored technologies, Recent advances in instrumentation and data-assimilative modeling may provide the components necessary for building an algal forecasting system, This review will outline the utility and hurdles of optical approaches in HAB detection and monitoring. In all the approaches, the desired HAB information must be isolated and extracted from the measured bulk optical signals. Examples of strengths and weaknesses of the current approaches to deconvolve the bulk optical properties are illustrated. After the phytoplankton signal has been isolated, species-recognition algorithms will be required, and we demonstrate one approach developed for Gymnodinium breve Davis, Pattern-recognition algorithms will be species-specific, reflecting the acclimation state of the HAB species of interest. Field data will provide inputs to optically based ecosystem models, which are fused to the observational networks through data-assimilation methods. Potential model structure and data-assimilation methods are reviewed.

AB Classical life-history theory predicts 'trade-offs' between reproductive and somatic investments. However, empirical studies have shown that intraspecific phenotypic correlations between these two resource investments are often positive or nonsignificant, rather than negative as predicted. The model of Van Noordwijk and De Jong (1986) was proposed to explain these unexpected results. According to their model, positive correlations between reproductive and somatic investments will result if individual variation in resource acquisition exceeds that of resource allocation, whereas negative correlations will result if individual variation in resource allocation exceeds that of resource acquisition. To test this model, I used body storage/condition as an index of somatic investment because it is usually strongly related to level of resource acquisition. I predicted that laboratory studies should more often show negative correlations between reproductive and somatic investments than field studies, because individual variation in resource acquisition is expected to be lower in controlled laboratory environments than in variable natural environments. A literature review revealed that correlations between somatic (storage) investment and reproductive investment (estimated as clutch/litter mass, number of offspring per clutch/litter, or number of clutches/litters) among conspecific breeding female animals are more often positive (15 species) or nonsignificant (17 species) than negative (6 species). Moreover, as expected, five of six negative correlations were observed in laboratory studies, whereas 13 of 15 positive correlations were observed in field studies. It is concluded that future empirical and theoretical work on life histories should consider individual variation in both resource acquisition and allocation and the interaction between the two.

AB A 9-year study of the structure of assemblages of fish on 20 coral patch reefs, based on 20 non-manipulative censuses, revealed a total of 141 species from 34 families, although 40 species accounted for over 95% of sightings of fish. The average patch reef was 8.5 m2 in surface area, and supported 125 fish of 20 species at a census. All reefs showed at least a two-fold variation among censuses in total numbers of fish present, and 12 showed ten-fold variations. There was also substantial variation in the composition and relative abundances of species present on each patch reef, such that censuses of a single patch reef were on average about 50% different from each other in percent similarity of species composition (Czekanowski's index). Species differed substantially in the degree to which their numbers varied from census to census, and in the degree to which their dispersion among patch reefs was modified from census to census. We characterize the 40 most common species with respect to these attributes. The variations in assemblage structure cannot be attributed to responses of fish to a changing physical structure of patch reefs, nor to the comings and goings of numerous rare species. Our results support and extend earlier reports on this study, which have stressed the lack of persistant structure for assemblages on these patch reefs. While reef fishes clearly have microhabitat preferences which are expressed at settlement, the variations in microhabitat offered by the patch reefs are insufficient to segregate many species of fish by patch reef. Instead, at the scale of single patch reefs, and, to a degree, at the larger scale of the 20 patch reefs, most of the 141 species of fish are distributed without regard to differences in habitat structure among reefs, and patterns of distribution change over time. Implications for general understanding of assemblage dynamics for fish over more extensive patches of reef habitat are considered.

AB A population model for migratory vertebrates is developed by combining game theory models of foraging behaviour with population biology. Models of foraging behaviour which incorporate interference and resource depletion are developed to determine the density-dependent mortality occurring within sites. Population size can then be related to the strength of interference, the variance in competitive ability and the rate at which resources are depleted. The model is extended to predict evolutionarily stable migration strategies. This novel framework is then used to predict the population decline resulting from habitat loss.

AB An 11-yr study of life history and demographic variation in the sagebrush lizard Sceloporus graciosus was carried out on two study areas (Rattlesnake Ridge and Ponderosa Flat) in the Kolob Mesa Section of Zion National Park, Utah. Two primary objectives of this mark-recapture study were to: (1) quantify variation in age structure, age and size at maturity, age-specific survivorship and fecundity, and individual growth rates, and (2) conduct a series of density reduction experiments designed to elucidate the effects of density on growth rates and survival of posthatchling lizards. In addition, we examined the relationships of variation in population density and deviation from long-term average precipitation and temperature to variation in individual growth, reproduction, and demography.
   At both sites the active season was almost-equal-to 160 d, extending from early April to mid-September. Reproduction occurred during a 50-d period between mid-May and early July. Mean clutch size was 3.7 eggs and most females produced their first clutch in the 2nd yr of life (their third active season) at an age of almost-equal-to 22-24 mo and a minimum snout-vent length of almost-equal-to 50 mm. Most mature females produced two clutches of eggs per year, and there was no statistically significant variation in either mean clutch size or body-size-adjusted clutch size among the 11 yr of study. Clutch size was significantly correlated with body size. Relative clutch mass averaged 0.247 and was not significantly correlated with body size. Since hatchlings first appeared in early to mid-August, their first growing season was almost-equal-to 2 mo long. There was no significant sexual dimorphism in growth rate or body size in either population.
   There was great variation in estimates of egg-yearling survival among years. Egg-yearling survival probability varied from 0.12 to 0.59 with a mean of 0.28. At Ponderosa Flat, the survival of yearling males (0.38) was significantly lower than that of yearling females (0.47). Survival of yearling males (0.45) and females (0.43) at Rattlesnake Ridge was not significantly different. There were no other significant differences in the survival of males and females (XBAR = 0.56 for both sexes) within any age class in any year of the study. However, the survival of yearlings was significantly lower than that of older lizards in both populations. Mean posthatchling survival over all years was 0.45, and there was significant heterogeneity in posthatchling survival among years. Average annual survival of immigrants (0.32) was significantly lower than that of residents (0.44).
   There was a significant negative linear relatonship between yearling body size in late June and total density of posthatchling lizards. A stepwise linear regression model revealed significant effects of both rainfall (and presumably resource availability) and population density on the growth of yearlings. This model explained 78% of the annual variation in yearling growth. Rank correlation analysis revealed that survivorship of hatchlings was negatively correlated with density of conspecific lizards. The negative correlation implies direct density dependence of hatchling mortality rates and is a potentially important mechanism of population regulation. Removals of almost all yearling and older age lizards from the study sites resulted in significant increases in growth rates of hatchlings in the year of the removal and yearlings during the following year.
   Four results from this study combine to suggest substantial resource limitation of S. graciosus on the Kolob Mesa. (1) Snout-vent lengths attained by yearling lizards were positively correlated with deviations from long-term mean rainfall values. (2) Body sizes attained by yearlings were greatest in the years following density reductions. (3) Body size attained by yearlings was negatively correlated with density of conspecifics. And (4), in a year in which a density reduction followed a warm, wet spring, more yearling females reached maturity than in all other years of the study combined.
   Finally, we compared data from the Kolob Mesa populations to those from other populations of S. graciosus.

AB The objective of this study was to construct a spatial simulation model of the vegetation dynamics in semi-permanent prairie wetlands. A hydrologic submodel estimated water levels based on precipitation, runoff, and potential evapotranspiration. A vegetation submodel calculated the amount and distribution of emergent cover and open water using a geographic information system. The response of vegetation to water-level changes was based on seed bank composition, seedling recruitment and establishment, and plant survivorship.
   The model was developed and tested using data from the Cottonwood Lake study site in North Dakota. Data from semi-permanent wetland P1 were used to calibrate the model. Data from a second wetland, P4, were used to evaluate model performance. Simulation results were compared with actual water data from 1979 through 1989.
   Test results showed that differences between calculated and observed water levels were within 10 cm 75% of the time. Open water over the past decade ranged from 0 to 7% in wetland P4 and from 0 to 8% in submodel simulations. Several model parameters including evapotranspiration and timing of seedling germination could be improved with more complex techniques or relatively minor adjustments. Despite these differences the model adequately represented vegetation dynamics of prairie wetlands and can be used to examine wetland response to natural or human-induced climate change.

AB Structural genomic variants (SVs) are ubiquitous and play a major role in adaptation and speciation. Yet, comparative and population genomics have focused predominantly on gene duplications and large-effect inversions. The lack of a common framework for studying all SVs is hampering progress towards a more systematic assessment of their evolutionary significance. Here we (i) review how different types of SVs affect ecological and evolutionary processes; (ii) suggest unifying definitions and recommendations for future studies; and (iii) provide a roadmap for the integration of SVs in ecoevolutionary studies. In doing so, we lay the foundation for population genomics, theoretical, and experimental approaches to understand how the full spectrum of SVs impacts ecological and evolutionary processes.

AB This study aims to answer the following research question: how is the resilience of firms defined in the business and management field? In doing so, we answer recent calls for research about a more thorough conceptualisation of the resilience of firms and its definition. We conducted a systematic literature review of 66 selected papers published between 2000 and 2017. By means of inductive content analysis, we analyse the definitions of 'resilience' and elaborate a novel conceptual framework that introduces a dynamic perspective on the resilience of firms. The proposed framework overcomes existing definitional fragmentation and raises awareness of the temporal dimension in the conceptualisation of the resilience of firms. We contribute to extant business and management literature on the resilience of firms by proposing a model that articulates two main paths for explaining organisational resilience, i.e. absorptive resilience and adaptive resilience paths. We also identify a set of key capabilities needed to be successfully resilient at the different stages of the two paths. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background The ocean microbiota modulates global biogeochemical cycles and changes in its configuration may have large-scale consequences. Yet, the underlying ecological mechanisms structuring it are unclear. Here, we investigate how fundamental ecological mechanisms (selection, dispersal and ecological drift) shape the smallest members of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota: prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes). Furthermore, we investigate the agents exerting abiotic selection on this assemblage as well as the spatial patterns emerging from the action of ecological mechanisms. To explore this, we analysed the composition of surface-ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities using DNA-sequence data (16S- and 18S-rRNA genes) collected during the circumglobal expeditions Malaspina-2010 and TARA-Oceans. Results We found that the two main components of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota, prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes, appear to be structured by different ecological mechanisms. Picoeukaryotic communities were predominantly structured by dispersal-limitation, while prokaryotic counterparts appeared to be shaped by the combined action of dispersal-limitation, selection and drift. Temperature-driven selection appeared as a major factor, out of a few selected factors, influencing species co-occurrence networks in prokaryotes but not in picoeukaryotes, indicating that association patterns may contribute to understand ocean microbiota structure and response to selection. Other measured abiotic variables seemed to have limited selective effects on community structure in the tropical and subtropical ocean. Picoeukaryotes displayed a higher spatial differentiation between communities and a higher distance decay when compared to prokaryotes, consistent with a scenario of higher dispersal limitation in the former after considering environmental heterogeneity. Lastly, random dynamics or drift seemed to have a more important role in structuring prokaryotic communities than picoeukaryotic counterparts. Conclusions The differential action of ecological mechanisms seems to cause contrasting biogeography, in the tropical and subtropical ocean, among the smallest surface plankton, prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes. This suggests that the idiosyncrasy of the main constituents of the ocean microbiota should be considered in order to understand its current and future configuration, which is especially relevant in a context of global change, where the reaction of surface ocean plankton to temperature increase is still unclear.

AB Anthropogenic environments have been implicated in enrichment and exchange of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria. Here we study the impact of confined and controlled swine farm environments on temporal changes in the gut microbiome and resistome of veterinary students with occupational exposure for 3 months. By analyzing 16S rRNA and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing data in tandem with culture-based methods, we show that farm exposure shapes the gut microbiome of students, resulting in enrichment of potentially pathogenic taxa and antimicrobial resistance genes. Comparison of students' gut microbiomes and resistomes to farm workers' and environmental samples revealed extensive sharing of resistance genes and bacteria following exposure and after three months of their visit. Notably, antibiotic resistance genes were found in similar genetic contexts in student samples and farm environmental samples. Dynamic Bayesian network modeling predicted that the observed changes partially reverse over a 4-6 month period. Our results indicate that acute changes in a human's living environment can persistently shape their gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome. Environments where antibiotics are used indiscriminately exhibit microbial communities that can represent hot-spots of resistance gene enrichment, which in turn could spread to humans. Here, the authors characterize how exposure to swine farms environment lead to temporal changes in the gut microbiome and resistome of healthy veterinary students.

AB Over the course of a mission to the International Space Station (ISS) crew members are exposed to a number of stressors that can potentially alter the composition of their microbiomes and may have a negative impact on astronauts' health. Here we investigated the impact of long-term space exploration on the microbiome of nine astronauts that spent six to twelve months in the ISS. We present evidence showing that the microbial communities of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose and tongue change during the space mission. The composition of the intestinal microbiota became more similar across astronauts in space, mostly due to a drop in the abundance of a few bacterial taxa, some of which were also correlated with changes in the cytokine profile of crewmembers. Alterations in the skin microbiome that might contribute to the high frequency of skin rashes/hypersensitivity episodes experienced by astronauts in space were also observed. The results from this study demonstrate that the composition of the astronauts' microbiome is altered during space travel. The impact of those changes on crew health warrants further investigation before humans embark on long-duration voyages into outer space.

AB The gut microbiota has an important role in animal health and performance, but its contribution is difficult to determine, in particular given the effects of host genetic factors. Here, whole-genome sequencing of the hosts and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the microbiota were performed to separate the effects between host genetics and the microbiota in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and faeces on fat deposition in 206 yellow broilers reared under identical conditions. Despite the notable spatial variation in the diversity, composition and potential function of the gut microbiota, host genetics exerted limited effects on the gut microbial community. The duodenal and caecal microbiota made greater contributions to fat deposition and could separately account for 24% and 21% of the variance in the abdominal fat mass after correcting for host genetic effects. We further identified two caecal microbial taxa, Methanobrevibacter and Mucispirillum schaedleri, which were significantly correlated with fat deposition. Chickens with a lower Methanobrevibacter abundance had significantly lower abdominal fat content than those with a higher abundance of Methanobrevibacter (35.51 vs. 55.59 g), and the body weights of these chickens did not notably differ. Chickens with a higher M. schaedleri abundance exhibited lower abdominal fat accumulation (39.88 vs. 55.06 g) and body weight (2.23 vs. 2.41 kg) than those with a lower abundance of this species. These findings may aid the development of strategies for altering the gut microbiota to control fat deposition during broiler production.

AB Tropical forests shelter an unparalleled biological diversity. The relative influence of environmental selection (i.e., abiotic conditions, biotic interactions) and stochastic-distance-dependent neutral processes (i.e., demography, dispersal) in shaping communities has been extensively studied for various organisms, but has rarely been explored across a large range of body sizes, in particular in soil environments. We built a detailed census of the whole soil biota in a 12-ha tropical forest plot using soil DNA metabarcoding. We show that the distribution of 19 taxonomic groups (ranging from microbes to mesofauna) is primarily stochastic, suggesting that neutral processes are prominent drivers of the assembly of these communities at this scale. We also identify aluminium, topography and plant species identity as weak, yet significant drivers of soil richness and community composition of bacteria, protists and to a lesser extent fungi. Finally, we show that body size, which determines the scale at which an organism perceives its environment, predicted the community assembly across taxonomic groups, with soil mesofauna assemblages being more stochastic than microbial ones. These results suggest that the relative contribution of neutral processes and environmental selection to community assembly directly depends on body size. Body size is hence an important determinant of community assembly rules at the scale of the ecological community in tropical soils and should be accounted for in spatial models of tropical soil food webs.

AB Nitrogen (N) availability is increasing dramatically in many ecosystems, but the influence of elevated N on the functioning of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in natural ecosystems is not well understood. We measured AM fungal community structure and mycorrhizal function simultaneously across an experimental N addition gradient in an alpine meadow that is limited by N but not by phosphorus (P). AM fungal communities at both whole-plant-community (mixed roots) and single-plant-species (Elymus nutans roots) scales were described using pyro-sequencing, and the mycorrhizal functioning was quantified using a mycorrhizal-suppression treatment in the field (whole-plant-community scale) and a glasshouse inoculation experiment (single-plant-species scale). Nitrogen enrichment progressively reduced AM fungal abundance, changed AM fungal community composition, and shifted mycorrhizal functioning towards parasitism at both whole-plant-community and E. nutans scales. N-induced shifts in AM fungal community composition were tightly linked to soil N availability and/or plant species richness, whereas the shifts in mycorrhizal function were associated with the communities of specific AM fungal lineages. The observed changes in both AM fungal community structure and functioning across an N enrichment gradient highlight that N enrichment of ecosystems that are not P-limited can induce parasitic mycorrhizal functioning and influence plant community structure and ecosystem sustainability.

AB Because significant global changes are currently underway in the Arctic, creating a large-scale standardized database for Arctic marine biodiversity is particularly pressing. This study evaluates the potential of aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to detect Arctic coastal biodiversity changes and characterizes the local spatio-temporal distribution of eDNA in two locations. We extracted and amplified eDNA using two COI primer pairs from similar to 80 water samples that were collected across two Canadian Arctic ports, Churchill and Iqaluit, based on optimized sampling and preservation methods for remote regions surveys. Results demonstrate that aquatic eDNA surveys have the potential to document large-scale Arctic biodiversity change by providing a rapid overview of coastal metazoan biodiversity, detecting nonindigenous species, and allowing sampling in both open water and under the ice cover by local northern-based communities. We show that DNA sequences of similar to 50% of known Canadian Arctic species and potential invaders are currently present in public databases. A similar proportion of operational taxonomic units was identified at the species level with eDNA metabarcoding, for a total of 181 species identified at both sites. Despite the cold and well-mixed coastal environment, species composition was vertically heterogeneous, in part due to river inflow in the estuarine ecosystem, and differed between the water column and tide pools. Thus, COI-based eDNA metabarcoding may quickly improve large-scale Arctic biomonitoring using eDNA, but we caution that aquatic eDNA sampling needs to be standardized over space and time to accurately evaluate community structure changes.

AB Niche differences are key to understanding the distribution and structure of biodiversity. To examine niche differences, we must first characterize how species occupy niche space, and two approaches are commonly used in the ecological literature. The first uses species traits to estimate multivariate trait space (so-called functional trait diversity, FD); the second quantifies the amount of time or evolutionary history captured by a group of species (phylogenetic diversity, PD). It is often-but controversially-assumed that these putative measures of niche space are at a minimum correlated and perhaps redundant, since more evolutionary time allows for greater accumulation of trait changes. This theoretical expectation remains surprisingly poorly evaluated, particularly in the context of multivariate measures of trait diversity. We evaluated the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and trait diversity using analytical and simulation-based methods across common models of trait evolution. We show that PD correlates with FD increasingly strongly as more traits are included in the FD measure. Our results indicate that phylogenetic diversity can be a useful surrogate for high-dimensional trait diversity, but we also show that the correlation weakens when the underlying process of trait evolution includes variation in rate and optima.

AB Climate change projections anticipate increased frequency and intensity of drought stress, but grassland responses to severe droughts and their potential to recover are poorly understood. In many grasslands, high land-use intensity has enhanced productivity and promoted resource-acquisitive species at the expense of resource-conservative ones. Such changes in plant functional composition could affect the resistance to drought and the recovery after drought of grassland ecosystems with consequences for feed productivity resilience and environmental stewardship. In a 12-site precipitation exclusion experiment in upland grassland ecosystems across Switzerland, we imposed severe edaphic drought in plots under rainout shelters and compared them with plots under ambient conditions. We used soil water potentials to scale drought stress across sites. Impacts of precipitation exclusion and drought legacy effects were examined along a gradient of land-use intensity to determine how grasslands resisted to, and recovered after drought. In the year of precipitation exclusion, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in plots under rainout shelters was -15% to -56% lower than in control plots. Drought effects on ANPP increased with drought severity, specified as duration of topsoil water potential psi < -100kPa, irrespective of land-use intensity. In the year after drought, ANPP had completely recovered, but total species diversity had declined by -10%. Perennial species showed elevated mortality, but species richness of annuals showed a small increase due to enhanced recruitment. In general, the more resource-acquisitive grasses increased at the expense of the deeper-rooted forbs after drought, suggesting that community reorganization was driven by competition rather than plant mortality. The negative effects of precipitation exclusion on forbs increased with land-use intensity. Our study suggests a synergistic impact of land-use intensification and climate change on grassland vegetation composition, and implies that biomass recovery after drought may occur at the expense of biodiversity maintenance.

AB Climate change is altering life at multiple scales, from genes to ecosystems. Predicting the vulnerability of populations to climate change is crucial to mitigate negative impacts. We suggest that regional patterns of spatial and temporal climatic variation scaled to the traits of an organism can predict where and why populations are most vulnerable to climate change. Specifically, historical climatic variation affects the sensitivity and response capacity of populations to climate change by shaping traits and the genetic variation in those traits. Present and future climatic variation can affect both climate change exposure and population responses. We provide seven predictions for how climatic variation might affect the vulnerability of populations to climate change and suggest key directions for future research.

AB 1. Predators affect prey by killing them directly (lethal effects) and by inducing costly antipredator behaviours in living prey (risk effects). Risk effects can strongly influence prey populations and cascade through trophic systems. A prerequisite for assessing risk effects is characterizing the spatiotemporal variation in predation risk.
   2. Risk effects research has experienced rapid growth in the last several decades. However, preliminary assessments of the resultant literature suggest that researchers characterize predation risk using a variety of techniques. The implications of this methodological variation for inference and comparability among studies have not been well recognized or formally synthesized.
   3. We couple a literature survey with a hierarchical framework, developed from established theory, to quantify the methodological variation in characterizing risk using carnivore-ungulate systems as a case study. Via this process, we documented 244 metrics of risk from 141 studies falling into at least 13 distinct subcategories within three broader categories.
   4. Both empirical and theoretical work suggest risk and its effects on prey constitute a complex, multi-dimensional process with expressions varying by spatiotemporal scale. Our survey suggests this multi-scale complexity is reflected in the literature as a whole but often underappreciated in any given study, which complicates comparability among studies and leads to an overemphasis on documenting the presence of risk effects rather than their mechanisms or scale of influence.
   5. We suggest risk metrics be placed in a more concrete conceptual framework to clarify inference surrounding risk effects and their cascading effects throughout ecosystems. We recommend studies (i) take a multi-scale approach to characterizing risk; (ii) explicitly consider 'true' predation risk (probability of predation per unit time); and (iii) use risk metrics that facilitate comparison among studies and the evaluation of multiple competing hypotheses. Addressing the pressing questions in risk effects research, including how, to what extent and on what scale they occur, requires leveraging the advantages of the many methods available to characterize risk while minimizing the confusion caused by variability in their application.

AB The general dynamic model of oceanic island biogeography (GDM) has added a new dimension to theoretical island biogeography in recognizing that geological processes are key drivers of the evolutionary processes of diversification and extinction within remote islands. It provides a dynamic and essentially non-equilibrium framework generating novel predictions for emergent diversity properties of oceanic islands and archipelagos. Its publication in 2008 coincided with, and spurred on, renewed attention to the dynamics of remote islands. We review progress, both in testing the GDM's predictions and in developing and enhancing ecological-evolutionary understanding of oceanic island systems through the lens of the GDM. In particular, we focus on four main themes: (i) macroecological tests using a space-for-time rationale; (ii) extensions of theory to islands following different patterns of ontogeny; (iii) the implications of GDM dynamics for lineage diversification and trait evolution; and (iv) the potential for downscaling GDM dynamics to local-scale ecological patterns and processes within islands. We also consider the implications of the GDM for understanding patterns of non-native species diversity. We demonstrate the vitality of the field of island biogeography by identifying a range of potentially productive lines for future research.

AB Competitive exclusion and habitat filtering influence community assembly, but ecologists and evolutionary biologists have not reached consensus on how to quantify patterns that would reveal the action of these processes. Currently, at least 22 alpha-diversity and 10 beta-diversity metrics of community phylogenetic structure can he combined with nine null models (eight for Ii-diversity metrics), providing 278 potentially distinct approaches to test for phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion. Selecting the appropriate approach for a study is daunting. First, we describe similarities among metrics and null models across variance in phylogeny size and shape, species abundance, and species richness. Second, we develop spatially explicit, individual-based simulations of neutral, competitive exclusion, or habitat filtering community assembly, and quantify the performance (type I and II error rates) of all 278 metric and null model combinations against each assembly process. Many a-diversity metrics and null models are at least functionally equivalent, reducing the number of truly unique metrics to 12 and the number of unique metric + null model combinations to 72. An even smaller subset of metric and null model combinations showed robust statistical performance. For a-diversity metrics, phylogenetic diversity' and mean nearest taxon distance were best able to detect habitat filtering, while mean pairwise phylogenetic distance-based metrics were best able to detect competitive exclusion. Overall, alpha-diversity metrics tended to have greater power to detect habitat filtering and competitive exclusion than a-diversity metrics, but had higher type 1 error in some cases. Across both alpha- and beta-diversity metrics, null model selection affected type I error rates more than metric selection. A null model that maintained species richness, and approximately maintained species occurrence frequency and abundance across sites, exhibited low type I and II error rates. This regional null model simulates neutral dispersal of individuals into local communities by sampling from a regional species pool. We introduce a flexible new R package, metricTester, to facilitate robust analyses of method performance.

AB The online resource http://www.plantrdnadatabase.com/ stores information on the number, chromosomal locations and structure of the 5S and 18S-5.8S-26S (35S) ribosomal DNAs (rDNA) in plants. This resource was exploited to study relationships between rDNA locus number, distribution, the occurrence of linked (L-type) and separated (S-type) 5S and 35S rDNA units, chromosome number, genome size and ploidy level. The analyses presented summarise current knowledge on rDNA locus numbers and distribution in plants. We analysed 2949 karyotypes, from 1791 species and 86 plant families, and performed ancestral character state reconstructions. The ancestral karyotype (2n = 16) has two terminal 35S sites and two interstitial 5S sites, while the median (2n = 24) presents four terminal 35S sites and three interstitial 5S sites. Whilst 86.57% of karyotypes show S-type organisation (ancestral condition), the L-type arrangement has arisen independently several times during plant evolution. A non-terminal position of 35S rDNA was found in about 25% of single-locus karyotypes, suggesting that terminal locations are not essential for functionality and expression. Single-locus karyotypes are very common, even in polyploids. In this regard, polyploidy is followed by subsequent locus loss. This results in a decrease in locus number per monoploid genome, forming part of the diploidisation process returning polyploids to a diploid-like state over time.

AB Environmental variability has long been postulated as a major selective force in the evolution of large brains. However, assembling evidence for this hypothesis has proved difficult. Here, by combining brain size information for over 1,200 bird species with remote-sensing analyses to estimate temporal variation in ecosystem productivity, we show that larger brains (relative to body size) are more likely to occur in species exposed to larger environmental variation throughout their geographic range. Our reconstructions of evolutionary trajectories are consistent with the hypothesis that larger brains (relative to body size) evolved when the species invaded more seasonal regions. However, the alternative-that the species already possessed larger brains when they invaded more seasonal regions-cannot be completely ruled out. Regardless of the exact mechanism, our findings provide strong empirical support for the association between large brains and environmental variability.

AB The recently introduced technique of measuring corticosterone in feathers currently provides the longest-term measure of corticosterone in birds. This review examines the strengths, weaknesses, and unresolved technical issues of the feather corticosterone technique. Feather corticosterone's major strengths are that it provides: a retrospective assessment of corticosterone physiology, including information from absent (unseen) or dead (e.g. museum specimens) individuals; a long-term measure of corticosterone exposure over the period of feather growth (days weeks), integrating both baseline and responses to stressors; and flexible, minimally-invasive, sampling. However, researchers considering this technique should be aware of its limitations. Feather corticostetone only reflects hormone exposure during feather growth and, when sampling during molt, corticosterone titers and ecological conditions may not be representative of the majority of the annual cycle. Synchronization of molt is often unknown for a population, requiring assumptions when making inter-individual comparisons. Additionally, unresolved technical issues include: assessing whether corticosterone is the only hormone measured by assays; determining deposition dynamics to fully understand connections between feather and plasma corticosterone titers; studying the longevity and stability of corticosterone in the feather; establishing the impact of feather size and color on corticosterone deposition; and understanding the causes and implications of corticosterone variation along the length of the feather. Notwithstanding the above limitations and technical challenges, determining corticosterone titers in feathers is proving to be a useful technique for exploring some ecological and physiological correlates in individual birds. Given the unique perspective that feather corticosterone offers, we suggest that this measure complement, not replace, plasma measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The jaguar is the top predator of the Atlantic Forest (AF), which is a highly threatened biodiversity hotspot that occurs in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. By combining data sets from 14 research groups across the region, we determine the population status of the jaguar and propose a spatial prioritization for conservation actions. About 85% of the jaguar's habitat in the AF has been lost and only 7% remains in good condition. Jaguars persist in around 2.8% of the region, and live in very low densities in most of the areas. The population of jaguars in the AF is probably lower than 300 individuals scattered in small sub-populations. We identified seven Jaguar Conservation Units (JCUs) and seven potential JCUs, and only three of these areas may have >= 50 individuals. A connectivity analysis shows that most of the JCUs are isolated. Habitat loss and fragmentation were the major causes for jaguar decline, but human induced mortality is the main threat for the remaining population. We classified areas according to their contribution to jaguar conservation and we recommend management actions for each of them. The methodology in this study could be used for conservation planning of other carnivore species.

AB Fostering ecosystem services in urban road corridors is an important challenge for urban planning and governance because residents are often exposed to environmental pressures in these ubiquitous open spaces. We here aim at illustrating multiple ecosystem services that may be underpinned by roadside vegetation. Previous work is broadly scattered in papers from the natural and social sciences and biased by a focus both on regulating services (temperature regulation, air filtration, carbon sequestration) and also on trees. We provide a first synthesis that illustrates (i) the multi-functional capacity of green elements in streetscapes to deliver various ecosystem services; (ii) the relevance of planted and wild grown herbaceous vegetation as well as trees; and (iii) trade-offs between certain ecosystem services as well as risks related to disservices. Trees and herbaceous road vegetation can mitigate adverse environmental conditions in road corridors, which is particularly important in vulnerable neighborhoods that are undersupplied with green spaces. Enhancing the amenity value of streetscapes might also positively influence public health by promoting physical activity. However, significant knowledge gaps exist, e.g. on the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem services and on the valuation of green street components by different sociocultural groups. Our synthesis illustrates management options that can support planning and governance approaches toward more livable streetscapes by fostering ecosystem services and counteracting disservices.

   EXPERIENCE; ENVIRONMENTS; BENEFITS; ATTITUDE; CONTACT
AB At a time of unprecedented biodiversity loss, researchers are increasingly recognizing the broad range of benefits provided to humankind by nature. However, as people live more urbanized lifestyles there is a progressive disengagement with the natural world that diminishes these benefits and discourages positive environmental behaviour. The provision of food for garden birds is an increasing global phenomenon, and provides a readily accessible way for people to counter this trend. Yet despite its popularity, quite why people feed birds remains poorly understood. We explore three loosely defined motivations behind bird feeding: that it provides psychological benefits, is due to a concern about bird welfare, and/or is due to a more general orientation towards nature. We quantitatively surveyed households from urban towns in southern England to explore attitudes and actions towards garden bird feeding. Each household scored three Likert statements relating to each of the three motivations. We found that people who fed birds regularly felt more relaxed and connected to nature when they watched garden birds, and perceived that bird feeding is beneficial for bird welfare while investing time in minimising associated risks. Finally, feeding birds may be an expression of a wider orientation towards nature. Overall, we found that the feelings of being relaxed and connected to nature were the strongest drivers. As urban expansion continues both to threaten species conservation and to change peoples' relationship with the natural world, feeding birds may provide an important tool for engaging people with nature to the benefit of both people and conservation.

AB As a large carbon pool, global forest ecosystems are a critical component of the global carbon cycle. Accurate estimations of global forest aboveground biomass (AGB) can improve the understanding of global carbon dynamics and help to quantify anthropogenic carbon emissions. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques have been proven that can accurately capture both horizontal and vertical forest structures and increase the accuracy of forest AGB estimation. In this study, we mapped the global forest AGB density at a 1-km resolution through the integration of ground inventory data, optical imagery, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System/Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite data, climate surfaces, and topographic data. Over 4000 ground inventory records were collected from published literatures to train the forest AGB estimation model and validate the resulting global forest AGB product. Our wall-to-wall global forest AGB map showed that the global forest AGB density was 210.09 Mg/ha on average, with a standard deviation of 109.31 Mg/ha. At the continental level, Africa (333.34 +/- 63.80 Mg/ha) and South America (301.68 +/- 67.43 Mg/ha) had higher AGB density. The AGB density in Asia, North America and Europe were 172.28 +/- 94.75, 166.48 +/- 84.97, and 132.97 +/- 50.70 Mg/ha, respectively. The wall-to-wall forest AGB map was evaluated at plot level using independent plot measurements. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between our predicted results and the validation plots were 0.56 and 87.53 Mg/ha, respectively. At the ecological zone level, the R-2 and RMSE between our map and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggested values were 0.56 and 101.21 Mg/ha, respectively. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison was also conducted between our forest AGB map and other published regional AGB products. Overall, our forest AGB map showed good agreements with these regional AGB products, but some of the regional AGB products tended to underestimate forest AGB density.

AB Considered to play an important role in plant mineral nutrition, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is a common relationship between the roots of a great majority of plant species and glomeromycotan fungi. Its effects on the plant host are highly context dependent, with the greatest benefits often observed in phosphorus (P)-limited environments. Mycorrhizal contribution to plant nitrogen (N) nutrition is probably less important under most conditions. Moreover, inasmuch as both plant and fungi require substantial quantities of N for their growth, competition for N could potentially reduce net mycorrhizal benefits to the plant under conditions of limited N supply. Further compounded by increased belowground carbon (C) drain, the mycorrhizal costs could outweigh the benefits under severe N limitation. Using a field AM fungal community or a laboratory culture of Rhizophagus irregularis as mycorrhizal inoculants, we tested the contribution of mycorrhizal symbiosis to the growth, C allocation, and mineral nutrition of Andropogon gerardii growing in a nutrient-poor substrate under variable N and P supplies. The plants unambiguously competed with the fungi for N when its supply was low, resulting in no or negative mycorrhizal growth and N-uptake responses under such conditions. The field AM fungal communities manifested their potential to improve plant P nutrition only upon N fertilization, whereas the R. irregularis slightly yet significantly increased P uptake of its plant host (but not the host's growth) even without N supply. Coincident with increasing levels of root colonization by the AM fungal structures, both inoculants invariably increased nutritional and growth benefits to the host with increasing N supply. This, in turn, resulted in relieving plant P deficiency, which was persistent in non-mycorrhizal plants across the entire range of nutrient supplies.

AB A mosaic of intact native and human-modified vegetation use can provide important habitat for top predators such as the puma (Puma concolor), avoiding negative effects on other species and ecological processes due to cascade trophic interactions. This study investigates the effects of restoration scenarios on the puma's habitat suitability in the most developed Brazilian region (Sao Paulo State). Species Distribution Models incorporating restoration scenarios were developed using the species' occurrence information to (1) map habitat suitability of pumas in Sao Paulo State, Southeast, Brazil; (2) test the relative contribution of environmental variables ecologically relevant to the species habitat suitability and (3) project the predicted habitat suitability to future native vegetation restoration scenarios. The Maximum Entropy algorithm was used (Test AUC of 0.84 +/- 0.0228) based on seven environmental non-correlated variables and non-autocorrelated presence-only records (n = 342). The percentage of native vegetation (positive influence), elevation (positive influence) and density of roads (negative influence) were considered the most important environmental variables to the model. Model projections to restoration scenarios reflected the high positive relationship between pumas and native vegetation. These projections identified new high suitability areas for pumas (probability of presence >0.5) in highly deforested regions. High suitability areas were increased from 5.3% to 8.5% of the total State extension when the landscapes were restored for >= the minimum native vegetation cover rule (20%) established by the Brazilian Forest Code in private lands. This study highlights the importance of a landscape planning approach to improve the conservation outlook for pumas and other species, including not only the establishment and management of protected areas, but also the habitat restoration on private lands. Importantly, the results may inform environmental policies and land use planning in Sao Paulo State, Brazil.

AB Cheating is a focal concept in the study of mutualism, with the majority of researchers considering cheating to be both prevalent and highly damaging. However, current definitions of cheating do not reliably capture the evolutionary threat that has been a central motivation for the study of cheating. We describe the development of the cheating concept and distill a relative-fitness-based definition of cheating that encapsulates the evolutionary threat posed by cheating, i.e. that cheaters will spread and erode the benefits of mutualism. We then describe experiments required to conclude that cheating is occurring and to quantify fitness conflict more generally. Next, we discuss how our definition and methods can generate comparability and integration of theory and experiments, which are currently divided by their respective prioritisations of fitness consequences and traits. To evaluate the current empirical evidence for cheating, we review the literature on several of the best-studied mutualisms. We find that although there are numerous observations of low-quality partners, there is currently very little support from fitness data that any of these meet our criteria to be considered cheaters. Finally, we highlight future directions for research on conflict in mutualisms, including novel research avenues opened by a relative-fitness-based definition of cheating.

AB Ecological theory and evidence suggest that plant community biomass and composition may often be jointly controlled by climatic water availability and soil nutrient supply. To the extent that such colimitation operates, alterations in water availability caused by climatic change may have relatively little effect on plant communities on nutrient-poor soils. We tested this prediction with a 5-y rainfall and nutrient manipulation in a semiarid annual grassland system with highly heterogeneous soil nutrient supplies. On nutrient-poor soils, rainfall addition alone had little impact, but rainfall and nutrient addition synergized to cause large increases in biomass, declines in diversity, and near-complete species turnover. Plant species with resource-conservative functional traits (low specific leaf area, short stature) were replaced by species with resource-acquisitive functional traits (high specific leaf area, tall stature). On nutrient-rich soils, in contrast, rainfall addition alone caused substantial increases in biomass, whereas fertilization had little effect. Our results highlight that multiple resource limitation is a critical aspect when predicting the relative vulnerability of natural communities to climatically induced compositional change and diversity loss.

AB Phenotypic differences among individuals can arise during any stage of life. Although several distinct processes underlying individual differences have been defined and studied (e.g. parental effects, senescence), we lack an explicit, unified perspective for understanding how these processes contribute separately and synergistically to observed variation in functional traits. We propose a conceptual framework based on a developmental view of life-history variation, linking each ontogenetic stage with the types of individual differences originating during that period. In our view, the salient differences among these types are encapsulated by three key criteria: timing of onset, when fitness consequences are realized, and potential for reversibility. To fill a critical gap in this framework, we formulate a new term to refer to individual differences generated during adulthood reversible state effects. We define these as 'reversible changes in a functional trait resulting from life-history trade-offs during adulthood that affect fitness', highlighting how the adult phenotype can be repeatedly altered in response to environmental variation. Defining individual differences in terms of trade-offs allows explicit predictions regarding when and where fitness consequences should be expected. Moreover, viewing individual differences in a developmental context highlights how different processes can work in concert to shape phenotype and fitness, and lays a foundation for research linking individual differences to ecological and evolutionary theory.

AB Global ecosystems have shifted from historical conditions, but it is unclear from what baselines change should be assessed. Scientists and managers have increasingly accepted the impossibility of returning ecosystems to a "pristine" state; however, historical conditions remain the cornerstone for restoration and management. We explore the rationale behind the application of historical baselines to ecosystem management and propose Anthropocene baselines as a concept to provide an improved basis for the management of human-dominated ecosystems. The Anthropocene baselines concept emphasizes the conservation value of the remnants of historical ecosystems but confronts the reality that many ecosystems cannot-or will not-be restored to historical ranges of variability. In order to prevent further unwanted changes to biodiversity and ecosystem services, we suggest that the management of human-dominated ecosystems must move beyond historical constraints toward new points of reference dictated by social-ecological sustainability.

AB The resilience of ecosystems depends on the diversity of species and their specific responses to environmental variation. Here we show that the diversity of climatic responses across species contributes to a higher projected resilience of species-rich pollinator communities in real-world ecosystems despite land-use intensification. We determined the thermal niche of 511 pollinator species (flies, bees, beetles and butterflies) in 40 grasslands. Species in intensively used grasslands have broader thermal niches and are also more complementary in their thermal optima. The observed increase in thermal resilience with land-use intensification is mainly driven by the dominant flies that prefer cooler temperatures and compensate for losses of other taxa. Temperature explained 84% of the variation in pollinator activity across species and sites. Given the key role of temperature, quantifying the diversity of thermal responses within functional groups is a promising approach to assess the vulnerability of ecosystems to land-use intensification and climate change.

AB Background: Chronic malnutrition, termed stunting, is defined as suboptimal linear growth, affects one third of children in developing countries, and leads to increased mortality and poor developmental outcomes. The causes of childhood stunting are unknown, and strategies to improve growth and related outcomes in children have only had modest impacts. Recent studies have shown that the ecosystem of microbes in the human gut, termed the microbiota, can induce changes in weight. However, the specific changes in the gut microbiota that contribute to growth remain unknown, and no studies have investigated the gut microbiota as a determinant of chronic malnutrition.
   Results: We performed secondary analyses of data from two well-characterized twin cohorts of children from Malawi and Bangladesh to identify bacterial genera associated with linear growth. In a case-control analysis, we used the graphical lasso to estimate covariance network models of gut microbial interactions from relative genus abundances and used network analysis methods to select genera associated with stunting severity. In longitudinal analyses, we determined associations between these selected microbes and linear growth using between-within twin regression models to adjust for confounding and introduce temporality. Reduced microbiota diversity and increased covariance network density were associated with stunting severity, while increased relative abundance of Acidaminococcus sp. was associated with future linear growth deficits.
   Conclusions: We show that length growth in children is associated with community-wide changes in the gut microbiota and with the abundance of the bacterial genus, Acidaminococcus. Larger cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and to clarify the mechanisms involved.

AB Avian host life history traits have been hypothesized to predict rates of infection by haemosporidian parasites. Using molecular techniques, we tested this hypothesis for parasites from three haemosporidian genera (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon) collected from a diverse sampling of birds in northern Malawi. We found that host life history traits were significantly associated with parasitism rates by all three parasite genera. Nest type and nest location predicted infection probability for all three parasite genera, whereas flocking behavior is an important predictor of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infection and habitat is an important predictor of Leucocytozoon infection. Parasite prevalence was 79.1% across all individuals sampled, higher than that reported for comparable studies from any other region of the world. Parasite diversity was also exceptionally high, with 248 parasite cytochrome b lineages identified from 152 host species. A large proportion of Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon parasite DNA sequences identified in this study represent new, previously undocumented lineages (n = 201; 81% of total identified) based on BLAST queries against the avian malaria database, MalAvi.

   model; species assemblages; species distribution model
ID EM ALGORITHM; PREDICT; COOCCURRENCE; PATTERNS
AB Species distribution models (SDMs) represent important analytical and predictive tools for ecologists. Until now, these models have either assumed (i) that species' occurrence probabilities are uncorrelated or (ii) that species respond linearly to preselected environmental variables. These two assumptions currently prevent ecologists from modelling assemblages with realistic co-occurrence and species richness properties. This paper introduces a stochastic feedforward neural network, called mistnet', which makes neither assumption. Thus, unlike most SDMs, mistnet can account for non-independent co-occurrence patterns driven by unobserved environmental heterogeneity. And unlike several recently proposed joint SDMs, the model can also learn nonlinear functions relating species' occurrence probabilities to environmental predictors. Mistnet makes more accurate predictions about the North American bird communities found along Breeding Bird Survey transects than several alternative methods tested. In particular, typical assemblages held out of sample for validation were each tens of thousands of times more likely under the mistnet model than under independent combinations of single-species predictions. Apart from improved accuracy, mistnet shows two other important benefits for ecological research and management. First: by analysing co-occurrence data, mistnet can identify unmeasured - and perhaps unanticipated - environmental variables that drive species turnover. For example, the model identified a strong grassland/forest gradient, even though only temperature and precipitation were given as model inputs. Second: mistnet is able to take advantage of outside information to guide its predictions towards more realistic assemblages. For example, mistnet automatically adjusts its expectations to include more forest-associated species in response to a stray observation of a forest-dwelling warbler.

AB AimFreshwater biodiversity is declining world-wide as a result of human-caused degradation of freshwater ecosystems. Declines in species richness are well documented for many taxonomic groups, but less is known about how and why species composition and beta diversity () change in response to environmental degradation in freshwater environments.
   LocationThe Mid-Atlantic Highlands region of the USA (36-42 degrees N, 74-82 degrees E) and Finland in northern Europe (60-68 degrees N, 20-32 degrees E).
   MethodsWe used null models, occupancy analyses, ordinations and multitaxon niche models to assess how of stream macroinvertebrate assemblages in two biogeographically distinct regions responded to environmental alteration and what mechanisms were most likely to have caused the observed differences in .
   ResultsMacroinvertebrate assemblages at anthropogenically disturbed sites were significantly more dissimilar from one another than were reference sites, a result contrary to those reported in several other studies. In this study, anthropogenic disturbances decreased the regional prevalence of most common taxa and increased the prevalence of several less common taxa. These differences in taxon occupancies and between the reference condition and disturbed streams are unlikely to be the result of a single mechanism, although environmental filtering was probably of primary importance.
   Main conclusionsThe effects of anthropogenic disturbance on assemblage composition can be variable and probably depend on: initial ecological conditions; the magnitude, type and uniformity of environmental alteration occurring in a region; and the sensitivity of individual taxa. It is unlikely that is controlled by a single mechanism, and these variable mechanisms may have diverse effects on taxon occupancies and hence . Restoration ecologists will need to consider how varies naturally across different landscape settings and in response to different types of disturbance when developing region-wide restoration strategies.

AB Urban heat islands (UHIs) created through urbanization can have negative impacts on the lives of people living in cities. They may also vary spatially and temporally over a city. There is, thus, a need for greater understanding of these patterns and their causes. While previous UHI studies focused on only a few cities and/or several explanatory variables, this research provides a comprehensive and comparative characterization of the diurnal and seasonal variation in surface UHI intensities (SUHIIs) across 67 major Chinese cities. The factors associated with the SUHII were assessed by considering a variety of related social, economic and natural factors using a regression tree model. Obvious seasonal variation was observed for the daytime SUHII, and the diurnal variation in SUHII varied seasonally across China. Interestingly, the SUHII varied significantly in character between northern and southern China. Southern China experienced more intense daytime SUHIIs, while the opposite was true for nighttime SUHIIs. Vegetation had the greatest effect in the day time in northern China. In southern China, annual electricity consumption and the number of public buses were found to be important. These results have important theoretical significance and may be of use to mitigate UHI effects.

AB Trophic cascades are indirect positive effects of predators on resources via control of intermediate consumers. Larger-bodied predators appear to induce stronger trophic cascades (a greater rebound of resource density toward carrying capacity), but how this happens is unknown because we lack a clear depiction of how the strength of trophic cascades is determined. Using consumer resource models, we first show that the strength of a trophic cascade has an upper limit set by the interaction strength between the basal trophic group and its consumer and that this limit is approached as the interaction strength between the consumer and its predator increases. We then express the strength of a trophic cascade explicitly in terms of predator body size and use two independent parameter sets to calculate how the strength of a trophic cascade depends on predator size. Both parameter sets predict a positive effect of predator size on the strength of a trophic cascade, driven mostly by the body size dependence of the interaction strength between the first two trophic levels. Our results support previous empirical findings and suggest that the loss of larger predators will have greater consequences on trophic control and biomass structure in food webs than the loss of smaller predators.

AB The development and function of our brain are governed by a genetic blueprint, which reflects dynamic changes over the history of evolution. Recent progress in genetics and genomics, facilitated by next-generation sequencing and single-cell sorting, has identified numerous genomic loci that are associated with a neuroanatomical or neurobehavioral phenotype. Here, we review some of the genetic changes in both protein-coding and noncoding regions that affect brain development and evolution, as well as recent progress in brain transcriptomics. Understanding these genetic changes may provide novel insights into neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia.

AB The authenticity and reliability of urbanization levels measured by different indicators in China have not reached a consensus, which may impede our understanding of the process of urbanization and its impacts on the environment. The objective of this study was to describe a reliable method of estimating urbanization level based on the Operational Line-scan System (OLS) on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) nighttime light data and to analyze the dynamics of urbanization levels in China from 1992 to 2012. We calculated the comprehensive urbanization level at the national, provincial, and county scales using a compounded night light index (CNLI) and compared the change rate of CNLI with those of the other two conventional urbanization level indicators, proportion of the nonagricultural population and proportion of built-up area. Our results showed that CNLI derived from the DMSP/OLS data set provided a relatively reliable and accurate measure of the comprehensive urbanization level in China. During the last two decades, China has experienced continued and rapid urbanization with large regional variations. The CNLI increased 3.12 times, from 1.72 x 10(-3) to 7.09 x 10(-3). The annual increases of CNLI in eastern provinces were much faster than those in western provinces. In addition, we found that the rates of change in these three indicators were consistent for most provinces with the exception of the four municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) and a few eastern coastal provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong). Because the imbalance among population growth, urban expansion and socioeconomic development may affect cities' sustainable development, we should pay more attention to these regions with large disparities between different indicators.

AB Recently, in addition to the popular concept of "ecosystem services" (ES), the term "landscape services" (LS) has come into use. We are examining the question of whether a stronger focus on LS would be useful, particularly with regard to case studies carried out in Germany. Important reasons for introducing the term LS include the prominent role of spatial aspects, the reference to landscape elements and the landscape character, and the relevance of LS for landscape planning. We found no strong arguments for replacing the concept of ES by LS; however, we do prefer a situation-related use of both concepts. We propose the following definition: Landscape services are the contributions of landscapes and landscape elements to human well-being.

AB We investigated how soil respiration (Rs), heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and rhizosphere respiration (Rr) respond to nitrogen addition in a 21-yr-old larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii) plantation in North China. Three levels of nitrogen treatments (control, no nitrogen addition; low-N, 20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); high-N, 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) were established in May 2010. Rs, Rh and Rr were then measured during the growing seasons from 2011 to 2013. Nitrogen addition significantly reduced Rs by 10.0% under low-N treatment and by 12.5% under high-N treatment. Rh and Rr showed different responses to nitrogen addition. Nitrogen addition had no significant effects on growing season fluxes of Rh during the observation periods, but Rr was decreased by similar to 37% and similar to 31% under the low-N and high-N treatments, respectively. Averaged across the three growing seasons, the mean rate of Rs decreased from 2.47 +/- 0.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the control plots to 2.22 +/- 0.34 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in low-N plot and 2.16 +/- 0.30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the high-N plot. Rr contributed about 111% and 76% of the observed reduction of Rs in low and high-N plots, respectively. In addition, elevated nitrogen input also reduced the temperature coefficients (Q(10)) of Rh and Rr. Compared to the control, nitrogen additions significantly decreased Q(10) of Rh and Rr in high-N plots by 7% and 13%, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the reduction in Rs can mainly be attributed to the decrease in rhizosphere respiration in our nitrogen-limited plantation. With global temperature rising, nitrogen deposition may increase carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems, not only by reducing carbon loss by Rs, but also by reducing the temperature coefficients of Rh and Rr.

AB Ocean acidification (OA) effects on larvae are partially attributed for the rapidly declining oyster production in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. This OA effect is a serious concern in SE Asia, which produces >80% of the world's oysters. Because climate-related stressors rarely act alone, we need to consider OA effects on oysters in combination with warming and reduced salinity. Here, the interactive effects of these three climate-related stressors on the larval growth of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, were examined. Larvae were cultured in combinations of temperature (24 and 30 degrees C), pH (8.1 and 7.4), and salinity (15 psu and 25 psu) for 58 days to the early juvenile stage. Decreased pH (pH 7.4), elevated temperature (30 degrees C), and reduced salinity (15 psu) significantly delayed pre- and post-settlement growth. Elevated temperature lowered the larval lipid index, a proxy for physiological quality, and negated the negative effects of decreased pH on attachment and metamorphosis only in a salinity of 25 psu. The negative effects of multiple stressors on larval metamorphosis were not due to reduced size or depleted lipid reserves at the time of metamorphosis. Our results supported the hypothesis that the C. gigas larvae are vulnerable to the interactions of OA with reduced salinity and warming in Yellow Sea coastal waters now and in the future.

AB Aim To assess the future climatic suitability of European catchments for freshwater species and the future utility of the current network of protected areas.
   Location Europe.
   Methods Using recently updated catchment-scale species data and climate projections from multiple climate models, we assessed the climate change threat by the 2050s for 1648 European freshwater plants, fishes, molluscs, odonates, amphibians, crayfish and turtles for two dispersal scenarios and identified hot-spots of change at three spatial scales: major river basins, countries and freshwater ecoregions. We considered both common species and the often overlooked rare species. To set our findings within the context of current and future conservation networks, we evaluated the coverage of freshwater biodiversity by Europe's protected area network.
   Results Six per cent of common and 77% of rare species are predicted to lose more than 90% of their current range. Eight fish species and nine mollusc species are predicted to experience 100% range loss under climate change. As the most species-rich group, molluscs are particularly vulnerable due to the high proportion of rare species and their relatively limited ability to disperse. Furthermore, around 50% of molluscs and fish species will have no protected area coverage given their projected distributions.
   Main conclusions We identified the species most at threat due to projected changes in both catchment suitability and representation within the European protected area network. Our findings suggest an urgent need for freshwater management plans to facilitate adaptation to climate change.

AB The traditional view of forest dynamics originated by Kira and Shidei [Kira T, Shidei T (1967) Jap J Ecol 17: 70-87] and Odum [Odum EP (1969) Science 164(3877): 262-270] suggests a decline in net primary productivity (NPP) in aging forests due to stabilized gross primary productivity (GPP) and continuously increased autotrophic respiration (R-a). The validity of these trends in GPP and Ra is, however, very difficult to test because of the lack of long-term ecosystem-scale field observations of both GPP and Ra. Ryan and colleagues [Ryan MG, Binkley D, Fownes JH (1997) Ad Ecol Res 27: 213-262] have proposed an alternative hypothesis drawn from site-specific results that aboveground respiration and below-ground allocation decreased in aging forests. Here, we analyzed data from a recently assembled global database of carbon fluxes and show that the classical view of the mechanisms underlying the age-driven decline in forest NPP is incorrect and thus support Ryan's alternative hypothesis. Our results substantiate the age-driven decline in NPP, but in contrast to the traditional view, both GPP and R-a decline in aging boreal and temperate forests. We find that the decline in NPP in aging forests is primarily driven by GPP, which decreases more rapidly with increasing age than R-a does, but the ratio of NPP/GPP remains approximately constant within a biome. Our analytical models describing forest succession suggest that dynamic forest ecosystem models that follow the traditional paradigm need to be revisited.

AB The role of Pleistocene climate changes in promoting evolutionary diversification in global biota is well documented, but the great majority of data regarding this subject come from North America and Europe, which were greatly affected by glaciation. The effects of Pleistocene changes on cold- and/or dry-adapted species in tropical areas where glaciers were not present remain sparsely investigated. Many such species are restricted to small areas surrounded by unfavourable habitats, which may represent potential interglacial microrefugia. Here, we analysed the phylogeographic structure and diversification history of seven cactus species in the Pilosocereus aurisetus complex that are restricted to rocky areas with high diversity and endemism within the Neotropical savannas of eastern South America. We combined palaeodistributional estimates with standard phylogeographic approaches based on two chloroplast DNA regions (trnT-trnL and trnS-trnG), exon 1 of the nuclear gene PhyC and 10 nuclear microsatellite loci. Our analyses revealed a phylogeographic history marked by multiple levels of distributional fragmentation, isolation leading to allopatric differentiation and secondary contact among divergent lineages within the complex. Diversification and demographic events appear to have been affected by the Quaternary climatic cycles as a result of isolation in multiple patches of xerophytic vegetation. These small patches presently harbouring P.aurisetus populations seem to operate as microrefugia, both at present and during Pleistocene interglacial periods; the role of such microrefugia should be explored and analysed in greater detail.

AB Many aquatic ecosystems sustain multiple invasive species and interactions among them have important implications for ecosystem structure and functioning. Here, we examine interactions among two pairs of invasive crayfish species because of their close proximity and thus chance of sympatric populations in the near future within the Thames catchment, U.K. (signal, Pacifastacus leniusculus and virile crayfish, Orconectes virilis within a river system; red swamp, Procambarus clarkii and Turkish crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus found within a suite of ponds). We address two questions: do sympatric invasive crayfish occupy a smaller niche than their allopatric counterparts due to potential resource competition? and do interactions among invasive species amplify or mitigate one another's impacts on the ecosystem?
   Two fully factorial mesocosm experiments (one for each crayfish pair) were used to investigate crayfish diet and their impact on benthic invertebrate community structure, benthic algal standing stock and leaf litter decomposition rates in allopatric and sympatric populations, compared with a crayfish-free control. We used stable isotope analysis to examine crayfish diet in the mesocosms and in allopatric populations of each species in the Thames catchment.
   Isotopic niche width did not vary significantly between allopatric and sympatric populations of crayfish in the mesocosm experiments, and isotopic niche partitioning in all the wild populations suggests the invaders can coexist.
   All four species altered benthic invertebrate community structure but with differing functional effects, often mediated via trophic cascades. Red swamp crayfish predation upon snails evidently promoted benthic algal standing stock via reduction in grazing pressure. However, a trophic cascade whereby the crayfish consumed native invertebrate shredders, causing a reduction in net leaf litter decomposition, was decoupled by red swamp and signal crayfish since they consumed leaf litter directly and thus moderated the cascade to a trickle when in sympatry with Turkish or virile crayfish, respectively.
   Benthic invertebrate predator abundance was significantly reduced by sympatric red swamp and Turkish crayfish but not independently when in allopatry, indicating an amplified effect overall when in sympatry.
   Our results suggest that the combined effect of multiple invasions on the ecosystem can reflect either an additive effect of their independent impacts or an amplified effect, which is greater than the sum of their independent impacts. A lack of general pattern in their effects makes any potential management strategy more complex.

AB Detailed knowledge of a species' functional niche is crucial for the study of ecological communities and processes. The extent of niche overlap, functional redundancy and functional complementarity is of particular importance if we are to understand ecosystem processes and their vulnerability to disturbances.
   Coral reefs are among the most threatened marine systems, and anthropogenic activity is changing the functional composition of reefs. The loss of herbivorous fishes is particularly concerning as the removal of algae is crucial for the growth and survival of corals. Yet, the foraging patterns of the various herbivorous fish species are poorly understood.
   Using a multidimensional framework, we present novel individual-based analyses of species' realized functional niches, which we apply to a herbivorous coral reef fish community. In calculating niche volumes for 21 species, based on their microhabitat utilization patterns during foraging, and computing functional overlaps, we provide a measurement of functional redundancy or complementarity. Complementarity is the inverse of redundancy and is defined as less than 50% overlap in niche volumes.
   The analyses reveal extensive complementarity with an average functional overlap of just 15 center dot 2%. Furthermore, the analyses divide herbivorous reef fishes into two broad groups. The first group (predominantly surgeonfishes and parrotfishes) comprises species feeding on exposed surfaces and predominantly open reef matrix or sandy substrata, resulting in small niche volumes and extensive complementarity. In contrast, the second group consists of species (predominantly rabbitfishes) that feed over a wider range of microhabitats, penetrating the reef matrix to exploit concealed surfaces of various substratum types. These species show high variation among individuals, leading to large niche volumes, more overlap and less complementarity.
   These results may have crucial consequences for our understanding of herbivorous processes on coral reefs, as algal removal appears to depend strongly on species-specific microhabitat utilization patterns of herbivores. Furthermore, the results emphasize the capacity of the individual-based analyses to reveal variation in the functional niches of species, even in high-diversity systems such as coral reefs, demonstrating its potential applicability to other high-diversity ecosystems.

AB In terrestrial ecosystems, deep soils are a major reservoir of organic carbon (C). Improving knowledge of how deep soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization responds to fresh C supply and nitrogen (N) availability is essential to better understand whether this C pool will react to climate change. However, little is known about the effects of C and N inputs on SOC mineralization and microbial communities in forest deep soils. To quantify the effects of C and N inputs on SOC mineralization, we apply two species of C-13 -labeled leaf litters and ammonium chloride solution while incubating soils collected from 60 cm to 70 cm depth in a coniferous forest in subtropical China. The soil phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles are also determined to establish the effects of C and N supply on microbial community structure, and the delta C-13 in PLFAs is used to establish pathways of leaf litter-derived C flux among microbial communities. The addition of leaf litters stimulates deep SOC mineralization, indicating that the stability of deep SOC is attributed to a lack of fresh C input, but the addition of Michelin macclurei litter with higher C:P ratio has a greater positive priming effect than adding Pious massoniana litter. N addition reduces the magnitude of positive priming and alters the direction of priming in soils with P. massoniana litter addition, suggesting that N deposition may suppress deep SOC mineralization and favor the maintenance of SOC storage. Leaf litter addition enhances the biomass of individual PLFA and increases the fungi:bacteria ratio, suggesting that microbes are limited by energy and that soil microbial community composition is modified by C inputs. N addition decreases the fungi:bacteria ratio, but increases the Gram positive:Gram negative bacteria ratio. The highest C-13-enrichment and distribution of litter derived C are found in 16:0 and 18:1 omega 9c PLFAs, but litter species and N addition do not affect total PLFA-C and litter-derived PLFA-C. These results support the views that a lack of fresh C supply and N deposition may prevent the mineralization of SOC pool in deep layers and that the utilization of labile substrate by 16:0 and 18:1 omega 9c populations promotes positive SOC priming.

AB A central assumption underlying the study of habitat selection is that selected habitats confer enhanced fitness. Unfortunately, this assumption is rarely tested, and in some systems, gradients of predation risk may more accurately characterize spatial variation in vital rates than gradients described by habitat selection studies. Here, we separately measured spatial patterns of both resource selection and predation risk and tested their relationships with a key demographic trait, adult female survival, for a threatened ungulate, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou Gmelin). We also evaluated whether exposure to gradients in both predation risk and resource selection value was manifested temporally through instantaneous or seasonal effects on survival outcomes. We used Cox proportional hazards spatial survival modelling to assess the relative support for 5 selection- and risk-based definitions of habitat quality, as quantified by woodland caribou adult female survival. These hypotheses included scenarios in which selection ideally mirrored survival, risk entirely drove survival, non-ideal selection correlated with survival but with additive risk effects, an ecological trap with maladaptive selection and a non-spatial effect of annual variation in weather. Indeed, we found positive relationships between the predicted values of a resource selection function (RSF) and survival, yet subsequently incorporating an additional negative effect of predation risk greatly improved models further. This revealed a positive, but non-ideal relationship between selection and survival. Gradients in these covariates were also shown to affect individual survival probability at multiple temporal scales. Exposure to increased predation risk had a relatively instantaneous effect on survival outcomes, whereas variation in habitat suitability predicted by an RSF had both instantaneous and longer-term seasonal effects on survival. Predation risk was an additive source of hazard beyond that detected through selection alone, and woodland caribou selection thus was shown to be non-ideal. Furthermore, by combining spatial adult female survival models with herd-specific estimates of recruitment in matrix population models, we estimated a spatially explicit landscape of population growth predictions for this endangered species.

AB Global demand for agricultural products is expected to double in the next decades, putting tremendous pressure on agriculture to produce more. The bulk of this increase will come from developing countries, which host most biodiversity-rich areas of the planet. Whilst most biodiversity is found in production landscapes shared with people, where agriculture represents an increasing threat, international conservation organisations continue to focus on the maintenance and expansion of the network of protected areas. When conservation organisations partner with agricultural programmes, they promote low input, extensive agriculture. Combined with the focus on protected areas, this may exacerbate rather than mitigate conflicts between biodiversity conservation and agricultural production. Two models have been proposed to increase agricultural production whilst minimising the negative consequences for biodiversity: 'land sparing' and 'land sharing'. Although often polarized in debates, both are realistic solutions, depending on the local circumstances. We propose a number of criteria that could guide the choice towards one or the other. We conclude that general principles to be considered in both land sparing and land sharing are: managing spillover effects, maintaining resilience and ecosystem services, accounting for landscape structure, reducing losses and wastes, improving access to agricultural products in developing countries and changing consumption patterns in developed countries, and developing supportive markets and policies.

AB Recent ecological studies have shown that oxidative status could have a significant impact on fitness components in wild animals. Not only can oxidative status reflect the environmental conditions that animals experience, but it can also predict their chances of reproduction and survival in the future in their natural habitat. Such important characteristics make markers of oxidative status informative tools to evaluate a priori individual perspectives of reproduction and survival as well as to assess a posteriori the effect of human activities on the fitness of species of conservation concern and wildlife in general. Markers of oxidative status may therefore help conservation practitioners to identify conservation threats to animal populations and to maximize the success of wildlife management. Despite these potential benefits for animal conservation programmes, up to now markers of oxidative status have only been reported anecdotally in conservation studies. The aim of this review is therefore to raise awareness by conservation practitioners of the use of markers of oxidative status. Towards this end, we first describe how environmental disruptions due to human activities can translate into variation in oxidative status. Second, we show how individual and population variation in oxidative status may contribute to the success or the failure of reintroduction or translocation programmes. Finally, we emphasize the technical features specific to the measurement of markers of oxidative status in conservation programmes, which may help investigators with the interpretation of their results. Such prior knowledge about markers of oxidative status may encourage conservation physiologists to use them in order to enhance the success of conservation programmes and wildlife management.

AB The Earth is warming, especially in polar areas in which winter temperatures and precipitation are expected to increase. Despite a growing research focus on winter climatic change, the impacts on Arctic terrestrial ecosystems remain poorly understood. Snow acts as an insulator, and depth changes affect the enhancement of thermally dependent reactions, such as microbial activity, affecting soil nutrient composition, respiration, and winter gas efflux. Snow depth and spring temperatures influence snow melt timing, determining the start of plant growth and forage availability. Delays in winter onset affect tundra carbon balance, faunal hibernation, and migration but are unlikely to lengthen the plant growing season. Mild periods in winter followed by a return to freezing have negative consequences for plants and invertebrates, and the resultant ice layers act as barriers to foraging, triggering starvation of herbivores and their predators. In summary, knock-on effects between seasons and trophic levels have important consequences for biological activity, diversity, and ecosystem function.

AB The study of animal personality variation promises to provide significant new insight into the way that behavior evolves in animals, along with its ecological and evolutionary influences. We strongly advocate more empirical work in this exciting and rapidly expanding research area, but hope that new studies adopt a more hypothesis-driven and/or experimental approach than seems to be usual at the moment. Here we outline what we feel is "good practice" to the many empiricists that are keen on pursuing work in this field. We highlight the substantial body of theoretical work that exists for providing well -reasoned hypotheses, which new empirical studies should be designed to test. Furthermore, using a brief review of existing work on the behavioral ecology of animal personality variation in the zebra finch one of the more widely used model systems in this field we stress the importance of understanding the ecology of the chosen study animal, and the problems that are likely to arise by neglecting to identify or account for the structure of behavioral variation that is often likely to occur.

AB Human-generated noise has profoundly changed natural soundscapes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, imposing novel pressures on ecological processes. Despite interest in identifying the ecological consequences of these altered soundscapes, little is known about the sublethal impacts on wildlife population health and individual fitness. We present evidence that noise induces a physiological stress response in an amphibian and impairs mate attraction in the natural environment. Traffic noise increased levels of a stress-relevant glucocorticoid hormone (corticosterone) in female wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and impaired female travel towards a male breeding chorus in the field, providing insight into the sublethal consequences of acoustic habitat loss. Given that prolonged elevated levels of corticosterone can have deleterious consequences on survival and reproduction and that impaired mate attraction can impact population persistence, our results suggest a novel pathway by which human activities may be imposing population-level impacts on globally declining amphibians.

AB Several species of the genus Urtica (especially Urtica dioica, Urticaceae), are used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments. To better understand the chemical diversity of the genus and to compare different accessions and different taxa of Urtica, 63 leaf samples representing a broad geographical, taxonomical and morphological diversity were evaluated under controlled conditions. A molecular phylogeny for all taxa investigated was prepared to compare phytochemical similarity with phylogenetic relatedness. Metabolites were analyzed via UPLC-PDA-MS and multivariate data analyses. In total, 43 metabolites were identified, with phenolic compounds and hydroxy fatty acids as the dominant substance groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) provides a first structured chemotaxonomy of the genus. The molecular data present a highly resolved phylogeny with well-supported clades and subclades. U. dioica is retrieved as both para- and polyphyletic. European members of the U. dioica group and the North American subspecies share a rather similar metabolite profile and were largely retrieved as one, nearly exclusive cluster by metabolite data. This latter cluster also includes - remotely related - Urtica urens, which is pharmaceutically used in the same way as U. dioica. However, most highly supported phylogenetic clades were not retrieved in the metabolite cluster analyses. Overall, metabolite profiles indicate considerable phytochemical diversity in the genus, which largely falls into a group characterized by high contents of hydroxy fatty acids (e.g., most Andean-American taxa) and another group characterized by high contents of phenolic acids (especially the U. dioica-clade). Antiinflammatory in vitro COX1 enzyme inhibition assays suggest that bioactivity may be predicted by gross metabolic profiling in Urtica. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cynodont therapsids diversified extensively after the Permo-Triassic mass extinction event, and gave rise to mammals in the Jurassic. We use an enlarged and revised dataset of discrete skeletal characters to build a new phylogeny for all main cynodont clades from the Late Permian to the Early Jurassic, and we analyse models of morphological diversification in the group. Basal taxa and epicynodonts are paraphyletic relative to eucynodonts, and the latter are divided into cynognathians and probainognathians, with tritylodonts and mammals forming sister groups. Disparity analyses reveal a heterogeneous distribution of cynodonts in a morphospace derived from cladistic characters. Pairwise morphological distances are weakly correlated with phylogenetic distances. Comparisons of disparity by groups and through time are nonsignificant, especially after the data are rarefied. A disparity peak occurs in the Early/Middle Triassic, after which period the mean disparity fluctuates little. Cynognathians were characterized by high evolutionary rates and high diversity early in their history, whereas probainognathian rates were low. Community structure may have been instrumental in imposing different rates on the two clades.

AB We synthesized available information from ecological models at local and regional scales to obtain a global picture of the trophic position and ecological role of squids in marine ecosystems. First, static food-web models were used to analyze basic ecological parameters and indicators of squids: biomass, production, consumption, trophic level, omnivory index, predation mortality diet, and the ecological role. In addition, we developed various dynamic temporal simulations using two food-web models that included squids in their parameterization, and we investigated potential impacts of fishing pressure and environmental conditions for squid populations and, consequently, for marine food webs. Our results showed that squids occupy a large range of trophic levels in marine food webs and show a large trophic width, reflecting the versatility in their feeding behaviors and dietary habits. Models illustrated that squids are abundant organisms in marine ecosystems, and have high growth and consumption rates, but these parameters are highly variable because squids are adapted to a large variety of environmental conditions. Results also show that squids can have a large trophic impact on other elements of the food web, and top-down control from squids to their prey can be high. In addition, some squid species are important prey of apical predators and may be keystone species in marine food webs. In fact, we found strong interrelationships between neritic squids and the populations of their prey and predators in coastal and shelf areas, while the role of squids in open ocean and upwelling ecosystems appeared more constrained to a bottom-up impact on their predators. Therefore, large removals of squids will likely have large-scale effects on marine ecosystems. In addition, simulations confirm that squids are able to benefit from a general increase in fishing pressure, mainly due to predation release, and quickly respond to changes triggered by the environment. Squids may thus be very sensitive to the effects of fishing and climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chromosomal rearrangements may directly cause hybrid sterility and can facilitate speciation by preserving local adaptation in the face of gene flow. We used comparative linkage mapping with shared gene-based markers to identify potential chromosomal rearrangements between the sister monkeyflowers Mimulus lewisii and Mimulus cardinalis, which are textbook examples of ecological speciation. We then remapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for floral traits and flowering time (premating isolation) and hybrid sterility (postzygotic isolation). We identified three major regions of recombination suppression in the M. lewisii x M. cardinalis hybrid map compared to a relatively collinear Mimulus parishii x M. lewisii map, consistent with a reciprocal translocation and two inversions specific to M. cardinalis. These inferences were supported by targeted intraspecific mapping, which also implied a M. lewisii-specific reciprocal translocation causing chromosomal pseudo-linkage in both hybrid mapping populations. Floral QTLs mapped in this study, along with previously mapped adaptive QTLs, were clustered in putatively rearranged regions. All QTLs for male sterility, including two underdominant loci, mapped to regions of recombination suppression. We argue that chromosomal rearrangements may have played an important role in generating and consolidating barriers to gene flow as natural selection drove the dramatic ecological and morphological divergence of these species.

AB World soils, a large reservoir of reactive carbon, moderate the global carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, radioactive forcing and ecosystem services; as such, soil carbon sequestration is important in limiting global warming to 2 degrees C. Among uncertainties are emissions from soils and permafrost, the CO2 fertilization effect, silicate weathering, the fate of eroded carbon, the efficiency of natural sinks, the permanence of carbon sequestered in soil and measurements of changes in soil carbon over short periods. Adoption of proven technologies can sequester carbon at the rate of 500-1000 kg/ha/year in croplands, 50-500 kg/ha/year in grazing lands, 500-1000 kg/ha/year in forestlands and 5-10 kg/ha/year of pedogenic carbonates in arid lands. Soil carbon is stabilized though deep placement, interaction with clays and the formation of stable aggregates. Adoption of recommended practices can be promoted by payments for ecosystems services. Researchable priorities include understanding trends of principal drivers, quantifying feedbacks related to climate change and impacts on ecosystem services.

AB Commercial selective logging and the conversion of primary and degraded forests to agriculture are the biggest threats to tropical biodiversity. Our understanding of the impacts of these disturbances and the resulting local extinctions on the functional roles performed by the remaining species is limited. We address this issue by examining functional diversity (FD), which quantifies a range of traits that affect a species' ecological role in a community as a single continuous metric. We calculated FD for birds across a gradient of disturbance from primary forest through intensively logged forest to oil palm plantations on previously forested land in Borneo, Southeast Asia, a hotspot of imperilled biodiversity. Logged rainforest retained similar levels of FD to unlogged rainforest, even after two logging rotations, but the conversion of logged forest to oil palm resulted in dramatic reductions in FD. The few remaining species in oil palm filled a disproportionately wide range of functional roles but showed very little clustering in terms of functional traits, suggesting that any further extinctions from oil palm would reduce FD even further. Determining the extent to which the changes we recorded were due to under-utilization of resources within oil palm or a reduction in the resources present is an important next step. Nonetheless our study improves our understanding of the stability and resilience of functional diversity in these ecosystems and of the implications of land-use changes for ecosystem functioning.

AB The long-term impacts of large hydroelectric dams on small-scale fisheries in tropical rivers are poorly known. A promising way to investigate such impacts is to compare and integrate the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of resource users with biological data for the same region. We analyzed the accuracy of fishers' LEK to investigate fisheries dynamics and environmental changes in the Lower Tocantins River (Brazilian Amazon) downstream from a large dam. We estimated fishers' LEK through interviews with 300 fishers in nine villages and collected data on 601 fish landings in five of these villages, 22 years after the dam's establishment (2006-2008). We compared these two databases with each other and with data on fish landings from before the dam's establishment (1981) gathered from the literature. The data obtained based on the fishers' LEK (interviews) and from fisheries agreed regarding the primary fish species caught, the most commonly used type of fishing gear (gill nets) and even the most often used gill net mesh sizes but disagreed regarding seasonal fish abundance. According to the interviewed fishers, the primary environmental changes that occurred after the impoundment were an overall decrease in fish abundance, an increase in the abundance of some fish species and, possibly, the local extinction of a commercial fish species (Semaprochilodus brama). These changes were corroborated by comparing fish landings sampled before and 22 years after the impoundment, which indicated changes in the composition of fish landings and a decrease in the total annual fish production. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that large dams may adversely affect small-scale fisheries downstream and establish a feasible approach for applying fishers' LEK to fisheries management, especially in regions with a low research capacity.

AB Global factors, such as climate change, international trade and introductions of exotic species are often elicited as contributors to the unprecedented rate of disease emergence, but few studies have partitioned these factors for global pandemics. Although contemporary correlative species distribution models (SDMs) can be useful for predicting the spatial patterns of emerging diseases, they focus mainly on the fundamental niche (FN) predictors (i.e. abiotic climate and habitat factors), neglecting dispersal and propagule pressure predictors (PP, number of non-native individuals released into a region). Using a validated, predictive and global SDM, we show that both FN and PP accounted for significant, unique variation to the distribution of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen implicated in the declines and extinctions of over 200 amphibian species worldwide. Bd was associated positively with vegetation, total trade and introduced amphibian hosts, nonlinearly with annual temperature range and non-significantly with amphibian leg trade or amphibian species richness. These findings provide a rare example where both FN and PP factors are predictive of a global pandemic. Our model should help guide management of this deadly pathogen and the development of other globally predictive models for species invasions and pathogen emergence influenced by FN and PP factors.

AB Background: Roemer's Law, a widely cited principle in health care policy, states that hospital beds that are built tend to be used. This simple but powerful expression has been invoked to justify Certificate of Need regulation of hospital beds in an effort to contain health care costs. Despite its influence, a surprisingly small body of empirical evidence supports its content. Furthermore, known geographic factors influencing health services use and the spatial structure of the relationship between hospital bed availability and hospitalization rates have not been sufficiently explored in past examinations of Roemer's Law. We pose the question, "Accounting for space in health care access and use, is there an observable association between the availability of hospital beds and hospital utilization?''
   Methods: We employ an ecological research design based upon the Anderson behavioral model of health care utilization. This conceptual model is implemented in an explicitly spatial context. The effect of hospital bed availability on the utilization of hospital services is evaluated, accounting for spatial structure and controlling for other known determinants of hospital utilization. The stability of this relationship is explored by testing across numerous geographic scales of analysis. The case study comprises an entire state system of hospitals and population, evaluating over one million inpatient admissions.
   Results: We find compelling evidence that a positive, statistically significant relationship exists between hospital bed availability and inpatient hospitalization rates. Additionally, the observed relationship is invariant with changes in the geographic scale of analysis.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the effects of Roemer's Law, thus suggesting that variations in hospitalization rates have origins in the availability of hospital beds. This relationship is found to be robust across geographic scales of analysis. These findings suggest continued regulation of hospital bed supply to assist in controlling hospital utilization is justified.

AB Understanding speciation requires determining how inherent barriers to gene flow (reproductive isolation, RI) evolve between populations. The field of population genomics attempts to address this question by characterizing genome-wide patterns of divergence between taxa, often utilizing next-generation sequencing. Here, we focus on a central assumption of such "genome scans": regions displaying high levels of differentiation contain loci contributing to RI. Three major issues are discussed concerning the relationship between gene flow, genomic divergence, and speciation: (a) patterns expected in the presence versus absence of gene flow; (b) processes, such as direct selection and genetic hitchhiking, allowing for divergence with gene flow; and (c) the consequences of the timing of when gene flow occurs during speciation (e. g., continuous gene flow versus gene flow following secondary contact after a period of initial allopatric divergence). Theory and existing data are presented for each issue, and avenues for future work are highlighted.

AB The prevalence of obesity in modern societies has two major contributory factors-an environmental change that has happened in historical times and a genetic predisposition that has its origins in our evolutionary history. Understanding both aspects is complex. From an evolutionary perspective, three different types of explanation have been proposed. The first is that obesity was once adaptive and enabled us to survive (or sustain fecundity) through periods of famine. People carrying so-called thrifty genes that enabled the efficient storage of energy as fat between famines would be at a selective advantage. In the modern world, however, people who have inherited these genes deposit fat in preparation for a famine that never comes, and the result is widespread obesity. The key problem with this, and any other adaptive scenario, is to understand why, if obesity was historically so advantageous, many people did not inherit these thrifty genes and in modern society are able to remain slim, despite the environmental change favoring fat storage. The second type of explanation is that obesity is not adaptive and may never even have existed in our evolutionary past, but it is favored today as a maladaptive by-product of positive selection on some other trait. An example of this type of explanation is the suggestion that obesity results from variation in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Finally, a third class of explanation is that most mutations in the genes that predispose us to obesity are neutral and have been drifting over evolutionary time-so-called drifty genes, leading some individuals to be obesity prone and others obesity resistant. In this article, I review the current evidence for and against these three different scenarios and conclude that the thrifty gene hypothesis is untenable but the other two ideas may provide a cogent explanation of the modern obesity phenomenon.

AB While many migratory marine organisms converge at breeding areas, identifying foraging strategies away from these reproductive sites can be challenging. Adult female green turtles Chelonia mydas regularly migrate thousands of kilometers between nesting and foraging areas, making it difficult to identify foraging habitats that support nesting populations and to understand their feeding strategies. In this study, we use stable isotope analysis to investigate the trophic ecology and spatial distribution of foraging green turtles in the Greater Caribbean. Further, we explore the possibility that adult green turtles, originally considered to be herbivores, may, like their counterparts in the Pacific Ocean, display carnivorous feeding strategies. The wide range of carbon and nitrogen isotope values in bulk epidermis observed in the nesting population at Tortuguero, Costa Rica, could indicate that these turtles feed over several trophic levels. Isotopic niches-or the range of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, which can be used as a proxy for ecological niche-varied among the 5 green turtle foraging aggregations sampled. Similarly, the isotopic composition of the primary producer Thalassia testudinum also varied substantially with geographic location. However, compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (AA-CSIA) indicated that individuals in the nesting population with different bulk delta N-15 values feed at the same trophic position. The combined results suggest that spatial differences in the isotopic composition of seagrass at the base of the food web, rather than differences in turtle foraging strategy, contribute to the isotopic variation in the nesting population. This study improves understanding of the foraging ecology of a highly dispersed and migratory species.

AB 1. Habitat filtering and limiting similarity have been proposed as two opposing forces structuring community memberships. Community assembly theory proposes habitat filtering as a mechanism restricting community membership according to the ecological strategies of species in a given environment. Limiting similarity posits that some species exclude others that are ecologically similar.
   2. We quantified nine ecophysiological and life-history traits for 80 dipterocarp species in the 52-ha Lambir Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP; Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia). We studied forests on four soil types differing in fertility and moisture, focusing on soil resource availabilities as environmental determinants of habitat filtering processes. We used a null-model approach to detect the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity. We quantified the relative contributions of soil resources (nutrients and water) to habitat filtering by comparing the strength of habitat filtering processes (i.e. effect sizes) at the overall plot scale and at the individual soil-type scale. We also compared the strengths of assembly processes among soil types.
   3. Compared to a null model at microscale (20 x 20 m), trait range and variance were reduced for seven of nine functional traits, suggesting the importance of habitat filtering in the dipterocarp community. We also found a broader distribution of five traits, and more even spacing for seven traits (20 x 20 m), which is consistent with the concept of limiting similarity. Randomizations that swapped species occurrences within soil types (i.e. null models removing soil effects in assembly processes) were much closer to observed values, and there were no phylogenetic constraints on habitat association. Hence, soil resource availability acted as a habitat filtering mechanismin the FDP; relative contributions to habitat filtering ranged from 35% for seed mass to 77% for relative growth rate. Furthermore, soil types apparently affected the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity.
   4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that soil resource availability is a crucial determinant of habitat filtering in this species-rich tropical rain forest; the strengths of assembly processes differed among soil types. Variation in soil resource availability can shape the distribution of traits through community assembly processes, promoting trait diversification and species coexistence.

AB Competition for canopy space is a process of major importance in forest dynamics. Although virgin and old-growth European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests in Europe have been studied for many years, there are to date no studies of individual-tree crown plasticity and the way this is influenced by local neighborhood interactions in these forests. In this study, we analyzed crown plasticity and local neighborhood interactions of individual trees in the upper canopy of the old-growth beech forests of Serrahn, northeast Germany. In a 2.8-ha sample plot, we measured crown radii of all upper canopy trees and analyzed the direction and extent of crown asymmetry. Size, relative position, and distance of neighboring trees were used to construct vectors of neighborhood asymmetry within different distances from target trees. The crowns of beech trees showed strong morphological plasticity. Mean absolute and relative displacement of crown centers from the stem base were 1.95 m and 0.37, respectively. Circular-circular rank correlation coefficients between the direction of crown displacement and the direction of neighborhood pressure showed that trees strongly positioned their crowns away from local neighbors. Highest correlation coefficients were obtained when basal area and relative position of neighboring trees within a radial distance of 12 m were considered. Clark and Evans index and Ripley's K-function showed that crowns were more regularly distributed than stems. Projected canopy cover was about 10% higher than canopy cover with simulated circular crowns. We conclude that the crowns of older beech trees have a high ability to plastically respond to changes in the local canopy conditions, enabling very effective exploitation of canopy space.

AB Effective broad-spectrum biodiversity conservation requires that conservation strategies simultaneously meet the needs of multiple species. However, little is known about how maintaining habitat connectivity for one species or species group may also act as an umbrella for other species. We evaluated the degree to which predicted connected habitat for each of 144 different hypothetical organisms expressing range of dispersal abilities and ecological responses to elevation, roads and land cover function as an indicators of connected habitat for the others in the U.S. Northern Rocky Mountains. We used resistant kernel modeling to map the extent of the study area predicted to be connected by dispersal for each species. At relatively large dispersal abilities there was extensive overlap between connected habitat for most organisms and much of the study area is predicted to provide connected habitat for all hypothetical organisms simultaneously. In contrast, at low to medium dispersal abilities there was much less intersection of habitat connected by dispersal. We found that habitat specialists with limited dispersal ability are weak indicators of others, and likewise are weakly indicated by others. We evaluated the effectiveness of three carnivores as connectivity umbrellas for many species. All three carnivore species performed significantly worse as connectivity umbrellas than the average across the simulated species. These species are associated with high elevation forested habitats. It is the low elevation and non-forest habitats that are most at risk of habitat loss and fragmentation in the study area, suggesting that a carnivore umbrella may miss many species most at risk.

AB Background: Stability is a crucial ecosystem feature gaining particular importance in face of increasing anthropogenic stressors. Biodiversity is considered to be a driving biotic force maintaining stability, and in this study we investigate how different indices of biodiversity affect the stability of communities in varied abiotic (composition of available resources) and biotic (invasion) contexts.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We set up microbial microcosms to study the effects of genotypic diversity on the reliability of community productivity, defined as the inverse of the coefficient of variation of across-treatment productivity, in different environmental contexts. We established a bacterial diversity gradient ranging from 1 to 8 Pseudomonas fluorescens genotypes and grew the communities in different resource environments or in the presence of model invasive species. Biodiversity significantly stabilized community productivity across treatments in both experiments. Path analyses revealed that different aspects of diversity determined stability: genotypic richness stabilized community productivity across resource environments, whereas functional diversity determined stability when subjected to invasion.
   Conclusions/Significance: Biodiversity increases the stability of microbial communities against both biotic and abiotic environmental perturbations. Depending on stressor type, varying aspects of biodiversity contribute to the stability of ecosystem functions. The results suggest that both genetic and functional diversity need to be preserved to ensure buffering of communities against abiotic and biotic stresses.

AB We review the opportunities to validate multibody musculoskeletal models in view of the current transition of musculoskeletal modelling from a research topic to a practical simulation tool in product design, healthcare and other important applications. This transition creates a new need for justification that the models are adequate representations of the systems they simulate. The need for a consistent terminology and established standards is identified and knowledge from fields with a more progressed state-of-the-art in verification and validation is introduced. A number of practical steps for improvement of the validation of multibody musculoskeletal models are pointed out and directions for future research in the field are proposed. It is hoped that a more structured approach to model validation can help to improve the credibility of musculoskeletal models.

AB 1. Revegetation can provide major environmental benefits in degraded landscapes, but there is also potential for negative impacts from genetic change in local native populations. Broad areas of revegetation may provide a large source of foreign genes in landscapes where small remnant native populations act as a sink. Genetic change from hybridisation can threaten population persistence and contribute to species extinction through genetic assimilation or demographic swamping.
   2. Implementation of revegetation within a risk management framework allows identification of risk factors, analysis and evaluation of risk to inform decision-making and management to minimise and mitigate the risk. Informed analysis and evaluation of genetic risk is important in revegetation because it will be difficult to control or reverse the impacts in natural ecosystems and they are often not expressed until the second generation or later.
   3. A risk assessment protocol is presented based on evaluation of factors that influence the likelihood and consequences of adverse genetic change from revegetation arising through pollen dispersal.
   4. The assessment is applicable to a broad range of revegetation activities and contributes to the development of informed decision-making processes in implementation of revegetation systems and land use practices that protect and enhance biodiversity in degraded landscapes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Implementation of revegetation programmes within a risk management framework will help to ensure that significant environmental benefits are captured with minimal concomitant negative impacts on the surrounding biodiversity. A genetic risk protocol provides a tool for evaluation of potential adverse genetic impacts on native populations from revegetation and can be implemented in conjunction with weed risk assessment. Risk assessment as an integral part of evaluation of environmental impact for large-scale revegetation programmes will contribute to the development of informed decision-making processes in the implementation of revegetation systems, and ultimately, it will aid in the development of land uses that protect and enhance biodiversity in degraded landscapes.

AB Introduced species represent opportunities to observe evolution over contemporary time scales, and as exotics encounter new environments, adaptive responses can occur, potentially contributing to invasion. Here, we compare 22 native North American populations and 12 introduced European populations of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) in five common gardens (control, herbivory, light stress, nutrient stress and drought). We found evidence for improved growth and reproduction of the introduced populations in most environments, particularly in the light stress. However, under drought conditions, the introduced plants experienced more rapid wilting and mortality than their native counterparts, evidence consistent with a life-history trade-off between rapid growth and drought tolerance. Moreover, we found parallel latitudinal clines in flowering time and correlations between fitness components and the local climate of the source populations in both ranges. Together these data provide evidence for adaptation to local environmental conditions in the native and introduced range of common ragweed.

AB Potential causes of species' geographic distribution limits fall into two broad classes: (1) limited adaptation across spatially variable environments and (2) limited opportunities to colonize unoccupied areas. Combining demographic studies, analyses of demographic responses to environmental variation, and species distribution models, we investigated the causes of range limits in a model system, the eastern border of the California annual plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. Vital rates of 20 populations varied with growing season temperature and precipitation: fruit number and overwinter survival of 1-year-old seeds declined steeply, while current-year seed germination increased modestly along west-to-east gradients in decreasing temperature, decreasing mean precipitation, and increasing variation in precipitation. Long-term stochastic finite rate of increase, X exhibited a fourfold range and varied among geologic surface materials as well as with temperature and precipitation. Growth rate declined significantly toward the eastern border, falling below 1 in three of the five easternmost populations. Distribution models employing demographically important environmental variables predicted low habitat favorability beyond the eastern border. Models that filtered or weighted population presences by X, predicted steeper eastward declines in favorability and assigned greater roles in setting the distribution to among-year variation in precipitation and to geologic surface material. These analyses reveal a species border likely set by limited adaptation to declining environmental quality.

AB Important changes are needed to disciplinary theories and methods to support interdisciplinary and integrated ocean and coastal management policies and implementation. This review argues that theories and methods should conform to a perspective that ocean management is a societal activity with diverse goals ideally informed by interdisciplinary information. The review focuses on the integrated coastal management (ICM) and marine ecosystem-based management (EBM) frameworks and the marine protected areas (MPA) management tool. It begins by suggesting that at present there is a notable imbalance in the degree of effort allocated to monitoring the ecological and social dimensions of ocean resource use and policy processes. Based on how Western society and an influential epistemic community construct 'the environment' and society's relation to the environment, natural sciences play an inordinately important role in the description of the problem and policy recommendations. The discourse advocating for a global networks of marine protected areas, without adequate consideration of society impacts and responses, represents an example of this imbalance. Rebalancing the contributions of scientific disciplines encounters various dilemmas with epistemological, methodological and sociological dimensions. The analysis concludes with suggestions for balancing ocean and coastal interdisciplinary research and reframing key issues, creating self reflexive and multidisciplinary research teams, and reworking educational programmes.

   FRAMEWORK
AB We collected ants from six urban and one forest land-use types in Raleigh, NC to examine the effects of urbanization on species richness and assemblage composition. Since urban areas are warmer (i.e., heat island effect) we also tested if cities were inhabited by species from warmer/drier environments. Species richness was lower in industrial areas relative to other urban and natural environments. There are two distinct ant assemblages; 1) areas with thick canopy cover, and 2) more disturbed open urban areas. Native ant assemblages in open environments have more southwestern (i.e., warmer/drier) distributions than forest assemblages. High native species richness suggests that urban environments may allow species to persist that are disappearing from natural habitat fragments. The subset of species adapted to warmer/drier environments indicates that urban areas may facilitate the movement of some species. This suggests that urban adapted ants may be particularly successful at tracking future climate change.

AB Interspecific competition is a key process determining the dynamics of mixed forest stands and influencing the yield of multispecies tree plantations. Trees can respond to competitive pressure from neighbors by crown plasticity, thereby avoiding competition. We employed a high-resolution ground-based laser scanner to analyze the 3-dimensional extensions and shape of the tree crowns in a near-natural broad-leaved mixed forest in order to quantify the direction and degree of crown asymmetry of 15 trees (Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Carpinus betulus) in detail. We also scanned the direct neighbors and analyzed the distance of their crown centres and the crown shape with the aim to predict the crown asymmetry of the focal tree from competition-relevant attributes of its neighbors. It was found that the combination of two parameters, one summarizing the size of the neighbor (DBH) and one describing the distance to the neighbor tree (HD), was most suitable for characterizing the strength of the competitive interaction exerted on a target tree by a given neighbor. By summing up the virtual competitive pressure of all neighbors in a single competitive pressure vector, we were able to predict the direction of crown asymmetry of the focal tree with an accuracy of 96 degrees on the full circle (36 degrees).
   The competitive pressure model was equally applicable to beech, ash and hornbeam trees and may generate valuable insight into competitive interactions among tree crowns in mixed stands, provided that sufficiently precise data on the shape and position of the tree crowns is available. Multiple-aspect laser-scanning proved to be an accurate and practicable approach for analyzing the complex 3-dimensional shape of the tree crowns, needed to quantify the plasticity of growth processes in the canopy. We conclude that the laser-based analysis of crown plasticity offers the opportunity to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of canopy space exploration and also may produce valuable advice for the silvicultural management of mixed stands.

AB Aim
   Jaguars and pumas, being similar in size and behaviour, are the largest felids of the Neotropics. However, pumas appear to be more resistant to human impacts. Our objective was to compare the response of both species with human impacts at a regional scale in a highly modified region where both species had continuous distribution in the past.
   Location
   The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (UPAF).
   Methods
   Pumas and jaguars presence-only data were used in an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA). From the total number of records, we resampled 95 records of each species 10 times to characterize and compare their habitat requirements, built habitat-suitability maps and examined interspecific differences in niche parameters related to present landscape characteristics.
   Results
   Both species showed high dependence on native forest and habitat protection, and low tolerance to anthropogenic environments. However, jaguars showed higher differences between their optimal habitat and the available landscape (mean +/- SD; marginality M = 2.290 +/- 0.072) and lower tolerance to deviations from their optimal habitat (tolerance T = 0.596 +/- 0.013) than pumas (M = 1.358 +/- 0.067, P < 0.001; T = 0.742 +/- 0.022, P < 0.001). Although their niches highly overlapped (Pianka's O = 0.746 +/- 0.069), pumas' higher tolerance resulted in a larger area covered by suitable patches of habitat with higher connectivity. All jaguar-suitable areas were also suitable for pumas; however, 44 +/- 8% of puma-suitable areas were unsuitable or marginal for jaguars.
   Main conclusions
   Pumas showed more tolerance than jaguars to human impacts at a regional scale in the UPAF, a pattern also observed at local and continental scales. Although the proximate factors responsible for the differential response of pumas to human-altered environments seem to be similar at all spatial scales (e.g. broader trophic niche than jaguars), the resultant spatial configuration of suitable habitat at a regional scale might be another important factor determining puma persistence and higher jaguar demands on conservation efforts.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in soil resources is widely thought to promote plant species coexistence, and this mechanism figures prominently in resource-ratio models of competition. However, most experimental studies have found that nutrient enhancements depress diversity regardless of whether nutrients are uniformly or heterogeneously applied. This mismatch between theory and empirical pattern is potentially due to an interaction between plant size and the scale of resource heterogeneity. Clonal plants that spread vegetatively via rhizomes or stolons can grow large and may integrate across resource patches, thus reducing the positive effect of small-scale resource heterogeneity on plant species richness. Many rhizomatous clonal species respond strongly to increased soil fertility, and they have been hypothesized to drive the descending arm of the hump-shaped productivity-diversity relationship in grasslands. We tested whether clonals reduce species richness in a grassland community by manipulating nutrient heterogeneity, soil fertility, and the presence of rhizomatous clonal species in a 6-year field experiment. We found strong and consistent negative effects of clonals on species richness. These effects were greatest at high fertility and when soil resources were applied at a scale at which rhizomatous clonals could integrate across resource patches. Thus, we find support for the hypothesis that plant size and resource heterogeneity interact to determine species diversity.

AB The temperature response of soil respiration in deserts is not well quantified. We evaluated the response of respiration to temperatures spanning 67A degrees C from seven deserts across North America and Greenland. Deserts have similar respiration rates in dry soil at 20A degrees C, and as expected, respiration rates are greater under wet conditions, rivaling rates observed for more mesic systems. However, deserts differ in their respiration rates under wet soil at 20A degrees C and in the strength of the effect of current and antecedent soil moisture on the sensitivity and magnitude of respiration. Respiration increases with temperature below 30A degrees C but declines for temperatures exceeding 35A degrees C. Hot deserts have lower temperature sensitivity than cold deserts, and insensitive or negative temperature sensitivities were predicted under certain moisture conditions that differed among deserts. These results have implications for large-scale modeling efforts because we highlight the unique behavior of desert soil respiration relative to other systems. These behaviors include variable temperature responses and the importance of antecedent moisture conditions for soil respiration.

AB Ecologists have long known that certain organisms fundamentally modify, create, or define habitats by altering the habitat's physical properties. In the past 15 years, these processes have been formally defined as "ecosystem engineering", reflecting a growing consensus that environmental structuring by organisms represents a fundamental class of ecological interactions occurring in most, if not all, ecosystems. Yet, the precise definition and scope of ecosystem engineering remains debated, as one should expect given the complexity, enormity, and variability of ecological systems. Here I briefly comment on a few specific current points of contention in the ecosystem engineering concept. I then suggest that ecosystem engineering can be profitably subdivided into four narrower functional categories reflecting four broad mechanisms by which ecosystem engineering occurs: structural engineers, bioturbators, chemical engineers, and light engineers. Finally, I suggest some conceptual model frameworks that could apply broadly within these functional groups.

AB Recent advances in technologies have lead to a vast influx of data on movements, based on discrete recorded position of animals or fishing boats, opening new horizons for future analyses. However, most of the potential interest of tracking data depends on the ability to develop suitable modelling strategies to analyze trajectories from discrete recorded positions. A serious modelling challenge is to infer the evolution of the true position and the associated spatio-temporal distribution of behavioural states using discrete, error-prone and incomplete observations. In this paper, a Bayesian Hierarchical Model (HBM) using Hidden Markov Process (HMP) is proposed as a template for analyzing fishing boats trajectories based on data available from satellite-based vessel monitoring systems (VMS). The analysis seeks to enhance the definition of the fishing pressure exerted on fish stocks, by discriminating between the different behavioural states of a fishing trip, and also by quantifying the relative importance of each of these states during a fishing trip. The HBM approach is tested to analyse the behaviour of pelagic trawlers in the Bay of Biscay. A hidden Markov chain with a regular discrete time step is used to model transitions between successive behavioural states (e.g., fishing, steaming, stopping (at Port or at sea)) of each vessel. The parameters of the movement process (speed and turning angles) are defined conditionally upon the behavioural states. Bayesian methods are used to integrate the available data (typically VMS position recorded at discrete time) and to draw inferences on any unknown parameters of the model. The model is first tested on simulated data with different parameters structures. Results provide insights on the potential of HBM with HMP to analyze VMS data. They show that if VMS positions are recorded synchronously with the instants at which the process switch from one behavioural state to another, the estimation method provides unbiased and precise inferences on behavioural states and on associated movement parameters. However, if the observations are not gathered with a sufficiently high frequency, the performance of the estimation method could be drastically impacted when the discrete observations are not synchronous with the switching instants. The model is then applied to real pathways to estimate variables of interest such as the number of operations per trip, time and distance spent fishing or travelling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB To understand the mechanisms determining community composition, it is essential to distinctively unravel the importance of local from that of regional processes. In this effort, the mechanisms underlying bacterioplankton community assembly were analysed in eight lakes of short water residence time (WRT) during a four-season sampling campaign. Bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) was determined using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP) on the 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) and 16S rRNA. The relationship between similarity in BCC between a lake and its major inlet on the one hand and cell import per cell production rate from the inlet to the lake epilimnion on the other was used as a measure of the importance of cell dispersal (mass effects) for community assembly. Low similarities in BCC between lakes and their inlets were observed even at short WRTs, and the degree of similarity correlated better with the environmental conditions in lakes and streams than with cell import per cell production rates. Thus, mass effects seemed less important for local lake BCC in comparison to environmental habitat characteristics (species sorting). Analyses of 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA community fingerprints yielded similar results, indicating that species-sorting dynamics exerted an equally important effect on both the abundant and active fraction within the studied bacterioplankton communities.

AB Assessment of future socio-ecological consequences of land-use policies is useful for supporting decisions about what and where to invest for the best overall environmental and developmental outcomes However, the task faces a great challenge due to the inherent complexity of coupled human-landscape systems and the long-term perspective required for sustainability assessment. Multi-agent system models have been recognized to be well suited to express the co-evolutions of the human and landscape systems in response to policy interventions. This paper applies the Land Use Dynamics Simulator (LUDAS) framework presented by Le et al [Ecological Informatics 3 (2008) 135] a mountain watershed in central Vietnam for supporting the design of land-use policies that enhance environmental and socio-economical benefits in long term With an exploratory modelling strategy for complex integrated systems, our purpose is to assess relative impacts of policy interventions by measuring the long-term landscape and community divergences (compared with a baseline) driven from the widest plausible range of options for a given policy Model's tests include empirical verification and validation of sub-models, rational evaluation of coupled model's structure, and behaviour tests using sensitivity/uncertainty analyses. We design experiments of replicated simulations for relevant policy factors in the study region that include (i) forest protection zoning, (ii) agricultural extension and (iii) agrochemical subsidies As expected, the stronger human-environment interactions the performance indicators involve, the more uncertain the indicators are. Similar to the findings globally summarised by Liu et al [Science 317 (2007) 1513], time lags between the implementation of land-use policies and the appearance of socio-ecological consequences are observed in our case. Long-term legacies are found in the responses of the total cropping area, farm size and income distribution to changes in forest protection zoning, implying that impact assessment of nature conservation policies on rural livelihoods must be considered in multiple decades Our comparative assessment of alternative future socio-ecological scenarios shows that it is challenging to attain better either household income or forest conservation by straightforward expanding the current agricultural extensions and subsidy schemes without improving the qualities of the services The results also suggest that the policy intervention that strengthens the enforcement of forest protection in the critical areas of the watershed and simultaneously create incentives and opportunities for agricultural production in the less critical areas will likely promote forest restoration and community income in long run We also discuss limitations of the simulation model and recommend future directions for model development.

AB It is assumed that predators mainly prey on substandard individuals, but even though some studies partially support this idea, evidence with large sample sizes, exhaustive analysis of prey and robust analysis is lacking. We gathered data from a culling program of yellow-legged gulls killed by two methods: by the use of raptors or by shooting at random. We compared both data sets to assess whether birds of prey killed randomly or by relying on specific individual features of the prey. We carried out a meticulous post-mortem examination of individuals, and analysing multiple prey characteristics simultaneously we show that raptors did not hunt randomly, but rather preferentially predate on juveniles, sick gulls, and individuals with poor muscle condition. Strikingly, gulls with an unusually good muscle condition were also predated more than expected, supporting the mass-dependent predation risk theory. This article provides a reliable example of how natural selection may operate in the wild and proves that predators mainly prey on substandard individuals.

AB High-impact biological invasions often involve establishment and spread in disturbed, high-resource patches followed by establishment and spread in biotically or abiotically stressful areas. Evolutionary change may be required for the second phase of invasion (establishment and spread in stressful areas) to occur. When species have low genetic diversity and short selection history, within-generation phenotypic plasticity is often cited as the mechanism through which spread across multiple habitat types can occur. We show that trans-generational plasticity (TGP) can result in pre-adapted progeny that exhibit traits associated with increased fitness both in high-resource patches and in stressful conditions. In the invasive sedge, Cyperus esculentus, maternal plants growing in nutrient-poor patches can place disproportional number of propagules into nutrient-rich patches. Using the invasive annual grass, Aegilops triuncialis, we show that maternal response to soil conditions can confer greater stress tolerance in seedlings in the form of greater photosynthetic efficiency. We also show TGP for a phenological shift in a low resource environment that results in greater stress tolerance in progeny. These lines of evidence suggest that the maternal environment can have profound effects on offspring success and that TGP may play a significant role in some plant invasions.

AB The degradation of grasslands is a common problem across semi-arid areas worldwide. Over the last 150 years, much of the south-western United States has experienced significant land degradation, with desert grasslands becoming dominated by shrubs and concurrent changes in runoff and erosion which are thought to propagate further the process of degradation. Plot-based experiments to determine how spatio-temporal characteristics of soil moisture, runoff and erosion change over a transition from grassland to shrubland were carried out at four sites over a transition from black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) grassland to creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) shrubland at the Sevilleta NWR LTER site in New Mexico. Each site consisted of a 10 x 30 m bounded runoff plot and adjacent characterization plots with nested sampling points where soil moisture content was measured. Results show distinct spatio-temporal variations in soil moisture content, which are due to the net effect of processes operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales, such as plant uptake of water at local scales versus the redistribution of water during runoff events at the hillslope scale. There is an overall increase in runoff and erosion over the transition from grassland to shrubland, which is likely to be associated with an increase in connectivity of bare, runoff-generating areas, although these increases do not appear to follow a linear trajectory. Erosion rates increased over the transition from grassland to shrubland, likely related in part to changes in runoff characteristics and the increased capacity of the runoff to detach, entrain and transport sediment. Over all plots, fine material was preferentially eroded which has potential implications for nutrient cycling since nutrients tend to be associated with fine sediment.

   PERFORMANCE
AB Delta(CO2)-C-14 observations are increasingly used to constrain recently added fossil fuel CO2 in the atmosphere. We use the LMDZ global atmospheric transport model to examine the pseudo-Lagrangian framework commonly used to determine recently added fossil fuel CO2 (CO2ff). Our results confirm that Delta(CO2)-C-14 spatial variability in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere is dominated by the effect of CO2ff, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, ocean CO2 exchange is more important. The model indicates that the free troposphere, at 3-5 km altitude, is a good choice for "background,'' relative to which the recently added fossil fuel CO2 can be calculated, although spatial variability in free tropospheric Delta(CO2)-C-14 contributes additional uncertainty to the CO2ff calculation. Comparison of model and observations suggests that care must be taken in using high-altitude mountain sites as a proxy for free tropospheric air, since these sites may be occasionally influenced by (polluted) boundary layer air, especially in summer. Other sources of CO2 which have Delta C-14 different than that of the atmosphere contribute a bias, which, over the Northern Hemisphere land, is mostly due to the terrestrial biosphere, whereas ocean CO2 exchange and nuclear industry and natural cosmogenic production of C-14 contribute only weakly. The model indicates that neglecting this bias leads to a consistent underestimation of CO2ff, typically between 0.2 and 0.5ppm of CO2, with a maximum in summer. While our analysis focuses on fossil fuel CO2, our conclusions, particularly the choice of background site, can also be applied to other trace gases emitted at the surface.

AB Aim
   We tested whether the species-energy and species-human relationships vary between native and both naturalized and casual alien species richness when other environmental variables had been taken into account.
   Location
   Trento Province, a region (c. 6200 km2) on the southern border of the European Alps (Italy), subdivided into 156 contiguous (c. 37.5 km2) cells and ranging in elevation from 66 to 3769 m.
   Methods
   Data were separated into three subsets, representing richness of natives, naturalized aliens and casual aliens and separately related to temperature, human population and various environmental correlates of plant species diversity. We applied ordinary least squares and simultaneous autoregressive regressions to identify potential contrasting responses of the three plant status subsets and hierarchical partitioning to evaluate the relative importance of the predictor variables.
   Results
   Variation in alien plant species richness along the region was almost entirely explained by temperature and human population density. The relationships were positive but strongly curvilinear. Native species richness was less strongly related to either factor but was positively related to the presence of calcareous bedrock. Native species richness had a decelerating positive relationship with temperature (R2 = 55%), whereas naturalized and casual aliens had a positive accelerating relationship explaining 86% and 62% of the variation in richness, respectively. Native species richness had a positive decelerating relationship with population density (R2 = 42%), whilst both alien subsets had a positive accelerating relationship.
   Main conclusions
   Alien species richness was higher in areas with the most rich and diverse assemblages of native species. Areas at high altitudes are not especially prone to alien invasion due to energy constraints, low propagule pressure and disturbance, even considering a potential increased in temperature. Thus, if we consider future environmental change, we should expect a stronger response of aliens than natives in the currently warm, urbanized, low-altitude areas than in cold, high-altitude areas where human population density is low.

AB This study estimates the complete carbon budget of an 11.4 km(2) peat-covered catchment in Northern England. The budget considers both fluvial and gaseous carbon fluxes and includes estimates of particulate organic carbon (POC); dissolved organic carbon (DOC); excess dissolved CO2: release of methane (CH4): net ecosystem respiration of CO2: and uptake of CO2 by primary productivity. All components except CH4 were measured directly in the catchment and annual carbon budgets were calculated for the catchment between 1993 and 2005 using both extrapolation and interpolation methods. The study shows that: Over the 13 year study period the total carbon balance varied between a net sink of -20 to -91 Mg C/km(2)/yr. The biggest component of this budget is the uptake of carbon by primary productivity (-178 Mg C/km(2)/yr) and in most years the second largest component is the loss of DOC from the peat profile (+39 Mg C/km(2)/yr). Direct exchanges of C with the atmosphere average -89 Mg C/km(2)/yr in the catchment. Extrapolating the general findings of the carbon budget across all UK peatlands results in an approximate carbon balance of -1.2 Tg C/yr (+/-0.4 Pg C/yr) which is larger than previously reported values. Carbon budgets should always be reported with a clear statement of the techniques used and errors involved as this is significant when comparing results across studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding the genetic mechanisms of speciation and basis of species differences is among the most important challenges in evolutionary biology. Two questions of particular interest are what roles divergent selection and chromosomal differentiation play in these processes. A number of recently proposed theories argue that chromosomal rearrangements can facilitate the development and maintenance of reproductive isolation and species differences by suppressing recombination within rearranged regions. Reduced recombination permits the accumulation of alleles contributing to isolation and adaptive differentiation and protects existing differences from the homogenizing effects of introgression between incipient species. Here, we examine patterns of genetic diversity and divergence in rearranged versus collinear regions in two widespread, extensively hybridizing sunflower species, Helianthus annuus and Helianthus petiolaris, using sequence data from 77 loci distributed throughout the genomes of the two species. We find weak evidence for increased genetic divergence near chromosomal break points but not within rearranged regions overall. We find no evidence for increased rates of adaptive divergence on rearranged chromosomes; in fact, collinear chromosomes show a far greater excess of fixed amino acid differences between the two species. A comparison with a third sunflower species indicates that much of the nonsynonymous divergence between H. annuus and H. petiolaris probably occurred during or soon after their formation. Our results suggest a limited role for chromosomal rearrangements in genetic divergence, but they do document substantial adaptive divergence and provide further evidence of how species integrity and genetic identity can be maintained at many loci in the face of extensive hybridization and gene flow.

AB We investigated the spatial and temporal variability of soil CO2 efflux across 62 sites of a 393-ha complex watershed of the northern Rocky Mountains. Growing season (83 day) cumulative soil CO2 efflux varied from similar to 300 to similar to 2000 g CO2 m(-2), depending upon landscape position, with a median of 879.8 g CO2 m(-2). Our findings revealed that highest soil CO2 efflux rates were observed in areas with persistently high soil moisture (riparian meadows), whereas lower soil CO2 efflux rates were observed on forested uplands (98% of watershed area). Furthermore, upslope accumulated area (UAA), a surrogate measure of the lateral redistribution of soil water, was positively correlated with seasonal soil CO2 efflux at all upland sites, increasing in explanatory power when sites were separated by the major aspects of the watershed (SE/NW). We used the UAA-soil CO2 efflux relationship to upscale measured CO2 efflux to the entire watershed and found watershed-scale soil CO2 efflux of 799.45 +/- 151.1 g CO2 m(-2) over 83 days. These estimates compared well with independent eddy covariance estimates of nighttime ecosystem respiration measured over the forest. We applied this empirical model to three synthetic watersheds with progressively reduced complexity and found that seasonal estimates of soil CO2 efflux increased by 50, 58, and 98%, demonstrating the importance of landscape structure in controlling CO2 efflux magnitude. Our study represents an empirical quantification of seasonal watershed-scale soil CO2 efflux and demonstrates that UAA (i.e., landscape position) and drainage patterns are important controls on the spatial organization of large-scale (similar to km(2)) soil CO2 efflux, particularly in semiarid, subalpine ecosystems.

AB Combining the needs of agricultural production with enhancing biodiversity requires a landscape-scale approach since the geographic scale at which most non-farmed species operate is unconstrained by farm boundaries. Bumblebees are a key component of farmland biodiversity as pollinators of both crops and wild flora. However, the factors determining their densities in such landscapes remain poorly understood.
   Using a combination of remote-sensed landscape data and molecular markers, we quantify the effects of land use (oilseed rape, field beans and non-cropped areas, all of which provide suitable bumblebee forage), at various spatial scales to find the best predictor of colony density for the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum Scopoli in an arable landscape.
   Estimated colony density was positively correlated with the area of all habitat categories within 1000 m of the sample site. No significant relationships were found for greater or lesser distances. This concurs with earlier estimates of the foraging range of this species. We found no evidence that nest sizes increased with forage availability, although our data do not allow us to categorically exclude this possibility.
   It has long been suspected that forage availability limits bee abundance in agricultural landscapes but there is little direct evidence for this. Here we report a direct relationship between floral abundance and bumblebee nest density within a notionally fixed area. Importantly, we suggest that the forage availability within the previously published estimated foraging distance for this species at this location is a good predictor of the scale of impact of forage provision on nesting density.

AB The fact that superabundant invasive pests are also sometimes highly aggressive represents an interesting paradox. Strong intraspecfic aggression should result in high intraspecific competition and limit the densities reached by exotic species. One mechanism that can allow invaders to attain high densities despite high intraspecific aggression, involves positive correlations between aggression and other behaviors such as foraging activity. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to quantify the ecological implications of correlations between aggressiveness and foraging activity among groups of exotic signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) at low and high densities. Our results showed that high invader densities increased intraspecific aggression and per capita interactions between crayfish, but also increased foraging activity and impacts on preferred prey. As a result, exotic crayfish did not show density-dependent reductions in per capita feeding or growth rates. We suggest that the positive correlation between aggression and activity is part of an aggression syndrome whereby some individuals are generally more aggressive/active than others across situations. An aggression syndrome can couple aggressive behaviors important to population establishment of invasive species with foraging activity that enhances the ability of invaders to attain high densities and have large impacts on invaded communities.

AB This paper aims to identify the current challenges facing the sustainable development of island tourism and to develop a new conceptual approach to sustainable development based upon optimisation. The optimisation process for island tourism will be discussed through the development of a new life cycle model - the multifunctional interactive process cycle that is calibrated using a set of 15 island tourism status indicators. The paper also seeks to explain how a complex and dynamic tourism system can be developed that takes a destination towards an optimal sustainable state to satisfy both visitors and the local community.

AB No-take marine reserves are expected to enhance coral reef resilience indirectly through suppression of algal growth and thus maintenance of coral dominance. The mechanism of such enhancement is protection of functionally important herbivorous fishes from harvest. We provide indirect (inferred) evidence of reserves performing this role. We used data on herbivorous fishes, macroalgae and corals collected at one point in time in 15 reserves (range of duration of protection: 0.5 to 11 yr) and at 15 fished sites in the Philippines. Results inferred a 9- and 15-fold increase in density and biomass, respectively, of herbivorous fishes, which coincided with a 13-fold decrease in macroalgal cover inside reserves after 11 yr of protection. The inferred decline in macroalgal cover was more rapid during the first 5 yr of protection. No significant trends in fish abundance or macroalgal cover were detected among fished sites. Biomass of herbivorous fishes was 8 times higher, and cover of macroalgae 25 times lower, on average, inside older (8 to 11 yr) reserves than at fished sites. Parrotfishes (Scaridae), and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) had markedly different inferred trajectories of population recovery. Recovery of parrotfish was more rapid than that of surgeonfish in the first 5 yr of protection, suggesting that the functional role of parrotfish was important in reducing macroalgal cover. The inferred relationships of hard coral cover with duration of reserve protection and with herbivore biomass were non-significant. Even at fished sites, coral cover (mostly > 25 %) was much higher than macrolgal cover (mostly < 15 %). Thus, there was no evidence that the current levels of fishing of herbivores on these reefs have led to 'benthic phase shifts'.

AB Deep-sea fishes prey on benthic fauna and scavenge on the carcasses of surface-living animals. Few studies have addressed the relative importance of each trophic pathway. Recent documentation of inter-decadal fluctuations in macrourid densities in the abyssal Pacific, related to changing food supplies, hastens the need for information. We conducted stomach content and stable isotope analyses of two abyssal macrourids, carrion sources, and benthic prey, collected concurrently at 4100 m off California. Squid and fishes were the most frequent prey for Coryphaenoides armatus, with small crustaceans numerous in the diet of small specimens. The diet of Coryphaenoides yaquinae included more benthic prey such as crustaceans, polychaetes, and the holothuroid Protankyra brychia. Carrion was present in both species and it was 69% of the mass of food of large C. armatus. Carrion delta N-15 values were comparable to those in abyssal deposit feeders, but carrion was relatively enriched in C-13, giving it a unique isotopic signature compared to benthic prey sources. The highest delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were observed in benthic shrimps and large polychaetes. The two macrourids had intermediate values, with C. armatus having slightly but significantly lower delta N-15 relative to C. yaquinae. Results of isotope mass balance suggest that carrion was the most important prey resource for both species but to a lesser extent in C. yaquinae. These two species bypass the conventional phytodetritus-based abyssal food web for much of their nutrition. Their population dynamics may be tied more closely to fluctuations in epipelagic nekton populations through fishing effects and direct climatic forcing on top trophic levels.

AB Background: Gene duplication is the primary force of new gene evolution. Deciphering whether a pair of duplicated genes has evolved divergent functions is often challenging. The zebrafish is uniquely positioned to provide insight into the process of functional gene evolution due to its amenability to genetic and experimental manipulation and because it possess a large number of duplicated genes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We report the identification and characterization of two hypoxia-inducible genes in zebrafish that are co-ortholgs of human IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1). IGFBP-1 is a secreted protein that binds to IGF and modulates IGF actions in somatic growth, development, and aging. Like their human and mouse counterparts, in adult zebrafish igfbp-1a and igfbp-1b are exclusively expressed in the liver. During embryogenesis, the two genes are expressed in overlapping spatial domains but with distinct temporal patterns. While zebrafish IGFBP-1a mRNA was easily detected throughout embryogenesis, IGFBP-1b mRNA was detectable only in advanced stages. Hypoxia induces igfbp-1a expression in early embryogenesis, but induces the igfbp-1b expression later in embryogenesis. Both IGFBP-1a and -b are capable of IGF binding, but IGFBP-1b has much lower affinities for IGF-I and -II because of greater dissociation rates. Overexpression of IGFBP-1a and -1b in zebrafish embryos caused significant decreases in growth and developmental rates. When tested in cultured zebrafish embryonic cells, IGFBP-1a and -1b both inhibited IGF-1-induced cell proliferation but the activity of IGFBP-1b was significantly weaker.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate subfunction partitioning of the duplicated IGFBP-1 genes at the levels of gene expression, physiological regulation, protein structure, and biological actions. The duplicated IGFBP-1 may provide additional flexibility in fine-tuning IGF signaling activities under hypoxia and other catabolic conditions.

AB The loss of coral reef habitats has been witnessed at a global scale including in the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. In addition to field surveys that can be spatially limited, remote sensing can provide a synoptic view of the changes occurring on coral reef habitats. Here, we utilize an 18-year time series of Landsat 5/TM and 7/ETM+ images to assess changes in eight coral reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, namely Carysfort Reef, Grecian Rocks, Molasses Reef, Conch Reef, Sombrero Reef, Looe Key Reef, Western Sambo and Sand Key Reef. Twenty-eight Landsat images (1984-2002) were used, with imagery gathered every 2 years during spring, and every 6 years during fall. The image dataset was georectified, calibrated to remote sensing reflectance and corrected for atmospheric and water-column effects. A Mahalanobis distance classification was trained for four habitat classes ('coral', 'sand', 'bare hardbottom' and 'covered hardbottom') using in situ ground-truthing data collected in 2003-2004 and using the spectral statistics from a 2002 image. The red band was considered useful only for benthic habitats in depths less than 6 m. Overall mean coral habitat loss for all sites classified by Landsat was 61% (3.4%/year), from a percentage habitat cover of 19% (1984) down to 7.6% (2002). The classification results for the eight different sites were critically reviewed. A detailed pixel by pixel examination of the spatial patterns across time suggests that the results range from ecologically plausible to unreliable due to spatial inconsistencies and/or improbable ecological successions. In situ monitoring data acquired by the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP) for the eight reef sites between 1996 and 2002 showed a loss in coral cover of 52% (8.7%/year), whereas the Landsat-derived coral habitat areas decreased by 37% (6.2%/year). A direct trend comparison between the entire CREMP percent coral cover data set (1996-2004) and the entire Landsat-derived coral habitat areas showed no significant difference between the two time series (ANCOVA; F-test, p = 0.303, n = 32), despite the different scales of measurements.

AB Environmental stressors impact physiology and behavior in many species of animals. These effects are partly mediated through changing concentrations of glucocorticoids, which also vary with reproductive state and social conditions. Prior research has focused largely on seasonal breeders, but the close temporal linkage between season and reproductive state in these species hinders ability to disentangle environmental effects from those of the animal's reproductive status. Here we assessed the effects of environmental challenges on the fecal glucocorticoid (fGC) levels of non-seasonal breeders, female baboons (Papio cynocephalus) of Amboseli, Kenya. Amboseli is characterized by a long dry season, during which food and water become scarce, and by extreme temperatures above 40 degrees C in the shade during some months of the year. We found that after accounting for female reproductive status and individual variability, females exhibited higher fGC levels during the dry season than during the wet season. Further, during the wet season, fGC levels were higher in months of high average daily maximum temperatures. During the dry season, fGC levels were elevated both in hotter months and in months during which the baboons spent a relatively high proportion of time feeding. In spite of these stressors, female baboons reproduce during all months of the year in Amboseli, unlike most other mammals in this environment. This may be attributable to their extreme adaptability, specifically their diversified diet, and their ability to modify their behavior, including their activity profiles. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Japanese knotweeds are among the most invasive organisms in the world. Their recent expansion into salt marsh habitat provides a unique opportunity to investigate how invasives establish in Dew environments. We used morphology. cytology, and AFLP genotyping to identify taxa and clonal diversity in roadside and salt marsh populations. We conducted a greenhouse study to determine the ability to tolerate salt and whether salt marsh populations are more salt tolerant than roadside populations as measured by the efficiency of PSII, leaf area, succulence, height, root-to-shoot ratio. and total biomass. Clonal diversity was extremely low with one F. japonica clone and five F. xbohemica genotypes. The two taxa were significantly different in several traits, but did not vary in biomass or plasticity of any trait. All traits were highly plastic in response to salinity, but differed significantly among genets. Despite this variation, plants from the salt marsh habitats did not perform better in the salt treatment, suggesting that they are not better adapted to tolerate salt. Instead, our data support the hypothesis that plasticity in salt tolerance traits may allow these taxa to live in saline habitats without specific adaptation to tolerate salt.

AB Invasions resulting in the transformation of one ecosystem to another are an increasingly widespread phenomenon. While it is clear that these conversions, particularly between grassland and shrubland systems, have severe consequences, it is often less clear which factors are associated with these conversions. We resampled plots from the 1930s (Weislander VTMs) to test whether two widely assumed factors, changes in fire frequency and nitrogen deposition, are associated with the conversion of coastal sage scrublands to exotic grasslands in southern California. Over the 76-year period, coastal sage scrub cover declined by 49%, being replaced predominantly by exotic grassland species. Grassland encroachment was positively correlated with increased fire frequency and, in areas with low fire frequencies, air pollution (percent fossil carbon as indicated by partial derivative C-14, likely correlated with nitrogen deposition). We conclude that increases in fire frequency and air pollution over the last several decades in southern California may have facilitated the conversion of coastal sage shrubland to exotic grassland systems.

AB Aggregate community- level response to disturbance is a principle concern in ecology because post- disturbance dynamics are integral to the ability of ecosystems to maintain function in an uncertain world. Community- level responses to disturbance can be arrayed along a spectrum ranging from synchronous oscillations where all species rise and fall together, to compensatory dynamics where total biomass remains relatively constant despite fluctuations in the densities of individual species(1). An important recent insight is that patterns of synchrony and compensation can vary with the timescale of analysis(2) and that spectral time series methods can enable detection of coherent dynamics that would otherwise be obscured by opposing patterns occurring at different scales(3). Here I show that application of wavelet analysis to experimentally manipulated plankton communities reveals strong synchrony after disturbance. The result is paradoxical because it is well established that these communities contain both disturbance- sensitive and disturbance- tolerant species leading to compensation within functional groups(4,5). Theory predicts that compensatory substitution of functionally equivalent species should stabilize ecological communities(6-10), yet I found at the whole- community level a large increase in seasonal biomass variation. Resolution of the paradox hinges on patterns of seasonality among species. The compensatory shift in community composition after disturbance resulted in a loss of cold- season dominants, which before disturbance had served to stabilize biomass throughout the year. Species dominating the disturbed community peaked coherently during the warm season, explaining the observed synchrony and increase in seasonal biomass variation. These results suggest that theory relating compensatory dynamics to ecological stability needs to consider not only complementarity in species responses to environmental change, but also seasonal complementarity among disturbance- tolerant and disturbance- sensitive species.

AB This study examines the hypothesis that surface-atmosphere exchange Of CO2 in terrestrial ecosystems always can be interpreted purely in terms of biological processes, neglecting geochemical cycling by karst systems that characterize 22 million km(2) in the world [Yuan Daoxian, G., 1997. The carbon cycle in karst, Zeitschrift fur Geomorphologie 108 (Supplementbande), 91-102]. Eddy covariance data of net CO2 fluxes are examined for two ecosystems over karstic substrates in contrasting climates in the North and South of Spain. A semiarid matorral is found to behave similarly to previously studied ecosystems when well watered, but sizeable mid-day CO2 emissions during extended drought and plant senescence are found to be incompatible with ecophysiological interpretations of the flux. For a temperate pasture overlying an accessible cave, afternoon CO2 emissions in summer are likewise inexplicable in a biological context, but coincide with periods when ventilation is observed inside the subterranean cavity. These results suggest direct linkages at times in CO2 exchanges among atmosphere, ecosystems, and carbonate substrates which represent more than a tenth of the Earth's land surface.

AB Metagentiana striata is an alpine annual herbaceous plant endemic to the east of the Qinghai-Tibet (Q-T) Plateau and adjacent areas. The phylogeography of M. striata was studied by sequencing the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) trnS-trnG intergenic spacer. Ten haplotypes were identified from an investigation of 232 individuals of M. striata from 14 populations covering the entire geographical range of this species. The level of differentiation amongst populations was very high (G(ST) = 0.746; N-ST = 0.774) and a significant phylogeographical structure was observed (P < 0.05). An analysis of molecular variance found a high variation amongst populations (76%), with F-ST = 0.762 (highly significant, P < 0.001), indicating that little gene flow occurred amongst the different regions; this was explained by the isolation of populations by high mountains along the Q-T Plateau and adjacent areas (N-m = 0.156). Only one ancestral haplotype (A) was common and widespread throughout the distributional range of M. striata. The populations of the Hengduan Mountains region of the south-eastern Q-T Plateau showed high diversity and uniqueness of haplotypes. It is suggested that this region was the potential refugium of M. striata during the Quaternary glaciation, and that interglacial and postglacial range expansion occurred from this refugium. This scenario was in good agreement with the results of nested clade analysis, which inferred that the current spatial distribution of cpDNA haplotypes and populations resulted from range expansion, together with past allopatric fragmentation events.

AB Although arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form spatially complex communities in terrestrial ecosystems, the scales at which this diversity manifests itself is poorly understood. This information is critical to the understanding of the role of AMF in plant community composition. We examined small-scale (submetre) variability of AMF community composition (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting) and abundance (extraradical hyphal lengths) in two 1 m(2) plots situated in a native grassland ecosystem of western Montana. Extraradical AMF hyphal lengths varied greatly between samples (14-89 m g soil(-1)) and exhibited spatial structure at scales < 30 cm. The composition of AMF communities was also found to exhibit significant spatial autocorrelation, with correlogram analyses suggesting patchiness at scales < 50 cm. Supportive of overall AMF community composition analyses, individual AMF ribotypes corresponding to specific phylogenetic groups exhibited distinct spatial autocorrelation. Our results demonstrate that AMF diversity and abundance can be spatially structured at scales of < 1 m. Such small-scale heterogeneity in the soil suggests that establishing seedlings may be exposed to very different, location dependent AMF communities. Our results also have direct implications for representative sampling of AMF communities in the field.

AB Apis mellifera originated in Africa and extended its range into Eurasia in two or more ancient expansions. In 1956, honey bees of African origin were introduced into South America, their descendents admixing with previously introduced European bees, giving rise to the highly invasive and economically devastating "Africanized" honey bee. Here we ask whether the honey bee's out-of-Africa expansions, both ancient and recent (invasive), were associated with a genome-wide signature of positive selection, detected by contrasting genetic differentiation estimates (F-ST) between coding and noncoding SNPs. In native populations, SNPs in protein-coding regions had significantly higher FST estimates than those in noncoding regions, indicating adaptive evolution in the genome driven by positive selection. This signal of selection was associated with the expansion of honey bees from Africa into Western and Northern Europe, perhaps reflecting adaptation to temperate environments. We estimate that positive selection acted on a minimum of 852-1,371 genes or approximate to 10% of the bee's coding genome. We also detected positive selection associated with the invasion of African-derived honey bees in the New World. We found that introgression of European-derived alleles into Africanized bees was significantly greater for coding than noncoding regions. Our findings demonstrate that Africanized bees exploited the genetic diversity present from preexisting introductions in an adaptive way. Finally, we found a significant negative correlation between FST estimates and the local GC content surrounding coding SNPs, suggesting that AT-rich genes play an important role in adaptive evolution in the honey bee.

AB Marine turtles have been exploited by humans since pre-history, with particular intensity in the last century, the result of which has been the depletion of most nesting populations in the world. In many cases these declines have been reversed thanks to a variety of effective conservation programs. Several nesting populations maintain positive growth trends, although most are probably depleted relative to historic levels, while others continue in a severely depleted state, with little or no population growth in recent decades. This mosaic of population trajectories along with demographic and life-history traits that buffer against extinction has created unique challenges for marine turtle assessments such as those by the World Conservation Union's (IUCN) Marine Turtle Specialist Group, which conducts global assessments for the IUCN Red List. While the Red Listing approach describes extinction risk, which theoretically can be useful for developing conservation priorities, the descriptors that have been assigned to marine turtles so far (e.g. Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered) state an unrealistic imminence of extinction, a problem enhanced by the fact that its global resolution fails to reflect the disparate population trends ongoing in different regions worldwide. Coupled with misuse of the Red List by governments and conservation organizations worldwide, these shortcomings have led to increased debate regarding its efficacy for marine turtles. In this paper we describe the Red Listing assessment process, the problems associated with this approach for marine turtles, as well as the overall value of Red List assessments for marine turtle conservation. We suggest that Red list assessments for marine turtles at the global scale do not accurately depict the current status of marine turtles and may have unintended consequences for their conservation. Largely the data do not exist, or are not reliable, making the use of the current criteria intractable. We discuss novel methods for conducting marine turtle assessments, such as using a wider array of the current Red List Criteria, modelling future population dynamics, and developing regional assessments and/or conservation prescriptive assessments.

AB 1. There is growing interest in the causes and consequences of animal temperaments. Temperament behaviours often have heritable components, but ecological variables can also affect them. Numerous variables are likely to differ between habitats, and these may interact to influence temperament behaviours.
   2. Temperament behaviours may be correlated within populations (behavioural syndromes), although the underlying causes of such correlations are currently unclear.
   3. We analysed three different temperament behaviours and learning ability in three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to determine how different ecological variables influence them both within and between populations. We selected populations from four ponds and four rivers that varied naturally in their exposure to predators.
   4. High-predation river populations were significantly less bold than a high-predation pond and low-predation river populations, and low-predation pond populations were significantly less bold than a high-predation pond population. Within populations, temperament behaviours were correlated in one high-predation river population only.
   5. These results suggest that multiple ecological factors can interact to affect temperament behaviours between populations, and also correlations in those behaviours within populations.

AB Changes in the composition of a community due to the invasion by exotic plant species can lead to modi. cation of ecosystem function that, in turn, produces feedbacks that drive further changes in community composition. The development of predictive models of this process requires an understanding of the spatial extent of the impacts of the exotic species, particularly during early stages of invasion. The main objective of this study was to characterize the neighborhood dynamics of ecosystem transformations by the invasive tree species Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) and tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima Mill.) in temperate forests of the northeastern United States. By using a neighborhood approach in multiple sites, we sought to determine (1) the magnitude and spatial extent of the effects of the two invasive species on soil properties and processes; (2) whether the effects of the invasive species were site dependent; and (3) the differences in the effects of invasive versus native tree species on ecosystem processes.
   Our results showed that Norway maple and tree of heaven alter the functioning of temperate forest ecosystems even at relatively low densities by increasing cycling rates (i.e., net N mineralization, net nitrification, Ca mineralization) and nutrient availability (i.e., pH, Ca, Mg, K, N). At the neighborhood scale, the spatial extent of the impact of the two species varied strikingly among soil properties. Moreover, the neighborhood effects of the two invasive species were site dependent, with the magnitude of the impact increasing with soil fertility. At the community level, Norway maple and to a lesser extent tree of heaven had stronger effect on soils than any of the dominant native tree species considered. We conclude that the invasion of northeastern forests by Norway maple and tree of heaven is characterized by predictable, neighborhood-specific acceleration of nutrient cycling rates and localized increases in nutrient pools. These ecosystem alterations have enormous potential for the modi. cation of competitive hierarchies in forest communities. In particular, Norway maple and tree of heaven may change relative abundances within the native community to the benefit of native species that are more competitive on nutrient rich sites.

AB Following catastrophic disturbances, succession and vegetation development occur, but in the prolonged absence of these disturbances a decline (retrogressive) phase follows in which nutrient availability and tree biomass declines considerably. We measured plant diversity across six long-term chronosequences that each included retrogressive stages in Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, Hawaii and Sweden. In contrast to theories predicting negative or hump-shaped responses of tree diversity to biomass or soil fertility, tree species richness often peaked coincidentally with tree basal area (a surrogate of tree biomass), and declined during retrogression. Similar patterns were found regardless of whether or not species richness estimates were rarefraction-adjusted to correct for variation in stem densities across plots. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index sometimes showed the same pattern, but in two chronosequences was least when tree basal area peaked; this was driven by the domination of total basal area by single tree species in both cases. The decline in tree diversity during retrogression was often associated with reduced relative amounts of total phosphorus in soil. In contrast, total vascular plant species richness often increased during retrogression. These results demonstrate that forests with high tree diversity and biomass do not persist indefinitely in the long-term absence of catastrophic disturbance, and that similar patterns occur across the boreal, temperate and subtropical zones.

AB Many small passerines are resident in forests with very cold winters. Considering their size and the adverse conditions, this is a remarkable feat that requires optimal energy management in several respects, for example regulation of body fat reserves, food hoarding and night-time hypothermia. Besides their beneficial effect on survival, these behaviours also entail various costs. The scenario is complex with many potentially important factors, and this has made 'the little bird in winter' a popular topic for theoretic modellers. Many predictions could have been made intuitively, but models have been especially important when many factors interact. Predictions that hardly could have been made without models include: (i) the minimum mortality occurs at the fat level where the marginal values of starvation risk and predation risk are equal; (ii) starvation risk may also decrease when food requirement increases; (iii) mortality from starvation may correlate positively with fat reserves; (iv) the existence of food stores can increase fitness substantially even if the food is not eaten; (v) environmental changes may induce increases or decreases in the level of reserves depending on whether changes are temporary or permanent; and (vi) hoarding can also evolve under seemingly group-selectionistic conditions.

AB 1. Functional traits contribute to the success of invasive plants. These traits can reflect inherent properties or they can be new adaptations from evolutionary responses to escape from natural enemies of the introduced range. We tested the hypothesis that genetic shifts in morphological and physiological traits have occurred between native and invasive populations of Sapium sebiferum.
   2. Sapium sebiferum seedlings were grown in a greenhouse using seed collected from four populations of its introduced range (US) and four from native Chinese populations that are thought to be genetic candidates of the introduced populations. We examined plant biomass production, relative growth rate (RGR), relative stem height growth rate (RHR), root : shoot ratio (RSR), total number of leaves (TLN) and leaf area (TLA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net CO2 assimilation (A) and shoot specific respiration rate (R-D).
   3. US populations of S. sebiferum differed from Chinese populations for most plant variables. Final shoot and total biomass, as well as, RGRs of invasive (US) populations were significantly greater than those of native (Chinese) populations, although RHR and TLN per seedling did not differ between them. Root : shoot ratios (RSR) were significantly lower, while leaf traits including TLA, LAR and SLA were generally greater for invasive populations compared to native populations. Net CO2 A was significantly higher for invasive populations than for native populations, but no significant difference in R-D was found between two population types.
   4. Of 13 measured plant variables, RSRs, TLA and CO2 A were identified as traits that contributed the most to differences observed between native Chinese and invasive US populations. The suite of morphological and physiological traits functioning together may result in different growth strategies for native versus invasive populations. By virtue of these traits, invasive populations of S. sebiferum may use soil resources and light more efficiently than native populations, which may have given rise to their competitive superiority in the introduced range.

ID STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; ELEVATION; MODELS; RESOLUTION; SLOPE
AB Lidar data have become a Major source of digital terrain information for use in many applications including hydraulic modeling and flood plane mapping. Based on established relationships between sampling intensity and error, nominal post-spacing likely contributes significantly to the error budget. Post-spacing is also a major cost factor during lidar data collection. This research presents methods for establishing a relationship between nominal post-spacing and its effects on hydraulic modeling for flood zone delineation. Lidar data collected at a low post-spacing (approximately 1 to 2 m) over a piedmont study area in North Carolina was systematically decimated to simulate datasets with sequentially higher post-spacing values. Using extensive first-order ground survey information, the accuracy of each DEM derived from these lidar datasets was assessed and reported. Hydraulic analyses were performed utilizing standard engineering practices and modeling software (HEC-RAS). All input variables were held constant in each model run except for the topographic information from the decimated lidar datasets. The results were compared to a hydraulic analysis performed on the un-decimated reference dataset. The sensitivity of the primary model outputs to the variation in nominal post-spacing is reported. The results indicate that base flood elevation does not statistically change over the post-spacing values tested. Conversely, flood zone boundary mapping was found to be sensitive to variations in post-spacing.

AB Over the past decade an increasing number of studies have experimentally manipulated the number of species in a community and examined how this alters the aggregate production of species biomass. Many of these studies have shown that the effects of richness on biomass change through time, but we have limited understanding of the mechanisms that produce these dynamic trends. Here we report the results of an experiment in which we manipulated the richness of freshwater algae in laboratory microcosms. We used two experimental designs ( additive and substitutive) that make different assumptions about how patches are initially colonized, and then tracked the development of community biomass from the point of initial colonization through a period of 6 - 12 generations of the focal species. We found that the effect of initial species richness on biomass production qualitatively shifted twice over the course of the experiment. The first shift occurred as species transitioned from density-independent to dependent phases of population growth. At this time, intraspecific competition caused monocultures to approach their respective carrying capacities more slowly than polycultures. As a consequence, species tended to over-yield for a brief time, generating a positive, but transient effect of diversity on community biomass. The second shift occurred as communities approached carrying capacity. At this time, strong interspecific interactions caused biomass to be dominated by the competitively superior species in polycultures. As this species had the lowest carrying capacity, a negative effect of diversity on biomass resulted in late succession. Although these two shifts produced dynamics that appeared complex, we show that the patterns can be fit to a simple Lotka-Volterra model of competition. Our results suggest that the effects of algal diversity on primary production change in a predictable sequence through successional time.

AB Food web structure and major sources of primary production consumed by metafauna of Mad Island Marsh, a coastal saltmarsh on the NW coast of the Gulf of Mexico, were compared using stable isotopes and dietary analysis. Carbon and nitrogen isotope data were entered into a mixing model containing 5 potential production sources. Results were inconclusive due to overlapping isotopic signatures of certain sources, but nonetheless indicated that most fishes and macroinvertebrates assimilated material derived mostly from variable mixtures of macrophytes and filamentous algae. Highest estimates of percentage of material assimilated directly or indirectly from C-4 marsh grasses (ranging from 30 to 82 %) were for spot Leiostomus xanthurus and Gulf killifish Fundulus grandis. Isotopic analysis could not reveal the detailed structure of predator-prey interactions at the species level; greater detail of trophic pathways was revealed by the dietary analysis. Estimates of vertical web structure (species trophic levels) by the 2 methods were largely concordant. The exceptions were 2 zooplanktivorous and detritivorous fish species and grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio that had higher trophic levels according to nitrogen isotope ratios. For these taxa, the isotopic method more accurately indexed the number of trophic transfers than the dietary method, which depends on accurate dietary estimation for all food chain components leading to a consumer, and which assumes equal assimilation efficiencies for items found in stomach contents. The isotopic method underestimated trophic levels of several invertebrates, possibly due to inaccurate estimation of mean delta N-15 for production sources supporting these taxa and/or differential trophic fractionation. Together, stable isotope and dietary analyses provide a more accurate assessment of food web structure and dynamics of coastal marsh ecosystems than either method alone.

AB Using rotifer-algal microcosms, we tracked rapid evolution resulting from temporally changing natural selection in ecological predator-prey dynamics. We previously demonstrated that predator-prey oscillations in rotifer-algal laboratory microcosms are qualitatively altered by the presence of genetic variation within the prey. In that study, changes in algal gene frequencies were inferred from their effects on population dynamics but not observed directly. Here, we document rapid prey evolution in this system by directly observing changes in Chlorella vulgaris genotype frequencies as the abundances of these algae and their consumer, Brachionus calyciflorus, change through time. We isolated a group of algal clones that we could distinguish by using microsatellite-DNA markers, and developed an allele-specific quantitative PCR technique (AsQ-PCR) to quantify the frequencies of pairs of clones in mixed culture. We showed that two of these genotypes exhibited a fitness tradeoff in which one was more resistant to predation (more digestion-resistant), and the other had faster population growth under limiting nitrogen concentrations. A fully specified mathematical model for the rotifer-algal population and evolutionary dynamics predicted that these two clones would undergo a single oscillation in clonal frequencies followed by asymptotic fixation of the more resistant clone, rather than the recurrent oscillations previously observed with other algal clones. We used AsQ-PCR to confirm this prediction: the superior competitor dominated initially, but as rotifer densities increased, the more predator-resistant clone predominated.

AB Ecological systems with hierarchical organization and non-equilibrium dynamics require multiple-scale analyses to comprehend how a system is structured and to formulate hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms. Characteristic scales in real landscapes are determined by, or at least reflect, the spatial patterns and scales of constraining human interactions with the biophysical environment. If the patterns or scales of human actions change, then the constraints change, and the structure and dynamics of the entire socioecological system (SES) can change accordingly. Understanding biodiversity in a SES requires understanding how the actions of humans as a keystone species shape the environment across a range of scales. We address this problem by investigating the spatial patterns of human disturbances at multiple scales in a SES in southern Italy. We describe an operational framework to identify multi-scale profiles of short-term anthropogenic disturbances using a moving window algorithm to measure the amount and configuration of disturbance as detected by satellite imagery. Prevailing land uses were found to contribute in different ways to the disturbance gradient at multiple scales, as land uses resulted from other types of biophysical and social controls shaping the region. The resulting profiles were then interpreted with respect to defining critical support regions and scale-dependent models for the assessment and management of disturbances, and for indicating system fragility and resilience of socio-ecological systems in the region. The results suggest support regions and scale intervals where past disturbance has been most likely and clumped - i.e. where fragility is highest and resilience is lowest. We discuss the potential for planning and managing landscape disturbances with a predictable effect on ecological processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, are sessile, filter-feeding organisms that are heavily preyed upon by blue crabs, which find their clam prey using chemical cues. Clams may evade blue crabs by reducing their pumping (feeding) behavior when a threat is perceived. The purpose of this study was to determine the type of signals that clams use to detect consumers. Clams decreased their pumping time in response to blue crabs and blue crab effluent, but not to crab shells, indicating that chemical signals and not mechanical cues mediated the response of clams to distant predators. Because predator diet can influence prey evaluation of predatory threats, we compared clam responses to blue crabs fed a steady diet of fish, clams, or that were starved prior to the experiment. In addition, we used injured clams as a stimulus because many organisms detect predators by sensing the odor of injured con- or heterospecifics. Clams reduced feeding in response to injured conspecifics and to blue crabs that had recently fed. Clams reacted similarly to fed crabs, regardless of their diet, but did not respond to starved blue crabs. Because blue crabs are generalist predators and the threat posed by these consumers is unrelated to the crab's diet, we should expect clam reactions to blue crabs to be independent of the crab's diet. The failure of clams to react to starved blue crabs likely increases their vulnerability to these consumers, but clam responses to injured conspecifics may constitute a strategy that allows animals to detect an imminent threat when signals emanating from blue crabs are not detectable.

AB For effective conservation planning, resource managers around the world require information on species distributions. Available data, however, are often too coarse in spatial resolution to be of practical use. We describe four modelling techniques that harness the information contained in coarse-scale occurrence records to predict species' distributions at the finer resolutions relevant to conservation officers in the field. The techniques are primarily statistical in nature, but can incorporate expert knowledge on species' habitat preferences. We highlight the conceptual strengths and weaknesses of each, and perform a preliminary test of their comparative performance, using empirical data on the distribution of nine bird species in Uganda and satellite-derived environmental indices. Two techniques, the point sampling approach and iterative approach, yield encouraging results. Because the dominance of environmental factors controlling species' distributions shifts with spatial scale, however, cross-scale predictions remain a formidable challenge. Further testing and refinement of the techniques we present here are undoubtedly necessary before they can be applied with any confidence. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In Canada, there are two known regional foci where wildlife populations are infected with bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) and considered to be disease reservoirs. Free-ranging populations of wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) in and around Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP) and wapiti (Cervus elaphus manitobensis) in and around Riding Mountain National Park (RMNP) are infected with bovine tuberculosis. In this paper, we provide an overview of these diseased wild ungulate populations and the complexities of attempting to manage issues relating to bovine tuberculosis in and around protected areas. We do not describe the quantitative science and epidemiological data in detail from these case histories, but instead compare and contrast these two cases from a broader perspective. This is achieved by reviewing the context and process by which a diverse group of stakeholders engage and develop strategies to address the controversial problems that diseased wildlife populations often present. We suggest that understanding the factors that drive the strategic-level management processes is equally important for addressing a wildlife disease problem as the tactical-level issues, such as design and implementation of technically sound field research and management programs. Understanding the experiences within the WBNP and RMNP areas, particularly the strategies that have failed or succeeded, may prove useful to understanding and improving management approaches when wildlife are infected with M. bovis. Applying this understanding is consistent with the principles of adaptive management in which we learn from previous experiences to develop better strategies for the future. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the last 20 years, new species, asexual reproduction, polyploidy and hybridization have all been reported within the genus Cobitis. An understanding of the current distribution and baseline phylogeographical history of 'true' nonhybrid Cobitis species is crucial in order to unravel these discoveries. In the present work, we investigated the phylogeography of the spined loach, Cobitis taenia, using 1126 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 174 individuals collected at 47 sites. In total, 51 haplotypes that differed at 49 positions (4.35%) were detected. We deduce that C. taenia survived European glaciations in at least three refuges in the Ponto-Caspian area. Two of these refuges each provided a major lineage that recolonized Europe in separate directions: one westward to England and the other spreading north into Russia before moving west. A third (minor) lineage that contributed little to the recolonization of Europe was also revealed - remaining near its Black Sea refuge. However, more recent history was difficult to resolve with colonization from a more western refugium during the last glacial maximum (LGM) a distinct possibility. Nested clade analysis indicates a pattern of restricted gene flow with isolation by distance at the first two levels and overall. Unlike many other European freshwater fish species, the Danube is not part of the current distribution of C. taenia, nor was it used as either a refuge or a source of colonization of Europe. Low genetic diversity within C. taenia suggests that its colonization of Europe is relatively recent. Demographic analyses revealed a history of recent expansion and isolation by distance.

AB The behavior of several landscape pattern metrics were tested against various pattern scenarios generated by neutral landscape models, including number of classes, scale-map extent, scale-resolution, class proportion, aggregation level-RULE, and aggregation level-SimMap. The results demonstrate that most of the metrics are sensitive to certain pattern scenarios, yet are not sensitive to others; therefore, none of them is appropriate for all aspects of a landscape pattern. Despite these limitations, some of these metrics are recommended for future use, which include total number of patches, average patch size, total edge density, double-logged fractal, contagion, and aggregation index. Special attention should be paid to the relationships between metric values and ecological processes rather than the numbers themselves. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society.

AB Photosynthesis was limited by low-intensity photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and leaf wetness in a lower montane cloud forest (LMCF) of Cauca, Colombia. Mean PAR intensity remained below the saturation level for leaf-scale net photosynthesis (Pn) throughout the solar day during the wet season and for most of the solar day during the dry season. PAR represented a smaller fraction of total solar radiation (K) in LMCF than in lowland rain forest (LRF). In LMCF trees and shrubs, mean PAR-saturated Pn ranged from 4.3-10.6 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1) at 1450m, and from 3.5-10.2 mu mol C m(-2) s-1 at 2150 m. P-n was reduced by abaxial wetness in leaves of some trees and shrubs, and eliminated in others. This study indicates that persistent cloudiness and interception of cloud water by leaves limit LMCF productivity.

AB Aim Mammalian carnivores are considered particularly sensitive indicators of environmental change. Information on the distribution of carnivores from the early 1900s provides a unique opportunity to evaluate changes in their distributions over a 75-year period during which the influence of human uses of forest resources in California greatly increased. We present information on the distributions of forest carnivores in the context of two of the most significant changes in the Sierra Nevada during this period: the expansion of human settlement and the reduction in mature forests by timber harvest.
   Methods We compare the historical and contemporary distributions of 10 taxa of mesocarnivores in the conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range by contrasting the distribution of museum and fur harvest records from the early 1900s with the distribution of detections from baited track-plate and camera surveys conducted from 1996 to 2002. A total of 344 sample units (6 track plates and 1 camera each) were distributed systematically across c. 3,000,000 ha area over a 7-year period.
   Results Two species, the wolverine (Gulo gulo) and the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), present in the historical record for our survey area, were not detected during the contemporary surveys. The distributions of 3 species (fisher [Martespennanti], American marten [M. americana], and Virginia opossum [Didelphisvirginiana]) have substantially changed since the early 1900s. The distributions of fishers and martens, mature-forest specialists, appeared to have decreased in the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade region. A reputed gap in the current distribution of fishers was confirmed. We report for the first time evidence that the distribution of martens has become fragmented in the southern Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada. The opossum, an introduced marsupial, expanded its distribution in the Sierra Nevada significantly since it was introduced to the south-central coast region of California in the 1930s. There did not appear to be any changes in the distributions of the species that were considered habitat generalists: gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), western spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis), or black bear (Ursus americanus). Detections of raccoons (Procyon lotor) and badgers (Taxidea taxus) were too rare to evaluate. Contemporary surveys indicated that weasels (M. frenata and M. erminea) were distributed throughout the study area, but historical data were not available for comparison.
   Main conclusions Two species, the wolverine and Sierra Nevada red fox, were not detected in contemporary surveys and may be extirpated or in extremely low densities in the regions sampled. The distributions of the mature forest specialists (marten and fisher) appear to have changed more than the distributions of the forest generalists. This is most likely due to a combination of loss of mature forest habitat, residential development and the latent effects of commercial trapping. Biological characteristics of individual species, in combination with the effect of human activities, appear to have combined to affect the current distributions of carnivores in the Sierra Nevada. Periodic resampling of the distributions of carnivores in California, via remote detection methods, is an efficient means for monitoring the status of their populations.

AB Analogous to other top predators foraging on patchy resources, the spatial behaviour of fishers provides information on the spatial organization of fish. Focusing on the Peruvian anchovy purse-seine fishery, vessel monitoring system data are used to describe fishing vessels' trajectories, and acoustic survey data to characterize anchovy spatial distribution. Vessel trajectories were analysed in terms of move-length distribution, whereas fish distribution was characterized by spatial extent, concentration, and fractal dimension. Fishers perform Levy flights that can be characterized by a single statistic (mu); mu is significantly correlated with the fractal dimension of fish distribution. It is argued that the Levy statistic is a good candidate for an ecosystem indicator that might contribute to realtime monitoring of ecosystems.

AB As defined by Ascher, biocomplexity results from a "multiplicity" of interconnected relationships and levels." However, no integrative framework yet exists to facilitate the application of this concept to coupled human-natural systems. Indeed, the term "biocomplexity" is still used primarily as a creative and provocative metaphor. To help advance its utility, we present a framework that focuses on linkages among different disciplines that are often used in studies of coupled human-natural systems, including the ecological, physical, and socioeconomic sciences. The framework consists of three dimensions of complexity: spatial, organizational, and temporal. Spatial complexity increases as the focus changes from the type and number of the elements of spatial heterogeneity to an explicit configuration of the elements. Similarly, organizational complexity increases as the focus shifts from unconnected units to connectivity among functional units. Finally, temporal complexity increases as the current state of a system comes to rely more and more on past states, and therefore to reflect echoes, legacies, and evolving indirect effects of those states. This three-dimensional, conceptual volume of biocomplexity enables connections between models that derive from different disciplines to be drawn at an appropriate level of complexity for integration.

AB The size, density and biomass of coral reef fish in 4 fully closed marine protected areas (MPAs) with different ages were studied over a 17 yr period. Space-for-time substitution samples were available for d period of 4 yr before, and 36 yr after the closure. Both the height of the size structure graph (which is a value of overall abundance-biomass) and the assemblage biomass graph are convex polynomials with a maximum biomass of 1200 kg ha(-1) at 22 yr. This suggests that full recovery of coral reef fish assemblages in terms of abundance-biomass is considerably longer than generally believed. Beyond 25 yr, there can be a small loss in biomass, which we suggest is due to reduced net primary production associated with the increased abundance of calcifying algae attributable to intense grazing. Size spectra slopes were variable at all times, changed quickly, and were probably influenced by local environmental conditions, which made concise predictions for equilibrium coral reef size structure rather difficult.

AB Mechanisms for the maintenance of Zapotec ethnicity in Tlailotlacan, an enclave of Teotihuacan, Mexico, are reconstructed using oxygen-isotope analyses of bone and enamel phosphate. The data indicate continual interaction among the enclave inhabitants, their Oaxacan homeland, and other diaspora colonies, with no dominant post-marital residence pattern. There is no apparent association between social status and place of origin, and individual agency is indicated by variable acceptance of Teotihuacan traditions. Striking patterns of movement include the sojourning of children in other regions and the relocation of breastfeeding women. These segments of the population would have played major roles in the social and political articulation of diaspora colonies. Foreign signatures in primary burials indicate that some immigrants died shortly after their arrival in Tlailotlacan. Data from secondary burials indicate the transportation of dead relatives or ancestors to Teotihuacan for burial. We conclude that the behaviour of immigrants in ancient and modern cities is analogous in many ways. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB 1 Distribution of plant species in fragmented landscapes is the result of both seed and site availability. Little is known about how their relative importance differs at different spatial scales.
   2 I sowed seeds of eight dry grassland species into 22 localities that differed in occupancy by these species and followed seedling establishment over 3 years. I compared the number of emerging seedlings at three scales: between previously occupied and previously unoccupied localities, between occupied and unoccupied blocks within occupied localities, and between plots with and without seed addition within occupied blocks.
   3 At the two larger scales, I also studied the relationship of the number of seedlings and of the distributions of adult plants to environmental factors.
   4 Both seed and site availability are important in structuring the distribution of these species, but site availability becomes less important with increasing spatial scale. The intensity of this effect is, however, species specific.
   5 The relationship between environmental factors and pattern of species distribution is also clearly scale dependent, and differs between seedlings and adults. Whilst abiotic factors are the main determinants of seedling distribution, the occurrence of adult individuals is best predicted by the occurrence of other species. This suggests that the present distribution of species in the landscape is determined mainly by historical factors.
   6 Conclusions based on the importance of seed and site availability for species distribution in natural communities at one scale cannot be extrapolated to other scales. Only comparisons on multiple scales can provide a full understanding of factors affecting species distribution at landscape level.

AB [1] Tower-based measurements of mass and energy exchanges at the end of the growing season in central Botswana were used to evaluate functional relationships commonly applied to predict water and carbon fluxes between savanna landscapes and the atmosphere. Following a large rainfall event, daily evapotranspiration (ETdaily) exhibited an exponential decay consistent with a derived analytical expression based on critical and wilting-point soil moisture limits for savanna vegetation native to the study region. A piecewise linear soil moisture limitation function provided good estimates of ETdaily as a function of potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture (R-2 = 0.92). Comparison of a soil moisture mass balance with measured ETdaily indicated deeper root water uptake at a site with more woody vegetation compared with a grass-dominated site. Linear correlation (R-2 = 0.90) of daytime CO2 flux and evapotranspiration supported a constant water use efficiency to estimate carbon fluxes from water fluxes. Daytime and nighttime CO2 fluxes responded similarly to soil drying, enabling estimation of total daily CO2 flux from ETdaily. These experimental results support a simple model of savanna land-atmosphere exchange over interstorm periods.

AB Various ecological processes influence patterns of species diversity at multiple spatial scales. One process that is potentially important but rarely considered is community assembly. I assembled model communities using species pools of differing size to examine how the history of community assembly may affect multi-scale diversity patterns. The model contained three scales at which diversity could be measured: local community, metacommunity, and species pool. Local species saturation occurred, as expected from the competition and predation built in the model. However, local communities did not become resistant to invasions except when the species pool was very small. Depending on dispersal rate and trophic level, the larger the species pool, the harder it was to predict which species invades which local community at a given time. Consequently, local-community dissimilarity maintained by assembly history increased linearly with pool size, even though local diversity was decoupled from pool size. These results have two implications for multi-scale diversity patterns. First, assembly history may provide an explanation for scale-dependent relationships between local and regional diversity: assembly causes the relationship to be curvilinear at one scale (local community), while linear at another (metacommunity). Second, assembly history influences how gamma-diversity is partitioned into alpha- and beta-diversity: assembly causes the relative contribution of beta to increase with pool size. Overall, this study suggests that community assembly history interacts with species pool size to regulate multi-scale patterns of species diversity.

AB Seed banks play a critical role in the maintenance of many wetland plant communities, and recruitment from the seed bank in response to environmental heterogeneity may influence species diversity and the spatial pattern seen in vegetation. Reduced recruitment in tidal freshwater wetlands in the Nanticoke River watershed (Maryland and Delaware, USA) may result from sediment input or sea level rise. An experimental test of the effects of inundation and sedimentation was conducted on seedling emergence from a pooled seed bank of tidal freshwater wetlands in a 2 x 5 factorial greenhouse experiment. Treatments were two levels of inundation (flooded and non-flooded) and five levels of sediment addition (0-2 cm depth). Twenty taxa emerged from the pooled wetland seed bank, with Leersia oryzoides and Typha species occurring the most frequently. A significant decrease was seen in seedling emergence due to flooding (P = 0.003), and the addition of sediment significantly decreased taxa density (P = 0.023) and seedling emergence (P = 0.0069). These findings suggest that the expression of species from the seed bank is largely controlled by sedimentation rates and hydrology, and that increases in sedimentation and relative sea level may reduce plant biodiversity of tidal freshwater wetlands.

AB Focal-species approaches provide tractable frameworks for structuring site-based conservation, but explanations of how and why focal species are chosen are often lacking. This paper outlines the rationale and selection criteria for one such strategy: the "Landscape Species Approach." We define five criteria for selecting landscape species (area requirements, heterogeneity, ecological function, vulnerability, and socioeconomic significance) and illustrate the process using data from two landscapes, the northwestern Bolivian Andes and northern Congo. Candidate species from each site were scored and suites of complementary landscape species were assembled. Like all focal-species approaches (and indeed all conservation planning), this approach is not without biases. However, by making our assumptions explicit and allowing evaluation of the inherent biases, we attempt to provide a transparent, replicable method for identifying species around which to structure site-based conservation (landscape species). The process is also useful for identifying data gaps, ranking threats, and setting research priorities. Clear justification and selection criteria should accompany any focal species strategy to allow methods to be replicated, tested, and refined. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In birds, the annual change in daylength is the most important environmental cue used for synchronising breeding, moult, and migration with recurrent seasonal fluctuation in environmental conditions. Human-caused environmental changes may affect photo-responsive birds in two ways: (1) The photoperiod may become an unreliable predictor of favourable conditions if the phase relationship between temperature-dependent resource availability and daylength changes. For example, advances in the timing of breeding in response to increased spring temperature expose juvenile birds to altered photoperiodic conditions, which may result in unseasonably early autumn migration. (2) Range shifts and expansions may expose birds to novel photoperiodic conditions. Extant responses to these conditions could limit the potential of birds to evade increasingly unsuitable habitats and to establish new breeding and wintering grounds. However, if birds respond to novel photoperiodic conditions in an adaptive way-i.e., the elicited phenotypic change is in accord with the direction of selection-then adaptation of avian life cycles to global environmental change will be facilitated. In the course of environmental change, we expect the photoperiodic response itself to be the target of selection. However, adaptive evolution of the response to daylength may not keep pace with rapid environmental changes because of unfavourable genetic correlations among life-cycle stages or the lack of within-population genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity.

AB We analyzed and radiocarbon-dated 205 fossil woodrat middens from 14 sites in central and northern Wyoming and adjacent Utah and Montana to document spatiotemporal patterns of Holocene invasion by Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma). Holocene migration into central and northern Wyoming and southern Montana from the south proceeded by a series of long-distance dispersal events, which were. paced by climate variability and structured by the geographic distribution and connectivity of suitable habitats on the landscape. The migration of Utah juniper into the region involved multiple long-distance dispersal events, ranging from 30 to 135 kin. One of the earliest established populations, on East Pryor Mountain in south central Montana, is currently the northernmost population of the species. Establishment by long-distance dispersal of that population and another in the Bighorn Basin occurred during a period of relatively dry climate between 7500 and 5400 years ago. Further expansion of these initial colonizing populations and backfilling to occupy suitable sites to the south was delayed during a wet period from 5400 to 2800 years ago. Development of dry conditions 2800 years ago led to a rapid expansion in which Utah juniper colonized sites throughout its current range. Landscape structure and climate variability play important roles in governing the pattern and pace of natural invasions and deserve close attention in studying and modeling plant invasions, whether exotic or natural.

AB Zooplankton are commonly used to establish a baseline isotopic signature for pelagic production in lakes. Our objective was to evaluate this approach by quantifying among-lake and within-lake variability of delta(13)C and delta(15)N for different taxa of pelagic zooplankton. We measured the delta(13)C and delta(15)N of Daphnia, Holopedium, and calanoid copepods from four lakes sampled from June to November 2001 and from eight additional takes sampled once in midsummer. In the four lakes with temporal sampling, within-lake differences due to taxonomic grouping accounted for 36.7% of the variance in delta(15)N and 41.7% of the variance in delta(13)C. Among all lakes, the delta(15)N of calanoid copepods was on average 2.55parts per thousand and 2.44parts per thousand higher than Daphnia or Holopedium, respectively, whereas the delta(13)C of calanoid copepods was 2.19parts per thousand and 2.23parts per thousand lower than Daphnia or Holopedium, respectively. If N-15 fractionation is similar among species, the differences in delta(15)N suggest that calanoid copepods either feed at a higher trophic position in the food web or they have a consistently higher baseline delta(15)N signature than Daphnia or Holopedium among lakes. Differences in delta(13)C suggest that zooplankton taxa in the pelagia of lakes have different food sources. We conclude that species composition and feeding behaviors of the zooplankton community should be considered before making among-lake comparisons of food web structure. We show that Daphnia is a useful isotopic baseline for organisms that rely on primary production in lakes.

AB What drives community change on large spatial scales? An opportunity to address this fundamental question was provided by a massive subtidal recruitment of the mussel, Mytilus edulis, across the southwest Gulf of Maine (GOM), USA, in 1995. Since M. edulis is consumed by many predator species, we hypothesized that the episodic increase in food resources had a bottom-up effect on populations of mussel consumers. The mussel recruitment event was unprecedented in its large spatial extent, high coverage of the sea floor, and depth of penetration into the rocky subtidal zone. During 1995-1997 we tracked mussels and their consumer populations in the area to document what happened. Surveys across a 120-km marine landscape revealed that juvenile mussels covered 33-91% of the bottom (8-12 m depth) at 13 of 17 sites between October 1995 and June 1996. The cover of mussel prey in June 1996 explained significant variation in the density and biomass of mussel predators, the sea stars Asterias spp. and rock crabs Cancer spp., at 16-17 sites 10, 13, and 23 months after mussel recruitment. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the extensive mussel recruitment had a bottom-up effect on the subtidal food web. Levels of Asterias spp. recruitment, biomass, and density following mussel recruitment were the highest recorded at two monitored sites in 16-18 years. One year after the large pulse of mussel food resources, Asterias spp. recruitment was positively related to the percent cover of mussels, suggesting a feedback between food supply and consumer recruitment on a large spatial scale. Crab size-structure data supported the interpretation that recruitment contributed to the high densities of rock crabs recorded in July 1997. We suggest that the bottom-up effects observed in consumer populations were produced by increased growth, elevated reproduction and recruitment, and possibly by immigration.
   Coupling between bottom-up and top-down control was observed after a lag of 12-14 months post-mussel recruitment when predation by sea stars, rock crabs, and sea urchins eliminated extensive beds of juvenile mussels across the study region. The elimination of Mytilus prey triggered cannibalism in the sea star Asterias vulgaris, which contributed to density-dependent population declines in sea stars between 1996 and 1997. A key assumption of a consumer reproduction and recruitment response-that some of the larvae produced by local adult stocks of consumers could be retained in the study region-was tested by investigating the potential larval dispersal of sea stars and crabs in a simulated three-dimensional flow field of the southwest GOM. The simulation supported the assumption as 15-75% of particles released below 1-m depth were retained in the region over 2-5 week periods approximating the larval life-span of the consumers. Furthermore, the degree of retention increased dramatically between the surface (1 m) and 15-m depth, implying that the extent of large-scale connectivity by passive larval dispersal is highly dependent on depth. In this study, massive prey recruitment stimulated coupling between bottom-up and top-down forces, resulting in broad-scale changes in local consumer populations that persisted after the prey-recruitment signal was removed, underscoring the importance of episodic events in marine community dynamics.

AB In the Bonin Islands of the western Pacific where the light environment is characterized by high fluctuations due to frequent typhoon disturbance, we hypothesized that the invasive success of Bischofia javanica Blume (invasive tree, mid-successional) may be attributable to a high acclimation capacity under fluctuating light availability. The physiological and morphological responses of B. javanica to both simulated canopy opening and closure were compared against three native species of different successional status: Trema orientalis Blume (pioneer), Schima mertensiana (Sieb. et Zucc.) Koidz (mid-successional) and Elaeocarpus photiniaefolius Hook.et Arn (late-successional). The results revealed significant species-specific differences in the timing of physiological maturity and phenotypic plasticity in leaves developed under constant high and low light levels. For example, the photosynthetic capacity of T. orientalis reached a maximum in leaves that had just fully expanded when grown under constant high light (50% of full sun) whereas that of E . photiniaefolius leaves continued to increase until 50 d after full expansion. For leaves that had just reached full expansion, T. orientalis , having high photosynthetic plasticity between high and low light, exhibited low acclimation capacity under the changing light (from high to low or low to high light). In comparison with native species, B. javanica showed a higher degree of physiological and morphological acclimation following transfer to a new light condition in leaves of all age classes (i.e. before and after reaching full expansion). The high acclimation ability of B. javanica in response to changes in light availability may be a part of its pre-adaptations for invasiveness in the fluctuating environment of the Bonin Islands.

AB We studied relationships between tropical tunas (albacore (Thunnus alalunga), bigeye (Thunnus obesus), and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares)) and their biotic and abiotic environments through simultaneous acoustic observations of tunas and their prey, experimental longline catch, and oceanographic data in French Polynesia. Vertical habitat limits were estimated based on temperature and dissolved oxygen at capture data. We then studied tuna-micronekton relationships to better understand how tuna occupy the pelagic space, At a regional scale, tunas were more abundant in areas rich in prey with favourable hydrological conditions. Inside such areas, at the scale of a longline set, however, the longline catches were maximal only when prey were not distributed in dense patches (except for yellowfin tuna). We interpreted this result by considering that areas with high prey abundance attract tunas, but at a small scale, if prey are patchy distributed, tunas are more inclined to feed on them rather than on longline baits. The effect of patches on yellowfin tuna catch per unit effort (CPUE) does not appear likely because this species also feeds on the mixed layer, where patch density was very low. Not only hydrological characteristics, but also prey density and prey patch characteristics, should be taken into account for interpreting longline CPUE data.

AB Temperate grasslands are vast terrestrial ecosystems that may be an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle; however, annual C flux data for these grasslands are limited. The Bowen ratio/energy balance (BREB) technique was used to measure CO2 fluxes over a grazed mixed-grass prairie and a seeded western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii (Rybd) Love] site at Mandan, ND from 24 April to 26 October in 1996, 1997, and 1998. Above-ground biomass and leaf area index (LAI) were measured about every 21 days throughout the season. Root biomass and soil organic C and N content were determined to 110 cm depth in selected increments about mid-July each year. Peak above-ground biomass and LAI coincided with peak fluxes and occurred between mid-July to early August. Biomass averaged 1227 and 1726 kg ha(-1) and LAI 0.44 and 0.59, for prairie and western wheatgrass, respectively. Average CO2 flux for the growing season was 279 g CO2 m(-2) for prairie and 218 g CO2 m(-2) for western wheatgrass (positive flux is CO2 uptake and negative flux is CO2 loss to the atmosphere). Using prior measured dormant season CO2 fluxes from the prairie sites gave annual flux estimates that ranged from -131 to 128 g CO2 m(-2) for western wheatgrass and from -70 to 189 g CO2 m(-2) for the prairie. This wide range in calculated annual fluxes suggests that additional research is required concerning dormant season flux measurements to obtain accurate estimates of annual CO, fluxes.
   These results suggest Northern Great Plains mixed-grass prairie grasslands can either be a sink or a source for atmospheric CO2 or near equilibrium, depending on the magnitude of the dormant season flux. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM), leaf litter, and root material of an Ultisol from the tropical rainforest of Kakamega, Kenya, were analyzed for stable carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) isotopic values as well as total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents in order to determine trends in SOM decomposition within a very well-developed soil under tropical conditions. In addition, we quantified mineralogy and chemistry of the inorganic soil fraction. Clay mineralogical variation with depth was small and the abundance of kaolin indicates intense weathering and pedoturbation under humid tropical conditions. The soil chemistry was dominated by silica, aluminium, and iron with calcium, potassium, and magnesium as minor constituents. The relative depletion of base cations compared with silica and aluminium is an indicator for intense weathering and leaching conditions over long periods of time. Depth profiles of delta(13)C and delta(15)N showed a distinct enrichment trend down profile with a large (average (13)DeltaC = 5.0%. and average (15)DeltaN = 6.3%) and abrupt offset within the uppermost 1020 cm of the soil. Isotopic enrichment with depth is commonly observed in soil profiles and has been attributed to fractionation during decomposition. However, isotopic offsets within soil profiles that exceed 3% are usually interpreted as a recent change from C-4 to C-3 dominated vegetation, We argue that the observed isotopic depth profiles along with data from mineralogy and chemistry of the inorganic fraction from the Kakamega Forest soil are a result of intense weathering and high organic matter turnover rates under humid, tropical conditions.

AB Designing reserves that preserve the habitat of many coexisting and threatened species often involves use of conservation surrogates, such as umbrella species. Typically, animals with legal protection are used as umbrella species, and these selections are overwhelmingly vertebrates. The tacit assumption that vertebrates automatically serve as conservation umbrellas for invertebrates rarely has been justified. The California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica, Muscicapidae), is a federally listed and endangered species in the United States and has been used as an umbrella species for the conservation of coastal sage scrub in southern California. Conservation planning efforts for this community follow a general paradigm of using vertebrate-based reserve designs as de facto protection for invertebrate cohabitants. To test the effectiveness of this strategy, I surveyed 50 patches of coastal sage scrub in San Diego County for three species of Lepidoptera: Mormon metalmark (Apodemia mormo, Riodinidae), Bernardino blue, (Euphilotes bernardino, Lycaenidae), and Electra buckmoth (Hemileuca electra, Saturniidae). The presence of the gnatcatcher was a poor indicator of the presence of these insects. Only the largest or most recently separated habitat patches supported all three species of Lepidoptera, but the gnatcatcher was present on nearly every site, regardless of sim. Results indicate that vertebrates do not automatically function as umbrella species for invertebrate cohabitants. Reserve designs based on vertebrate umbrella species, which assume invertebrates will be protected, may result in the loss of a large portion of invertebrate diversity.

AB The effects of fishing on life history traits and life history strategies of teleost fishes are analysed by a new comparative method that splits traits into an allometric part (size effect), an autoregressive phylogenetic component, and an environmental component (fishing effect). Both intra- and inter-specific variation of age and size at maturity, fecundity, adult size and egg size are analysed by comparing 84 populations of 49 species submitted to various fishing pressures. Two axes of life history diversification are found among teleosts. One is the well-known slow-fast continuum separating short-lived and early maturing species (like Clupeiformes) From longer-lived species that mature late relative to their size and spawn larger eggs (like salmonids or Scorpaeniformes). An additional strategy involves the schedule of resource allocation to growth and reproduction. Indeterminate growth allows higher teleosts (e.g. Gadiformes) to reach a large size while maturing early and laying small eggs. Increasing fishing pressure decreases age at maturity and egg size, and increases Fecundity at maturity, the slope of the fecundity-length relationship and relative size at maturity. These compensations for higher adult mortality differ among life history strategies. Indeterminate growth is associated with a greater flexibility in resource allocation to growth and reproduction that facilitates greater resilience to fishing mortality.

AB Management of small mammal communities in forest ecosystems requires a working knowledge of the scales at which species presence and abundance can best be predicted. Habitat-based models were developed to characterize the distribution of a boreal relict, the southern red-backed vole, Clethrionomys gapperi, in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA, at three hierarchical scales of analysis. Vole presence and abundance were most evident at the high-resolution (macrohabitat) scale, followed by the intermediate-resolution scale. The low-resolution model was the least effective for predicting presence or abundance and reflects the need for more resolute landscape classification systems if small mammal populations are to be accounted for in an ecologically relevant manner. Tree and shrub communities indicative of suitable vole habitat included Fraxinus pennsylvanica and Tsuga canadensis in the canopy and Carpinus caroliniana in the understory. Vole abundance increased with incidence of tree species such as Betula alleghaniensis, Pinus rigida, and Prunus serotina in the canopy, and Acer spicatum and woody vines in the understory. Voles were associated with northwest-facing high-elevation sites with abundant rocky substrate, likely a reflection of physiological water and thermal requirements, biogeographic influences, and the importance of substrate complexity for decreasing inter- and intraspecific interactions and avoidance of predators.
   Identification of the most effective resolution of landscape characterization improves habitat-based models of C. gapperi population dynamics in managed landscapes. Low-resolution habitat classifications may suffice for detecting suitable vole habitats within forest types, but prediction of vole abundance is most accurate at the greatest resolution, i.e., the macrohabitat scale. The utility of forest communities and habitats at various scales to predict vole presence and abundance suggests that C. gapperi may be a useful indicator species for identification and assessment of habitat important for rare small mammal species in the southern Appalachians.

AB Reproductive effort was manipulated in a free-living population of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to investigate the trade-off between reproductive investment and the expression of a condition-dependent sexually selected ornament. Phenotypic plasticity in the expression of this trait was related to the experimentally manipulated size of the brood reared by a male. Males that invested more in current reproduction subsequently became more attractive to females in this population as they showed a preference for males with smaller badges. This supports the argument that direct benefits are a primary focus for mate choice by females. Trade-offs between reproductive effort and the expression of sexual ornaments are a potentially important source of phenotypic variation in both sexual ornaments and life-history traits.

AB The patterns of above-ground growth, biomass allocation, crown morphology, and light attenuation were compared between small (50 to 250 cm tall) and tall (250 to 600 cm tall) yellow birch, sugar maple, and beech individuals in low (< 10% of above-canopy PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density)) and high (10 to 40% PPFD) Light environments in a mature sugar maple-birch-beech stand near Quebec city, Canada. Significant differences in above-ground growth, crown morphology, and allocation patterns were found among (i) the three co-dominating tree species, (ii) short and tall individuals, and (iii) low and high light environments. The direction of the differences in most baits investigated between low and high light environments were strikingly similar among the three species, but the magnitude of the differences often varied. Overall, yellow birch differed more in several traits in terms of its responses to light and size compared to beech and sugar maple. In general, differences found between light environments were smaller for the taller saplings, indicating that plasticity tends to decrease with increasing size in all three species. None of these crown structural differences found among species translated into differences in light attenuation within the sapling crowns. The maximum height observed in individual trees of all three species tended to decrease sharply below approximately 4% PPFD. We suggest that maximum tree height is restricted in such low light environments since the photosynthetic to non-photosynthetic tissue ratio, as measured by the leaf area ratio (LAR), declines rapidly with seedling size up to 150 cm. We suggest that these three species co-dominate in this forest due to a combination of small but effective differences in physiological, morphological, and allocational traits and responses to increases in the understory light environment.

AB Although the establishment of new individuals in the breeding component of a population is an essential feature of population regulation, only a few attempts have been made to test biological hypotheses about recruitment. Most previous studies rely on ad hoc calculations or are flawed with unwarranted assumptions about survival. We use a recently developed approach, based on capture-mark-recapture, in which analysis of local recruitment is similar to a time-reversed analysis of survival. The basic data set consists of capture histories viewed in reverse order, with initial capture at year of birth, and subsequent observations corresponding to years when the animal has bred. The model considers two essential components, the probability for any breeding individual to reproduce for the first time (beta, the probability of first reproduction) and the probability of recapture (p), both conditional on survival. Contrary to previous attempts at modeling recruitment, the present approach does not assume an age at which breeding propensity stabilizes to a maximum value. The flexibility achieved allows the comparison of recruitment among groups within a population and also allows one to consider the effects of environmental variables, as well as interactions between such effects. Practically, the procedure starts from a global model, based upon the a priori knowledge of the biology of the species, and assesses its fit. Then more parsimonious models are selected using Akaike's Information Criterion and likelihood ratio tests. Finally, maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters are obtained with estimates of precision. We used a modified version of program RELEASE for goodness-of-fit tests, and program SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the method with the study of local recruitment of Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber resells) in the Camargue (southern France) between 1984 and 1994. We found additive effects of age and year to affect recruitment. Breeding propensity increased with age. Recruitment was noticeably higher in the year following an increase in mortality rate due to a particularly severe winter. Longlasting effects of this increased mortality on recruitment were observed in the three following years. There was no evidence for an effect of sex or cohort (year of birth) on recruitment. However, sex, as well as time and age, affected recapture rates. We discuss the various advantages and limitations of the model for the study of local recruitment in long-lived species and mention some potential developments.

AB Few measurements of nitrogen fixation exist for streams. Desert streams are warm, well lighted, and often support abundant cyanobacterial populations; thus N-2 fixation may be significant in these N-poor ecosystems. N-2 fixation was measured in situ by acetylene reduction for two patch types (Anabaena mat and an epilithic assemblage). Patch-specific rates were high compared with published values (maximum 775 mu g N-2 [83 mu mol C2H4] mg chl a(-1) h(-1) or 51 mg N-2 [5.4 mmol C2H4] m(-2) h(-1)). Daytime fixation was higher than nighttime fixation, and temperature, light and inorganic N concentration explained 52% of variance in hourly rates over all dates. Diel input-output budgets were constructed on five dates when cyanobacteria were present in the stream. Diel N-2 fixation rates were measured for comparison with reach-scale diel nitrogen retention, to assess the importance of this vector to N economy of the stream. Fixation accounted for up to 85% of net N flux to the benthos, but its importance varied seasonally. Finally, we applied biomass-specific fixation rates to 1992 and 1993 biomass data to obtain seasonal and annual N-2 fixation estimates. Cyanobacteria were absent or rare during winter and spring, thus most of the annual N-2 fixation occurred during summer and autumn. Annual rates of nitrogen fixation for 1992 and 1993 (8.0 g/m(2) and 12.5 g/m(2)) were very high compared to other streams, and moderately high compared to other ecosystems. Like other phenomena in this disturbance-prone ecosystem, nitrogen fixation is strongly influenced by the number and temporal distribution of flood events.

In 13 of 14 contrasts between light-demanding and shade-tolerant genera within the same subfamily or family, the shade-tolerators have seeds of greater mean dry mass, but in eight out of nine contrasts between light-demanding and shade;tolerant species within genera the shade-tolerators have seeds of about the same or slightly lesser mass.
   2. We use the results To emphasize the low position of seed size in the hierarchy of characteristics enabling plants to became established in the shade.
   3. Within genera and among confamilial genera of shade-tolerant plants there can be differences of one to three orders of magnitude in seed dry mass. By hypothesis, species whose seedlings have a given degree of tolerance of shade, as Such, may make many 'risky' seeds or few 'safe' seeds, the larger-seeded species being buffered against drought and the effects of herbivores or falling branches. Extremes of seed size represent particular adaptations; very small-seeded species (<1 mg) establish on steep micro-slopes free of litter, while very large seeds (>2000 mg) attract especially large animals as dispersers, Seed size is seen as adaptive in contexts other than survival of shade as such.

We investigated whether the cost of mating was a cost of storing and/or receiving sperm by using two types of males that do not transfer sperm (transformer pseudomales and the male offspring of homozygous tudor mothers). Females that were intermittently exposed to males that did and did not transfer sperm did not differ in lifespan, in the absence of any differences in other costly aspects of reproduction, showing that there was no cost to receiving sperm. There was a cost of mating with spermless males; this suggested a potential cost of receiving accessory fluid. However, it was not possible to distinguish this possibility from other explanations, e.g. female injury at mating and the transfer of parasites. The reasons why females continuously exposed to males remated more than was in their reproductive interests is discussed.

AB 1.  We studied age-related reproductive success in a recently established breeding colony of barnacle goose Branta leucopsis on the island of Gotland, Sweden.
   2.  Associations of age and breeding experience with several reproductive parameters were investigated by comparing the success of individuals of 2, 3, 4 and greater-than-or-equal-to 5 years of age.  Also, we measured the within-individual changes in reproductive parameters as the individuals grew older.
   3.  Associations between survival and reproductive success were investigated by comparing the reproductive success of 2, 3 and 4-year-old birds that returned or did not return, respectively, in the subsequent breeding season.
   4.  The reproductive success increased up to an age of 4-5 years.  Thus, clutch size, number of hatched young and number of fledged young increased, and hatching date was advanced with increasing age.  This was due to the fact that individuals increased in reproductive success as they grew older.
   5.  A possibly higher probability of survival among individuals that perform well in reproduction could not explain the higher reproductive success in older age-classes as compared to young age-classes of geese, because there were no associations between survival and reproductive success, and very few individuals did actually disappear between any two breeding seasons.
   6.  Path analysis suggested age effects only at earlier stages of reproduction, i.e. timing of breeding and clutch size.  These characters, in turn, were associated with number of fledged young.  These findings were further supported by measurements of hatching success and rearing success, which did not seem to increase with age.
   7.  Increased breeding experience was associated with early hatching date and larger clutch size in males, and with larger clutch size in females.  This was concluded from path analysis and from comparisons of individuals of the same age but with different breeding experience.
   8.  The increase in reproductive success with age in the barnacle goose is probably a result of age-related skills in individuals and the direct effects of these skills on reproductive success, but possibly also because of increased reproductive effort with age owing to these age-related skills.

AB We report on the interaction between reproduction and subsequent reproductive and vegetative growth in female plants of a dioecious, early successional, tall shrub, the feltleaf willow (Salix alaxensis).  We measured natural variation among individuals in flowering, and its correlation with subsequent shoot growth and flowering.  We also experimentally curtailed reproductive allocation in two ways:  (1) by removing inflorescence buds in April when plants were dormant, and (2) by covering inflorescences to prevent pollination and fruit development.  We hypothesized that these treatments would cause manipulated plants to retain more resources and to deploy them subsequently in shoot growth or reproduction.  However, treatment had no significant effect upon shoot elongation, which decreased slightly after floral buds were removed.  Treatments did significantly increase the fraction of buds differentiating as inflorescences instead of shoots.  We compared the experimental outcome with the natural, phenotypic variation among plants.  Among plants of either the treated or the unmanipulated groups, there was a significant negative correlation between current reproduction and subsequent growth; the corresponding regressions did not differ between the two groups.  Thus, natural phenotypic variation suggested a trade-off between reproduction and growth, but a direct test by experiment revealed only a trade-off between current and future reproduction.  Furthermore, the negative correlation seen in unmanipulated plants was unaffected by treatments curtailing reproductive investment.  We conclude that this correlation is not directly related to allocation constraints, and does not provide reliable evidence about costs of reproduction.  The increased commitment to flowering that occurred after experimental reduction of current reproductive investment may be evidence for a cost of reproduction, although the response need not have been caused directly by resource allocation constraints.

AB Background The principle that a single large habitat patch should hold more species than several small patches totalling the same area (SL > SS) is used by conservation agencies to favour protection of large, contiguous areas. Previous reviews of empirical studies have found the opposite, SS > SL, creating the single large or several small (SLOSS) debate.
   Aims Review the empirical and theoretical SLOSS literature; identify potential mechanisms underlying the SS > SL pattern; evaluate these where possible.
   Location Global.
   Time period 1976-2018.
   Major taxa Plants, invertebrates, vertebrates.
   Methods Literature review.
   Results Like previous reviews, I found that SS > SL dominates empirical findings. This pattern remained, although it was somewhat weakened, in studies where sampling intensity was proportional to patch size. I found six classes of theory, and conducted five preliminary evaluations of theory. None of the predictions was supported. The SS > SL pattern held for specialist species groups, suggesting it does not result from incursion by generalists into small patches. I found no evidence for the prediction that the reverse pattern (SL > SS) becomes more common over time since patch creation, through gradual species losses from SS. I found no difference between results for natural and anthropogenic patches. There was also no evidence for predictions that SL > SS is more common when the matrix is more hostile, or for stable than ephemeral patches.
   Main conclusions Most empirical comparisons find SS > SL. While there are several potential causes, more empirical work is needed to identify those at play. Meanwhile, conservation practitioners should understand that there is no ecological evidence supporting a general principle to preserve large, contiguous habitat areas rather than multiple small areas of the same total size.

AB Decades of research suggest that species richness depends on spatial characteristics of habitat patches, especially their size and isolation. In contrast, the habitat amount hypothesis predicts that (1) species richness in plots of fixed size (species density) is more strongly and positively related to the amount of habitat around the plot than to patch size or isolation; (2) habitat amount better predicts species density than patch size and isolation combined, (3) there is no effect of habitat fragmentation per se on species density and (4) patch size and isolation effects do not become stronger with declining habitat amount. Data on eight taxonomic groups from 35 studies around the world support these predictions. Conserving species density requires minimising habitat loss, irrespective of the configuration of the patches in which that habitat is contained.

AB This paper describes the formation of, and initial results for, a new FLUXNET coordination network for ecosystem-scale methane (CH4) measurements at 60 sites globally, organized by the Global Carbon Project in partnership with other initiatives and regional flux tower networks. The objectives of the effort are presented along with an overview of the coverage of eddy covariance (EC) CH4 flux measurements globally, initial results comparing CH4 fluxes across the sites, and future research directions and needs. Annual estimates of net CH4 fluxes across sites ranged from -0.2 +/- 0.02 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for an upland forest site to 114.9 +/- 13.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for an estuarine freshwater marsh, with fluxes exceeding 40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at multiple sites. Average annual soil and air temperatures were found to be the strongest predictor of annual CH4 flux across wetland sites globally. Water table position was positively correlated with annual CH4 emissions, although only for wetland sites that were not consistently inundated throughout the year. The ratio of annual CH4 fluxes to ecosystem respiration increased significantly with mean site temperature. Uncertainties in annual CH4 estimates due to gap-filling and random errors were on average +/- 1.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at 95% confidence, with the relative error decreasing exponentially with increasing flux magnitude across sites. Through the analysis and synthesis of a growing EC CH4 flux database, the controls on ecosystem CH4 fluxes can be better understood, used to inform and validate Earth system models, and reconcile differences between land surface model- and atmospheric-based estimates of CH4 emissions.

AB In coastal waters around the world, the dominant primary producers are benthic macrophytes, including seagrasses and macroalgae, that provide habitat structure and food for diverse and abundant biological communities and drive ecosystem processes. Seagrass meadows and macroalgal forests play key roles for coastal societies, contributing to fishery yields, storm protection, biogeochemical cycling and storage, and important cultural values. These socio-economically valuable services are threatened worldwide by human activities, with substantial areas of seagrass and macroalgal forests lost over the last half-century. Tracking the status and trends in marine macrophyte cover and quality is an emerging priority for ocean and coastal management, but doing so has been challenged by limited coordination across the numerous efforts to monitor macrophytes, which vary widely in goals, methodologies, scales, capacity, governance approaches, and data availability. Here, we present a consensus assessment and recommendations on the current state of and opportunities for advancing global marine macrophyte observations, integrating contributions from a community of researchers with broad geographic and disciplinary expertise. With the increasing scale of human impacts, the time is ripe to harmonize marine macrophyte observations by building on existing networks and identifying a core set of common metrics and approaches in sampling design, field measurements, governance, capacity building, and data management. We recommend a tiered observation system, with improvement of remote sensing and remote underwater imaging to expand capacity to capture broad-scale extent at intervals of several years, coordinated with strati fied in situ sampling annually to characterize the key variables of cover and taxonomic or functional group composition, and to provide ground-truth. A robust networked system of macrophyte observations will be facilitated by establishing best practices, including standard protocols, documentation, and sharing of resources at all stages of work flow, and secure archiving of open-access data. Because such a network is necessarily distributed, sustaining it depends on close engagement of local stakeholders and focusing on building and long-term maintenance of local capacity, particularly in the developing world. Realizing these recommendations will producemore effective, efficient, and responsive observing, a more accurate global picture of change in vegetated coastal systems, and stronger international capacity for sustaining observations.

TI Phylogenetic and Trait-Based Prediction of Extinction Risk for
   Data-Deficient Amphibians
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY

ID CONSERVATION STATUS; DISPERSAL; GEOGRAPHY; DECLINES; BIOLOGY; THREAT
AB Amphibians are among the most highly threatened lineages, with at least 2,000 species estimated to be in danger of extinction [1, 2]. Alarmingly, another similar to 2,200 species (similar to 25% of all similar to 7,900 known species) are data deficient or not evaluated (hereinafter termed data deficient) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [1]. Without an estimate of their status, data-deficient species are usually overlooked in conservation planning and resource allocation [3]. Amphibians have the highest proportion of data-deficient species of any vertebrate group [1, 4], which highlights the need to estimate their threat status considering potentially imminent extinctions. We apply a trait-based spatio-phylogenetic statistical framework [5] to predict threat status for data-deficient species. Because ecological, geographical, and evolutionary attributes increase extinction risk [6, 7], we used geographic distribution data [1, 8], phylogenetically imputed ecological traits, and an amphibian phylogeny [9] to provide initial baseline predictions. We estimate that half of the similar to 2,200 data-deficient species are threatened with extinction (vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered), primarily in the Neotropics and Southeast Asia. This increases the number of amphibian species estimated to be threatened with extinction by similar to 50%. Of these, we predict that similar to 500 species are endangered or critically endangered, and three may be extinct already. We highlight families that are most at risk and suggest where urgent conservation is needed to avert their loss. We show that some of the most vulnerable species may also be the most poorly known and offer an analytical framework for preliminary analysis of their threat status in the face of deficient empirical data.

AB Semi-arid grasslands on the Mongolian Plateau are expected to experience high inputs of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen in this century. It remains unclear, however, how soil organisms and nutrient cycling are directly affected by N enrichment (i.e., without mediation by plant input to soil) vs. indirectly affected via changes in plant-related inputs to soils resulting from N enrichment. To test the direct and indirect effects of N enrichment on soil organisms (bacteria, fungi and nematodes) and their associated C and N mineralization, in 2010, we designated two subplots (with plants and without plants) in every plot of a six-level N-enrichment experiment established in 1999 in a semi-arid grassland. In 2014, 4 years after subplots with and without plant were established, N enrichment had substantially altered the soil bacterial, fungal and nematode community structures due to declines in biomass or abundance whether plants had been removed or not. N enrichment also reduced the diversity of these groups (except for fungi) and the soil C mineralization rate and induced a hump-shaped response of soil N mineralization. As expected, plant removal decreased the biomass or abundance of soil organisms and C and N mineralization rates due to declines in soil substrates or food resources. Analyses of plant-removal-induced changes (ratios of without- to with-plant subplots) showed that micro-organisms and C and N mineralization rates were not enhanced as N enrichment increased but that nematodes were enhanced as N enrichment increased, indicating that the effects of plant removal on soil organisms and mineralization depended on trophic level and nutrient status. Surprisingly, there was no statistical interaction between N enrichment and plant removal for most variables, indicating that plant-related inputs did not qualitatively change the effects of N enrichment on soil organisms or mineralization. Structural equation modelling confirmed that changes in soil communities and mineralization rates were more affected by the direct effects of N enrichment (via soil acidification and increased N availability) than by plant-related indirect effects. Our results provide insight into how future changes in N deposition and vegetation may modify below-ground communities and processes in grassland ecosystems.

AB Foundation species define the ecosystems they live in, but ecologists have often characterized dominant plants as foundational without supporting evidence. Giant kelp has long been considered a marine foundation species due to its complex structure and high productivity; however, there is little quantitative evidence to evaluate this. Here, we apply structural equation modelling to a 15-year time series of reef community data to evaluate how giant kelp affects the reef community. Although species richness was positively associated with giant kelp biomass, most direct paths did not involve giant kelp. Instead, the foundational qualities of giant kelp were driven mostly by indirect effects attributed to its dominant physical structure and associated engineering influence on the ecosystem, rather than by its use as food by invertebrates and fishes. Giant kelp structure has indirect effects because it shades out understorey algae that compete with sessile invertebrates. When released from competition, sessile species in turn increase the diversity of mobile predators. Sea urchin grazing effects could have been misinterpreted as kelp effects, because sea urchins can overgraze giant kelp, understorey algae and sessile invertebrates alike. Our results confirm the high diversity and biomass associated with kelp forests, but highlight how species interactions and habitat attributes can be misconstrued as direct consequences of a foundation species like giant kelp.

AB Slums are a global urban challenge, with less developed countries being particularly impacted. To adequately detect and map them, data is needed on their location, spatial extent and evolution. High- and very high-resolution remote sensing imagery has emerged as an important source of data in this regard. The purpose of this paper is to critically review studies that have used such data to detect and map slums. Our analysis shows that while such studies have been increasing over time, they tend to be concentrated to a few geographical areas and often focus on the use of a single approach (e.g., image texture and object-based image analysis), thus limiting generalizability to understand slums, their population, and evolution within the global context. We argue that to develop a more comprehensive framework that can be used to detect and map slums, other emerging sourcing of geospatial data should be considered (e.g., volunteer geographic information) in conjunction with growing trends and advancements in technology (e.g., geosensor networks). Through such data integration and analysis we can then create a benchmark for determining the most suitable methods for mapping slums in a given locality, thus fostering the creation of new approaches to address this challenge.

AB Based on a comprehensive analysis of key definitions of Green Infrastructure (GI) and their conceptual evolution, we present a review of current GI mapping approaches at multiple spatial scales and their associated functional analyses. GI is an approach that is used to combine ecosystem services and human well-being to realize an efficient and sustainable use of spaces, hereafter named "GI concept". The interdisciplinary database that forms the basis of our literature review includes peer-reviewed journal papers as well as books and documents published by international organizations, governmental agencies, and research institutions. By analyzing these publications not only English but also Chinese articles we present an exhaustive review that gauges the state and evolution of GI in chronological terms, and we discuss how GI should be further improved. We systematically examine what GI actually measures and question whether its current manifestations are consistent with its conceptual development. Furthermore, we seek to find out whether there are specific trends in the conceptual evolution of definitions of GI, and whether there are gaps between this evolution and the implementation of GI in the context of advancing sustainable development. We then draw attention to differentiation while analyzing GI functions and classifications. On this foundation, we discuss six primary principles and propose a number of ways of enhancing and applying GI in the future. Our review shows that, at this point in time, special emphasis on the core idea of multifunctionality is significant for depicting the 'state of the art' of the evolving GI concept.

AB Macroecological models for predicting species distributions usually only include abiotic environmental conditions as explanatory variables, despite knowledge from community ecology that all species are linked to other species through biotic interactions. This disconnect is largely due to the different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines: macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions, while community ecologists focus on small extents and fine resolutions. A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species' presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions and their dynamics under environmental change.

AB Understanding the consequences of species loss in complex ecological communities is one of the great challenges in current biodiversity research. For a long time, this topic has been addressed by traditional biodiversity experiments. Most of these approaches treat species as trait-free, taxonomic units characterizing communities only by species number without accounting for species traits. However, extinctions do not occur at random as there is a clear correlation between extinction risk and species traits. In this review, we assume that large species will be most threatened by extinction and use novel allometric and size-spectrum concepts that include body mass as a primary species trait at the levels of populations and individuals, respectively, to re-assess three classic debates on the relationships between biodiversity and (i) food-web structural complexity, (ii) community dynamic stability, and (iii) ecosystem functioning. Contrasting current expectations, size-structured approaches suggest that the loss of large species, that typically exploit most resource species, may lead to future food webs that are less interwoven and more structured by chains of interactions and compartments. The disruption of natural body-mass distributions maintaining food-web stability may trigger avalanches of secondary extinctions and strong trophic cascades with expected knock-on effects on the functionality of the ecosystems. Therefore, we argue that it is crucial to take into account body size as a species trait when analysing the consequences of biodiversity loss for natural ecosystems. Applying size-structured approaches provides an integrative ecological concept that enables a better understanding of each species' unique role across communities and the causes and consequences of biodiversity loss.

AB Metacommunity patterns and underlying processes in aquatic organisms have typically been studied within a drainage basin. We examined variation in the composition of six freshwater organismal groups across various drainage basins in Finland. We first modelled spatial structures within each drainage basin using Moran eigenvector maps. Second, we partitioned variation in community structure among three groups of predictors using constrained ordination: (1) local environmental variables, (2) spatial variables, and (3) dummy variable drainage basin identity. Third, we examined turnover and nestedness components of multiple-site beta diversity, and tested the best fit patterns of our datasets using the "elements of metacommunity structure" analysis. Our results showed that basin identity and local environmental variables were significant predictors of community structure, whereas within-basin spatial effects were typically negligible. In half of the organismal groups (diatoms, bryophytes, zooplankton), basin identity was a slightly better predictor of community structure than local environmental variables, whereas the opposite was true for the remaining three organismal groups (insects, macrophytes, fish). Both pure basin and local environmental fractions were, however, significant after accounting for the effects of the other predictor variable sets. All organismal groups exhibited high levels of beta diversity, which was mostly attributable to the turnover component. Our results showed consistent Clementsian-type metacommunity structures, suggesting that subgroups of species responded similarly to environmental factors or drainage basin limits. We conclude that aquatic communities across large scales are mostly determined by environmental and basin effects, which leads to high beta diversity and prevalence of Clementsian community types.

AB The popularity of MaxEnt in species distribution modeling has been driven by several factors including its high degree of accuracy, and flexibility to tailor efforts to species-specific situations. Although many recent studies have identified the importance of adjusting mathematical transformation (feature class) and regularization of coefficient values, collectively known as tuning, few studies have addressed the need to customize the variables used in species distribution modeling, and use unselected variable sets. This study presents two novel methods to select for environmental variables in MaxEnt. The first involves selecting from a priori determined environmental variable sets (pre-selected based on ecological or biological knowledge), and the second utilizes a reiterative process of model formation and stepwise removal of least contributing variables. Both methods were tested on eight known species of invasive crayfish, with results reinforcing the need for species-specific environmental variable sets. While the reiterative process generally performs better than the a priori selected variables, selection of method can be based on information availability. These techniques appear to outperform the current practice of utilizing unselected variable sets and is especially important considering the increasing application of species distribution modeling (across spatial and temporal barriers) in conservation and management efforts whereby inaccurate predictions might have adverse effects.

AB Phenotypic plasticity of temperature tolerance (thermal acclimation) is often highlighted as an important component of the acute and evolutionary adaptation to temperatures in insects. For this reason, it is often suggested that thermal acclimation ability could be important for buffering the consequences of climate change. Based on data from Drosophila we discuss if and how phenotypic plasticity is likely to mitigate the effects of climate change. We conclude that plasticity of upper thermal limits is small in magnitude, evolves slowly and that acclimation ability is weakly correlated with latitude and environmental heterogeneity. Accordingly plasticity in upper thermal limits is unlikely to effectively buffer effects of global warming for species already close to their upper thermal boundaries.

AB Traditional spectral-based methods such as PCA are popular for anomaly detection in a variety of problems and domains. However, if data includes tensor (multiway) structure (e.g. space-time-measurements), some meaningful anomalies may remain invisible with these methods. Although tensor-based anomaly detection (TAD) has been applied within a variety of disciplines over the last twenty years, it is not yet recognized as a formal category in anomaly detection. This survey aims to highlight the potential of tensor-based techniques as a novel approach for detection and identification of abnormalities and failures. We survey the interdisciplinary works in which TAD is reported and characterize the learning strategies, methods and applications; extract the important open issues in TAD and provide the corresponding existing solutions according to the state-of-the-art.

AB We model the spatial and seasonal variability of three key water quality variables (water temperature and concentration of nitrates and phosphates) for entire river networks in a large area in northern Spain. Models were developed with the Random Forest technique, using 12 (water temperature and nitrate concentration) and 15 (phosphate concentration) predictor variables as descriptors of several environmental attributes (climate, topography, land-uses, hydrology and anthropogenic pressures). The effect of the different predictors on the response variables was assessed with partial dependence plots and partial correlation analysis. Results indicated that land uses were important predictors in defining the spatial and seasonal patterns of these three variables. Water temperature was positively related with air temperature and the upstream drainage area, whereas increases in forest cover decreased water temperature. Nitrate concentration was mainly related to the area covered by agricultural land-uses, increasing in winter, probably because of catchment run-off processes. On the other hand, phosphate concentration was highly related to the area covered by urban land-uses in the upstream catchment and to the proximity of the closest upstream effluent. Phosphate concentration increased notably during the low flow period (summer), probably due to the reduction of the dilution capacity. These results provide a large-scale continuous picture of water quality, which could help identify the main sources of change in water quality and assist in the prioritization of river reaches for restoration projects.

AB Populations arrayed along broad latitudinal gradients often show patterns of clinal variation in phenotype and genotype. Such population differentiation can be generated and maintained by both historical demographic events and local adaptation. These evolutionary forces are not mutually exclusive and can in some cases produce nearly identical patterns of genetic differentiation among populations. Here, we investigate the evolutionary forces that generated and maintain clinal variation genome-wide among populations of Drosophila melanogaster sampled in North America and Australia. We contrast patterns of clinal variation in these continents with patterns of differentiation among ancestral European and African populations. Using established and novel methods we derive here, we show that recently derived North America and Australia populations were likely founded by both European and African lineages and that this hybridization event likely contributed to genome-wide patterns of parallel clinal variation between continents. The pervasive effects of admixture mean that differentiation at only several hundred loci can be attributed to the operation of spatially varying selection using an F-ST outlier approach. Our results provide novel insight into the well-studied system of clinal differentiation in D.melanogaster and provide a context for future studies seeking to identify loci contributing to local adaptation in a wide variety of organisms, including other invasive species as well as temperate endemics.

AB One of the most common applications in isotopic ecology is the assessment of animal's assimilated diet through mass-balance mixing models. Its applicability relies on the use of accurate diet to tissue discrimination factors and turnover rates, which are known to vary as a function of several factors including taxon or tissue type. To date, few studies have assessed isotopic discrimination factors and turnover rates in cetacean species under controlled conditions. Previous experimental studies focused on blood, a difficult sample to obtain in the wild, or on a more appropriate tissue, the skin, but assessed in short experimental trials without arriving to the isotopic equilibrium. We carried out the longest controlled feeding experiment available (350 days) in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in order to assess discrimination factors and turnover rates in skin. Animals' isotopic composition was first stabilized by maintaining individuals under an isotopically constant diet during 172 days. Afterwards, diet was shifted and maintained during 178 days to calculate isotopic discrimination and turnover rates. Estimates for isotopic discrimination factors were 1.01 +/- 0.37 parts per thousand (mean +/- sd) for delta C-13 and 1.57 +/- 0.52 parts per thousand for delta N-15. Half-life turnover rates were estimated to be 24.16 +/- 8.19 days for carbon and 47.63 +/- 19 days for nitrogen. This is the first time that applicable values are available to assess the diet of free ranging small cetaceans through stable isotope mixing model analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Striking evolutionary convergence can lead to similar sets of species in different locations, such as in cichlid fishes and Anolis lizards, and suggests that evolution can be repeatable and predictable across clades. Yet, most examples of convergence involve relatively small temporal and/or spatial scales. Some authors have speculated that at larger scales (e.g., across continents), differing evolutionary histories will prevent convergence. However, few studies have compared the contrasting roles of convergence and history, and none have done so at large scales. Here we develop a two-part approach to test the scale over which convergence can occur, comparing the relative importance of convergence and history in macroevolution using phylogenetic models of adaptive evolution. We apply this approach to data from morphology, ecology, and phylogeny from 167 species of anuran amphibians (frogs) from 10 local sites across the world, spanning similar to 160 myr of evolution. Mapping ecology on the phylogeny revealed that similar microhabitat specialists (e.g., aquatic, arboreal) have evolved repeatedly across clades and regions, producing many evolutionary replicates for testing for morphological convergence. By comparing morphological optima for clades and microhabitat types (our first test), we find that convergence associated with microhabitat use dominates frog morphological evolution, producing recurrent ecomorphs that together encompass all sampled species in each community in each region. However, our second test, which examines whether and how much species differ from their inferred optima, shows that convergence is incomplete: that is, phenotypes of most species are still somewhat distant from the estimated optimum for each microhabitat, seemingly because of insufficient time for more complete adaptation (an effect of history). Yet, these effects of history are related to past ecologies, and not clade membership. Overall, our study elucidates the dominant drivers of morphological evolution across a major vertebrate clade and shows that evolution can be repeatable at much greater temporal and spatial scales than commonly thought. It also provides an analytical framework for testing other potential examples of large-scale convergence.

AB Halting the 'extinction of experience', the progressive disengagement of people with the natural world, is vital to human health and wellbeing and to public support for global biological conservation. Home to the majority of humanity, urban areas are the key for engaging people with nature, raising the crucial question of how cities should best be designed to facilitate these experiences. For the purposes of maintaining local biodiversity, intensive development within a small area (land sparing) has been shown to be better than extensive development over a large area (land sharing). Here, we investigated for the first time how different city forms affect people's experience of nature, measured in terms of their use of greenspaces. We selected five pairs of land-sharing and land-sparing study regions with different coverage by greenspaces within the city of Tokyo, central Japan and used a questionnaire survey to determine the use residents made of these spaces. We found the frequency of people's recreational use of urban greenspaces was higher in urban land-sharing than land-sparing regions. Moreover, satisfaction with local green environments was also higher in land-sharing regions. This suggests a potential conflict in the design of cities between the urban form that is most desirable for the direct protection of regional biodiversity, and that which best promotes people's nature experiences and the support for its wider protection. A strong emphasis on the advantages of land sparing may increase the separation of humans from nature, and further reduce public interest in, and awareness of, biodiversity and its benefits.

AB The composition of microbial communities and the level of enzymatic activity in the soil are both important indicators of soil quality, but the mechanisms by which a soil bacterial community is generated and maintained are not yet fully understood. Two soil samples were collected from the same location, but each had been subjected to a different long-term fertilization treatment and was characterized by different microbial diversity, biomass and physicochemical properties. These samples were gamma-sterilized and swap inoculated. Non-sterilized soil samples along with sterilized and inoculated soil samples were incubated for eight months before their nutrient content, microbial biomass, enzymatic activity and bacterial composition were analyzed. Total phosphorus, and potassium concentrations along with the overall organic matter content of the non-sterilized soil were all equal to those of the same soil that had been sterilized and self/swap inoculated. Additionally, the microbial biomass carbon concentration was not affected by the specific inoculum and varied only by soil type. The activities of catalase, invertase, urease, protease, acid phosphatase and phytase were smaller in the sterilized soils that had been inoculated with organisms from chemical fertilizer amended soil (NPK) when compared to sterilized soil inoculated with organisms from manure and chemical fertilizer amended soil (NPKM) and non-sterilized soil samples. Bacterial 16S rRNA examined by 454-pyrosequencing revealed that the composition of bacterial community reconstructed by immigrant microbial inoculum in the soil was mainly influenced by its physicochemical properties, although the microbial inoculum contained different abundances of bacterial taxa. For example, the pH of the soil was the dominant factor in reconstructing a new bacterial community. Taken together, these results demonstrated that both soil microbial composition and functionality were primarily determined by soil properties rather than the microbiatinoculum, which contributed to our understanding of how soil microbial communities are generated and maintained.

AB Connectivity plays a crucial role in determining the spread, viability, and persistence of populations across space. Dispersal across landscapes, or the movement of individuals or genes among resource patches, is critical for functional connectivity. Yet current connectivity modelling typically uses information on species location or habitat preference rather than movement, which unfortunately may not capture key dispersal limitations. We argue that recent developments in species distribution modelling provide insightful lessons for addressing this gap and advancing our understanding of connectivity. We suggest shifting the focus of connectivity modelling from locating where animals potentially disperse to a process-based approach directed towards understanding and mapping factors that limit successful dispersal. To do so, we propose defining species dispersal requirements through identifying spatial, environmental and intrinsic constraints to successful dispersal, analogous to identifying environmental dimensions that define niches. We discuss the benefits of this constraint-based framework for understanding the distribution of species, predicting species responses to climate change, and connectivity conservation practice. We illustrate how the framework can aid in identifying potential detrimental effects of human activities on connectivity and species persistence, and can spur the implementation of innovative conservation strategies. The proposed framework clarifies the validity and contextual utility of objectives and measures in existing connectivity models, and identifies gaps that may impede our understanding of connectivity and its integration into successful conservation strategies. We expect that this framework will facilitate a mechanistic approach to understanding and conserving connectivity, which will aid in effectively predicting and mitigating effects of ongoing environmental change.

AB Water use efficiency (WUE; gross primary production [GPP]/evapotranspiration [ET]) estimates the tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss during photosynthesis and is an important link of the carbon and water cycles. Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns and drivers of WUE is helpful for projecting the responses of ecosystems to climate change. Here we examine the spatiotemporal patterns, trends, and drivers of WUE at the global scale from 2000 to 2013 using the gridded GPP and ET data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Our results show that the global WUE has an average value of 1.70 g C/kg H2O with large spatial variability during the 14-year period. WUE exhibits large variability with latitude. WUE also varies much with elevation: it first remains relatively constant as the elevation varies from 0 to 1000 m and then decreases dramatically. WUE generally increases as precipitation and specific humidity increase; whereas it decreases after reaching maxima as temperature and solar radiation increases. In most land areas, the temporal trend of WUE is positively correlated with precipitation and specific humidity over the 14-year period; while it has a negative relationship with temperature and solar radiation related to global warming and dimming. On average, WUE shows an increasing trend of 0.0025 g C.kg(-1) H2O.yr(-1) globally. Our global-scale assessment of WUE has implications for improving our understanding of the linkages between the water and carbon cycles and for better projecting the responses of ecosystems to climate change.

AB Forest vertebrate fauna provide critical services, such as pollination and seed dispersal, which underpin functional and resilient ecosystems. In turn, many of these fauna are dependent on the flowering phenology of the plant species of such ecosystems. The impact of changes in climate, including climate extremes, on the interaction between these fauna and flora has not been identified or elucidated, yet influences on flowering phenology are already evident. These changes are well documented in the mid to high latitudes. However, there is emerging evidence that the flowering phenology, nectar/pollen production, and fruit production of long-lived trees in tropical and subtropical forests are also being impacted by changes in the frequency and severity of climate extremes. Here, we examine the implications of these changes for vertebrate fauna dependent on these resources. We review the literature to establish evidence for links between climate extremes and flowering phenology, elucidating the nature of relationships between different vertebrate taxa and flowering regimes. We combine this information with climate change projections to postulate about the likely impacts on nectar, pollen and fruit resource availability and the consequences for dependent vertebrate fauna. The most recent climate projections show that the frequency and intensity of climate extremes will increase during the 21st century. These changes are likely to significantly alter mass flowering and fruiting events in the tropics and subtropics, which are frequently cued by climate extremes, such as intensive rainfall events or rapid temperature shifts. We find that in these systems the abundance and duration of resource availability for vertebrate fauna is likely to fluctuate, and the time intervals between episodes of high resource availability to increase. The combined impact of these changes has the potential to result in cascading effects on ecosystems through changes in pollinator and seed dispersal ecology, and demands a focused research effort.

AB Islands are ideal for investigating processes that shape species assemblages because they are isolated and have discrete boundaries. Quantifying phylogenetic assemblage structure allows inferences about these processes, in particular dispersal, environmental filtering and in-situ speciation. Here, we link phylogenetic assemblage structure to island characteristics across 393 islands worldwide and 37,041 vascular plant species (representing angiosperms overall, palms and ferns). Physical and bioclimatic factors, especially those impeding colonization and promoting speciation, explained more variation in phylogenetic structure of angiosperms overall (49%) and palms (52%) than of ferns (18%). The relationships showed different or contrasting trends among these major plant groups, consistent with their dispersal- and speciation-related traits and climatic adaptations. Phylogenetic diversity was negatively related to isolation for palms, but unexpectedly it was positively related to isolation for angiosperms overall. This indicates strong dispersal filtering for the predominantly large-seeded, animal-dispersed palm family whereas colonization from biogeographically distinct source pools on remote islands likely drives the phylogenetic structure of angiosperm floras. We show that signatures of dispersal limitation, environmental filtering and in-situ speciation differ markedly among taxonomic groups on islands, which sheds light on the origin of insular plant diversity.

AB We used bulk tissue C-13 and N-15 values and N-15 values of individual amino acids (AA) to characterize the trophic structure of a pelagic fish assemblage from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) ecosystem. We focus on energy flow between fishes inhabiting distinct epipelagic, mesopelagic, and upper bathypelagic habitats and on predatory fish foraging across and within these depth habitats. Trophic positions (TPs) estimated from a combination of trophic and source AA N-15 values (TPTr-Src) spanned a narrow range of 0.7 TP for 10 species of large fishes, including tunas, billfishes, and gempylids (TPTr-Src 4.3-5.0). Similarly, 13 species of small micronekton fishes encompassed a range of 1.2 TP (TPTr-Src 2.6-3.8). The N-15 values of three source AAs were found to increase with increasing depth of capture across the 13 micronekton fish species (N-15(Phe) range=6.6 parts per thousand; N-15(Gly) range=13.4 parts per thousand; N-15(Ser) range=13.6 parts per thousand), indicating that some species from epipelagic, mesopelagic, and upper bathypelagic communities access distinct food resources, such as suspended particles. These isotopic depth trends are consistent with previous observations in particulate organic matter and zooplankton from the NPSG, providing new evidence that large pelagic and micronekton fishes access a food web fueled by particles formed in surface waters but that are highly modified by microbes as they slowly settle to remote depths. On the contrary, no significant relationships between the N-15 values of source AAs and habitat depth were observed in the large predator fish group, of which many species move and forage across large depth gradients.

AB The prevalence of phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) in nature is still a conflicting issue. Disagreement arises from confusion over its precise definition and the variety of approaches to measure its prevalence. Recent work highlighted that common measures of PNC strongly depend on the assumptions of the underlying model of niche evolution. However, this warning has not been well recognized in the applied literature and questionable approaches are still frequently applied. The aim of this study is to draw attention to the assumptions underlying commonly applied simple measures of PNC. We used a series of simulations to illustrate how misleading results can be if assumptions of niche evolution are violated, that the violation of assumptions is a common phenomenon and that testing assumptions requires in-depth pretest. We conclude that the seemingly simple measures of PNC, such as phylogenetic signal (PS) and evolutionary rate, are not so easy to apply if one accounts for the necessity to test model assumptions. In addition, these measures can be difficult to interpret. The common assumption that strong PS indicates PNC will be often invalid. In addition, the interpretation of some measures, for example the conclusion that evolutionary rate is slow enough to indicate PNC, requires a comparison with another clade, another trait or well-developed null model assumptions and thus additional data. We suggest that studies investigating PNC should always compare alternative evolutionary models and that model comparisons should in particular include flexible niche evolution models such as multiple-optima OU models, although these are computational intensive. These models are directly inherited from the concept of macroevolutionary adaptive landscape and can indicate PNC either by relative few peak shifts or by narrow peaks in the adaptive landscape. A test of PNC thus requires comparing these parameters of the macroevolutionary landscape between clades or time periods. The general prevalence of PNC in nature should be evaluated only based on studies keeping up to the high standards of communicating the used definition of PNC, testing the assumptions made in the modelling approaches and including newly developed models in a model comparison approach.

AB This article is part of a Special Issue "Chemosignals and Reproduction".
   Chemical cues were probably the first cues ever used to communicate and are still ubiquitous among living organisms. Birds have long been considered an exception: it was believed that birds were anosmic and relied on their acute visual and acoustic capabilities. Birds are however excellent smellers and use odors in various contexts including food searching, orientation, and also breeding. Successful reproduction in most vertebrates involves the exchange of complex social signals between partners. The first evidence for a role of olfaction in reproductive contexts in birds only dates back to the seventies, when ducks were shown to require a functional sense of smell to express normal sexual behaviors. Nowadays, even if the interest for olfaction in birds has largely increased, the role that bodily odors play in reproduction still remains largely understudied. The few available studies suggest that olfaction is involved in many reproductive stages. Odors have been shown to influence the choice and synchronization of partners, the choice of nest-building material or the care for the eggs and offspring. How this chemical information is translated at the physiological level mostly remains to be described, although available evidence suggests that, as in mammals, key reproductive brain areas like the medial preoptic nucleus are activated by relevant olfactory signals. Olfaction in birds receives increasing attention and novel findings are continuously published, but many exciting discoveries are still ahead of us, and could make birds one of the animal classes with the largest panel of developed senses ever described.

   ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
AB Flowers are complex structures, synchronously displaying both olfactory and visual signals/cues in the context of a particular floral morphology, that also vary in resource quantity and quality. Despite or possibly because of this complexity, many studies focus on a single or few traits rather than studying floral phenotypes in a more integrated fashion. However, each of these distinct trait classes (signals/cues, morphology and resources) mediates interactions with floral visitors, demanding a more holistic view of flowers. In our review, we integrate floral scents into the broader context of the whole-flower phenotype. We discuss the functions of scent bouquets, colouration, morphology and rewards in flower visitor interactions from an ecological and evolutionary perspective in isolation and taken together. Studies demonstrate that floral scent bouquets can act additively or synergistically with other modalities, and that their effects on flower visitors are context-dependent. We also present field study results showing that reward levels modulate dose-dependent responses to volatiles by honeybees. To motivate studies examining complex floral phenotypes, we outline statistical approaches suited to deal with the complex multivariate datasets generated by these studies. We conclude with a discussion on why flowers display multimodal traits and suggest future research efforts. Our aim is to foster a fresh view on integrated floral phenotypes and stimulate studies exploring the combined effects of olfactory, visual, morphological and nutritional traits on flower animal interactions.

AB Deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics may substantially alter soil N-oxide emissions. It is particularly relevant to accurately quantify those changes to properly account for them in a REDD+ climate change mitigation scheme that provides financial incentives to reduce the emissions. With this study we provide updated land use (LU)-based emission rates (104 studies, 392 N2O and 111 NO case studies), we determine the trend and magnitude of flux changes with land-use change (LUC) using a meta-analysis approach (44 studies, 135 N2O and 37 NO cases) and evaluate biophysical drivers of N2O and NO emissions and emission changes for the tropics.
   The average N2O and NO emissions in intact upland tropical forest amounted to 2.0 +/- 0.2 (n = 90) and 1.7 +/- 0.5 (n = 36) kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In agricultural soils annual N2O emissions were exponentially related to N fertilization rates and average water-filled pore space (WFPS) whereas in non-agricultural sites a Gaussian response to WFPS fit better with the observed NO and N2O emissions. The sum of soil N2O and NO fluxes and the ratio of N2O to NO increased exponentially and significantly with increasing nitrogen availability (expressed as NO3-/[NO3- + NH4+]) and WFPS, respectively; following the conceptual Hole-In-the-Pipe model. Nitrous and nitric oxide fluxes did not increase significantly overall as a result of LUC (Hedges's d of 0.11 +/- 0.11 and 0.16 +/- 0.19, respectively), however individual LUC trajectories or practices did. Nitrous oxide fluxes increased significantly after intact upland forest conversion to croplands (Hedges's d = 0.78 +/- 0.24) and NO increased significantly following the conversion of low forest cover (secondary forest younger than 30 years, woodlands, shrublands) (Hedges's d of 0.44 +/- 0.13). Forest conversion to fertilized systems significantly and highly raised both N2O and NO emission rates (Hedges's d of 1.03 +/- 0.23 and 0.52 +/- 0.09, respectively).
   Changes in nitrogen availability and WFPS were the main factors explaining changes in N2O emissions following LUC, therefore it is important that experimental designs monitor their spatio-temporal variation. Gaps in the literature on N oxide fluxes included geographical gaps (Africa, Oceania) and LU gaps (degraded forest, wetland (notably peat) forest, oil palm plantation and soy cultivation).

AB Land use and climate change are primary causes of changes in the supply of ecosystem services (ESs). Although the consequences of climate change on ecosystem properties and associated services are well documented, the cascading impacts of climate change on ESs through changes in land use are largely overlooked. We present a trait-based framework based on an empirical model to elucidate how climate change affects tradeoffs among ESs. Using alternative scenarios for mountain grasslands, we predicted how direct effects of climate change on ecosystems and indirect effects through farmers' adaptations are likely to affect ES bundles through changes in plant functional properties. ES supply was overall more sensitive to climate than to induced management change, and ES bundles remained stable across scenarios. These responses largely reflected the restricted extent of management change in this constrained system, which was incorporated when scaling up plot level climate and management effects on ecosystem properties to the entire landscape. The trait-based approach revealed how the combination of common driving traits and common responses to changed fertility determined interactions and tradeoffs among ESs.

AB The root microbiome is composed of an incredibly diverse microbial community that provides services to the plant. A major question in rhizosphere research is how species in root microbiome communities interact with each other and their host. In the nutrient mutualism between host plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), competition often leads to certain species dominating host colonization, with the outcome being dependent on environmental conditions. In the past, it has been difficult to quantify the abundance of closely related species and track competitive interactions in different regions of the rhizosphere, specifically within and outside the host. Here, we used an artificial root system (in vitro root organ cultures) to investigate intraradical (within the root) and extraradical (outside the root) competitive interactions between two closely related AMF species, Rhizophagus irregularis and Glomus aggregatum, under different phosphorus availabilities. We found that competitive interactions between AMF species reduced overall fungal abundance. R.irregularis was consistently the most abundant symbiont for both intraradical and extraradical colonization. Competition was the most intense for resources within the host, where both species negatively affected each other's abundance. We found the investment ratio (i.e. extraradical abundance/intraradical abundance) shifted for both species depending on whether competitors were present or not. Phosphorus availability did not change the outcome of these interactions. Our results suggest that studies on competitive interactions should focus on intraradical colonization dynamics and consider how changes in investment ratio are mediated by fungal species interactions.

AB Determining how ecosystem function and services are related to diversity is necessary for predicting the consequences of diversity loss and for setting goals and priorities for marine conservation. The consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functions and services depend on the level of functional redundancy - the number of species with similar ecological functional traits. Using field data on fish assemblages from 199 coral reef and lagoon sites from six islands, and on local fisheries from four islands in The Bahamas, we examined levels of functional diversity and redundancy within these assemblages and determined how fish biomass and local fisheries catches vary with local diversity. A majority of functional groups contain few species, suggesting that these assemblages have limited functional redundancy. Most also include species targeted by local fisheries, thus fishing has the potential to broadly impact food webs. Comparisons between a large marine reserve and fished reefs confirm that fishing significantly reduces functional redundancy and removes whole functional groups. Positive exponential relationships of fish biomass and fisheries catches with species and functional diversity highlight that even small declines in biodiversity may result in large reductions in secondary production and seafood provision. Taken together, these results indicate that Caribbean fish assemblages have low functional redundancy and high vulnerability of ecosystem functions and services to diversity loss, and that protection of multi-species assemblages is needed to maintain functions and services.

AB Land use and land cover (LULC) are driving forces that potentially exert pressures on water bodies, which are most commonly quantified by simply obtained aggregated data. However, this is insufficient to detect the drivers that arise from the landscape change itself. To achieve this objective one must distinguish between random and systematic transitions and identify the transitions that show strong signals of change, since these will make it possible to identify the transitions that have evolved due to population growth, industrial expansion and/or changes in land management policies. Our goal is to describe a method to characterize driving forces both from LULC and dominant LULC changes, recognizing that the presence of certain LULC classes as well as the processes of transition to other uses are both sources of stress with potential effects on the condition of water bodies. This paper first quantifies the driving forces from LULC and also from processes of LULC change for three nested regions within the Mondego river basin in 1990, 2000 and 2006. It then discusses the implications for the environmental water body condition and management policies. The fingerprint left on the landscape by some of the dominant changes found, such as urbanization and industrial expansion, is, as expected, low due to their proportion in the geographic regions under study, yet their magnitude of change and consistency reveal strong signals of change regarding the pressures acting in the system. Assessing dominant LULC changes is vital for a comprehensive study of driving forces with potential impacts on water condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological research, especially work related to conservation and resource management, increasingly involves social dimensions. Concurrently, social systems, composed of human communities that have direct cultural connections to local ecology and place, may draw upon environmental research as a component of knowledge. Such research can corroborate local and traditional ecological knowledge and empower its application. Indigenous communities and their interactions with and management of resources in their traditional territories can provide a model of such social-ecological systems. As decision-making agency is shifted increasingly to indigenous governments in Canada, abundant opportunities exist for applied ecological research at the community level. Despite this opportunity, however, current approaches by scholars to community engaged ecological research often lack a coherent framework that fosters a respectful relationship between research teams and communities. Crafted with input from applied scholars and leaders within indigenous communities in coastal British Columbia, we present here reflections on our process of academic-community engagement in three indigenous territories in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Recognizing that contexts differ among communities, we emerge with a generalizable framework to guide future efforts. Such an approach can yield effective research outcomes and emergent, reciprocal benefits such as trust, respect, and capacity among all, which help to maintain enduring relationships. Facing the present challenge of community engagement head-on by collaborative approaches can lead to effective knowledge production toward conservation, resource management, and scholarship.

AB The Deepwater Horizon oil spill led to the severe contamination of coastal environments in the Gulf of Mexico. A previous study detailed coastal saltmarsh erosion and recovery in a number of oil-impacted and nonimpacted reference sites in Barataria Bay, Louisiana over the first 18 months after the spill. Concentrations of alkanes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at oil-impacted sites significantly decreased over this time period. Here, a combination of DNA, lipid, and isotopic approaches confirm that microbial biodegradation was contributing to the observed petroleum mass loss. Natural abundance C-14 analysis of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) reveals that petroleum-derived carbon was a primary carbon source for microbial communities at impacted sites several months following oil intrusion when the highest concentrations of oil were present. Also at this time, microbial community analysis suggests that community structure of all three domains has shifted with the intrusion of oil. These results suggest that Gulf of Mexico marsh sediments have considerable biodegradation potential and that natural attenuation is playing a role in impacted sites.

AB Scaling relationships between skeletal dimensions and body mass in extant birds are often used to estimate body mass in fossil crown-group birds, as well as in stem-group avialans. However, useful statistical measurements for constraining the precision and accuracy of fossil mass estimates are rarely provided, which prevents the quantification of robust upper and lower bound body mass estimates for fossils. Here, we generate thirteen body mass correlations and associated measures of statistical robustness using a sample of 863 extant flying birds. By providing robust body mass regressions with upper- and lower-bound prediction intervals for individual skeletal elements, we address the longstanding problem of body mass estimation for highly fragmentary fossil birds. We demonstrate that the most precise proxy for estimating body mass in the overall dataset, measured both as coefficient determination of ordinary least squares regression and percent prediction error, is the maximum diameter of the coracoid's humeral articulation facet (the glenoid). We further demonstrate that this result is consistent among the majority of investigated avian orders (10 out of 18). As a result, we suggest that, in the majority of cases, this proxy may provide the most accurate estimates of body mass for volant fossil birds. Additionally, by presenting statistical measurements of body mass prediction error for thirteen different body mass regressions, this study provides a much-needed quantitative framework for the accurate estimation of body mass and associated ecological correlates in fossil birds. The application of these regressions will enhance the precision and robustness of many mass-based inferences in future paleornithological studies.

AB Understanding how disturbances interact to shape ecosystems is a key challenge in ecology. In forests of western North America, the degree to which recent bark beetle outbreaks and subsequent fires may be linked (e.g., outbreak severity affects fire severity) and/or whether these two disturbances produce compound effects on postfire succession is of widespread interest. These interactions remain unresolved, largely because field data from actual wildfires following beetle outbreaks are lacking. We studied the 2008 Gunbarrel Fire, which burned 27200 ha in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests that experienced a bark beetle outbreak 4-13 years prefire (gray stage, after trees have died and needles have dropped), to determine whether outbreak severity influenced subsequent fire severity and postfire tree regeneration. In 85 sample plots we recorded prefire stand structure and outbreak severity; multiple measures of canopy and forest-floor fire severity; and postfire tree seedling density. Prefire outbreak severity was not related to any measure of fire severity except for mean bole scorch, which declined slightly with increasing outbreak severity. Instead, fire severity varied with topography and burning conditions (proxy for weather at time of fire). Postfire Douglas-fir regeneration was low, with tree seedlings absent in 65% of plots. Tree seedlings were abundant in plots of low fire severity that also had experienced low outbreak severity (mean = 1690 seedlings/ha), suggesting a dual filter on tree regeneration. Although bark beetles and fire collectively reduced live basal area to <5% and increased snag density to >2000% of pre-outbreak levels, the lack of relationship between beetle outbreak and fire severity suggests that these disturbances were not linked. Nonetheless, effects on postfire tree regeneration suggest compound disturbance interactions that contribute to the structural heterogeneity characteristic of mid/lower montane forests.

AB Silage is green fodder conserved by lactic acid fermentation performed by epiphytic lactic acid bacteria under anaerobic conditions. To improve the ensiling process and the quality of the resulting silage, starter cultures are added to the fresh forage. A detailed analysis of the microbial community playing a role in grass ensiling has been carried out by high throughput sequencing technologies. Moreover, the influence of the inoculant Lactobacillus buchneri CD034 on the microbial community composition was studied. For this purpose, grass was ensiled untreated or inoculated with L. buchneri CD034.
   The fresh forage as well as silages after 14 and 58 days of fermentation were characterized physicochemically. Characteristic silage conditions such as increased titers of lactic acid bacteria and higher concentrations of acetic acid were observed in the inoculated silage in comparison to the untreated samples. Taxonomic community profiles deduced from 16S rDNA amplicon sequences indicated that the relative abundance of Lactococci diminished in the course of fermentations and that the proportion of bacteria belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased during the fermentation of untreated silage. In the inoculated silage, members of these phyla were repressed due to an increased abundance of Lactobacilli. In addition, metagenome analyses of silage samples confirmed taxonomic profiles based on 16S rDNA amplicons. Moreover, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactococcus lactis were found to be dominant species within silages as analyzed by means of fragment recruitments of metagenomic sequence reads on complete reference genome sequences. Fragment recruitments also provided clear evidence for the competitiveness of the inoculant strain L. buchneri CD034 during the fermentation of the inoculated silage.
   The inoculation strain was able to outcompete other community members and also affected physicochemical characteristics of the silage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Models analyzing how Southwestern plant communities will respond to climate change predict that increases in temperature will lead to upward elevational shifts of montane species. We tested this hypothesis by reexamining Robert Whittaker's 1963 plant transect in the Santa Catalina Mountains of southern Arizona, finding that this process is already well underway. Our survey, five decades after Whittaker's, reveals large changes in the elevational ranges of common montane plants, while mean annual rainfall has decreased over the past 20years, and mean annual temperatures increased 0.25 degrees C/decade from 1949 to 2011 in the Tucson Basin. Although elevational changes in species are individualistic, significant overall upward movement of the lower elevation boundaries, and elevational range contractions, have occurred. This is the first documentation of significant upward shifts of lower elevation range boundaries in Southwestern montane plant species over decadal time, confirming that previous hypotheses are correct in their prediction that mountain communities in the Southwest will be strongly impacted by warming, and that the Southwest is already experiencing a rapid vegetation change.

AB Questions Is trait convergence more intense when soil resource availability and disturbance constrain productivity and limit above-ground competition? Do the effects of productivity and disturbance on functional diversity differ between the local and metacommunity scales?
   Location Semi-arid grasslands in New Zealand (43 degrees 59S, 170 degrees 27E).
   Methods We measured trait convergence and divergence in grasslands along gradients of primary productivity and disturbance at local (i.e. 1mx1m) and metacommunity (8mx50m) scales, using long-term (27-yr) manipulations of soil resource availability and grazing intensity. We compared trait dispersion metrics to those expected under different null models.
   Results At the metacommunity scale, we found stronger trait convergence with increasing productivity and grazing intensity, where all short, slow-growing species were excluded from the potential species pool. However, once this broad-scale filter on species pool was taken into account, we found that at the local scale, abundance-weighted functional dispersion of co-occurring species was stronger than expected under our null model, thereby suggesting limiting similarity. Moreover, trait divergence became stronger at higher productivity and lower grazing intensity, where size-asymmetric competition for light is likely to have been more intense.
   Conclusions At the metacommunity scale, environmental filtering led to species with particular traits being excluded from the species pool. In contrast, at the local community scale where individuals interact, there was evidence of limiting similarity. Our results suggest that environmental filtering and limiting similarity are not mutually exclusive and jointly determine community structure, but can operate at different spatial scales.

AB Daily patterns in the foraging behaviour of birds are assumed to balance the counteracting risks of predation and starvation. Predation risks are a function of the influence of weight on flight performance and foraging behaviours that may expose individuals to predators. Although recent research sheds light on daily patterns in weight gain, little data exist on daily foraging routines in free-living birds. In order to test the predictions of various hypotheses about daily patterns of foraging, we quantified the activity of four species of passerines in winter using radio-frequency identification receivers built into supplemental feeding stations. From records of 472 368 feeder visits by tagged birds, we found that birds generally started to feed before sunrise and continued to forage at a steady to increasing rate throughout the day. Foraging in most species terminated well before sunset, suggesting their required level of energy reserves was being reached before the end of the day. These results support the risk-spreading theorem over a long-standing hypothesis predicting bimodality in foraging behaviour purportedly driven by a trade-off between the risks of starvation and predation. Given the increased energetic demands experienced by birds during colder weather, our results suggest that birds' perceptions of risk are biased towards starvation avoidance in winter.

AB Greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus (Bonaparte) currently occupy approximately half of their historical distribution across western North America. Sage-grouse are a candidate for endangered species listing due to habitat and population fragmentation coupled with inadequate regulation to control development in critical areas. Conservation planning would benefit from accurate maps delineating required habitats and movement corridors. However, developing a species distribution model that incorporates the diversity of habitats used by sage-grouse across their widespread distribution has statistical and logistical challenges. We first identified the ecological minimums limiting sage-grouse, mapped similarity to the multivariate set of minimums, and delineated connectivity across a 920,000km2 region. We partitioned a Mahalanobis D2 model of habitat use into k separate additive components each representing independent combinations of species-habitat relationships to identify the ecological minimums required by sage-grouse. We constructed the model from abiotic, land cover, and anthropogenic variables measured at leks (breeding) and surrounding areas within 5km. We evaluated model partitions using a random subset of leks and historic locations and selected D2 (k=10) for mapping a habitat similarity index (HSI). Finally, we delineated connectivity by converting the mapped HSI to a resistance surface. Sage-grouse required sagebrush-dominated landscapes containing minimal levels of human land use. Sage-grouse used relatively arid regions characterized by shallow slopes, even terrain, and low amounts of forest, grassland, and agriculture in the surrounding landscape. Most populations were interconnected although several outlying populations were isolated because of distance or lack of habitat corridors for exchange. Land management agencies currently are revising land-use plans and designating critical habitat to conserve sage-grouse and avoid endangered species listing.

AB Aim Although many studies support the prevailing paradigm of nitrogen (N)-driven biodiversity loss, some have argued that phosphorus (P) may be the main culprit. This questions the generality of the global threat through N enrichment. The major objective here was to quantify the relative importance of soil N and P in explaining patterns of plant species richness, under different levels of N and P limitation. Location North-western Europe. Methods We collected soil, productivity and plant species data from 132 semi-natural grasslands located along a gradient of nutrient availability and atmospheric N deposition. We used linear mixed models to investigate the relation between soil nutrients, acidity, limitation and productivity on one side, and indices for plant species richness on the other. Results Mixed models explained between 38 and 50% of the total variation in species numbers, forbs and endangered species. Soil P was significantly negatively related to total species number, forbs and endangered species. Soil N was only significantly negatively related to number of forbs and endangered species. Compared with soil P, the explained variation attributed to soil N was between five- and twenty-fold lower. P-limited grasslands exhibited higher species richness, numbers of forbs and endangered species. Species richness and number of forbs decreased with lower soil acidity. N deposition was negatively related to the number of forbs and endangered species, as well as to soil acidity. Productivity was weakly positively related to soil P and negatively to species and forb numbers. We found no interaction factors between the explanatory variables. Main conclusions P enrichment can present a greater threat to biodiversity than N enrichment in at least some terrestrial ecosystems. However, as N- and P-driven species loss appeared independent, our results suggest that simultaneously reducing N and P inputs is a prerequisite for maintaining maximum plant diversity.

AB Populations of widely distributed species encounter and must adapt to local environmental conditions. However, comprehensive characterization of the genetic basis of adaptation is demanding, requiring genome-wide genotype data, multiple sampled populations, and an understanding of population structure and potential selection pressures. Here, we used single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and data on numerous environmental variables to describe the genetic basis of local adaptation in 21 populations of teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize. We found complex hierarchical genetic structure created by altitude, dispersal events, and admixture among subspecies, which complicated identification of locally beneficial alleles. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium revealed four large putative inversion polymorphisms showing clinal patterns of frequency. Population differentiation and environmental correlations suggest that both inversions and intergenic polymorphisms are involved in local adaptation.

AB The effects of black-locust invasion on plant forest diversity are still poorly investigated. Vascular plants are likely to be influenced by increasing nutrient availability associated with the nitrogen-fixing activity of black-locust, whereas it is not clear if, along with stand aging, black-locust formations regain forest species. The main aim of the present study was to test whether the increase of black-locust stand age promoted a plant variation in mature stands leading to assemblages similar to those of native forests. Therefore, plant richness and composition of stands dominated by native trees were compared with pure black-locust stands of different successional stages. Our study confirmed that the replacement of native forests by pure black-locust stands causes both plant richness loss and shifts in species composition. In black-locust stands plant communities are dominated by nitrophilous species and lack many of the oligothrophic and acidophilus species typical of native forests. Plant communities of native forests are more diverse with respect to pure black-locust stands, suggesting that black-locust invasion also causes a homogenization of the plant forest biota. We did not detect differences across the successional gradient of black-locust stands, and mature stands do not recover the diversity of plant species which are lost by the replacement of the native forests by black-locust. Accordingly some efforts in reducing the negative impacts of black-locust invasion on plant forest biota should be focused at least in those areas where conservation is among management priorities, such in the case of habitats included in the Habitat Directive (92/43 ECE).

AB The distribution and abundance of plant species are intimately related to their reproductive success, which in turn is affected by a large number of environmental variables. Yet, reproductive success is rarely taken into account in species distribution models (SDMs). In this paper we examine the extent to which consideration of the reproduction niche and its relationship with temperature could improve SDMs. We review the literature on plant reproductive responses to temperature and the influence of these relationships on species range delimitation. We define the reproduction niche and discuss how temperature influences several stages of the reproductive process. Furthermore, we review examples that illustrate how the reproduction niche influences species distributions and discuss how aspects of the reproduction niche could be considered in SDMs. We show that the reproduction niche fundamentally influences species distributions and that in principle it is easy to include aspects of the reproduction niche in SDMs, although sufficient data are only available for a restricted number of species. Bayesian methods and inverse parameterization may be the most efficient way to use existing data.

AB The literature on speciation has expanded dramatically in recent years, catalyzed by the emergence of new conceptual frameworks, new theoretical approaches, and new methods for characterizing pattern and inferring process. As a consequence, the language used to describe the speciation process has become more complex. Increasing complexity may be an accurate reflection of current thinking with respect to how phenotypic differences limit gene flow, how selection results in the evolution of reproductive isolation, and genetic changes that contribute to speciation. However, increased language complexity has come at a cost; old definitions have been reconfigured and new terms have been introduced. In some instances, the introduction of new terminology has failed to recognize historical usage, leading to unnecessary ambiguity and redundancy. Although the writings of Mayr and Dobzhansky remain a reference point in the language of speciation, the last decades of the 20th century saw substantial changes in our thinking about the speciation process. During that period, the language of speciation remained relatively stable. In contrast, the first decade of the 21st century has witnessed a remarkable expansion of the language of speciation. Here, the origin and evolution of ideas about speciation are viewed through the lens of changing language use.

AB Indian Himalayan basins are earmarked for widespread dam building, but aggregate effects of these dams on terrestrial ecosystems are unknown. We mapped distribution of 292 dams (under construction and proposed) and projected effects of these dams on terrestrial ecosystems under different scenarios of land-cover loss. We analyzed land-cover data of the Himalayan valleys, where dams are located. We estimated dam density on fifth-through seventh-order rivers and compared these estimates with current global figures. We used a species-area relation model (SAR) to predict short-and long-term species extinctions driven by deforestation. We used scatter plots and correlation studies to analyze distribution patterns of species and dams and to reveal potential overlap between species-rich areas and dam sites. We investigated effects of disturbance on community structure of undisturbed forests. Nearly 90% of Indian Himalayan valleys would be affected by dam building and 27% of these dams would affect dense forests. Our model projected that 54,117 ha of forests would be submerged and 114,361 ha would be damaged by dam-related activities. A dam density of 0.3247/1000 km(2) would be nearly 62 times greater than current average global figures; the average of 1 dam for every 32 km of river channel would be 1.5 times higher than figures reported for U. S. rivers. Our results show that most dams would be located in species-rich areas of the Himalaya. The SAR model projected that by 2025, deforestation due to dam building would likely result in extinction of 22 angiosperm and 7 vertebrate taxa. Disturbance due to dam building would likely reduce tree species richness by 35%, tree density by 42%, and tree basal cover by 30% in dense forests. These results, combined with relatively weak national environmental impact assessment and implementation, point toward significant loss of species if all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed.

AB The effect of the textural properties of a series of commercial carbon molecular sieves (CMS), prepared from different polymeric precursors, on their ability for CO2 adsorption at different temperatures has been studied. The adsorbents have been characterized by N-2 and CO2 adsorption at 77 and 273 K, respectively, together with measurements of immersion calorimetry into liquids of different molecular dimensions. The studied CMSs cover a wide range of porosity, from purely microporous carbons to samples containing wide micropores as well as a certain proportion of mesoporosity. Studies of CO2 adsorption, at atmospheric pressure (1 bar) and three different temperatures (273, 298 and 323 K), have shown that a high CO2 adsorption capacity requires the presence of a well-developed microporosity, as well as a high volume of narrow micropores. On the other hand, narrow micropores seem to be the key factor leading to a maximum capacity of CO2 adsorption, even at temperatures close to that of anthropogenic emissions of CO2.

AB Drylands are the largest terrestrial biome on Earth and a ubiquitous feature is desert pavement terrain, comprising rocks embedded in the mineral soil surface. Quartz and other translucent rocks are common and microbial communities termed hypoliths develop as biofilms on their ventral surfaces. In extreme deserts these represent major concentrations of biomass, and are emerging as key to geobiological processes and soil stabilization. These highly specialized communities are dominated by cyanobacteria that support diverse heterotrophic assemblages. Here we identify global-scale trends in the ecology of hypoliths that are strongly related to climate, particularly with regard to shifts in cyanobacterial assemblages. A synthesis of available data revealed a linear trend for colonization with regard to climate, and we suggest potential application for hypoliths as biomarkers of aridity on a landscape scale. The potential to exploit the soil-stabilizing properties of hypolithic colonization in environmental engineering on dryland soils is also discussed.

AB Habitat destruction and land use change are among the anthropogenic influences affecting many ecosystems. After environmental degradation, restoration and reclamation efforts can be hampered by poor physio-chemical soil characteristics and reduced soil community complexity. To enhance degraded system recovery, soil manipulations may be necessary to alleviate habitat destruction. This review will (1) discuss grassland restoration in terms of ecosystem-level processes, and (2) analyze the efficacy of novel and easily applicable amendments (i.e. compost, biochar, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) to facilitate grassland recovery in severely degraded habitats. We suggest that restoration practitioners emphasize soil ecological knowledge and microbial processes in tandem with native plants when restoring damaged ecosystems. This review is intended to guide practitioners in the promotion of grassland ecosystem sustainability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite increasing interest, animal personality is still a puzzling phenomenon. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain intraindividual consistency and interindividual variation in behaviour, which have been primarily supported by qualitative data and simulations. Using an empirical approach, I tested predictions of one main life-history hypothesis, which posits that consistent individual differences in behaviour are favoured by a trade-off between current and future reproduction. Data on life-history were collected for individuals of a natural population of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Using open-field and novel-object tests, I quantified variation in activity, exploration and boldness for 117 individuals over 3 years. I found systematic variation in boldness between individuals of different residual reproductive value. Young males with low current but high expected future fitness were less bold than older males with high current fecundity, and males might increase in boldness with age. Females have low variation in assets and in boldness with age. Body condition was not related to boldness and only explained marginal variation in exploration. Overall, these data indicate that a trade-off between current and future reproduction might maintain personality variation in mouse lemurs, and thus provide empirical support of this life-history trade-off hypothesis.

AB Night-time stomatal conductance (g(night)) occurs in many ecosystems, but the g(night) response to environmental drivers is relatively unknown, especially in deserts.
   Here, we conducted a Bayesian analysis of stomatal conductance (g) (N = 5013) from 16 species in the Sonoran, Chihuahuan, Mojave and Great Basin Deserts (North America). We partitioned daytime g (g(day)) and g(night) responses by describing g as a mixture of two extreme (dark vs high light) behaviors.
   Significant g(night) was observed across 15 species, and the g(night) and g(day) behavior differed according to species, functional type and desert. The transition between extreme behaviors was determined by light environment, with the transition behavior differing between functional types and deserts. Sonoran and Chihuahuan C-4 grasses were more sensitive to vapor pressure difference (D) at night and soil water potential (Psi(soil)) during the day, Great Basin C-3 shrubs were highly sensitive to D and Psi(soil) during the day, and Mojave C-3 shrubs were equally sensitive to D and Psi(soil) during the day and night.
   Species were split between the exhibition of isohydric or anisohydric behavior during the day. Three species switched from anisohydric to isohydric behavior at night. Such behavior, combined with differential D, Psi(soil) and light responses, suggests that different mechanisms underlie g(day) and g(night) regulation.

AB The eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast is characterized by numerous shallow (2-5 m) estuarine lagoons, fed by streams and small rivers that drain northward from the Brooks Range through the arctic coastal plain, and bounded seaward by barrier islands and shoals. Millions of birds from six continents nest and forage during the summer period in this region using the river deltas, lagoons, and shoreline along with several species of anadromous and marine fish. We examined biogeochemical processes linking the benthic community to the overall food web structure of these poorly studied but pristine estuaries, which are largely covered by 1.8 m of ice for 10 months annually. In summer, these lagoons are relatively warm with brackish salinities (5-10A degrees C, S = 10-25) compared to more open coastal waters (0-5A degrees C, S > 27). The stable isotopic composition of organic materials in sediments (i.e., benthic particulate organic matter) and water column suspended particulate organic matter from both streams and lagoons are largely indistinguishable and reflect strong terrestrial contributions, based upon delta C-13 and delta N-15 values (-25.6aEuro degrees to -27.4aEuro degrees and 1.4aEuro degrees to 3.3aEuro degrees, respectively). By comparison, shifts toward more heavy isotope-enriched organic materials reflecting marine influence are observed on the adjacent coastal shelf (-24.8aEuro degrees to -25.4aEuro degrees and 3.4aEuro degrees to 5.3aEuro degrees, respectively). The isotopic composition of lagoon fauna is consistent with a food web dominated by omnivorous detritovores strongly dependent on microbial processing of terrestrial sources of carbon. Biomagnification of N-15 in benthic organisms indicate that the benthic food web in lagoons support up to four trophic levels, with carnivorous gastropod predators and benthic fishes (delta N-15 values up to 14.4aEuro degrees) at the apex.

AB Chromosomal inversions allow genetic divergence of locally adapted populations by reducing recombination between chromosomes with different arrangements. Divergence between populations ( or hybridization between species) is expected to leave signatures in the neutral genetic diversity of the inverted region. Quantitative expectations for these patterns, however, have not been obtained. Here, we develop coalescent models of neutral sites linked to an inversion polymorphism in two locally adapted populations. We consider two scenarios of local adaptation: selection on the inversion breakpoints and selection on alleles inside the inversion. We find that ancient inversion polymorphisms cause genetic diversity to depart dramatically from neutral expectations. Other situations, however, lead to patterns that may be difficult to detect; important determinants are the age of the inversion and the rate of gene flux between arrangements. We also study inversions under genetic drift, finding that they produce patterns similar to locally adapted inversions of intermediate age. Our results are consistent with empirical observations, and provide the foundation for quantitative analyses of the roles that inversions have played in speciation.

AB Rhizosphere samples were taken from herbaceous plants along an altitudinal gradient on Segrila Mountain slope. Root colonization and spore biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from different altitudes were analyzed. Of the 146 plant species representing 45 families investigated, 72.2% of plant species were colonized by AMF and formed typical AM structures. A broad range of AM fungal taxa, 62 taxa representing all 4 orders of AMF were isolated from the soil. The composition of the AMF spore community was quite different at different positions along the elevation gradient. Some AM fungi, such as Scutellospora, preferred some specific elevations, or a range of elevation. Intensity of root colonization (M%) and spore density were negatively correlated with the altitude of the study sites. Species richness showed a decreasing trend with increasing elevation but the Shannon-Weiner index was unaffected by elevation. Isolate frequency and relative abundance of AMF also showed quite different distribution patterns among taxonomic families. The drivers of these changes in the AM fungal assemblages is not known and cannot be determined conclusively using such a comparative study along an environmental gradient. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Recent studies in the Northern Hemisphere have shown that songbirds living in noisy urban environments sing at higher frequencies than their rural counterparts. However, several aspects of this phenomenon remain poorly understood. These include the geographical scale over which such patterns occur (most studies have compared local populations), and whether they involve phenotypic plasticity or microevolutionary change. We conducted a field study of silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) vocalizations over more than 1 million km 2 of urban and rural south-eastern Australia, and compared possible effects of urban noise on songs (which are learned) and contact calls (which are innate). Across 14 paired urban and rural populations, silvereyes consistently sang both songs and contact calls at higher frequencies in urban environments. Syllable rate (syllables per second) decreased in urban environments, consistent with the hypothesis that reflective structures degrade song and encourage longer intervals between syllables. This comprehensive study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate varied adaptations of urban bird vocalizations over a vast geographical area, and to provide insight into the mechanism responsible for these changes.

AB Models of diffusion-driven pattern formation that rely on the Turing mechanism are utilized in many areas of science. However, many such models suffer from the defect of requiring fine tuning of parameters or an unrealistic separation of scales in the diffusivities of the constituents of the system in order to predict the formation of spatial patterns. In the context of a very generic model of ecological pattern formation, we show that the inclusion of intrinsic noise in Turing models leads to the formation of "quasipatterns" that form in generic regions of parameter space and are experimentally distinguishable from standard Turing patterns. The existence of quasipatterns removes the need for unphysical fine tuning or separation of scales in the application of Turing models to real systems.

AB Rapid expansion of coastal anthropogenic development means that critical foraging and developmental habitats often occur near highly polluted and urbanized environments. Although coastal contamination is widespread, the impact this has on long-lived vertebrates like the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is unclear because traditional experimental methods cannot be applied. We coupled minimally invasive sampling techniques with health assessments to quantify contaminant patterns in a population of green turtles resident to San Diego Bay, CA, a highly urbanized and contaminated estuary. Several chemicals were correlated with turtle size, suggesting possible differences in physiological processes or habitat utilization between life stages. With the exception of mercury, higher concentrations of carapace metals as well as 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and gamma chlordane in blood plasma relative to other sea turtle studies raises important questions about the chemical risks to turtles resident to San Diego Bay. Mercury concentrations exceeded immune function no-effects thresholds and increased carapace metal loads were correlated with higher levels of multiple health markers. These results indicate immunological and physiological effects studies are needed in this population. Our results give insight into the potential conservation risk contaminants pose to sea turtles inhabiting this contaminated coastal habitat, and highlight the need to better manage and mitigate contaminant exposure in San Diego Bay.

AB Aim
   The term relict refers to a formerly widespread species currently occurring in refugia that provide a persistent combination of specific ecological conditions. In peatlands, direct palaeoecological evidence of relict status exists for some plant species and, in the case of calcareous sediments, for some snail species. We tested whether some species are significantly linked to old calcareous fens at the millennial scale independent of the effect of recent fen area. We focused on three organism groups - vascular plants, bryophytes and land snails - that differ in the degree of preservation of their remains in calcareous fen sediments and in their dispersal ability.
   Location
   Western Carpathians (Slovakia and the Czech Republic).
   Methods
   The sample sites comprised 47 well-preserved calcareous fens, from which we compiled complete recent species lists, measured the area and analysed radiocarbon-dated samples from the deepest sediment and from the beginning of complete deforestation, as indicated by plant and snail fossils. Using the species co-occurrences in large data sets, we identified calcareous fen specialists and compared their recent distribution patterns against a null model that controlled for the effect of fen area.
   Results
   Two land snail species, eleven vascular plant species and no bryophyte species have statistically significant affinities with old fens, independent of the effect of recent fen area. For one bryophyte and one snail, the effects of age and area are not distinguishable.
   Main conclusions
   The results for land snails, being abundantly preserved and easily determinable in calcareous fen deposits, are in full accordance with the direct macrofossil evidence. This suggests that our approach indirectly revealed a relict distribution of the species. Identification of species that are significantly linked to ancient localities at the millennial scale has great potential in palaeoecology for the detection of stands with old sediments, and in nature conservation as a tool for the identification of long-term-persisting rare species that infrequently colonize young sites and thus deserve priority in the protection of their habitats. From a theoretical perspective, limited dispersal from old to new localities of the same habitat can contribute to spatial effects in biotic assemblages, even at relatively fine scales.

AB Urban environments can modify the local climate and are net CO2 emitters, both of which can affect the life of an increasing proportion of the world's population that lives in and around cities. Observational information on the seasonal and diurnal variations of CO2 fluxes (F-CO2) as well as on the contribution from the different CO2 sources and sinks is needed at fine spatial resolution to help develop and validate weather prediction and atmospheric dispersion models. This study reports on F-CO2 measured using the eddy covariance technique for a two-year period over a suburban and an urban residential area as well as a reference agricultural site located in the Montreal region, which experiences cold winters and warm summers. The seasonal and diurnal variability of F-CO2 and its response to incoming light and to air temperature was analysed. Typical weekday and weekend vehicular traffic CO2 emissions (E-VT) were estimated from inventory data for both residential sites. The urban site was a net source of CO2 throughout the entire measurement period on the order of 200 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). The suburban site was a winter source and a summer daytime sink of CO2 resulting in a net source of 50 t CO2 ha(-1) y(-1).Lower emissions at the suburban site are attributed to the large biological uptake in summer and to its low anthropogenic emissions. Higher emissions at the urban site are partly associated with its greater population and building density, promoting higher emissions from vehicular traffic and heating fuel combustion. The cold climate induced increased heating fuel combustion as compared to cities under a warmer climate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chromosomal inversions disrupt recombination in heterozygotes by both reducing crossing-over within inverted regions and increasing it elsewhere in the genome. The reduction of recombination in inverted regions facilitates the maintenance of hybridizing species, as outlined by various models of chromosomal speciation. We present a comprehensive comparison of the effects of inversions on recombination rates and on nucleotide divergence. Within an inversion differentiating Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis, we detected one double recombinant among 9,739 progeny from F-1 hybrids screened, consistent with published double-crossover frequencies observed within species. Despite similar rates of exchange within and between species, we found no sequence-based evidence of ongoing gene exchange between species within this inversion, but significant exchange was inferred within species. We also observed greater differentiation at regions near inversion breakpoints between species versus within species. Moreover, we observed strong "interchromosomal effect" (higher recombination in inversion heterozygotes between species) with up to 9-fold higher recombination rates along collinear segments of chromosome two in hybrids. Further, we observed that regions most susceptible to changes in recombination rates corresponded to regions with lower recombination rates in homokaryotypes. Finally, we showed that interspecies nucleotide divergence is lower in regions with greater increases in recombination rate, potentially resulting from greater interspecies exchange. Overall, we have identified several similarities and differences between inversions segregating within versus between species in their effects on recombination and divergence. We conclude that these differences are most likely due to lower frequency of heterokaryotypes and to fitness consequences from the accumulation of various incompatibilities between species. Additionally, we have identified possible effects of inversions on interspecies gene exchange that had not been considered previously.

AB Fisheries-induced evolution has been hypothesized to delay the recovery of collapsed fish stocks through effects on their productivity. The cod stock in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (SGSL) collapsed in the early 1990s and has shown no recovery since then, due mainly to high natural mortality of adult cod. Age and size at maturation of SGSL cod decreased sharply over time in cohorts produced in the 1950s and 1960s, likely reflecting an evolutionary response to intensified fishing, and have remained low since then, despite severe reductions in fishing mortality over the past 15 years. A predicted consequence of early maturation is increased natural mortality due to higher costs to reproduction. Early maturation may be a cause of increases in natural mortality of SGSL cod in the 1970s but does not appear to be related to the much larger increases since then. Instead, the current high natural mortality of SGSL cod appears to be primarily a cause, rather than a consequence, of the continued early maturation in this population, now replacing fishing mortality as the agent of selection favouring early maturity. This striking example of the failure to reverse fisheries-induced evolution by relaxing fishing pressure emphasizes the need for management strategies that minimize the chances of harvest-induced genetic change.

AB This paper reviews the primary effects of canopy on understorey vegetation to provide insight into the management of the canopy space to benefit tree regeneration. Site conditions, like nutrient and water availability, overstorey conditions, e.g. tree species, and canopy density, are important determinants of ground vegetation. An investigation of canopy effects is concerned about how the canopy trees modify site conditions. As canopy density may be deliberately modified during regeneration treatments, the effect of canopy density on individual species in the herbaceous layer and tree regeneration is important. This autecological perspective focuses on the successional traits of species to help understand species differences in fecundity, survival, density and growth. From a synecological perspective, the importance of successional traits for the outcome of competition between species arising from differences in canopy densities is highlighted. This review shows that moderately dense canopies may favour tree regeneration over aggressive shade-intolerant graminoids or forbs. This is particularly true for shade-tolerant and intermediate shade-tolerant tree species. To better understand and utilise this phenomenon, research should try to identify and isolate different canopy effects.

AB The concept of "ecological traps'' was introduced over three decades ago. An ecological trap occurs when, by various mechanisms, low-quality (yielding low fitness) habitat is more attractive than good habitat, thus coaxing individuals to settle there despite a resultant loss of fitness. Empirical work on such traps has increased dramatically in the past decade, but the converse-avoidance of high-quality habitat because it is less attractive, what we term a "perceptual trap''-has remained largely unexplored. Even so, depending on conditions (growth rate, strength of habitat preference, and mortality rate), such perceptual traps can be more limiting than ecological traps to population persistence. An example from field experiments with the Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) lends empirical support to the concept, and several other potential examples suggest that these traps are perhaps more prevalent than has been appreciated. Because demographic Allee effects are expected to prevent a population from growing sufficiently in a habitat that is avoided, a perceptual trap may persist even though fitness is high. Unlike an ecological trap, which may be negated by increasing habitat quality, biologists will be hard pressed to negate a perceptual trap, which will require determining which cues an animal uses to select high-quality habitat and then devising a means of enhancing those cues so that an animal is lured into the habitat.

AB A diverse soil microbial community is involved in nitrogen cycling, and these microbes can be affected by land management practices and weed invasion. We surveyed 20 woodlands with a history of livestock grazing, with livestock recently excluded from 10 sites. We investigated whether soil nutrients were lower when grazing was excluded and higher when exotic grasses dominated the understory. Second, using quantitative real-time PCR, we investigated whether microbial nitrogen functional gene (NFG) abundance was altered with soil nutrient enrichment, livestock exclusion, and exotic grass invasion. The target genes were chiA (decomposition-ammonification), nifH (nitrogen fixation), nirK and narG (denitrification), and bacterial amoA (nitrification). Woodland soils were enriched in phosphorus and nitrogen compared to reference condition sites, but soil nutrients were not lower following livestock exclusion. Total nitrogen and nifH were negatively correlated in grazed woodlands, suggesting that aboveground herbivory reduces the capacity for belowground nitrogen fixation. Woodlands dominated by exotic grasses had higher levels of nitrate, narG, and nirK than those dominated by native grasses. We hypothesize that the increase in potential for denitrification was due to increases in soil nitrate, rather than changes in plant composition. Overall, soil physicochemistry explained more variation in NFG abundance than livestock presence or plant invasion, particularly for chiA and bacterial amoA, with significant relationships between the abundance of all five NFGs and total nitrogen or nitrate. All woodlands investigated had a history of anthropogenic disturbance and nutrification, and soil nutrient levels and the abundance of NFGs are likely to be related to long-term land management practices.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are of great environmental concern due to bioaccumulation in different food chains. Trophodynamics of PBDEs in freshwater food chain is an important criterion for assessing their ecological risk. In the study. PBDEs were analyzed in sixteen aquatic species collected from Baiyangdian Lake, North China. The concentrations of nine PBDE congeners (BDE-28, -47, -66, -99, -100, -85, -153, -154, and -183) in aquatic organisms ranged from 3.4 to 160.2 ng/g lipid weight. BDE-47 was the predominant PBDE congener in most samples except for river snails and swan mussels. BDE-209 was detected in 50% of biota samples, which indicated the bioavailability of BDE209. Correlation between lipid-normalized concentrations of PBDEs and trophic levels determined by stable isotope nitrogen technologies confirmed that PBDEs were biomagnified in the freshwater food chain. The trophic magnification factors (TMFs) ranged from 1.3 to 2.1 for PBDE congeners, greater than one, indicating the biomagnification potential for the PBDE congeners in the freshwater food chain. The relationship between TMFs and Log K-ow (octanol-water partition coefficient) indicated that the phenomenon of trophic magnification for lowly brominated congeners was obvious in the freshwater food chain.

AB I evaluate ecological, evolutionary, and historical influences of tectonics and topography on the regional diversity of terrestrial mammals, focusing on the hypothesis that diversification rates are higher in active versus passive tectonic settings. Ten predictions follow from this hypothesis. 1) The timing of peaks in speciation should be congruent with the timescale for tectonic episodes. 2) The rates of speciation and genetic differentiation of populations should be greater for species inhabiting topographically complex regions than spatially continuous landscapes. 3) If topographic complexity per se promotes diversification, then a cluster of young divergences should occur for montane species compared to lowland relatives. 4) Endemism in tectonically active regions should reflect origination within the region rather than range reduction from larger areas. 5) Extinction rates should differ for lineages in tectonically active regions compared to adjacent lowlands. 6) The relationship between local and regional species richness should differ between topographic settings because of higher beta diversity in topographically complex regions. 7) Species originating in topographically complex regions should colonize adjacent lowlands more often than the reverse pattern. 8) North-south mountain ranges should have higher regional species richness than east-west mountain ranges. 9) Areas with multiple mountain ranges should have higher regional species richness than comparable areas with single mountain ranges. 10) Global climate changes should affect diversification in tectonically active regions. Research addressing these topics places elevational diversity gradients into a geohistorical context and integrates data from modern biotas and the fossil record.

AB Birds are responding to recent climate change in a variety of ways including shifting their geographic ranges to cooler climates. There is evidence that northern-temperate birds have shifted their breeding and non-breeding ranges to higher latitudes, and tropical birds have shifted their breeding ranges to higher altitudes. There is further evidence these shifts have affected migration strategies and the composition and structure of communities. Projections based on correlative distributional models suggest many birds will experience substantial pressures under climate change, resulting in range contraction and shifts. Inherent limitations of correlative models, however, make it difficult to develop reliable projections and detailed inference. Incorporating a mechanistic perspective into species distribution models enriches the quality of model inferences but also severely narrows the taxonomic and geographic relevance. Mechanistic distributional models have seen increased applications, but so far primarily in ectotherms. We argue that further development of similar models in birds would complement existing empirical knowledge and theoretical projections. The considerable data already available on birds offer an exciting basis. In particular, information compiled on flight performance and thermal associations across life history stages could be linked to distributional limits and dispersal abilities, which could be used to develop more robust and detailed projections. Yet, only a broadening of taxonomic scale, specifically to appropriately represented tropical diversity, will allow for truly general inference and require the continued use of correlative approaches that may take on increasingly mechanistic components. The trade-off between detail and scale is likely to characterize the future of global change biodiversity research, and birds may be an excellent group to improve, integrate and geographically extend current approaches.

AB Questions: Do evolutionary changes in phenotypic plasticity occur after anthropogenic disturbance? Do these changes tend to be increases or decreases in plasticity? How do these evolutionary patterns differ among taxa and trait types? Does evolution of plasticity change with time since the disturbance?
   Data incorporated: Evolutionary rates for plasticity estimated from 20 studies that have compared a plastic response in two or more populations, at least one of which had experienced an anthropogenic disturbance in nature and at least one of which had not.
   Method of analysis: We estimate evolutionary rates (darwins and haldanes) for plasticity for each study, which represent the amount of evolutionary change in plasticity. We then perform analyses of covariance, with the evolutionary rate numerator (amount of evolutionary change) as a response variable, taxa and trait type as predictor variables, and the amount of evolutionary time as a covariate.
   Conclusions: We find that plasticity has evolved in several cases, including both increases and decreases in the levels of plasticity following anthropogenic disturbances. The typical direction of this evolutionary response depends on an interaction between taxon and trait type. For instance, invertebrates sometimes show the evolution of increased plasticity for life-history traits, but the evolution of decreased plasticity for morphological traits. Plants, on the other hand, show no trends in the direction of plasticity evolution.

AB The accelerating decrease of Arctic sea ice substantially changes the growth conditions for primary producers, particularly with respect to light. This affects the biochemical composition of sea ice algae, which are an essential high-quality food source for herbivores early in the season. Their high nutritional value is related to their content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which play an important role for successful maturation, egg production, hatching and nauplii development in grazers. We followed the fatty acid composition of an assemblage of sea ice algae in a high Arctic fjord during spring from the early bloom stage to post bloom. Light conditions proved to be decisive in determining the nutritional quality of sea ice algae, and irradiance was negatively correlated with the relative amount of PUFAs. Algal PUFA content decreased on average by 40% from April to June, while algal biomass (measured as particulate carbon, C) did not differ. This decrease was even more pronounced when algae were exposed to higher irradiances due to reduced snow cover. The ratio of chlorophyll a (chl a) to C, as well as the level of photoprotective pigments, confirmed a physiological adaptation to higher light levels in algae of poorer nutritional quality. We conclude that high irradiances are detrimental to sea ice algal food quality, and that the biochemical composition of sea ice algae is strongly dependent on growth conditions.

DT Article

   inverse modelling; ecosystem model; CCAMLR
AB A quantitative food web of the Ross Sea is presented here as a step towards investigating ecosystem effects of the fishery for Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni). The model consolidates quantitative information on trophic links across all the major biota of the Ross Sea and tests for data consistency. The model has 38 trophic groups and is balanced in terms of annual flows of organic carbon in an average recent year (1990-2000). The focus of the model is on the role of Antarctic toothfish in the food web which means that the model has greater taxonomic resolution towards the top of the food web than the base. A survey of the available literature and both published and unpublished data provided an initial set of parameters describing the annual average abundance, imports, exports, energetics (growth, reproduction, consumption) and trophic linkages (diets, key predators) for each model group. The relative level of uncertainty on these parameters was also estimated. This set of parameters was not self consistent, and a method is described to adjust the initial parameter set to give a balanced model, taking into account the estimates of parameter uncertainty and the large range of magnitude (>6 orders of magnitude) in trophic flows between groups. Parameters for biomass, production rate, growth efficiency, diet fractions and other transfers of biomass between groups were adjusted simultaneously. It was found that changes to the initial set of parameters needed to obtain balance were reasonably small for most groups and most parameters. The mean absolute change for all key parameters (biomass, production rate, growth efficiency) and all groups together was 1.7%, and for diet fractions was 0.6%. Large but not implausible changes in biomass, production/biomass and production/consumption parameters were needed to balance the microzooplankton (34-47%), ice bacteria (61-72%), and ice protozoa (24-54%), components of the model. Trophic levels are in close agreement: with those derived from isotope and other ecosystems. In the balanced model, there is only enough large (>100 cm) toothfish production to satisfy 6.5% of the diet of Weddell seals, 5.6% of the diet of orca and 2.6% of the diet of sperm whales. The model does not support the hypothesis that depletion of Antarctic toothfish by fishing would change the diet of predators of tooth fish (Weddell seals, orca, sperm whales) by large amounts throughout the Ross Sea, though the importance of toothfish as prey items to these predators is not tested and requires further investigation. The model shows that large toothfish consume 61% of the annual production of medium-sized demersal fishes and 14% of the annual production of small demersal fishes, implying a potential for the fishery to affect these prey through trophic cascades. There is a need to establish monitoring of medium and small demersal fishes in the Ross Sea, and to model potential changes to these groups due to the fishery.

AB Changes in land use and management have been strongly affecting mountain grassland, however, their effects on the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and its components have not yet been well documented. We analysed chamber-based estimates of NEE, gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and light use efficiency (LUE) of six mountain grasslands differing in land use and management, and thus site fertility, for the growing seasons of 2002 to 2008. The main findings of the study are that: (1) land use and management affected seasonal NEE, GPP and R, which all decreased from managed to unmanaged grasslands; (2) these changes were explained by differences in leaf area index (LAI), biomass and leaf-area-independent changes that were likely related to photosynthetic physiology; (3) diurnal variations of NEE were primarily controlled by photosynthetically active photon flux density and soil and air temperature; seasonal variations were associated with changes in LAI; (4) parameters of light response curves were generally closely related to each other, and the ratio of R at a reference temperature/ maximum GPP was nearly constant across the sites; (5) similarly to our study, maximum GPP and R for other grasslands on the globe decreased with decreasing land use intensity, while their ratio remained remarkably constant. We conclude that decreasing intensity of management and, in particular, abandonment of mountain grassland lead to a decrease in NEE and its component processes. While GPP and R are generally closely coupled during most of the growing season, GPP is more immediately and strongly affected by land management (mowing, grazing) and season. This suggests that management and growing season length, as well as their possible future changes, may play an important role for the annual C balance of mountain grassland.

AB Changes in food web dynamics and ocean productivity over the past 4500 years are investigated using stable isotope analysis of nitrogen and carbon in collagen from animal bones preserved in coastal archeological middens on Sanak Island, along the eastern edge of the Aleutian archipelgo. Samples included Steller sea lions, Harbor seals, Northern fur seals, sea otters, Pacific cod and sockeye salmon. Sea otters had the highest delta C-13 (-11.9 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) and lowest delta N-15 values (14.5 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand), Northern fur seals had the lowest delta C-13 values (-13.6 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand), and Steller sea lions had the highest delta N-15 values (18.4 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand) of the marine mammals. Cod isotope values were consistent with those of demersal organisms from near shore habitats (-12.5 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand delta C-13, 16.1 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand delta N-15), while salmon values were consistent with those of organisms existing in an open ocean habitat and at a lower trophic level (-15.2 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand d13C, 11.5 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand delta N-15). When comparing six different prehistoric time periods, two time periods had significantly different delta C-13 for salmon. Otters had significantly different delta N-15 values in two out of the six prehistoric time periods but no differences in delta C-13. The mean delta C-13, corrected for the oceanic Suess Effect, of modern specimens of all species (except Northern fur seals) were significantly lower than prehistoric animals. Several hypotheses are explored to explain these differences including a reduction in productivity during the twentieth century in this region of the Gulf of Alaska. If true, this suggests that North Pacific climate regimes experienced during the twentieth century may not be good analogs of North Pacific marine ecosystems during the late Holocene.

AB Species selected as flagships to promote conservation activities around the world are typically well known and charismatic mega-fauna. Unfortunately this limits the scope for applying the concept as some critical areas for biodiversity conservation, such as tropical islands, lack such species. In this study, we explore the potential to apply the concept of 'tourism flagship species' to tropical island birds of the Seychelles, an archipelago of considerable importance for conservation that is highly dependent on international tourism. In particular we wish to identify which species attributes are most influential with regard to their potential for fundraising among international tourists. Using a choice experiment approach and using state-of-the-art econometric methods, we found that conservation attributes and physical appearance of the bird species are both important in terms of raising funds for conservation. Nevertheless, conservation attributes ranked higher in the respondents preferences. Our results suggest that there is considerable potential for a variety of species to effectively act as flagships in developing nations that are dependent on international tourism and rich in biodiversity but lack charismatic fauna.

AB Aim
   Palaeontologial data suggest that all temperate forest species in northern China migrated southwards during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and recolonized post-glacially within the Holocene. We tested this assumption using phylogeographical studies of a temperate deciduous shrub species (Ostryopsis davidiana Decne., Betulaceae), which has a wide distribution in northern China.
   Location
   Northern China.
   Methods
   We sequenced two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments (trnL-trnF and psbA-trnH, together about 1300 bp in length) of 294 plants from 21 populations across the total distribution range of this species. We used maximum parsimony and haplotype network methods to construct phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes.
   Results
   The analysis of cpDNA variation identified eight haplotypes. A single haplotype was fixed in all populations except for one population that was polymorphic, having two haplotypes. The population subdivisions were extremely high (G(ST) = 0.972 and N-ST = 0.974), suggesting very low gene flow between populations. Haplotypes clustered into two tentative clades, both of which occur in the southern region of the species' range but only one of which occurs in the northern region. Across the sampled populations, the haplotype distributions were differentiated geographically.
   Main conclusions
   Our analyses suggest that multiple refugia were maintained across the range of O. davidiana in both northern (north of the Qing Mountains) and southern (south of the Qing Mountains) regions during the LGM rather than that the species survived only in the south and subsequently colonized northwards. The extremely low within-population diversity of this species suggests strong bottleneck or founder effects within each fragmented region during the Quaternary climatic oscillations. These findings provide important clues for understanding range shifts and changes in within- and/or between-population genetic diversity of temperate forests in response to past climatic oscillations in northern China.

AB Adaptation to different resources has the potential to cause rapid species diversification, but few studies have been able to quantify the time scale of recent adaptive radiations. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, a model of speciation for host-specialized parasites, consists of several biotypes (races or species) living on distinct legume hosts. To document this radiation, we used rapidly evolving sequences from Buchnera, the maternally transmitted bacterial endosymbiont of aphids. Analyses of Buchnera pseudogene sequences revealed that 11 host-associated biotypes sort mostly into distinct matrilines despite low sequence divergence. A calibration based on divergence times of 7 sequenced genomes of Buchnera allowed us to date the last maternal ancestor of these biotypes between 8,000 and 16,000 years, with a burst of diversification at an estimated 3,600-9,500 years. The recency of this diversification, which is supported by microsatellite data, implies that the pea aphid complex ranks among the most rapid adaptive radiations yet documented. This diversification coincides with post-Pleistocene warming and with the domestication and anthropogenic range expansion of several of the legume hosts of pea aphids. Thus, we hypothesize that the new availability or abundance of resources triggered a cascade of divergence events in this newly formed complex.

AB The deep ocean is home to the largest ecosystems on our planet. This vast realm contains what may be the greatest number of animal species, the greatest biomass, and the greatest number of individual organisms in the living world. Humans have explored the deep ocean for about 150 years, and most of what is known is based on studies of the deep seafloor. In contrast, the water column above the deep seabed comprises more than 90% of the living space, yet less than 1% of this biome has been explored. The deep pelagic biota is the largest and least-known major faunal group on Earth despite its obvious importance at the global scale. Pelagic species represent an incomparable reservoir of biodiversity. Although we have yet to discover and describe the majority of these species, the threats to their continued existence are numerous and growing. Conserving deep pelagic biodiversity is a problem of global proportions that has never been addressed comprehensively. The potential effects of these threats include the extensive restructuring of entire ecosystems, changes in the geographical ranges of many species, large-scale elimination of taxa, and a decline in biodiversity at all scales. This review provides an initial framework of threat assessment for confronting the challenge of conserving deep pelagic biodiversity; and it outlines the need for baseline surveys and protected areas as preliminary policy goals.

AB While food webs have provided a rich vein of research material over the last 50 years, they have largely been the subject matter of the pure ecologist working in natural habitats. While there are some notable exceptions to this trend, there are, as I explain in this paper, many applied questions that could be answered using a food web approach. The paper is divided into two halves. The first half provides a brief review of six areas where food webs have begun to be used as an applied tool: restoration ecology, alien species, biological control, conservation ecology, habitat management and global warming. The second half outlines five areas in which a food web approach could prove very rewarding: urban ecology, agroecology, habitat fragmentation, cross-habitat food webs and ecosystem services.

AB Although many species face numerous predators in nature, the combined impact of multiple predators on the inducible defenses of prey has rarely been studied. Prey may respond with an intermediate phenotype that balances the risk from several sources or may simply respond to the most dangerous predator. I examined the separate and combined effects of the presence of shell-breaking (crabs, Cancer productus) and shell-entry (seastars, Pisaster ochraceus) predators fed conspecific snails on the defensive shell morphology and antipredator behavior of a marine snail (Nucella lamellosa). When exposed to each feeding predator separately, snails responded with a combination of morphological defenses that reflect the attack mode of the predator and a generalized behavioral response. Snails responded to feeding crabs by increasing refuge use and producing a thick, rotund shell. Snails responded to feeding seastars with increased refuge use but produced elongate shells with high spires that allowed for greater retraction of the soft tissue. Seastar-induced phenotypes reduced susceptibility to seastars relative to crab-induced phenotypes, but crab-induced phenotypes did not significantly reduce susceptibility to crabs, indicating an asymmetrical functional trade-off. When feeding predators were combined, snails produced a morphological phenotype similar to that expressed in the presence of the predator that imposed the highest mortality at the population level, suggesting that predator-induced morphology was prioritized according to predation risk. These results suggest that prioritizing conflicting defenses according to predator danger may be a common strategy for prey responding to combined predators, particularly in conjunction with generalized behavioral responses that reduce overall risk in multiple-predator environments.

AB The replacement of native plants by alien species is likely to affect other trophic levels, particularly phytophagous insects. Nevertheless, the effect of alien plants on insect biomass has not yet been quantified. Given their critical role in transferring energy from plants to higher trophic levels, if alien plants do affect insect biomass, this could have far-reaching consequences for community structure. We used 35 food webs to evaluate the impacts of alien plants on insect productivity in a native forest in the Azores. Our food webs quantified plants, insect herbivores, and their parasitoids, which allowed us to test the effects of alien plants on species richness and evenness, insect abundance, insect biomass, and food-web structure. Species richness of plants and insects, along with plant species evenness, declined as the level of plant invasion increased. Nevertheless, none of the 4 quantitative food-web descriptors (number of links, link density, connectance, and interaction evenness) varied significantly with plant invasion independent of the size of the food web. Overall, insect abundance was not significantly affected by alien plants, but insect biomass was significantly reduced. This effect was due to the replacement of large insects on native plants with small insects on alien plants. Furthermore, the impact of alien plants was sufficiently severe to invert the otherwise expected pattern of species-richness decline with increased elevation. We predict a decrease in insect productivity by over 67% if conservation efforts fail to halt the invasion of alien plants in the Azores.

AB Results from experiments studying different factors determining invasibility (e.g. land use, disturbance, biotic interactions) at different spatial scales are mainly used in isolation, probably because a methodology for integration is lacking. Recent studies show that factors affecting invasibility most likely do so in a hierarchical manner, with different factors acting more strongly at different spatial scales. Climate can be considered the dominant factor at the continental scale, while at regional and landscape scale topography, land cover and land use become increasingly important. At smaller spatial scales, soil type, disturbance, biotic interactions, resources, and microclimate may become significant. In the current paper, we propose a hierarchical framework for combining results from different types of studies. In this hierarchical system, factors operating at a smaller scale are subordinate to factors operating at a larger scale, but if conditions at higher levels are satisfied, the small-scale factors may become indispensable for making accurate predictions. Depending on the aim of the study, the accuracy of prediction can be selected by the researcher, which in its turn determines which data are required. We discuss several applications of the framework and indicate some options for future research. Although the complexity of natural systems presents fundamental limits to predictions, we think this framework can provide a useful tool for the identification of areas of risk for biological invasions, for improving our understanding of invasibility, and for identifying gaps in our current knowledge.

AB In both ecology and conservation, often a strong positive association is assumed between the diversity of plants as primary producers and that of animals, specifically primary consumers. Such a relationship has been observed at small spatial scales, and a begetting of diversity by diversity is expected under various scenarios of co-evolution and co-adaptation. But positive producer-consumer richness relationships may also arise from similar associations with past opportunities for diversification or contemporary environmental conditions, or from emerging properties of plant diversity such as vegetation complexity or productivity. Here we assess whether the producer-consumer richness relationship generalizes from plot to regional scale and provide a first global test of its strength for vascular plants and endothermic vertebrates. We find strong positive richness associations, but only limited congruence of the most diverse regions. The richness of both primary and higher-level consumers increases with plant richness at similar strength and rate. Environmental conditions emerge as much stronger predictors of consumer richness, and after accounting for environmental differences little variation is explained by plant diversity. We conclude that biotic interactions and strong local associations between plants and consumers only relatively weakly scale up to broad geographical scales and to functionally diverse taxa, for which environmental constraints on richness dominate.

AB With examples from Australo-Papuan ornithology, we examine the technical and theoretical roots of molecular phylogeography and review its development. We describe the progression from ad hoc interpretation of gene trees in single species phylogeographic studies through to comparative phylogeography and currently advocated model-testing approaches. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences have provided most advances to date, although we demonstrate and advocate the future use of multilocus datasets analysed with coalescent methods. We examine interrelationships among speciation research, historical biogeography, phylogeography and landscape genetics. Mitochondrial paraphyly, in which individuals of one species or population have mtDNA that is more closely related to that of another than to their own, emerges in 44% of Australian studies to date as a common, important result in Australian avian phylogeography. Accordingly, we explore at length its most common causes and its impact on case studies in Australo-Papuan avian phylogeography. The impact of so much paraphyly on avian phylogeography and taxonomy is a major theme of the review. We suggest a full research agenda for avian phylogeography in the Australo-Papuan region that spans diverse topics: the need for more studies of pelagic birds, spatio-temporal links between New Guinea and Australia, island populations, testing of long-established biogeographical hypotheses, and integration of molecular and non-molecular datasets into integrated evolutionary understanding of species and populations. Studying the full continuum of divergences from landscape genetics, to phylogeography, to recently diverged species with evidence of paraphyly, to highly divergent species with many fixed differences will lead to a more complete understanding of the processes and patterns of avian evolution.

AB Females tend to be smaller than males in woody dioecious plant species, but they tend to be larger in herbs. The smaller size of females in woody species has been attributed to higher reproductive costs, yet no satisfactory explanation has been provided for their larger size in herbs. Because herbs have higher nitrogen concentrations in their tissues than woody plants, and because pollen is particularly rich in nitrogen, we predicted that male growth would be more compromised by reproduction than female growth. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three experiments on the annual dioecious herb Mercurialis annua. First, we compared the timing of reproduction between males and females and found that males started flowering earlier than females; early flowering is expected to compromise growth more than later flowering. Second, we compared plants allowed to flower with those prevented from flowering by experimental debudding and found that males incurred a higher reproductive cost than females in terms of both biomass and, particularly, nitrogen. Third, we grew plants under varying levels of nitrogen availability and found that although sexual size dimorphism was unaffected by nitrogen, females, but not males, decreased their relative allocation to both roots and reproduction under high nitrogen availability. We propose that males deal with the high cost of pollen production in terms of nitrogen by allocating biomass to nitrogen-harvesting roots, whereas females pay for carbon-rich seeds and fruits by investing in photosynthetic organs. Sexual dimorphism would thus seem to be the outcome of allocation to above-versus below-ground sinks that supply resources (carbon versus nitrogen) limiting the female and male reproduction differentially.

AB The lion Panthera leo is one of the world's most charismatic carnivores and is one of Africa's key predators. Here, we used a large dataset from 357 lions comprehending 1.13 megabases of sequence data and genotypes from 22 microsatellite loci to characterize its recent evolutionary history. Patterns of molecular genetic variation in multiple maternal (mtDNA), paternal (Y-chromosome), and biparental nuclear (nDNA) genetic markers were compared with patterns of sequence and subtype variation of the lion feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVPle), a lentivirus analogous to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In spite of the ability of lions to disperse long distances, patterns of lion genetic diversity suggest substantial population subdivision (mtDNA Phi(ST) = 0.92; nDNA F-ST = 0.18), and reduced gene flow, which, along with large differences in seroprevalence of six distinct FIVPle subtypes among lion populations, refute the hypothesis that African lions consist of a single panmictic population. Our results suggest that extant lion populations derive from several Pleistocene refugia in East and Southern Africa (similar to 324,000-169,000 years ago), which expanded during the Late Pleistocene (similar to 100,000 years ago) into Central and North Africa and into Asia. During the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (similar to 14,000-7,000 years), another expansion occurred from southern refugia northwards towards East Africa, causing population interbreeding. In particular, lion and FIVPle variation affirms that the large, well-studied lion population occupying the greater Serengeti Ecosystem is derived from three distinct populations that admixed recently.

AB The central-European population of wolves Canis lupus has its western border of contiguous range in eastern Poland. Protected since 1998, Polish wolves began to expand towards the west. Based on large-scale data on wolf abundance (2000-2006) and geographic information system (GIS) tools, we built a habitat suitability model (HSM) for the species in Poland. The best model, selected by the Akaike information criterion, of the resource selection function (RSF) by wolves included percentage cover of forests, meadows and marshes (positively correlated to wolf abundance) and road density (negatively correlated), and explained 53% of the total variation in the wolf abundance index in a 10 x 10 km cell grid. That RSF was then used to evaluate the whole country in terms of suitability for wolves. Potential wolf range appeared to consist of 24 patches of good habitat (predicted relative probability of wolf occurrence >= 30%), including six patches already occupied and 17 new ones. In total, habitat suitable for wolves covers at least 20-24% of Poland, compared with 16% of the country's area now occupied by the species. HSM was validated with historical data on wolf occurrence in 1950-2006. The areas selected by our model and those inhabited by wolves in at least one decade overlapped in 81-86%. Furthermore, the probability of wolf occurrence predicted by the model correlated positively with the number of decades the wolves were actually recorded in the area. Based on the empirical relationship between patch size and wolf numbers, we estimated that Poland could support a population of 1450-1540 wolves, two to three times larger than the current estimate. HSM needs to be supplemented with a GIS-based connectivity analysis among patches, which in turn should be validated by molecular genetics studies on dispersing wolves. Because of broadly similar geographic conditions, the model may be applicable to eastern Germany, Belarus Republic and the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia).

AB Persistent contaminants are ubiquitous in the environment, often Present at concentrations that may jeopardize reproductive fitness only after long periods of exposure. As the duration of exposure is largely regulated by life span, long-lived species of high trophic status, such as many reptiles, birds, and mammals, may be at risk of reduced fitness and population decline. Delayed maturation and iteroparity confer the potential for cumulative effects to be expressed prior to reproduction, and large parental investments in yolk and milk may threaten offspring because of exposure during critical developmental periods, Long generation times may delay emergence of obvious effects on populations, perhaps eluding early intervention, while constraining rates at which populations may recover if conditions subsequently improve. Life history theory thus suggests that the suite of traits that optimized reproductive fitness throughout long-lived species, evolutionary histories may ultimately put them in peril in the modern, anthropogenically altered environment.

AB Invasion by cheatgrass and the associated high fire frequency can displace native plant communities from a perennial to an annual grass driven system. Our overall objective of this study was to determine the potential to favor desired native perennial bunchgrasses over annual grasses by altering plant available mineral nitrogen (N). In the first study, we grew cheatgrass and three native bunch grasses (native grasses were combined in equal proportions) in an addition series experimental design and applied one of three N treatments (0, 137, and 280 mg N/kg soil). Regression models were used to derive the effects of intra-and interspecific competition on individual plant yield of cheatgrass and the native bunch grasses (combined). In our second study, we compared the absolute growth rate of the four plant species grown in isolation in a randomized complete block design for 109 days under the same soil N treatments as the competition study. Predicted mean average weight of isolated individuals increased with increasing soil N concentrations for both cheatgrass and the three native perennials (P < 0.05). Biomass of cheatgrass and its competitive ability increased with increasing soil N concentrations (P < 0.0001) compared to the combined native bunchgrasses. However, the greatest resource partitioning occurred at the 137 mg N/kg soil N treatment compared to the 0 (control) and 280 mg N/kg soil treatments, suggesting there may be a level of N that minimizes competition. In the second study, the absolute growth of cheatgrass grown in isolation also increased with increasing N levels (P = 0.0297). Results and ecological implications of this study suggest that increasing soil N leads to greater competitive ability of cheatgrass, and that it may be possible to favor desired plant communities by modifying soil nutrient levels.

AB Past studies have focused primarily on the effects of invasive plants on litter decomposition at soil surfaces. In natural ecosystems, however, considerable amounts of litter may be at aerial and belowground positions. This study was designed to examine the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on the pool sizes and decomposition of aerial, surficial, and belowground litter in coastal marshlands, the Yangtze Estuary, which were originally occupied by two native species, Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis. We collected aerial and surficial litter of the three species once a month and belowground litter once every 2 months. We used the litterbag method to quantify litter decomposition at the aerial, surficial and belowground positions for the three species. Yearly averaged litter mass in the Spartina stands was 1.99 kg m(-2); this was 250 and 22.8% higher than that in the Scirpus (0.57 kg m(-2)) and Phragmites (1.62 kg m(-2)) stands, respectively. The litter in the Spartina stands was primarily distributed in the air (45%) and belowground (48%), while Scirpus and Phragmites litter was mainly allocated to belowground positions (85 and 59%, respectively). The averaged decomposition rates of aerial, surficial, and belowground litter were 0.82, 1.83, and 1.27 year(-1) for Spartina, respectively; these were 52, 62 and 69% of those for Scirpus litter at corresponding positions and 158, 144 and 78% of those for Phragmites litter, respectively. The differences in decomposition rates between Spartina and the two native species were largely due to differences in litter quality among the three species, particularly for the belowground litter. The absolute amount of nitrogen increased during the decomposition of Spartina stem, sheath and root litter, while the amount of nitrogen in Scirpus and Phragmites litter declined during decomposition for all tissue types. Our results suggest that Spartina invasion altered the carbon and nitrogen cycling in the coastal marshlands of China.

AB Aim We examine how two categories of non-native species (archaeophyte and neophyte, introduced before and after AD 1500, respectively) have had different impacts on beta diversity across European urban floras. Our goal is to use the unique biological perspective provided by urban areas, and the contrasting historical and geographical perspectives provided by archaeophytes and neophytes, to infer how non-native species will impact upon beta diversity in the future.
   Location Twenty-two urban areas located in seven European countries.
   Methods We used the beta-sim dissimilarity index to estimate the level of beta diversity for 231 unique pair-wise combinations of 22 urban floras. We examined bivariate plots of dissimilarity by geographical separation of city centres to evaluate distance decay of similarity for native species, archaeophytes and neophytes.
   Results Based on average percentages, 52.8% (SD = 8.2%) of species in the urban floras were identified as non-native with 28.3% (SD = 6.9%) classified as neophytes and 24.5% (SD = 4.9%) as archaeophytes. Relative to native species, across urban floras, archaeophytes were associated with higher compositional similarity and weaker distance decay patterns, whereas neophytes were associated with lower compositional similarity and stronger distance decay patterns.
   Main conclusions Across European urban floras, archaeophytes and neophytes occurred in similar numbers but archaeophytes were consistently associated with lower beta diversity and neophytes with higher beta diversity. Thus, the impact of non-native species on beta diversity can be determined, at least in part, through their historical and geographical associations with anthropogenic activities. If archaeophytes represent the long-term biogeographical outcome for human commensal species, neophytes could develop similar patterns. The consequences, however, are likely to be more substantial ecologically and geographically due to the increasing numbers of neophytes and their global anthropogenic associations. Nevertheless, at present, our findings suggest that, based on occurrence information, neophytes have not achieved this state with European urban floras retaining regionally distinct assemblages of neophytes.

AB Explanations for species coexistence in ant communities have traditionally focused on niche partitioning, particularly relating to differences in diet, foraging times and nesting requirements. Although niche separation is undoubtedly important, it seems insufficient to account for the high levels of local species richness that are commonly observed. This paper explores alternative explanations for ant species coexistence, focusing on factors that prevent competitive exclusion in diverse ant communities experiencing high levels of behavioural dominance, such as characteristically occurs in Australia. Very high species densities require two conditions to be met: first, a large number of species must successfully establish; and second, there must be a high rate of species persistence once established. In this context I advance five propositions based around three sets of arguments. First, ant sociality and modularity confers a high level of persistence once colonies are established, so that species coexistence is determined to a significant extent by processes operating at the establishment phase, rather than just by interactions between established colonies. Second, competitive outcomes are highly conditioned by environmental variation, which severely limits competitive exclusion. Finally, dominant species are highly patchy in space, and cannot comprehensively monopolize resources, such that there will usually be room for low densities of subordinate species. These propositions have relevance to neutral theories of community ecology, and to understanding intercontinental differences in local species richness.

AB Indirect evidence of the nitrogen (N) status of tropical forests strongly suggests that in heavily weathered soils under old-growth lowland tropical forests nitrogen is in relative excess. However, within the lowland forests of the Amazon basin, there is substantial evidence that soil texture influences soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations and hence possibly N availability and retention in the soil. Here, we evaluate the soil N status of two heavily weathered soils which contrast in texture (sandy versus clay Oxisol). Using N-15 pool dilution, we quantified gross rates of soil N cycling and retention. We also measured the delta N-15 signatures from the litter layer down to 50-cm depth mineral soil and calculated the overall N-15 enrichment factor (epsilon) for each soil type. The clay soil showed high gross N mineralization and nitrification rates and a high overall N-15 enrichment factor, signifying high N losses. The sandy soil had low gross rates of N cycling and N-15 enrichment factor, manifesting a conservative soil N cycling. Faster turnover rates of NH4+ compared to NO3- indicated that NH4+ cycles faster through microorganisms than NO3-, possibly contributing to better retention of NH4+ than NO3-. However this was opposite to abiotic retention processes, which showed higher conversion of NO3- to the organic N pool than NH4+. Our combined results suggest that clay Oxisol in Amazonian forest have higher N availability than sandy Oxisol, which will have important consequences for changes in soil N cycling and losses when projected increase in anthropogenic N deposition will occur.

AB We present the first quantified evidence of shifting environmental baselines from an island coral reef fishery (Rodrigues). As depletion of commercial fish species spreads out from the coast youngsters share few of their elders' memories of former abundance. Of three generations, the oldest reported more fish species as depleted (p <= 0.001), including predators indicative of ecosystem health and of interest to tourists. They recalled larger catches of the most-cited species Epinephelus multinotatus and bigger fish (p < 0.001). Generations also differed in their perceptions of island-level environmental change. Shifting baseline studies may be useful when planning Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in data-poor countries prioritising sustainable development. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patterns of polyploid evolution in the taxonomically controversial Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata groups were inferred genetically by analyzing 399 individuals from 177 localities for (1) four polymorphic plastid regions yielding aggregate haplotypes and (2) nuclear ribosomal ITS allele frequencies. Concordance between patterns observed in distributions of plastid haplotypes and ITS alleles renders ancestral polymorphism an unlikely cause of genetic variation in diploids and allopolyploids. Combining the degree of concerted evolution in ITS alleles (thought to reflect gene conversion) with inferred parentage provides support for a quadripartite classification of western European allopolyploid dactylorchids according to their respective parentage and relative dates of origin. The older allotetraploids that generally exhibit only one parental ITS allele can be divided into those derived via hybridization between the divergent complexes we now call D. incarnata s.l. and D.fuchsii (e.g., D. majalis) and those derived via hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and D. maculata (e.g., D. elata). Similarly, the younger allotetraploids that maintain evidence of both parental ITS alleles can be divided into those derived from hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and D.fuchsii, or perhaps in some cases a diploid species resembling D. saccifera (e.g., D. praetermissa, D. purpurella, D. traunsteineri s.l., D. baltica), and those derived from hybridization between the D. incarnata s.l. and D. maculata groups (e.g., D. occidentalis, D. sphagnicola). Older allotetraploids are inferred to have passed through glacially induced migration bottlenecks in southern Eurasia, whereas at least some younger allotetraploids now occupying northern Europe are inferred to have originated post-glacially and remain sympatric with their parents, a scenario that is largely in agreement with the morphology and ecology of these allotetraploids. ITS conversion is in most cases biased toward the maternal parent, eventually obscuring evidence of the original allopolyploidization event because plastid haplotypes also reflect the maternal contribution. Gene flow appears unexpectedly low among allotetraploids relative to diploids, whereas several mechanisms may assist the gene flow observed across ploidy levels. There is good concordance between (1) the genetically delimited species that are required to accurately represent the inferred evolutionary events and processes and (2) morphologically based species recognized in certain moderately conservative morphological classifications previously proposed for the genus. Further research will seek to improve sampling, especially in eastern Eurasia, and to develop more sensitive markers for distinguishing different lineages within (1) the remarkably genetically uniform D. incarnata group (diploids) and (2) locally differentiated populations of (in some cases unnamed) allotetraploids.

AB [1] We measured characteristics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and black carbon ( BC) along opposed north- and south-facing toposequences in recent ( 2004) and old (similar to 1860-1950) burn sites throughout interior Alaska. Surface fuel consumption did not vary between different topographic positions, with 3.3 (+/- 0.5) kg C m(-2) being consumed on toe slope sites, 4.0 (+/- 0.2) kg C m(-2) on north- slope sites, and 3.6 (+/- 0.3) kg C m(-2) on south-slope sites. On a relative scale, 43% of the organic matter depth was removed through biomass burning on toe slopes, 62% on north- slopes, and 77% on south-slope sites. Mineral soil BC stocks (measured using a chemical/thermal oxidation method isolating more graphitic BC) ranged from 112 +/- 24 g C m(-2) to 173 +/- 43 g C m(-2) on north- and south-facing aspects, respectively. These data supported the expectation that deeper and wetter ground fuels occurring in north-facing and toe-slope forests burned less completely, which decreased the amount of BC incorporated into mineral soil where it could be protected from subsequent fires. Thus, warmer and drier forests harbored less total SOC, but following wildfire aggraded larger BC stocks. BC was therefore an important component of stable soil C in warmer and drier forests which had higher C turnover rates in other soil pools (determined by density fractionation, delta(13) C, and Delta(14) C). These data provide a basis for understanding how variable patterns of organic layer depths and soil moisture mediate the consumption of SOC in wildfire, as well as the long-term accumulation of BC.

AB Selective ubiquitination of proteins is directed by diverse families of ubiquitin-protein ligases (or E3s) in plants. One important type uses Cullin-3 as a scaffold to assemble multisubunit E3 complexes containing one of a multitude of bric-a-brac/tramtrack/broad complex (BTB) proteins that function as substrate recognition factors. We previously described the 80-member BTB gene superfamily in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we describe the complete BTB superfamily in rice (Oryza sativa spp japonica cv Nipponbare) that contains 149 BTB domain-encoding genes and 43 putative pseudogenes. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the rice and Arabidopsis superfamilies revealed a near equal repertoire of putative substrate recognition module types. However, phylogenetic comparisons detected numerous gene duplication and/or loss events since the rice and Arabidopsis BTB lineages split, suggesting possible functional specialization within individual BTB families. In particular, a major expansion and diversification of a subset of BTB proteins containing Meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) substrate recognition sites was evident in rice and other monocots that likely occurred following the monocot/dicot split. The MATH domain of a subset appears to have evolved significantly faster than those in a smaller core subset that predates flowering plants, suggesting that the substrate recognition module in many monocot MATH-BTB E3s are diversifying to ubiquitinate a set of substrates that are themselves rapidly changing. Intriguing possibilities include pathogen proteins attempting to avoid inactivation by the monocot host.

AB It has been shown theoretically that sympatric speciation can occur if intraspecific competition is strong enough to induce disruptive selection. However, the plausibility of the involved processes is under debate, and many questions on the conditions for speciation remain unresolved. For instance, is strong disruptive selection sufficient for speciation? Which roles do genetic architecture and initial composition of the population play? How strong must assortative mating be before a population can split in two? These are some of the issues we address here. We investigate a diploid multilocus model of a quantitative trait that is under frequency-dependent selection caused by a balance of intraspecific competition and frequency-independent stabilizing selection. This trait also acts as mating character for assortment. It has been established previously that speciation can occur only if competition is strong enough to induce disruptive selection. We find that speciation becomes more difficult for very strong competition, because then extremely strong assortment is required. Thus, speciation is most likely for intermediate strengths of competition, where it requires strong, but not extremely strong, assortment. For this range of parameters, however, it is not obvious how assortment can evolve from low to high levels, because with moderately strong assortment less genetic variation is maintained than under weak or strong assortment-sometimes none at all. In addition to the strength of frequency-dependent competition and assortative mating, the roles of the number of loci, the distribution of allelic effects, the initial conditions, costs to being choosy, the strength of stabilizing selection, and the particular choice of the fitness function are explored. A multitude of possible evolutionary outcomes is observed, including loss of all genetic variation, splitting in two to five species, as well as very short and extremely long stable limit cycles. On the methodological side, we propose quantitative measures for deciding whether a given distribution reflects two (or more) reproductively isolated clusters.

AB Life history theory predicts trade-offs arising from the costs of reproduction: individuals investing more into reproduction should have less energy available for their own somatic demands. Despite a wealth of research on such costs for females, very few studies have looked at the male side. We investigated the costs of reproduction in males of two butterfly species, Bicyclus anynana and Pieris napi. The males of these species differ tremendously in their allocation of nutrients to reproduction: virgin male spermatophores were 18.5 times larger in the latter compared with those in the former. Based on this striking difference, we expected to find a longevity cost of mating in P. napi, but not necessarily in B. anynana. In line with our predictions, we found no evidence for a survival cost of mating in B. anynana, while there was some evidence for such a cost in P. napi. Here, virgin males lived longer than once- or twice-mated ones. However, this overall trend did not hold for all treatment groups; and there was no lineal relationship between the number of copulations and longevity. Adult food limitation reduced longevity throughout, but had otherwise very little impact. Spermatophore dry mass decreased in later compared with first spermatophores, while water content increased, indicating that spermatophore production is indeed physiologically costly. Additionally, adult food limitation tended to reduce spermatophore fresh and dry mass, and tended to increase spermatophore water content. Based on our results we tentatively conclude that longevity and reproduction may not always be traded off against each other, as in our study organisms' longevity seems to depend in first place on adult carbohydrate income, while male reproduction seems to be primarily (although not entirely) fuelled by larval storage reserves.

AB The evolution of reproductive isolation in the presence of gene flow is supported by theoretical models but rarely by data. Empirical support might be gained from studies of parallel hybrid zones between interbreeding taxa. We analysed gene flow over two hybrid zones separating ecotypes of Littorina saxatilis to test the expectation that neutral genetic markers will show site-specific differences if barriers have evolved in situ. Distinct ecotypes found in contrasting shore habitats are separated by divergent selection and poor dispersal, but hybrid zones appear between them. Swedish islands formed by postglacial uplift 5000 years ago provide opportunities to assess genetic structure in a recently evolved system. Each island houses a discrete population containing subpopulations of different ecotypes. Hybrid zones between ecotypes may be a product of ecological divergence occurring on each island or a consequence of secondary overlap of ecotypes of allopatric origin that have spread among the islands. We used six microsatellite loci to assess gene flow and genetic profiles of hybrid zones on two islands. We found reduced gene flow over both hybrid zones, indicating the presence of local reproductive barriers between ecotypes. Nevertheless, subpopulations of different ecotypes from the same island were genetically more similar to each other than were subpopulations of the same ecotype from different islands. Moreover, neutral genetic traits separating the two ecotypes across hybrid zones were site-specific. This supports a scenario of in situ origin of ecotypes by ecological divergence and nonallopatric evolution of reproductive barriers.

AB The respiratory loss of CO2 from soil microbes beneath winter snow in forests from cold climates can significantly influence the annual carbon budget. We explored the magnitude of winter soil respiration using continuous measurements of beneath- snow CO2 concentration within the footprint of a flux tower in a subalpine forest in the Rocky Mountains. We used eddy covariance measurements from the tower to obtain estimates of total wintertime ecosystem respiration and compared them to the calculated beneath- snow CO2 flux. Soil respiration in the winter was estimated to contribute 35 - 48% of the total wintertime ecosystem respiration, and 7 - 10% of the total annual ecosystem respiration. The largest increase in soil respiration occurred in the late winter following an earlier- than- normal initiation of snowmelt and increase in snow density. Following this melt event, respiration rates increased approximately sixfold, despite an increase in soil temperature of only 0.3 degrees - 0.5 degrees C. We interpret the late- winter surge in soil respiration to be triggered by a strong response of beneath- snow microbes to the pulse of meltwater coupled with extremely high sensitivity of the microbial biomass to increases in soil temperature.

AB Stable isotope ratios were used to determine the impact of anthropogenically derived organic matter from onshore and offshore fish farming and a sewage outfall on organisms at different trophic levels (primary producers and consumers) on the south-east coast of Sicily (Italy, Mediterranean). Representative macroalgae and consumers were collected in three sampling locations: "Impact" and two putative "Controls" sited to the north of the impacted location. While delta C-13 values of both organic matter sources and consumers varied little between locations delta N-15 spatial variability was higher and delta N-15 was shown to be a good descriptor of organic enrichment and uptake of anthropogenically derived material within coastal food webs. Isotopic data were analysed using a multivariate approach. Organic matter sources and benthic components were more sensitive to pollution than nektobenthic species and revealed that the effects of anthropogenic activities seem to be detectable over a wide area. The study site is characterised by wide waste dispersal, which brings a reduction in impact in the area directly affected by organic matter inputs and enlarges the area of moderate impact.

AB Cyanobacterial blooms are a regular feature of lakes in central North America, but little is known of their importance to the nitrogen (N) cycle and nutrition of aquatic food webs. We hypothesized that N-2-fixing cyanobacteria constitute a significant source of N to prairie lakes, that fixed N is effectively transferred to primary and secondary consumers, and that the importance of fixed N is structured on a landscape scale due to spatial gradients of lake chemistry and catchment characteristics. These hypotheses were tested using stable isotope analyses and mass budgets in six chained lakes of the northern Great Plains that were sampled biweekly during summers of 1994-2004. Mean annual N isotope signatures of particulate organic matter (delta N-15-POM) were highly correlated to the abundance of N-2-tixing cyanobacteria (r(2) = 0.75, p < 0.001), but exhibited no marked spatial organization. Instead, the temporal variability of delta N-15-POM was greatest in downstream lakes where N-2-fixing cyanobacteria were abundant. Furthermore, Seasonal declines in delta N-15-POM were correlated with reductions in delta N-15 of individual zooplankton taxa (Daphnia spp., Diacyclops thomasi, Leptodiaptomus siciloides, Leptodora kindtii), especially in downstream eastern lakes. N mass balances revealed that the importance of biological N-2 fixation relative to total N inputs (up to 77%) and initial N standing stock (up to 201 %) were significantly linearly correlated with landscape position (0.59 <= r(2) <= 0.83, p <= 0.07) and effective drainage area (0.61 <= r(2) <= 0.98, p <= 0.07), as were volumetric and areal estimates of N-2 fixation during summer (r(2) <= 0.87, p <= 0.007). These patterns demonstrate that fixed N is spatially structured, highly predictable based on landscape position, and readily assimilated into aquatic food webs.

We set out fresh spruce and birch logs and created spruce snags in 2001-2002 to experimentally test the effects of coarse woody debris (CWD) type and forest management on the composition of early and late successional, and red-listed saproxylic beetle assemblages. We examined effects of CWD availability at 100 m, and landscape composition at 1 and 10 km on saproxylic beetle abundances. Additionally, we tested whether assemblage similarity decreased with increasing distance between sites. We collected beetles from the experimental logs using eclector and window traps in four periods during 2003. CWD was measured and landscape composition data was obtained from maps of remotely sensed data. The composition of saproxylic beetles differed among different CWD substrates and between clear-cuts and the older stand types, however differences between mature managed and old-growth forests were significant only for red-listed species. Assemblage similarities for red-listed species on clear-cuts were more different at greater distances apart, indicating that they have more localised distributions. CWD availability within 100 m of the study sites was rarely important in determining the abundance of species, suggesting that early successional saproxylic beetles can disperse further than this distance. At a larger scale, a large area of suitable stand types within both 1 and 10 km resulted in greater abundances in the study sites for several common and habitat-specific species. The availability of suitable habitat at scales of 1-10 km is thus likely to be important in the survival of many saproxylic species in forestry-fragmented areas.

AB The current paper illustrates a method to operationally apply the model FOREST-BGC for the estimation of forest carbon fluxes in Mediterranean environments. The work was carried out in a pine forest stand within the coastal area of San Rossore (Central Italy) using both conventionally collected and remotely sensed data. The calibration of the model was performed using estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) derived from the carbon accumulated in the forest stems during the last four decades. Such estimates were obtained by transforming dendrochronological measurements collected in the stand into annual increments of woody biomass and carbon matter. Next, the model performance was validated against values of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP) collected during four years (1999-2002) by an eddy covariance flux tower. A method based on deriving fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) from remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data was also calibrated and validated in order to more directly assess forest GPR The results achieved indicate that the multi-year calibration against past carbon accumulation was essential in properly configuring the model in terms of respiration and allocation functions. Due to the importance of these functions, only the calibrated model was in fact able to correctly simulate the forest carbon fluxes, giving monthly estimates of both NEE and GPP quite close to those measured by the flux tower. These estimates were further improved by the proper integration of remotely sensed GPP evaluation and model carbon partitioning, which could be particularly useful for operational monitoring applications on a regional scale.

AB Although the relationship between dietary and phenotypic specialization has been well documented for many vertebrate groups, it has been stated that few such general trends can be established for lizards. This is often thought to be due to the lack of dietary specialization in many lizards. For example, many species that are reported to be insectivorous may also consume a variety of plant materials, and the reverse is often true as well. In this study, we investigate whether a correlation exists between general cranial form and dietary niche in lizards. Additionally, we test previously proposed hypotheses suggesting that herbivorous lizards should be larger bodied than lizards with other diets. Our data indicate that lizards specializing in food items imposing different mechanical demands on the feeding system show clear patterns of morphological specialization in their cranial morphology. True herbivores (diet of fibrous and tough foliage) are clearly distinguished from omnivorous and carnivorous lizards by having taller skulls and shorter snouts, likely related to the need for high bite forces. This allows herbivores to mechanically reduce relatively less digestible foliage. Carnivores have relatively longer snouts and retroarticular processes, which may result in more efficient capture and processing of elusive prey. When analysed in an explicit phylogenetic context, only snout length and skull mass remained significantly different between dietary groups. The small number of differences in the phylogenetic analyses is likely the result of shared evolutionary history and the relative paucity of independent origins of herbivory and omnivory in our sample. Analyses of the relationship between diet and body size show that on average herbivores have a larger body size than carnivores, with omnivores intermediate between the two other dietary groups.

AB The fitness of any evolutionary unit can be understood in terms of its two basic components: fecundity (reproduction) and viability (survival). Trade-offs between these fitness components drive the evolution of life-history traits in extant multicellular organisms. We argue that these trade-offs gain special significance during the transition from unicellular to multicellular life. In particular, the evolution of germ-soma specialization and the emergence of individuality tit the cell group (or organism) level are also consequences of trade-offs between the two basic fitness components, or so we argue using a multilevel selection approach. During the origin of multicellularity, we study how the group trade-offs between viability and fecundity are initially determined by the cell level trade-offs, but as the transition proceeds, the fitness trade-offs at the group level depart from those at the cell level. We predict that these trade-offs begin with concave curvature in single-celled organisms but become increasingly convex as group Size increases in multicellular organisms. We argue that the increasingly convex curvature of the trade-off function is driven by the cost of reproduction which increases as group size increases. We consider aspects of the biology of the volvocine green algae - which contain both unicellular and multicellular members - to illustrate the principles and conclusions discussed.

AB Montane areas in the Neotropics are characterized by high diversity and endemism of birds and other groups. The avian genus Myioborus (Parulinae) is a group of insectivorous warblers, characteristic of cloud forests, that represents one of the few Parulinae genera (New World warblers) that has radiated substantially in South America. The genus is distributed throughout most montane regions from the southwestern United States to northern Argentina. Here, I use mitochondrial sequences from the cytochrome b, ND2, and ND3 genes to present the first hypothesis of phylogenetic relationship among all Myioborius species level taxa. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods produced similar results and suggest a northern origin for the genus Myioborius with subsequent colonization of the Neotropical Montane Region. The lower-montane species, M. miniatus, is the sister taxon to a clade in which all taxa occupy upper-montane habitats. These "highland" taxa diverged early in the history of the genus and produced two well-defined monophyletic lineages, a Central-northern Andean clade formed by M. albifrons, M. ornatus, and M. melanocephalus, and a Pantepui (table-mountains of southern Venezuela, northern Brazil, and western Guyana) clade consisting of M. castaneocapillus, M. albifacies, and M. cardonai, and probably M. pariae. M. brunniceps, M. flavivertex, and M. torquatus were included in this upper-montane clade but without clear relationships to other taxa. Lack of resolution of nodes defining the upper-montane species clade is likely to result from a period of rapid diversification mediated by geological and climatic events during the Late Pliocene. These results suggest that an interplay of dispersal and vicariance has shaped the current biogeographic patterns of Myioborus. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB (W)e investigated the genetic structure of populations of Guianan harlequin toads (genus Atelopus) and their evolutionary affinities to extra-Guianan congeners. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene sequences produced well-supported clades largely corresponding to the four recognized taxa in the Guianas (Atelopus spumarius hoogmoedi, Atelopus spumarius barbotini, Atelopus franciscus, and Atelopus flavescens). Our findings suggest that the Guianan A. spumarius represent distinct evolutionary lineages that merit distinction from Amazonian conspecifics, and that the status of A. flavescens and A. franciscus is somewhat less clear. Approximately 69% of the observed genetic variation is accounted for by differences between these four recognized taxa. Coalescent-based estimates of gene flow between taxa suggest that these lineages are largely isolated from one another. Negligible rates of migration between populations and significant divergence within such close proximity suggests that although the region inhabited by these taxa is almost entirely undisturbed, significant habitat heterogeneity exists as to have produced a remarkable diversification of Atelopus within the eastern Guiana Shield. These results contradict the commonly held view of the Guiana Shield as a 'refuge' whose stability during late Tertiary and Quaternary climatic fluctuations served as a biotic reservoir. Instead, we provide evidence that climatic fluctuations during this time had a diversifying effect within the Guianan region.

AB In the northern Mediterranean Basin, agricultural land abandonment over the last century has resulted in increasing frequencies of very large, intense fires. In Catalonia (NE Spain) some fires have been locally associated with the expansion of the large, evergreen, resprouting tussock grass Ampelodesmos mauritanica. We tested the hypothesis of a positive feedback between the abundance of A. mauritanica and changing fire regimes.
   We used permanent plots distributed across a natural gradient of density of A. mauritanica in the Garraf Natural Park near Barcelona. Total aboveground biomass nearly doubled from plots with low to high density through a combination of A. mauritanica replacing the biomass of other components of the community (predominantly native shrubs), and its absolute standing biomass increasing. The quantity of litter also increased. This increase in fuel load and changes in community functional composition resulted from the simultaneous decrease in shrub productivity and an increase in litter accumulation. Litter accumulation was the consequence of A. mauritanica litter decomposing 30% more slowly than that of shrubs. Under standardized conditions, A. mauritanica and its litter were considerably more flammable than any of the shrub species. This resulted in a more than 40-fold increase in calculated plot flammability from low-to-high-density plots.
   Feedbacks, at the landscape scale, were then analysed using the landscape simulation platform LAMOS. Invasion success and contribution to community biomass of A. mauritanica increased with decreasing fire return intervals. Total area burnt in the landscape during each fire year was positively and exponentially related to the total biomass of A. mauritanica. Simulations showed that landscapes can abruptly switch from regimes of small localized to extensive fires as a result of the spread of A. mauritanica. Therefore, increases in fires under climate change represent threats not only through their direct impacts on ecosystems, but also by promoting invaders such as A. mauritanica, which have the potential to induce powerful feedforward processes and, thereby, fundamental changes to ecosystems.

AB We examined causes of speciation in asexual populations in both sympatry and parapatry, providing an alternative explanation for the speciation patterns reported by Dieckmann and Doebeli (1999) and Doebeli and Dieckmarm (2003). Both in sympatry and parapatry, they find that speciation occurs relatively easily. We reveal that in the sympatric clonal model, the equilibrium distribution is continuous and the disruptive selection driving evolution of discrete clusters is only transient. Hence, if discrete phenotypes are to remain stable in the sympatric sexual model, there should be some source of nontransient disruptive selection that will drive evolution of assortment. We analyze sexually reproducing populations using the Bulmer's infinitesimal model and show that cost-free assortment alone leads to speciation and disruptive selection only arises when the optimal distribution cannot be matched-in this example, because the phenotypic range is limited. In addition, Doebeli and Dieckmann's analyses assumed a high genetic variance and a high mutation rate. Thus, these theoretical models do not support the conclusion that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. In their parapatric model (Doebeli and Dieckmarm 2003), clustering into distinct phenotypes is driven by edge effects, rather than by frequency-dependent competition.

AB Planning management activities for a long-term sustainable forestry requires predictive tools designed for this kind of management. Many tools available today are either designed for planning periods that are too short to consider long-term sustainability, omit important parts of the forest ecosystem or are not capable of considering environmental changes. A long-term potential growth-limiting factor is the supply of available base cations as was demonstrated in an earlier study for a research area in southern Sweden. This paper presents the ForSAFE model, a computer implemented model system where four robust and well evaluated stand-alone models are combined to a dynamic model that considers vegetation and soil as well as the links between them. The system dynamics approach with causal loop diagrams (CLD) and feedback loop analysis (FLA) is presented as a useful tool for conceptualizing and constructing ecosystem models.

AB The single and synergistic effects of man-made changes to the environment, such as habitat destruction, climate change, introduction of novel, long-lived chemicals into the environment, transport of exotic species and pathogens into new geographical areas, and other factors are predicted to cause widespread population declines and species extinctions of plants and animals in this century. From its inception, physiology has dealt with organismal capacities to deal with environmental change. This essay argues that physiologists, their methods and concepts can make more substantial contributions to Conservation Biology than they have to date. A few of the many ways in which physiologists can participate in Conservation Biology include formulating standards for proof of cause-and-effect relations and providing information about how environmental change could affect organismal energetics, host-pathogen relations, immune defenses, and others.

AB Phylogenetic relationships of the Malagasy and Australasian rainbowfishes are investigated using 4394 characters derived from five mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S, tRNA-Valine, ND5, and COI), three nuclear genes (28S, histone H3, and TMO-4c4), and 102 morphological transformations. This study represents the first phylogenetic analysis of the endemic Malagasy family Bedotiidae and includes a nearly complete taxonomic review of all nominal species, as well as numerous undescribed species. Simultaneous analysis of the molecular and morphological datasets results in two equally most parsimonious trees. Results indicate that Bedotiidae (Bedotia + Rheocles) and Bedotia are monophyletic, whereas Rheocles is paraphyletic with the inclusion of two recently described species from northeastern Madagascar, R. vatosoa, and R. derhami. Rheocles vatosoa and R. derhami are sister taxa, and this clade is recovered as the sister group to Bedotia. The remaining species of Rheocles are not sexually dimorphic and comprise a clade that is recovered as the sister group to Bedotia + (R. derhami + R. vatosoa), all of which are sexually dichromatic, and sexually dimorphic for pigmentation and fin development. Three geographically distinct clades are recovered within Bedotia, one comprising species with distributions ranging from mid- to southeastern Madagascar, another including species restricted to eastern drainages north of the Masoala Peninsula, and a third comprising taxa with distributions extending from the Masoala Peninsula south to the Ivoloina River. The Australian/New Guinean melanotaeniids are monophyletic and are recovered as the sister group to Bedotiidae. The Australasian Telmatherinidae and Pseudomugilidae comprise a clade that is recovered as the sister group to the Melanotaeniidae-Bedotiidae clade. This sister-group relationship between Malagasy bedotiids and a clade restricted to Australia-New Guinea, and the absence of a close relationship between bedotiids and African or Mascarene atheriniforms, is congruent with the break-up of Gondwana, not a scenario reliant on Cenozoic trans-oceanic dispersal. Finally, results of the phylogenetic analysis indicate that Atheriniformes is polyphyletic and further corroborate recent morphological hypotheses, which have recovered Bedotiidae in a derived position within Atherinoidei.

AB We present a critical review of current trends in research of spatio-temporal development of forests. The paper addresses (1) field methods for the development of spatially-explicit models of forest dynamics and their integration in models of forest dynamics, (2) strengths and limitations of traditional patch models versus spatially-explicit, individual-based models, and (3) the potential for moment-based methods in the analysis of forest dynamics. These topics are discussed with reference to their potential for solving open questions in the studies of forest dynamics. The study of spatio-temporal processes provides a link between pattern and process in plant communities, and plays a crucial role in understanding ecosystem dynamics. In the last decade, the development of spatially-explicit, individual-based models shifted the focus of forest dynamics modelling from the dynamics of discrete patches to the interactions among individual organisms, thus encapsulating the theory of "neighbourhood" dynamics. In turn, the stochastic properties and the complexity of spatially-explicit, individual-based models gave rise to the development of a new suite of so-called moment-based models. These new models describe the dynamics of individuals and of pairs of individuals in terms of their densities, thus directly capturing second-order information on spatial structure. So far, this approach has not been applied to forests; we indicate extensions needed for such applications. Moment-based models may be an important complement to spatially explicit individual-based models in developing a general spatial theory of forest dynamics. However, both kinds of models currently focus on fine scales, whereas a critical issue in forest dynamics is to understand the interaction of fine-scale processes with coarser-scale disturbances. To obtain a more complete picture of forest dynamics, the relevant links and interactions between fine-, intermediate-, and coarse-scale processes ought to be identified. Intensive links between modelling work and field studies designed across different scales are a promising means to create a new perspective on forest dynamics.

AB The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is economically one of the world's most important marine species-a species presently suffering from heavy overexploitation throughout its range of distribution. Although not fully understood, the Atlantic cod is believed to be structured into populations in a rather complex manner, whereby both highly migratory and more confined ocean-spawning stocks coexist with stationary coastal populations. Owing to the complex population structure, little is presently known about how overexploitation of offshore stocks may affect other segments of the species. Here, we use microsatellite DNA analyses of coastal and offshore cod in combination with oceanographic modelling to investigate the population structure of Atlantic cod in the North Sea-Skagerrak area and evaluate the potential for larval transport into coastal populations. Our results suggest an extensive but temporally variable drift of offshore cod larvae into coastal populations. In a year (2001) with high inflow of North Sea waters into the Skagerrak we find that juvenile cod caught along the Skagerrak coast are predominantly of North Sea origin, whereas in a year (2000) with low inflow juveniles appear to be of local origin. These findings indicate that offshore cod may influence coastal cod populations over large distances.

AB Many models of local species interactions predict the occurrence of priority effects due to alternative stable equilibria (ASE). However, few empirical examples of ASE have been shown. One possible explanation for the disparity is that local ASE are difficult to maintain regionally in patch dynamic models. Here we examine two possible mechanisms for regional coexistence of species engaged in local ASE. Biotically generated heterogeneity (e.g., habitat modification that favors further invasion by conspecifics) results in regional exclusion of one species at equilibrium. In contrast, abiotic heterogeneity due to spatial variation in resource supply ratios generates local-scale ASE and ensures regional coexistence with sufficiently broad environmental gradients. Abiotic heterogeneity can result in a species that is the dominant competitor over some of its range being excluded if the area where it is dominant is too small. Biotic heterogeneity can lead to alternative stable landscapes or regional priority effects, while abiotic heterogeneity results in regional determinism. Broad environmental gradients in resource supply favor regional coexistence of species that exhibit local ASE. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tree growth (as diameter increment), litterfall production, and litter biomass were studied in two secondary tropical dry forests of the Yucatan Peninsula under four treatments of nutrient addition. The study's objective was to assess how variations in the nutrient supply affect aboveground net primary production and carbon (C) accumulation on the floor of two forests in different stages of regeneration. The study included an area of young forest (10 years old) with phosphorus (P)-poor soils and an area of old forest (around 60 years old) where soil P was comparatively less limiting. Four replicate plots (12 X 12 m) at each forest were either left intact (controls) or fertilized with nitrogen (N), P, or N plus P during 3 consecutive years. After 3 years of fertilization, relaxation of the constraints on nutrient limitation resulted in increased trunk growth rates at both the young and old forests. This effect was more pronounced with the addition of P or N plus P (trunk growth doubled with respect to controls), whereas N addition increased tree growth by 60% in comparison to trees in plots without nutrient supplements. In both forests, there were no significant differences in litterfall production among treatments during the first 2 years after fertilization. In the 3rd year of nutrient addition, litterfall production was significantly higher in plots fertilized with N plus P compared to control plots at both forest sites; however, changes in litterfall were not accompanied by litter accumulation in the floor of the two forests. The results of this study support the hypothesis that there is nutrient limitation during tropical dry forest regeneration. They further show that it may be maintained in the long term during secondary succession.

AB Genealogy-based methods were used to estimate migration of the fungal virus Cryphonectria hypovirus I between vegetative compatibility types of the host fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, as a means of estimating horizontal transmission within two host populations. Vegetative incompatibility is a self/non-self recognition system that inhibits virus transmission under laboratory conditions but its effect. on transmission in nature has not been clearly demonstrated. Recombination within and among different loci in the virus,genome restricted the genealogical analyses to haplotypes with common initiation and recombinational histories. The existence of recombination necessitated that we also Use genealogical approaches that can take advantage of both the imitation and recombinational histories of the sample. Virus migration between populations was significantly restricted. In contrast, estimates of migration between vegetative compatibility types were relatively high within populations despite previous evidence that transmission in the laboratory was restricted. The discordance between laboratory estimates and migration estimates from natural populations highlights the challenges in estimating pathogen transmission rates. Genealogical analyses inferred migration patterns throughout the entire coalescent history of one viral region in natural populations and not just recent patterns of migration or laboratory transmission. This application of genealogical analyses provides markedly stronger inferences on overall transmission rates than laboratory estimates do.

AB Recent studies of large portions of the human genome support a recent origin of modern humans from an African stock after a bottleneck of moderate size followed by a range expansion out of Africa. Under this simple scenario, patterns of molecular diversity suggest that balancing selection could be more prevalent than positive selection in coding regions.

AB The mussels Mytilus edulis L. and M. trossulus Gould are found sympatrically in most areas of Newfoundland, with a low frequency of hybrids. To assess the potential for reproductive isolation, we sampled mussels from three sites in an eastern Newfoundland Bay from May-October 1996 to determine if there were differences in the reproductive cycles of the two species and their natural hybrids. In mussels with shell lengths of 38-42 mm, males and females with mature gametes were dominant in June for M. edulis and hybrids, while M. trossulus showed a lower frequency of individuals with mature gametes. M. trossulus and hybrids spawned over a prolonged period (from late spring to early autumn) compared with most M. edulis individuals that spawned over a period of 2-3 weeks in July. This asynchrony in spawning activity between the two species may partially explain the low frequency of hybrids found in previous studies of these mussel populations. Female and male hybrids between M. edulis and M. trossulus showed normal gonad development, ripening and spawning, providing an opportunity for the introgression of genes between the two species. M. trossulus had a higher reproductive output than M. edulis of similar shell length, while hybrids showed intermediate values of reproductive output. M. trossulus females produced smaller eggs than either M. edulis or hybrids. Differences in reproductive traits may partially explain the maintenance of the mussel hybrid zone in Newfoundland.

AB The classical view of ecological systems has been one that assumes a state of equilibrium and stability; this is encapsulated in the 'balance of nature' paradigm. Over the last 30 years ecologisis and biogeographers have rejected the view that ecological systems are inherently stable or at some sort of equilibrium. Instead a nonequilibrium view, emphasizing the role of chance events such as disturbance in ecological dynamics, has become dominant. Alongside this change, the way in which the roles of space and spatial heterogeneity in ecological dynamics are viewed has shifted. Classical ecological theory tended to ignore spatial dynamics and heterogeneity and focused instead on temporal pattern. Over the last 20 years this view has also charged and the importance of spatial pattern has been emphasized. Through the explicit consideration of space and spatial pattern it has been shown that spatial heterogeneity may act to either stabilize or destabilize ecological systems and processes. This paper reviews these two changes in the way ecological systems are conceptualized and explores how they are inter-related. Advances in our understanding of the role of space and the nature of equilibrium in ecological systems are discussed within the context of both modelling and empirical studies, as are the problems involved with experimentally testing the large body of spatial theory developed.

AB Landscape monitoring usually relies on land-use statistics which reflect the share of land-sue/land cover types. In order to understand the functioning of landscapes, landscape pattern must be considered as well. Indicators which address the spatial configuration of landscapes are therefore needed. The suitability of landscape metrics, which are computed from the type, geometry and arrangement of patches, is examined. Two case studies in a surface mining region show that landscape metrics capture landscape structure but are highly dependent on the data model and on the methods of data analysis. For landscape metrics to become part of policy-relevant sets of environmental indicators, standardised procedures for their computation from remote sensing images must be developed.

AB We assessed the significance of flooding for the floristic composition of seed banks in flood-meadows of the northern valley of the Upper Rhine. We compared three hydrological compartments of the alluvial plain, consisting of the regularly flooded land between the river and low summer dykes (functional flood-plain), the occasionally flooded land between summer dykes and high winter dykes (hybrid flood-plain) and the land behind the winter dykes, which is now only submerged by ascending groundwater (fossil flood-plain). Due to their different flooding regime, the three compartments should differ with respect to the prevailing conditions of diaspore input.
   The seed density of soil samples increased with the duration of flooding in the three compartments, while species richness and the proportion of species not occurring in the vegetation was constant. The increase in seed density can be largely attributed to an increase of disturbance indicators, which are present in the above-ground vegetation and capable of forming a long-term persistent seed bank.
   No effects of flooding on the composition of seed banks in the three flood-plain compartments were found. The differences in seed bank composition can be largely explained by corresponding differences in above-ground vegetation and former and present-day meadow management. Seeds of species absent from above-ground vegetation can be attributed to the local species pool present in the immediate vicinity of the study plots. We discuss consequences of the results for the restoration of species-rich flood-plain meadows.

ID HONEY MESQUITE; GRASSLAND; EXPANSION; RESPONSES
AB It is necessary to quantify rates of woody plant encroachment on southwestern USA rangelands to determine the economic feasibility of treatments designed to manage these plants. This study observed changes in honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) canopy cover over a 20-year period (1976-1995) in 2 treatments: an untreated area that initially had a moderately dense mesquite stand (14.6% cover), and an area cleared of mesquite with root-plowing in 1974. Canopy cover of mesquite was estimated from scanned color-infrared aerial photograph images by manually delineating mesquite canopies with a computer using ArcView software. During the 20 years, mesquite cover in the untreated area increased (P less than or equal to 0.05) from 14.6 to 58.7%, averaging 2.2 percentage units per year. Cover in the root-plow treatment also significantly increased during the same period from 0 to 21.9% (1.1 percentage units per year), but the rate of increase was significantly lower than in the untreated area because mesquite growth was from new seedlings instead of established plants and/or new seedlings as occurred in the untreated area. Rate of increase was significantly lower from 1976 to 1990 (1.6 and 0.2 percentage units per year) than from 1990 to 1995 (4.1 and 3.7 percentage units per year) in the untreated and root-plow treatment, respectively. These differences were attributed to precipitation which was near normal from 1976 to 1990 but 25% above normal from 1991 to 1995.

AB We investigated the use of stable-isotope analysis as a direct means of tracing allocation of endogenous protein and lipid reserves to reproduction in five gulls (Larus canus, L. delawarensis, L. californicus, L. argentatus, L. philadelphia), four terns (Sterna caspia, S. hirundo, S. paradisaea, Chlidonias niger), and one jaeger (Stercorarius parasiticus) breeding on Great Slave Lake (GSL) in the Northwest Territories. Our approach was based on assumptions that (1) body tissues of birds just arriving at GSL from their assumed marine-associated wintering habitats would have stable-isotope ratios more enriched than those of birds in equilibrium with the local GSL foodweb, and (2) mobilization of these reserves to reproduction could be traced by the isotopic measurement of egg macronutrients. As predicted, the pectoral muscle of six species of arriving birds was more enriched in C-13 ((x) over bar = -21.5 parts per thousand) and N-15 ((x) over bar = 12.7 parts per thousand) than was that of postbreeding birds (C-13, (x) over bar = -23.5 parts per thousand; N-15, (x) over bar = 9.9 parts per thousand) or hatching-year birds raised at GSL (C-13, (x) over bar = -24.3 parts per thousand; N-15, (x) over bar = 9.0 parts per thousand). Abdominal fat of arriving Herring Gulls and Mew Gulls was more enriched in C-13 ((x) over bar = -19.7 parts per thousand) than the fat of other species ((x) over bar = -23.4 parts per thousand), indicating lipids of marine origin. We compared isotope values of the local GSL foodweb with dietary values predicted from isotope measurements of egg macronutrients ii diets were entirely derived at GSL. Isotopic analysis of lipid-free egg yolk, yolk lipid, and shell carbonate suggested that for most species, little if any endogenous protein reserves were used for reproduction, with the possible exception of Caspian Terns, whose egg protein and egg lipid values, and Common Terns, whose egg protein values, were more enriched in C-13 than those of the other species. Although endogenous nutrient reserves likely were important to birds during migration and the initial settling period at GSL, local food supplies were adequate to provide nutrients for reproduction.

AB We discuss the role of leaf cutting ant nests (Atta sp.) on the formation of understory "bottom-up" gaps in tropical rain forests. We (i) describe the characteristics of Atta nests that qualify them as promoters of understory gaps; (ii) review the effects of Atta nests on the dynamics of systems other than tropical forests; and (iii) discuss the hypotheses that in neotropical rain forests Atta nests affect plant productivity, and also influence distribution and community composition of the flora. Finally, we discuss the importance of Atta nests in the dynamics of forests and compare their effects with the better-known effects of treefall gaps. Atta nests modify soil structure, soil nutrient content, light intensity at ground level, seed bank composition and understory structure. The presence of the nest and associated refuse also accelerates the soil nutrient cycles. The size, high frequency, turnover rate and duration of these nests could make them a good substrate for particular species of plants. In spite of their potential importance, little information exists on the effects of Atta nests on plant productivity and/or plant composition in neotropical rain forests.

AB Linking the results of localized field experiments to generalities about the role of specific processes is essential in ecology. Comparative studies conducted at multiple locations enable the general importance of processes to be assessed. However, spatial or temporal variation in the strength of local ecological relationships frequently makes it difficult to draw general conclusions, as increasing the extent of a study is likely to increase the physical and biological heterogeneity. To unravel the influence of differences in wave climate on local ecological interactions among adult and juvenile sandflat bivalves, an experiment was conducted at three sites in each of three harbors in the North Island of New Zealand. The selected sites covered a range of wind-wave exposures but were all mid-intertidal sandflats with macrobenthic communities dominated by bivalves. Four treatments were used additions of 0, 15, 45, and 110 adults of the tellinid bivalve Macomona liliana. At each site a DOBIE wave gauge was used to provide time-series data on wave orbital speed at the seabed over the 35-d duration of the experiment. Significant experiment x location interactions indicated site-dependent variation in the strength and direction of treatment effects. However, multiple regression models based on site environmental characteristics were very successful in explaining differences between sites in the strength of experimental treatment effects (66-99% of the variance explained). We used the cube of the orbital wave velocity at the seabed (U-b(3)) as an index of energy dissipation by waves. Both the site average and maximum U-b(3) were important variables explaining location-dependent treatment effects. Average U-b(3) increased the strength of the negative effects of experimental additions of adult Macomona on juvenile bivalves, presumably by increasing the opportunity for juvenile bivalves to be resuspended by small waves and transported away from areas with high adult densities. Maximum U-b(3) decreased the strength of the experimental effects, probably by increasing the purely passive transport of juveniles with sediment bedload and thus obliterating patterns in the distribution of juvenile bivalves relative to adult Macomona. Hence, different aspects of the wave climate influenced adult-juvenile interactions in different ways. Ambient density of adult Macomona around the experimental sites was also an important factor. This multisite experiment confirmed the importance of local adult-juvenile interactions and suggested ways in which these interactions are influenced by local environmental characteristics. Where the influence of such broad-scale variables can be identified, linking broad-scale information to small-scale studies that identify mechanisms can increase the generality of ecological experiments.

AB Sporocarps of epigeous ectomycorrhizal fungi and vegetation data were collected from eight Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. - Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco stands along a wet to dry gradient in Olympic National Park, Washington, U.S.A. One hundred and fifty species of ectomycorrhizal fungi were collected from a total sample area of 2.08 ha. Over 2 years, fungal species richness ranged from 19 to 67 taxa per stand. Sporocarp standing crop ranged from 0 to 3.8 kg/ha, averaging 0.58 kg/ha, 0.06 kg/ha in spring and 0.97 kg/ha in fall. Sporocarp standing crop and fungal species richness were correlated with precipitation. These results demonstrated that ectomycorrhizal fungal sporocarp abundance and species richness can be partly explained in terms of an environmental gradient.

AB Ageing is an increase in mortality and/or decline in fertility with advancing age. Evolutionary theories predict that ageing will evolve in response to the pattern of externally imposed hazards to survival and fertility; a prediction confirmed in new empirical studies. Recent studies of large cohorts of experimental animals and of humans have revealed that mortality rates do not continue to accelerate at very advanced ages. It has been suggested that evolutionary theories cannot account for these mortality patterns; however, this challenge Is more apparent than real. Heterogeneity between individuals can shape mortality trajectories for populations, and recent evolutionary theory can both account for such heterogeneity and accommodate late-age mortality patterns.

AB Sardine, pilchard and anchovy stocks form the basis of commercially important purse seine fisheries in eastern boundary upwelling regions. High levels of environmentally driven recruitment variability have, however, made them especially difficult to manage. Reliable forecasts of recruitment success would greatly help with the setting of catch quotas prior to each fishing season. Theories of how environmental conditions influence recruitment success, according to survival/mortality of the early life-history stages, can be divided into mechanistic and sythesis theories. Mechanistic theories are concerned with specific physical processes, whereas synthesis theories attempt to unite the various mechanistic processes within a single conceptual framework. Despite the successful testing of some theories, there has been little success in reliably predicting recruitment success from a knowledge of environmental conditions. Possible reasons include the following: non-linearity in the relationship between environmental parameters and recruitment: the poor spatial and temporal resolution of much oceanographic data; the wide range of different factors involved in determining recruitment success; and the choice of environmental index. The recent compilation of time series of satellite images for these regions offers a solution to some of these problems, and in doing so reopens the possibility of finding sufficiently good relationships between environmental conditions and recruitment success for management purposes. In particular, the high resolution of these time series allows for the construction of environmental indices across many different spatial and temporal scales. These time series also open up the possibility of quantifying the behaviour of upwelling systems according to the evolution of their spatial structure through time, using pattern analysis techniques.

AB Serveral international conventions and agreements have stressed the importance of the assessment of forest biodiversity. However, the methods by which such assessments can be made remain unclear. Remote sensing represents an important tool for looking at ecosystem diversity and various structural aspects of individual ecosystems. It provides a means to make assessments across several different spatial scales, and is also critical for assessments of changes in ecosystem pattern over time. Many different forms of remote sensing are available. While lately the emphasis on laser scanner and synthetic aperture radar data has increased, most work to date has used photographs and digital optical imagery, primarily from airborne and spaceborne platforms. These provide the opportunity to assess different phenomena from the landscape to the stand scale. Remote sensing provides the most efficient tool available for determining landscape-scale elements of forest biodiversity, such as the relative proportion of matrix and patches and their physical arrangement. At intermediate scales, remote sensing provides an ideal tool for evaluating the presence of corridors and the nature of edges. At the stand scale, remote sensing technologies are likely to deliver an increasing amount of information about the structural attributes of forest stands, such as the nature of the canopy surface. the presence of layering within the canopy and presence of (very) coarse woody debris on the forest floor. Given the rate of development in the technology, even greater usage is likely in the future.

AB We studied body condition and feather growth rate in Great Tits (Parus major) in relation to dominance in two localities during late autumn and early winter. The two localities differed in elevation, ambient temperature, and arthropod availability. We supplemented the two study areas with food (husked peanuts) throughout the study period. The percentage of time tits spent at feeders was higher at El Ventorrillo (the locality that was colder and had lower natural food availability) and was associated with dominance only at this locality. The number of aggressive displacements per hour experienced by each individual was 150 times higher in the area with lower arthropod availability and lower temperatures. Protein reserves (measured as pectoralis muscle thickness) were higher at El Ventorrillo and were positively and consistently related to dominance at both localities. Growth rate of induced feathers was slower at Fl Ventorrillo but was not directly related to dominance in either locality. Only dominant adult males at El Ventorrillo compensated for the environmental harshness at this locality by attaining a higher feather growth rate than the other sex/age classes. Feather-mass asymmetry of induced feathers during autumn was not associated with body condition, did not change between localities, and was inversely and consistently related to dominance at both localities. The covariation among variables describing bird size, access to supplemental food, body condition, feather growth rate, and asymmetry was different at the two localities. Larger, dominant Great Tits spent more time foraging at feeders, had a thicker pectoralis muscle (i.e. body condition), and grew induced feathers at a higher rate only at the locality with colder temperatures and lower food availability.

AB A forest is embedded in heterogeneous landscape mosaics and interacts with the surrounding environment through processes such as seed dispersal. Previous forest models, however, have either ignored such interactions or made unrealistic assumptions. We developed a landscape model (FORMOSAIC) that explicitly considers not only the dynamics of a focal forest but also ecological impacts of adjacent areas on the focal forest. FORMOSAIC is hierarchically structured, spatially explicit, multi-scale, stochastic, and individual-based. It integrates information of tree position, regeneration, growth, death, spatial interaction, and environmental factors. Data for parameterizing FORMOSAIC were mainly from a 50 ha permanent study plot in the Pasoh forest reserve (Malaysia), which contained over 800 tree species and more than 330 000 trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) greater than or equal to 1.0 cm. Model simulation results agreed well with independent field census data in terms of species richness, species composition, tree abundance, and basal area at two spatial scales. Sensitivity analysis indicated that minimum harvest size was the most sensitive parameter. Species richness was particularly sensitive to the duration of seed immigration from species-rich surrounding forests. For tree abundance and basal area, the second most sensitive parameters varied at two spatial scales. Through uncertainty analysis we found that many parameters had scale-dependent and non-linear relationships with species richness, tree abundance, and basal area. There also existed significant interactive effects between parameters. The model could be a useful tool for addressing important issues such as fragmentation and deforestation in forest management for species diversity and timber production from a landscape perspective.

AB Availability of soil nitrogen, soil moisture, and light were examined, along with the growth, biomass allocation, and leaf nitrogen concentration of naturally established Acer saccharum Marsh. seedlings, in the understories of 12 forest sites in northern Wisconsin. The sites represented a nutrient and moisture gradient (poor to rich) according to a habitat classification system. We asked (1) Are seedling growth rates, biomass allocation patterns, and leaf nitrogen related to soil water and nitrogen availability? and (2) Do soil resource rankings predicted by habitat classifications mirror our direct observations? Across sites compared in a low-light data set (plots with <5% canopy openness), rich sites had 2- to 4-fold higher seedling growth, percent leaf nitrogen, nitrogen mineralization rates, and nitrification rates than poor sites. Seedling growth in low light correlated (P less than or equal to 0.05) positively with nitrification, total nitrogen mineralization, percent leaf nitrogen, soil moisture, and organic carbon, and negatively with fine root density. In multiple regression, soil moisture (P = 0.033) and nitrification (P = 0.015) together explained 79% of the variation in growth. Thus, seedling growth in shade was enhanced on richer sites in part because of higher nitrate N and water availability. This has potential implications for forest dynamics, since the probability of sugar maple becoming the dominant woody regeneration in any given understory may be partially dependent upon the level of soil resources.

ID SEED BANK; GROWTH; MANAGEMENT
AB Most wetlands in the central European lowlands have been severely altered by cultivation. As a consequence they no longer fulfil their function as habitats for specialised species and communities, nor as retention areas for water and solid materials. Therefore, a number of renaturation experiments are in progress, which intend to develop and test strategies and measures to improve this defect in landscape diversity. For this purpose experiments on re-wetting, nutrient depletion of eutrophicated areas and re-establishment of typical wetland plant species and phytocoenoses have been performed. An ecological development concept defining the aims and describing their feasibility precedes such experiments. Preliminary results indicate that the reconstruction of the former state (regeneration) is impossible within reasonable time spans. In drained raised bogs overgrown with heather, as well as in those which have been industrially exploited, the primary aim must always be to restore efficient peat formation as far as possible; as a rule one succeeds only with well-growing and nutrient-demanding fen and transitional bog species. In cultivated fens the aim is to reduce peat loss. As a first step this is accomplished by converting arable fields and sown meadows into permanent grassland, if possible with reduced fertilization and low mowing or grazing frequencies, and accompanied by rewetting during winter. Many experiments have sought to impoverish eutrophicated fen soils and introduce typical fen species by sowing or planting, so well tested techniques are available. However, the total prevention of peat loss is only possible by permanent rewetting throughout the year, so that peat accumulation can start again. Only in this way could fens regain their former function as sinks in landscape processes.

AB 1 Sexual reproduction, vegetative propagation and growth of Pinguicula vulgaris were monitored at two sites in Alberta, Canada during a single growing season. Seed number, biomass invested in growth, and vegetative propagation (gemmae production) were used as indices of resource allocation. Allocations to sexual reproduction, vegetative propagation and growth were analysed relative to allocation to the other two functions, plant size (winter bud mass), and site.
   2 The effects of plant size on patterns of resource investment were not consistent. Allocation to growth varied negatively with plant size, particularly in large fruiting plants. In contrast, sexual reproduction and gemmae production varied positively with plant size: seed and fruit production increased allometrically, whereas allocation to gemmae was isometric.
   3 In isolation from the effects of plant size, trade-offs occurred between sexual reproduction and vegetative functions (growth and gemmae production), whereas vegetative propagation and growth varied positively. Decreased gemmae production by fruiting plants, even after the effects of reproduction on growth had been accounted for, implied that: (1) reproduction affected vegetative propagation and growth independently; (2) growth was favoured over vegetative propagation; and (3) reproduction was more costly than indicated by simple trade-offs. Positive relations between growth and vegetative propagation probably arise because gemmae are in effect axillary buds on the over-wintering structure.
   4 These allocation patterns, combined with threshold sizes for reproduction, suggest an emphasis on growth until a minimum size is reached. Beyond this threshold, resources not required to maintain size seem to be allocated to current reproduction. We suggest that resource allocation by P. vulgaris may reflect growth form and phenology as well as the relative probabilities of adult, gemmae and seedling survival. Plants of similar growth form and/or phenology, such as bulb- or corm-forming species, probably employ similar strategies of resource allocation.

AB For over a decade, ecologists have repeatedly asserted that community food webs possess fundamental properties that are roughly constant among webs with widely varying numbers of species. This assertion of ''scale invariance'' is reevaluated here among 60 food webs originally published in its support. This analysis contradicts the conventional view of scale invariance by demonstrating highly significant trends in six of eight properties investigated. As the size of food webs increases to 54 trophic species, the fraction of intermediate species, the links/species ratio, and the fraction of links between intermediate species also increase. Concurrently, the fractions of top species, basal species, and links between top and basal species decrease. Only one of these properties, the links/species ratio, is widely thought not to be scale invariant. These trends corroborate hypotheses of scale-dependent food-web structure that successfully predict properties of new, high-quality food webs containing many more than 54 species. This success suggests that general, quantitative, and successfully predictive constraints in fundamental aspects of ecological organization have been discovered. Such discoveries are particularly important, because the lack of general prediction among all terrestrial and aquatic systems seriously impedes the maturation of ecology as a scientific discipline.

TI NUTRIENT FLUXES IN BULK PRECIPITATION AND THROUGHFALL IN 2 MONTANE

AB (1) The composition of bulk precipitation (rainfall plus dry deposition as collected by funnels) and throughfall water was studied during one year on a weekly basis in two epiphyte-rich Andean rain forests (Cordillera Central, Colombia, 2550 and 3370 m a.s.l.)
   (2) Nutrient input to the forest by bulk precipitation was higher at 2550 m because of larger precipitation volumes; rainfall was 2115 mm at 2550 m and 1453 mm at 3370 m. Losses of nutrients from the canopy, both total amounts and amounts per unit of precipitation, were also higher at 2550 m.
   (3) Net fluxes (throughfall flux minus bulk precipitation flux) and deposition ratios (ratio of throughfall flux to bulk precipitation flux) were generally within the range reported for other montane tropical rain forests. Differences between forests appear to be related to climate (mainly precipitation amounts), geographical situation (e.g. maritime influences) and the availability of nutrients in the soil. The patterns described in the present study are in accordance with other studies that show reduced cycling rates and limited availability of nitrogen and phosphorus in high-altitude rain forests.
   (4) Volcanic activity in the proximity of the forests (continuous SO2 emission and incidental ash-falls) was shown to affect precipitation chemistry. Inputs of SO4-S were high (26.2 and 16.8 kg ha-1 year-1 at 2550 and 3370 m, respectively) and correlated with rainfall acidity. As a consequence of an ash-fall, concentrations of Ca, Mg and SO4-S in bulk precipitation were far above average on one occasion. Throughfall concentrations fell to normal within two to three weeks in spite of low rainfall.

AB Most of the theories that have dominated supply chain management (SCM) take a reductionist and static view on the supply chain and its management, promoting a global hunt for cheap labor and resources. As a result, supply chains tend to be operated without much concern for their broader contextual environment. This perspective overlooks that supply chains have become both vulnerable and harmful systems. Recent and ongoing crises have emphasized that the structures and processes of supply chains are fluid and interwoven with political-economic and planetary phenomena. Building on panarchy theory, this article reinterprets the supply chain as a social-ecological system and leaves behind a modernist view of SCM, replacing it with a more contemporary vision of "dancing the supply chain." A panarchy is a structure of adaptive cycles that are linked across different levels on scales of time, space, and meaning. It represents the world's complexities more effectively than reductionist and static theories ever could, providing the basis for transformative SCM.

AB Adaptive radiation is the likely source of much of the ecological and morphological diversity of life(1-4). How adaptive radiations proceed and what determines their extent remains unclear in most cases(1,4). Here we report the in-depth examination of the spectacular adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika. On the basis of whole-genome phylogenetic analyses, multivariate morphological measurements of three ecologically relevant trait complexes (body shape, upper oral jaw morphology and lower pharyngeal jaw shape), scoring of pigmentation patterns and approximations of the ecology of nearly all of the approximately 240 cichlid species endemic to Lake Tanganyika, we show that the radiation occurred within the confines of the lake and that morphological diversification proceeded in consecutive trait-specific pulses of rapid morphospace expansion. We provide empirical support for two theoretical predictions of how adaptive radiations proceed, the 'early-burst' scenario(1,5) (for body shape) and the stages model(1,6,7) (for all traits investigated). Through the analysis of two genomes per species and by taking advantage of the uneven distribution of species in subclades of the radiation, we further show that species richness scales positively with per-individual heterozygosity, but is not correlated with transposable element content, number of gene duplications or genome-wide levels of selection in coding sequences.
   Analyses of molecular, anatomical, pigmentation and ecological characteristics of nearly all of the approximately 240 species of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika show that the massive adaptive radiation occurred within the confines of the lake through trait-specific pulses of accelerated evolution.

AB To understand ecosystem responses to anthropogenic global change, a prevailing framework is the definition of threshold levels of pressure, above which response magnitudes and their variances increase disproportionately. However, we lack systematic quantitative evidence as to whether empirical data allow definition of such thresholds. Here, we summarize 36 meta-analyses measuring more than 4,600 global change impacts on natural communities. We find that threshold transgressions were rarely detectable, either within or across meta-analyses. Instead, ecological responses were characterized mostly by progressively increasing magnitude and variance when pressure increased. Sensitivity analyses with modelled data revealed that minor variances in the response are sufficient to preclude the detection of thresholds from data, even if they are present. The simulations reinforced our contention that global change biology needs to abandon the general expectation that system properties allow defining thresholds as a way to manage nature under global change. Rather, highly variable responses, even under weak pressures, suggest that 'safe-operating spaces' are unlikely to be quantifiable.
   The utility of the threshold paradigm, such that relatively small perturbations drive abrupt ecosystem changes, is challenged by a synthesis of 36 meta-analyses, which detected few signatures of thresholds from over 4,600 global change impacts on natural ecological communities.

AB Since their emergence onto land, terrestrial plants have developed diverse strategies to acquire soil resources. However, we lack a framework that adequately captures how these strategies vary among species. Observations from around the world now allow us to quantify the variation observed in commonly-measured fine-root traits but it is unclear how root traits are interrelated and whether they fall along an "economic" spectrum of acquisitive to conservative strategies. We assessed root trait variation and mycorrhizal colonization rates by leveraging the largest global database of fine-root traits (the Fine-Root Ecology Database; FRED). We also developed a heuristic model to explore the role of mycorrhizal fungi in defining belowground exploration efficiency across a gradient of thin- to thick-diameter roots. In support of the expectations of the "root economic spectrum," we found that root diameter was negatively related to specific root length (Pearson's r=-0.76). However, we found an unexpected negative relationship between root diameter and root tissue density (Pearson's r = -0.40), and we further observed that root nitrogen content was largely unrelated to other economic traits. Mycorrhizal colonization was most closely associated with root diameter (Pearson's r = 0.62) and was unrelated to root tissue density and root nitrogen. The heuristic model demonstrated that while thinner roots have inherently greater capacity to encounter soil resources based on higher surface area per unit mass, the potential for increased associations with mycorrhizal fungi in thicker roots, combined with greater hyphal growth, can result in equally acquisitive strategies for both thin- and thick roots. Taken together, our assessments of root trait variation, trade-offs with mycorrhizal fungi, and broader connections to root longevity allowed us to propose a series of fundamental constraints on belowground resource acquisition strategies. Physical tradeoffs based on root construction (i.e., economic traits) and functional limitations related to the capacity of a root to encounter and acquire soil resources combine to limit the two-dimensional belowground trait space. Within this trait space there remains a diversity of additional variation in root traits that facilitates a wide range of belowground resource acquisition strategies.

AB As many as 22 of the 45 coral species on the Florida Reef Tract are currently affected by stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD). The ongoing disease outbreak was first observed in 2014 in Southeast Florida near Miami and as of early 2019 has been documented from the northernmost reaches of the reef tract in Martin County down to Key West. We examined the microbiota associated with disease lesions and apparently healthy tissue on diseased colonies of Montastraea cavernosa, Orbicella faveolata, Diploria labyrinthiformis, and Dichocoenia stokesii. Analysis of differentially abundant taxa between disease lesions and apparently healthy tissue identified five unique amplicon sequence variants enriched in the diseased tissue in three of the coral species (all except O. faveolata), namely an unclassified genus of Flavobacteriales and sequences identified as Fusibacter (Clostridiales), Planktotalea (Rhodobacterales), Algicola (Alteromonadales), and Vibrio (Vibrionales). In addition, several groups of likely opportunistic or saprophytic colonizers such as Epsilonbacteraeota, Patescibacteria, Clostridiales, Bacteroidetes, and Rhodobacterales were also enriched in SCTLD disease lesions. This work represents the first microbiological characterization of SCTLD, as an initial step toward identifying the potential pathogen(s) responsible for SCTLD.

AB Evidence is growing that human modification of landscapes has dramatically altered evolutionary processes. In urban population genetic studies, urbanization is typically predicted to act as a barrier that isolates populations of species, leading to increased genetic drift within populations and reduced gene flow between populations. However, urbanization may also facilitate dispersal among populations, leading to higher genetic diversity within, and lower differentiation between, urban populations. We reviewed the literature on nonadaptive urban evolution to evaluate the support for each of these urban fragmentation and facilitation models. In a review of the literature with supporting quantitative analyses of 167 published urban population genetics studies, we found a weak signature of reduced within-population genetic diversity and no evidence of consistently increased between-population genetic differentiation associated with urbanization. In addition, we found that urban landscape features act as barriers or conduits to gene flow, depending on the species and city in question. Thus, we speculate that dispersal ability of species and environmental heterogeneity between cities contributes to the variation exhibited in our results. However, >90% of published studies reviewed here showed an association of urbanization with genetic drift or gene flow, highlighting the strong impact of urbanization on nonadaptive evolution. It is clear that species biology and city heterogeneity obscure patterns of genetic drift and gene flow in a quantitative analysis. Thus, we suggest that future research makes comparisons of multiple cities and nonurban habitats, and takes into consideration species' natural history, environmental variation, spatial modelling and marker selection.

AB Background: Mood disorders are common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Better tools are needed for their diagnosis and treatment. Deeper phenotypic understanding of these disorders is integral to the development of such tools. This study is the first effort to use passively collected mobile phone keyboard activity to build deep digital phenotypes of depression and mania.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between mobile phone keyboard activity and mood disturbance in subjects with bipolar disorders and to demonstrate the feasibility of using passively collected mobile phone keyboard metadata features to predict manic and depressive signs and symptoms as measured via clinician-administered rating scales.
   Methods: Using a within-subject design of 8 weeks, subjects were provided a mobile phone loaded with a customized keyboard that passively collected keystroke metadata. Subjects were administered the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) weekly. Linear mixed-effects models were created to predict HDRS and YMRS scores. The total number of keystrokes was 626,641, with a weekly average of 9791 (7861), and that of accelerometer readings was 6,660,890, with a weekly average 104,076 (68,912).
   Results: A statistically significant mixed-effects regression model for the prediction of HDRS-17 item scores was created: conditional R-2=.63, P=.01. A mixed-effects regression model for YMRS scores showed the variance accounted for by random effect was zero, and so an ordinary least squares linear regression model was created: R-2=.34, P=.001. Multiple significant variables were demonstrated for each measure.
   Conclusions: Mood states in bipolar disorder appear to correlate with specific changes in mobile phone usage. The creation of these models provides evidence for the feasibility of using passively collected keyboard metadata to detect and monitor mood disturbances.

AB Climate warming is substantially shifting the leaf phenological events of plants, and thereby impacting on their individual fitness and also on the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Previous studies have largely focused on the climate impact on spring phenology, and to date the processes underlying leaf senescence and their associated environmental drivers remain poorly understood. In this study, experiments with temperature gradients imposed during the summer and autumn were conducted on saplings of European beech to explore the temperature responses of leaf senescence. An additional warming experiment during winter enabled us to assess the differences in temperature responses of spring leaf-out and autumn leaf senescence. We found that warming significantly delayed the dates of leaf senescence both during summer and autumn warming, with similar temperature sensitivities (6-8days delay per degrees C warming), suggesting that, in the absence of water and nutrient limitation, temperature may be a dominant factor controlling the leaf senescence in European beech. Interestingly, we found a significantly larger temperature response of autumn leaf senescence than of spring leaf-out. This suggests a possible larger contribution of delays in autumn senescence, than of the advancement in spring leaf-out, to extending the growing season under future warmer conditions.

AB In the absence of broad-scale disturbance, many temperate coniferous forests experience successful seedling establishment only when abundant seed production coincides with favorable climate. Identifying the frequency of past establishment events and the climate conditions favorable for seedling establishment is essential to understanding how climate warming could affect the frequency of future tree establishment events and therefore future forest composition or even persistence of a forest cover. In the southern Rocky Mountains, USA, research on the sensitivity of establishment of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa)two widely distributed, co-occurring conifers in North Americato climate variability has focused on the alpine treeline ecotone, leaving uncertainty about the sensitivity of these species across much of their elevation distribution. We compared annual germination dates for >450 Engelmann spruce and >500 subalpine fir seedlings collected across a complex topographic-moisture gradient to climate variability in the Colorado Front Range. We found that Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir established episodically with strong synchrony in establishment events across the study area. Broad-scale establishment events occurred in years of high soil moisture availability, which were characterized by above-average snowpack and/or cool and wet summer climatic conditions. In the recent half of the study period (1975-2010), a decrease in the number of fir and spruce establishment events across their distribution coincided with declining snowpack and a multi-decadal trend of rising summer temperature and increasing moisture deficits. Counter to expected and observed increases in tree establishment with climate warming in maritime subalpine forests, our results show that recruitment declines will likely occur across the core of moisture-limited subalpine tree ranges as warming drives increased moisture deficits.

AB Many regions on Earth are expected to become drier with climate change, which may impact nitrogen (N) cycling rates and availability. We used a meta-analytical approach on the results of field experiments that reduced precipitation and measured N supply (i.e., indices of N mineralization), soil microbial biomass, inorganic N pools (ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-)), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. We hypothesized that N supply and N2O emissions would be relatively insensitive to precipitation reduction and that reducing precipitation would increase extractable NH4+ and NO3- concentrations because microbial processes continue, whereas plant N uptake diminishes with drought. In support of this hypothesis, extractable NH4+ increased by 25% overall with precipitation reduction; NH4+ also increased significantly with increasing magnitude of precipitation reduction. In contrast, N supply and extractable NO3- did not change and N2O emissions decreased with reduced precipitation. Across studies microbial biomass appeared unchanged, yet from the diversity of studies, it was clear that proportionally smaller precipitation reductions increased microbial biomass, whereas larger proportional reductions in rainfall reduced microbial biomass; there was a positive intercept (P = 0.005) and a significant negative slope (P = 0.0002) for the regression of microbial biomass versus % precipitation reduction (LnR = -0.009 x (% precipitation reduction) + 0.4021). Our analyses imply that relative to other N variables, N supply is less sensitive to reduced precipitation, whereas processes producing N2O decline. Drought intensity and duration, through sustained N supply, may control how much N becomes vulnerable to loss via hydrologic and gaseous pathways upon rewetting dry soils.

AB In the Anthropocene, alien species are no longer the only category of biological organism establishing and rapidly spreading beyond historical boundaries. We review evidence showing that invasions by native species are a global phenomenon and present case studies from Southern Africa, and elsewhere, that reveal how climate-mediated expansions of native plants into adjacent communities can emulate the functional and structural changes associated with invasions by alien plant species. We conclude that integrating native invasions into ecological practice and theory will improve mechanistic models and better inform policy and adaptive ecological management in the 21st century.

AB Herbivory is a fundamental process that controls primary producer abundance and regulates energy and nutrient flows to higher trophic levels. Despite the recent proliferation of small-scale studies on herbivore effects on aquatic plants, there remains limited understanding of the factors that control consumer regulation of vascular plants in aquatic ecosystems. Our current knowledge of the regulation of primary producers has hindered efforts to understand the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and to manage such ecosystems effectively. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the outcomes of plant-herbivore interactions using a data set comprised of 326 values from 163 studies, in order to test two mechanistic hypotheses: first, that greater negative changes in plant abundance would be associated with higher herbivore biomass densities; second, that the magnitude of changes in plant abundance would vary with herbivore taxonomic identity. We found evidence that plant abundance declined with increased herbivore density, with plants eliminated at high densities. Significant between-taxa differences in impact were detected, with insects associated with smaller reductions in plant abundance than all other taxa. Similarly, birds caused smaller reductions in plant abundance than echinoderms, fish, or molluscs. Furthermore, larger reductions in plant abundance were detected for fish relative to crustaceans. We found a positive relationship between herbivore species richness and change in plant abundance, with the strongest reductions in plant abundance reported for low herbivore species richness, suggesting that greater herbivore diversity may protect against large reductions in plant abundance. Finally, we found that herbivore-plant nativeness was a key factor affecting the magnitude of herbivore impacts on plant abundance across a wide range of species assemblages. Assemblages comprised of invasive herbivores and native plant assemblages were associated with greater reductions in plant abundance compared with invasive herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and mixed-nativeness plants, and native herbivores and native plants. By contrast, assemblages comprised of native herbivores and invasive plants were associated with lower reductions in plant abundance compared with both mixed-nativeness herbivores and native plants, and native herbivores and native plants. However, the effects of herbivore-plant nativeness on changes in plant abundance were reduced at high herbivore densities. Our mean reductions in aquatic plant abundance are greater than those reported in the literature for terrestrial plants, but lower than aquatic algae. Our findings highlight the need for a substantial shift in how biologists incorporate plant-herbivore interactions into theories of aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning. Currently, the failure to incorporate top-down effects continues to hinder our capacity to understand and manage the ecological dynamics of habitats that contain aquatic plants.

AB For more than 50 years ecological niches have been defined as combinations of multidimensional environmental conditions permitting a species to survive and reproduce. A fundamental niche (N-F) is defined as the set of conditions within which a species can live in the absence of competitors, and a realized niche (N-R) is a N-F hypothetically reduced by competitive interactions (and some other limiting factors). This definition implies that N-F is "larger" than N-R, something that has been nearly universally accepted by ecologists. However, there have been few attempts at empirical tests. Here, we present a novel quantitative test using one-dimensional estimates of N-F for 105 species of reptiles and amphibians, and estimates of N-R obtained from similar to 1.4 x 10(4) field observations. To specify our test, we operationalize the original classification of niche types. Our results predominantly support the hypothesis that N-F 'is larger' than N-R and we highlight the theoretical and practical importance of quantifying niches.

AB Aim Biodiversity studies typically use species, or more recently phylogenetic diversity (PD), as their analysis unit and produce a single map of observed diversity. However, observed biodiversity is not necessarily an indicator of significant biodiversity and therefore should not be used alone. By applying a small number of additional metrics to PD, with associated statistical tests, we can determine whether more or less of the phylogeny occurs in an area, whether branch lengths in an area are longer or shorter, and whether more long or short-branched endemism occurs in an area, than expected under a null model.
   Location Australian continent.
   Methods We used a phylogeny sampling 90% of Australia's angiosperm genera, and 3.4 million georeferenced plant specimens downloaded from Australia's Virtual Herbarium (AVH), to calculate PD, relative phylogenetic diversity (RPD) and relative phylogenetic endemism (RPE). Categorical analysis of neo-and palaeo-endemism (CANAPE) and randomization tests were performed to determine statistical significance.
   Results We identify several combinations of significant PD and endemism across the continent that are not seen using observed diversity patterns alone. Joint interpretation of these combinations complements the previous interpretations of Australia's plant evolutionary history. Of conservation concern, only 42% of the significant endemism cells found here overlap with existing nature reserves.
   Main conclusions These spatial phylogenetic methods are feasible to apply to a whole flora at the continental scale. Observed richness or PD is inadequate to fully understand the patterns of biodiversity. The combination of statistical tests applied here can be used to better explain biodiversity patterns and the evolutionary and ecological processes that have created them. The spatial phylogenetic methods used in this paper can be also be used to identify conservation priorities at any geographical scale or taxonomic level.

AB Multiple niche-based processes including conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) determine plant regeneration and community structure. We ask how interspecific and intraspecific density-dependent interactions relate to plant life histories and associated functional traits. Using hierarchical models, we analysed how such interactions affected first-year survival of seedling recruits of 175 species in a tropical forest, and how species abundances and functional traits are related to interspecific variation in density-dependent effects. Conspecific seedling neighbour effects prevailed over the effects of larger conspecific and all heterospecific neighbours. Tolerance of seedling CNDD enhanced recruit survival and subsequent abundance, all of which were greater among larger seeded, slow-growing and well-defended species. Niche differentiation along the growth-survival trade-off and tolerance of seedling CNDD strongly correlated with regeneration success, with manifest consequences for community structure. The ability of larger seeded species to better tolerate CNDD suggests a novel mechanism for CNDD to contribute to seed-size variation and promote species coexistence through a tolerance-fecundity trade-off.

AB The proliferation of low-cost IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee wireless devices in critical infrastructure applications presents security challenges. Network security commonly relies on bit-level credentials that are easily replicated and exploited by hackers. Unauthorized access can be mitigated by physical layer (PHY) security measures that exploit device-dependent emission characteristics that are sufficiently unique to discriminate devices. RF distinct native attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprinting is a PHY-based security measure, which computes statistical features extracted from such device emissions. However, the RF-DNA fingerprints can be numerous, correlated, and noisy, therefore, a dimensional reduction analysis (DRA) via feature selection is, therefore, of interest. Device classification with DRA feature subsets is evaluated using a multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) classifier. Determining feature relevance from MDA was generally dismissed in prior RF fingerprinting work and is seldom considered in other applications. Here, the MDA feature relevance is revisited using a proposed eigen-based MDA loadings fusion (MLF) methodology. The MDA classification models are adopted and used to assess device identification (ID) classification and verification performance for both the authorized and unauthorized (rogue) devices using a claimed versus actual biometric methodology. Performance is compared for six DRA methods using: 1) a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; 2) one-way analysis of variance F-test statistics; 3) a Wilk's lambda ratio; 4) generalized relevance learning vector quantized-improved relevance; 5) randomly selected; and 6) the proposed MLF method. Quantitative and qualitative dimensionality assessment methods are compared and contrasted to establish upper bounds on the number of retained features. Experimentally collected ZigBee emissions are considered and ZigBee device classification and ID verification performance using DRA subsets are compared with a full-dimensional feature set. Results show that DRA via the proposed MLF method is superior and more robust than competing methods.

AB Incorporating connectivity into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) has met with conceptual, theoretical, and practical challenges, which include: 1) the need to consider connectivity for multiple species with different dispersal abilities, and 2) the role played by variable habitat quality in determining the spatial patterns of connectivity. We propose an innovative approach, combining biophysical modeling with a routinely-used tool for marine-reserve design (Marxan), to address both challenges by using ecologically-informed connectivity parameters. We showed how functional demographic connectivity for four candidate reef-associated species with varying dispersal abilities and a suite of connectivity metrics weighted by habitat quality can be used to set conservation objectives and inform MPA placement. Overall, the strength of dispersal barriers varied across modeled species and, also across species, we found a lack of spatial concordance of reefs that were high-quality sources, self-persistent, and stepping-stones. Including spatially-heterogeneous habitat quality made a considerable difference to connectivity patterns, significantly reducing the potential reproductive output from many reefs. We also found that caution is needed in combining connectivity data from modeled species into multi-species matrices, which do not perform reliably as surrogates for all connectivity metrics of individual species. We then showed that restricting the habitat available for conservation has an inequitable impact on different connectivity objectives and species, with greatest impact on betweenness centrality and long-distance dispersers. We used Brazilian coral reefs as a case study but our approach is applicable to both marine and terrestrial conservation planning, and offers a holistic way to design functionally-connected reserves to tackle the complex issues relevant to planning for persistence.

AB Conservation scientists emphasize the importance of maintaining a connected network of protected areas to prevent ecosystems and populations from becoming isolated, reduce the risk of extinction, and ultimately sustain biodiversity. Keeping protected areas connected in a network is increasingly recognized as a conservation priority in the current era of rapid climate change. Models that identify suitable linkages between core areas have been used to prioritize potentially important corridors for maintaining functional connectivity. Here, we identify the most "natural" (i.e., least human-modified) corridors between large protected areas in the contiguous Unites States. We aggregated results from multiple connectivity models to develop a composite map of corridors reflecting agreement of models run under different assumptions about how human modification of land may influence connectivity. To identify which land units are most important for sustaining structural connectivity, we used the composite map of corridors to evaluate connectivity priorities in two ways: (1) among land units outside of our pool of large core protected areas and (2) among units administratively protected as Inventoried Roadless (IRAs) or Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs). Corridor values varied substantially among classes of "unprotected" non-core land units, and land units of high connectivity value and priority represent diverse ownerships and existing levels of protections. We provide a ranking of IRAs and WSAs that should be prioritized for additional protection to maintain minimal human modification. Our results provide a coarsescale assessment of connectivity priorities for maintaining a connected network of protected areas.

AB There is increased recognition of a common suite of global challenges that hamper food system sustainability at the community scale. Food price volatility, shortages of basic commodities, increased global rates of obesity and non-communicable food-related diseases, and land grabbing are among the impediments to socially just, economically robust, ecologically regenerative and politically inclusive food systems. While international political initiatives taken in response to these challenges (e.g. Via Campesina) and the groundswell of local alternatives emerging in response to challenges are well documented, more attention is needed to the analysis of similarities between community approaches to global pressures. While we are not suggesting the application of a template set of good practices, the research reported in this paper point to the benefits of both sharing good practices and enabling communities to adopt good practices that are suited to their place-based capacities. The work also suggests that sharing community-derived good practices can support and reinforce global networks of sustainable community food systems, foster knowledge co-creation and ultimately cement collective action to global pressures. In turn these networks could enhance the sustainability and resilience of community food systems and facilitate wide scale food system transformation.

AB Although invasive plants are a major source of terrestrial ecosystem degradation worldwide, it remains unclear which trophic levels above the base of the food web are most vulnerable to plant invasions. We performed a meta-analysis of 38 independent studies from 32 papers to examine how invasive plants alter major groupings of primary and secondary consumers in three globally distributed ecosystems: wetlands, woodlands and grasslands. Within each ecosystem we examined if green (grazing) food webs are more sensitive to plant invasions compared to brown (detrital) food webs. Invasive plants have strong negative effects on primary consumers (detritivores, bacterivores, fungivores, and/or herbivores) in woodlands and wetlands, which become less abundant in both green and brown food webs in woodlands and green webs in wetlands. Plant invasions increased abundances of secondary consumers (predators and/or parasitoids) only in woodland brown food webs and green webs in wetlands. Effects of invasive plants on grazing and detrital food webs clearly differed between ecosystems. Overall, invasive plants had the most pronounced effects on the trophic structure of wetlands and woodlands, but caused no detectable changes to grassland trophic structure.

AB Mountain ecosystems have been less adversely affected by invasions of non-native plants than most other ecosystems, partially because most invasive plants in the lowlands are limited by climate and cannot grow under harsher high-elevation conditions. However, with ongoing climate change, invasive species may rapidly move upwards and threaten mid-, and then high-elevation mountain ecosystems. We evaluated this threat by modeling the current and future habitat suitability for 48 invasive plant species in Switzerland and New South Wales, Australia. Both regions had contrasting climate interactions with elevation, resulting in possible different responses of species distributions to climate change. Using a species distribution modeling approach that combines data from two spatial scales, we built high-resolution species distribution models (<= 250 m) that account for the global climatic niche of species and also finer variables depicting local climate and disturbances. We found that different environmental drivers limit the elevation range of invasive species in each of the two regions, leading to region-specific species responses to climate change. The optimal suitability for plant invaders is predicted to markedly shift from the lowland to the montane or subalpine zone in Switzerland, whereas the upward shift is far less pronounced in New South Wales where montane and subalpine elevations are already suitable. The results suggest that species most likely to invade high elevations in Switzerland will be cold-tolerant, whereas species with an affinity to moist soils are most likely to invade higher elevations in Australia. Other plant traits were only marginally associated with elevation limits. These results demonstrate that a more systematic consideration of future distributions of invasive species is required in conservation plans of not yet invaded mountainous ecosystems.

AB Critical political analyses on decentralisation policies have revealed that such approaches may not achieve their formal goal, and might even support centralisation efforts. A number of previous studies on decentralisation separated the analyses of administrative process from the analyses of political power of administrative actors across levels of government. Using bureaucratic politics theory, this article presents close examinations of both process and power relations reconfigured by decentralising and recentralising forces across governmental levels. This study illustrates how the Indonesian central government is on its way to reclaiming its authority for forest administration and management through so-called Forest Management Units (FMU) and closely related community forestry programmes. This study reveals that the sources of real contention in KPH and community forestry policies are the power struggles between national, provincial and district bureaucracies. The conceptual model and the results of this study contribute to the understanding of underlying dynamics of bureaucratic politics in the process of political power reconfigurations.

AB Nitrogen (N) deposition in China has increased greatly, but the general impact of elevated N deposition on carbon (C) dynamics in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems is not well documented. In this study we used a meta-analysis method to compile 88 studies on the effects of N deposition C cycling on Chinese terrestrial ecosystems. Our results showed that N addition did not change soil C pools but increased above-ground plant C pool. A large decrease in below-ground plant C pool was observed. Our result also showed that the impacts of N addition on ecosystem C dynamics depend on ecosystem type and rate of N addition. Overall, our findings suggest that 1) decreased below-ground plant C pool may limit long-term soil C sequestration; and 2) it is better to treat N-rich and N-limited ecosystems differently in modeling effects of N deposition on ecosystem C cycle.

AB Oyster reefs form over extensive areas and the diversity and productivity of sheltered coasts depend on them. Due to the relatively recent population growth of coastal settlements in Australia, we were able to evaluate the collapse and extirpation of native oyster reefs (Ostrea angasi) over the course of a commercial fishery. We used historical records to quantify commercial catch of O. angasi in southern Australia from early colonization, around 1836, to some of the last recorded catches in 1944 and used our estimates of catch and effort to map their past distribution and assess oyster abundance over 180 years. Significant declines in catch and effort occurred from 1886 to 1946 and no native oyster reefs occur today, but historically oyster reefs extended across more than 1,500 km of coastline. That oyster reefs were characteristic of much of the coastline of South Australia from 1836 to 1910 appears not to be known because there is no contemporary consideration of their ecological and economic value. Based on the concept of a shifted baseline, we consider this contemporary state to reflect a collective, intergenerational amnesia. Our model of generational amnesia accounts for differences in intergenerational expectations of food, economic value, and ecosystem services of nearshore areas. An ecological system that once surrounded much of the coast and possibly the past presence of oyster reefs altogether may be forgotten and could not only undermine progress towards their recovery, but also reduce our expectations of these coastal ecosystems. La Perdida de una Linea de Base Ecologica por Medio de la Erradicacion de Arrecifes de Ostion de los Ecosistemas Costeros y la Memoria Humana
   Resumen Los arrecifes de ostion se forman a lo largo de areas extensas y tanto la diversidad y como la productividad de las costas resguardadas dependen de ellos. Debido al incremento relativamente reciente del crecimiento poblacional en Australia, pudimos evaluar el colapso y la extirpacion de arrecifes del ostion nativo Ostrea angasi durante el desarrollo de una pesqueria comercial. Usamos registros historicos para cuantificar la captura comercial de O. angasi en el sur de Australia desde la colonizacion temprana, aproximadamente 1836, hasta algunas de las ultimas capturas registradas en 1944. Usamos nuestras estimaciones de captura y esfuerzo para mapear su distribucion anterior y evaluar la abundancia de los ostiones a lo largo de 180 anos. De 1886 hasta 1946 ocurrieron declinaciones significativas en la captura y el esfuerzo y en la actualidad no existen arrecifes de ostion nativo, pero estos se extendian historicamente a lo largo de mas de 1, 500 km de linea costera. Parece no ser conocido que estos arrecifes fueron caracteristicos de la mayor parte de la linea costera del sur de Australia de 1836 hasta 1910 porque no hay una consideracion contemporanea de su valor ecologico y economico. Con base en el concepto de una linea de base modificada, consideramos que este estado contemporaneo refleja una amnesia inter-generacional y colectiva. Nuestro modelo de una amnesia generacional representa diferencias en las expectativas inter-generacionales de alimento, valor economico y servicios ambientales de areas cercanas a la costa. Que un sistema ecologico que alguna vez rodeo una gran parte de la costa y posiblemente la presencia anterior de arrecifes de ostion probablemente esten olvidados, en conjunto puede no solamente debilitar el progreso hacia la recuperacion, sino tambien reducir nuestras expectativas de estos sistemas costeros.

AB Interannual variability in climatic conditions should be taken into account in climate change studies in semi-arid ecosystems. It may determine differentiation in phenotypic plasticity among populations, with populations experiencing higher environmental heterogeneity showing higher levels of plasticity.
   The ability of populations to evolve key functional traits and plasticity may determine the survival of plant populations under the drier and more variable climate expected for semi-arid ecosystems.
   Working with populations of the semi-arid Chilean shrub Senna candolleana along its entire distribution range, we assessed inter- and intra-population variation in functional traits as well as in their plasticity in response to water availability. We measured morphological and physiological traits related to drought resistance in both field conditions and in a greenhouse experiment, where drought response was evaluated under two water availability treatments.
   All populations responded plastically, but higher precipitation heterogeneity in dry-edge populations seemed to have selected for more plastic genotypes compared to populations growing at mesic sites and with more homogeneous environmental conditions.
   Synthesis.Our results suggest adaptive plasticity since higher levels of phenotypic plasticity were positively associated with plant performance. However, we did not find evidence for genetic variation for plasticity within populations. To the extent that phenotypic plasticity may play a key role in future persistence, populations at mesic sites may be more vulnerable to climate change due to their lower plasticity and their current limitations to evolve novel norms of reaction. Conversely, although Senna candolleana populations at the dry edge are exposed to higher levels of stress, they may be less susceptible to climate change in view of their greater plasticity. We highlight the need to consider population differentiation in both mean traits and their plasticity to model realistic scenarios of species distribution under climate change.

AB In disciplines such as macroevolution that are not amenable to experimentation, scientists usually rely on current observations to test hypotheses about historical events, assuming that "the present is the key to the past." Biogeographers, for example, used this assumption to reconstruct ancestral ranges from the distribution of extant species. Yet, under scenarios of high extinction rates, the biodiversity we observe today might not be representative of the historical diversity and this could result in incorrect biogeographic reconstructions. Here, we introduce a new approach to incorporate into biogeographic inference the temporal, spatial, and environmental information provided by the fossil record, as a direct evidence of the extinct biodiversity fraction. First, inferences of ancestral ranges for those nodes in the phylogeny calibrated with the fossil record are constrained to include the geographic distribution of the fossil. Second, we use fossil distribution and past climate data to reconstruct the climatic preferences and potential distribution of ancestral lineages over time, and use this information to build a biogeographic model that takes into account "ecological connectivity" through time. To show the power of this approach, we reconstruct the biogeographic history of the large angiosperm genus Hypericum, which has a fossil record extending back to the Early Cenozoic. Unlike previous reconstructions based on extant species distributions, our results reveal that Hypericum stem lineages were already distributed in the Holarctic before diversification of its crown-group, and that the geographic distribution of the genus has been relatively stable throughout the climatic oscillations of the Cenozoic. Geographical movement was mediated by the existence of climatic corridors, like Beringia, whereas the equatorial tropical belt acted as a climatic barrier, preventing Hypericum lineages to reach the southern temperate regions. Our study shows that an integrative approach to historical biogeography-that combines sources of evidence as diverse as paleontology, ecology, and phylogenetics-could help us obtain more accurate reconstructions of ancient evolutionary history. It also reveals the confounding effect different rates of extinction across regions have in biogeography, sometimes leading to ancestral areas being erroneously inferred as recent colonization events.

AB The Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment-Global Nutrient Model (IMAGE-GNM) is a global distributed, spatially explicit model using hydrology as the basis for describing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) delivery to surface water, transport and in-stream retention in rivers, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs. It is part of the integrated assessment model IMAGE, which studies the interaction between society and the environment over prolonged time periods. In the IMAGE-GNM model, grid cells receive water with dissolved and suspended N and P from upstream grid cells; inside grid cells, N and P are delivered to water bodies via diffuse sources (surface runoff, shallow and deep groundwater, riparian zones; litterfall in floodplains; atmospheric deposition) and point sources (wastewater); N and P retention in a water body is calculated on the basis of the residence time of the water and nutrient uptake velocity; subsequently, water and nutrients are transported to downstream grid cells. Differences between model results and observed concentrations for a range of global rivers are acceptable given the global scale of the uncalibrated model. Sensitivity analysis with data for the year 2000 showed that runoff is a major factor for N and P delivery, retention and river export. For both N and P, uptake velocity and all factors used to compute the subgrid in-stream retention are important for total in-stream retention and river export. Soil N budgets, wastewater and all factors determining litterfall in floodplains are important for N delivery to surface water. For P the factors that determine the P content of the soil (soil P content and bulk density) are important factors for delivery and river export.

AB The extent of Dipterocarp rainforests on the emergent Sundaland landmass in Southeast Asia during Quaternary glaciations remains a key question. A better understanding of the biogeographic history of Sundaland could help explain current patterns of biodiversity and support the development of effective forest conservation strategies. Dipterocarpaceae trees dominate the rainforests of Sundaland, and their distributions serve as a proxy for rainforest extent. We used species distribution models (SDMs) of 317 Dipterocarp species to estimate the geographic extent of appropriate climatic conditions for rainforest on Sundaland at the last glacial maximum (LGM). The SDMs suggest that the climate of central Sundaland at the LGM was suitable to sustain Dipterocarp rainforest, and that the presence of a previously suggested transequatorial savannah corridor at that time is unlikely. Our findings are supported by palynologic evidence, dynamic vegetation models, extant mammal and termite communities, vascular plant fatty acid stable isotopic compositions, and stable carbon isotopic compositions of cave guano profiles. Although Dipterocarp species richness was generally lower at the LGM, areas of high species richness were mostly found off the current islands and on the emergent Sunda Shelf, indicating substantial species migration and mixing during the transitions between the Quaternary glacial maxima and warm periods such as the present.

AB The main objectives of this study are estimate a species-dense, time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae, and Otothyrinae, which together comprise a group of armoured catfishes that is widely distributed across South America, to place the origin of major clades in time and space, and to demonstrate the role of river capture on patterns of diversification in these taxa. We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to estimate a time-calibrated phylogeny of 115 loricariid species, using three mitochondrial and one nuclear genes to generate a matrix of 4,500 base pairs, and used parametric biogeographic analyses to estimate ancestral geographic ranges and to infer the effects of river capture events on the geographic distributions of these taxa. Our analysis recovered Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae, and Otothyrinae as monophyletic with strong statistical support, and Neoplecostominae as more closely related to Otothyrinae than to Hypoptopomatinae. Our time-calibrated phylogeny and ancestral-area estimations indicate an origin of Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae, and Otothyrinae during the Lower Eocene in the Atlantic Coastal Drainages, from which it is possible to infer several dispersal events to adjacent river basins during the Neogene. In conclusion we infer a strong influence of river capture in: (1) the accumulation of modern clade species-richness values; (2) the formation of the modern basin-wide species assemblages, and (3) the presence of many low-diversity, early-branching lineages restricted to the Atlantic Coastal Drainages. We further infer the importance of headwater stream capture and marine transgressions in shaping patterns in the distributions of Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae and Otothyrinae throughout South America.

AB In tropical forest ecosystems, highly weathered soils are often considered as relatively nitrogen-rich but phosphorus-poor. Nutrient availability greatly regulates ecosystem processes and functions of tropical forests. However, little is known about how nitrogen and/or phosphorus additions affect the conditions of soil food web which is an important component of belowground ecosystems. In the present study, soil nematode communities were monitored and served as indicators of soil food web conditions under experimental nitrogen and phosphorus additions in a secondary forest in tropical China. The principal response curves of soil nematode community structure revealed same tendency of changes under nitrogen and/or phosphorus additions compared with control, in terms of nematode functional guild compositions: apparent successions from communities dominated by He-3 and Ba-1 to communities dominated by Ba-2 and Fu(2) occurred after nitrogen and/or phosphorus additions. The diversity of soil nematode genera was not sensitive to either nitrogen or phosphorus addition. Phosphorus addition significantly suppressed total nematode density, density of omnivore-predators, and four nematode faunal indices (i.e. MI25, El, SI, and SFI), but increased two faunal indices (i.e. Cl and BaI). However, nitrogen addition did not induce remarkable changes of these variables in the present study. Our results suggest that nitrogen and/or phosphorus additions suppress soil nematodes in tropical secondary forests, which was inconsistent with our expectation that nitrogen addition was detrimental to and phosphorus addition was conducive to soil nematodes in this nitrogen-rich but phosphorus-poor soil. Furthermore, the effects of phosphorus addition are more powerful than the effects of nitrogen addition. Moreover, phosphorus addition degrades the structure and trophic links of the soil food web, reduces the carbon utilization of soil nematodes, and leads to a more fungal dominated decomposition pathway. The alterations of soil food web conditions might result in altered ecosystem functioning. Our findings could provide a better understanding of the responses of soil food web to nitrogen and phosphorus additions in nitrogen-rich but phosphorus-poor soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examine the impact of key personnel's loss to competition on their former employers' creative performance. Using archival data on the career histories of designers and the creative performance of their fashion houses between 2000 and 2010, we find that a house's outward centrality in the network of personnel mobility-resulting from personnel departures-has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the house's creative performance. This relationship is moderated by the house's inward centrality in a network of personnel mobility stemming from hiring competitors' employees, the tenure of its creative directors, the accomplishments of these directors, and the house's status. Our results suggest that organizations can enhance their creativity by relying on ideas obtained through relationships with their former employees long after these employees left to work for the competition. However, this effect is contingent upon characteristics of the organization that may be associated with its capacity to absorb these ideas and its ability to signal legitimacy of the resulting output to the external audiences.

AB Vector life-history traits and parasite development respond in strongly nonlinear ways to changes in temperature. These thermal sensitivities create the potential for climate change to have a marked impact on disease transmission. To date, most research considering impacts of climate change on vector-borne diseases assumes that all populations of a given parasite or vector species respond similarly to temperature, regardless of their source population. This may be an inappropriate assumption because spatial variation in selective pressures such as temperature can lead to local adaptation. We examine evidence for local adaptation in disease vectors and present conceptual models for understanding how local adaptation might modulate the effects of both short- and long-term changes in climate.

AB Accurate models for species' distributions are needed to forecast the progress and impacts of alien invasive species and assess potential range-shifting driven by global change. Although this has traditionally been achieved through data-driven correlative modelling, robustly extrapolating these models into novel climatic conditions is challenging. Recently, a small number of process-based or mechanistic distribution models have been developed to complement the correlative approaches. However, tests of these models are lacking, and there are very few process-based models for invasive species. We develop a method for estimating the range of a globally invasive species, common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), from a temperature- and photoperiod-driven phenology model. The model predicts the region in which ragweed can reach reproductive maturity before frost kills the adult plants in autumn. This aligns well with the poleward and high-elevation range limits in its native North America and in invaded Europe, clearly showing that phenological constraints determine the cold range margins of the species. Importantly, this is a forward' prediction made entirely independently of the distribution data. Therefore, it allows a confident and biologically informed forecasting of further invasion and range shifting driven by climate change. For ragweed, such forecasts are extremely important as the species is a serious crop weed and its airborne pollen is a major cause of allergy and asthma in humans. Our results show that phenology can be a key determinant of species' range margins, so integrating phenology into species distribution models offers great potential for the mechanistic modelling of range dynamics.

AB Integrated Assessment Models of global climate change (IAMs) are an established tool to study inter-linkages between the human and the natural system. Insights from these complex models are widely used to advise policy-makers and to inform the general public. But up to now there has been little understanding of how these models can be evaluated and community-wide standards are missing. To answer this urgent question is a challenge because the systems are open and their future behavior is fundamentally unknown. In this paper, we discuss ways to overcome these problems. Reflecting on experience from other modeling communities, we develop an evaluation framework for IAM of global climate change. It builds on a systematic and transparent step-by-step demonstration of a model's usefulness testing the plausibility of its behavior. Steps in the evaluation hierarchy are: setting up an evaluation framework, evaluation of the conceptual model, code verification and documentation, model evaluation, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, documentation of the evaluation process, and communication with stakeholders. An important element in evaluating IAM of global climate change is the use of stylized behavior patterns derived from historical observation. The discussion of two examples is offered in this paper.

AB Bone is capable of adapting during life in response to stress. Therefore, variation in locomotor and manipulative behaviours across extant hominoids may be reflected in differences in trabecular bone structure. The hand is a promising region for trabecular analysis, as it is the direct contact between the individual and the environment and joint positions at peak loading vary amongst extant hominoids. Building upon traditional volume of interest-based analyses, we apply a whole-epiphysis analytical approach using high-resolution microtomographic scans of the hominoid third metacarpal to investigate whether trabecular structure reflects differences in hand posture and loading in knuckle-walking (Gorilla, Pan), suspensory (Pongo, Hylobates and Symphalangus) and manipulative (Homo) taxa. Additionally, a comparative phylogenetic method was used to analyse rates of evolutionary changes in trabecular parameters. Results demonstrate that trabecular bone volume distribution and regions of greatest stiffness (i.e., Young's modulus) correspond with predicted loading of the hand in each behavioural category. In suspensory and manipulative taxa, regions of high bone volume and greatest stiffness are concentrated on the palmar or distopalmar regions of the metacarpal head, whereas knuckle-walking taxa show greater bone volume and stiffness throughout the head, and particularly in the dorsal region; patterns that correspond with the highest predicted joint reaction forces. Trabecular structure in knuckle-walking taxa is characterised by high bone volume fraction and a high degree of anisotropy in contrast to the suspensory brachiators. Humans, in which the hand is used primarily for manipulation, have a low bone volume fraction and a variable degree of anisotropy. Finally, when trabecular parameters are mapped onto a molecular-based phylogeny, we show that the rates of change in trabecular structure vary across the hominoid clade. Our results support a link between inferred behaviour and trabecular structure in extant hominoids that can be informative for reconstructing behaviour in fossil primates.

AB Cephalopods are an important prey resource for fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals, and are also voracious predators on crustaceans, fishes, squid and zooplankton. Because of their high feeding rates and abundance, squids have the potential to exert control on the recruitment of commercially important fishes. In this review, we synthesize the available information for two intrinsic markers (delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotopic values) in squids for all oceans and several types of ecosystems to obtain a global view of the trophic niches of squids in marine ecosystems. In particular, we aimed to examine whether the trophic positions and trophic widths of squid species vary among oceans and ecosystem types. To correctly compare across systems, we adjusted squid delta N-15 values for the isotopic variability of phytoplankton at the base of the food web provided by an ocean circulation biogeochemistry isotope model. Studies that focused on the trophic ecology of squids using isotopic techniques were few, and most of the information on squids was from studies on their predators. Our results showed that squids occupy a large range of trophic positions and exploit a large range of trophic resources, reflecting the versatility of their feeding behavior and confirming conclusions from food-web models. Clear differences in both trophic position and trophic width were found among oceans and ecosystem types. The study also reinforces the importance of considering the natural variation in isotopic values when comparing the isotopic values of consumers inhabiting different ecosystems.

AB Shifts in precipitation regimes are an inherent component of climate change, but in low-energy systems are often assumed to be less important than changes in temperature. Because soil moisture is the hydrological variable most proximally linked to plant performance during the growing season in arctic-alpine habitats, it may offer the most useful perspective on the influence of changes in precipitation on vegetation. Here we quantify the influence of soil moisture for multiple vegetation properties at fine spatial scales, to determine the potential importance of soil moisture under changing climatic conditions. A fine-scale data set, comprising vascular species cover and field-quantified ecologically relevant environmental parameters, was analysed to determine the influence of soil moisture relative to other key abiotic predictors. Soil moisture was strongly related to community composition, species richness and the occurrence patterns of individual species, having a similar or greater influence than soil temperature, pH and solar radiation. Soil moisture varied considerably over short distances, and this fine-scale heterogeneity may contribute to offsetting the ecological impacts of changes in precipitation for species not limited to extreme soil moisture conditions. In conclusion, soil moisture is a key driver of vegetation properties, both at the species and community level, even in this low-energy system. Soil moisture conditions represent an important mechanism through which changing climatic conditions impact vegetation, and advancing our predictive capability will therefore require a better understanding of how soil moisture mediates the effects of climate change on biota.

AB Quantitative information on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization of soil under different long term nutrient management strategies is essential for better assessment of N availability and loss of C and N from soil. A laboratory incubation study was conducted with soils (0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depth), collected from 41 years of rice-rice system to evaluate the differences in C and N mineralization kinetics due to long term fertilization treatments-control (Non fertilized), N, NPK, FYM (Farmyard manure), N + FYM and NPK + FYM, and to assess the C and N mineralization rates in soil under different moisture regimes, i.e. aerobic and submergence. Both long term fertilization and moisture regime significantly affected C and N mineralization in soil. Long term integrated application of chemical fertilizer and organic manure (NPK + FYM, N + FYM) in soil resulted in higher potentially mineralizable C (C-0), potentially mineralizable N (N-0), rates of mineralization (dC(min)/dt and dN(min)/dt), microbial and mineralization quotients as compared to either of them applied alone (N, NPK, and FYM). Higher values of C-0, N-0, and rates of mineralization were recorded under aerobic condition than that under submergence. The amount of N released per unit C mineralization was higher in aerobic system that may result in greater loss of N from the system. A judicious N application strategy through integration of both organic and inorganic sources is essential for improving current N supplying capacity of soil and maintaining soil organic C pool in aerobic system.

AB 1. Our ability to generalize about broad patterns and outcomes of competitive interactions among plants has improved from a better understanding of functional traits. Facilitative interactions among plants also exhibit strong trait-based patterns; however, very little empirical research has addressed the trait basis of different facilitative mechanisms or the applicability of traditionally defined functional strategies to facilitation.
   2. We present a series of predictions regarding the trait basis of a variety of facilitative mechanisms based on empirical patterns of trait responses to environmental filters and knowledge of plant-environment feedbacks.
   3. Using a leaf-height-seed framework to predict plant responses to facilitative effects of neighbours, we identify two categories of facilitative mechanisms based on similar predicted responses of specific leaf area (SLA), height and seed size: (i) facilitation of low-SLA, large-seeded and tall plants in environments typified by periodically unfavourable conditions; and (ii) facilitation of high-SLA, small-seeded and tall plants in persistently severe environments. We suggest that facilitation related to herbivory will be idiosyncratic with respect to these functional traits.
   4. Competition for limiting resources is predicted to reinforce trait-based responses to facilitation in periodically severe environments, particularly under light competition, but to offset facilitative effects to some degree in persistently severe environments. Thus, biotic interactions may have stronger consequences for shifts in trait distributions in environments typified by disturbance, pulsed soil moisture and short growing seasons limited by low temperatures.
   5. Facilitative effects, in addition to facilitative responses, may also be regulated by functional traits, but there is much less empirical evidence for links between functional traits and ameliorative effects on the environment. However, we predict that leaf area index or other integrative traits related to canopy density are likely to be important effect traits for most facilitative mechanisms and should be integrated into more trait-screening programs.
   6. Based on the exceptional contribution that trait-based approaches have made for understanding other interactions, we suggest that taking a functional comparative approach to facilitation is an opportunity to improve our ability to identify general patterns and consequences of positive interactions.

AB Variation in species' responses to abiotic phenological cues under climate change may cause changes in temporal overlap among interacting taxa, with potential demographic consequences. Here, we examine associations between the abiotic environment and plant-pollinator phenological synchrony using a long-term syrphid fly-flowering phenology dataset (1992-2011). Degree-days above freezing, precipitation, and timing of snow melt were investigated as predictors of phenology. Syrphids generally emerge after flowering onset and end their activity before the end of flowering. Neither flowering nor syrphid phenology has changed significantly over our 20-year record, consistent with a lack of directional change in climate variables over the same time frame. Instead we document interannual variability in the abiotic environment and phenology. Timing of snow melt was the best predictor of flowering onset and syrphid emergence. Snow melt and degree-days were the best predictors of the end of flowering, whereas degree-days and precipitation best predicted the end of the syrphid period. Flowering advanced at a faster rate than syrphids in response to both advancing snow melt and increasing temperature. Different rates of phenological advancements resulted in more days of temporal overlap between the flower-syrphid community in years of early snow melt because of extended activity periods. Phenological synchrony at the community level is therefore likely to be maintained for some time, even under advancing snow melt conditions that are evident over longer term records at our site. These results show that interacting taxa may respond to different phenological cues and to the same cues at different rates but still maintain phenological synchrony over a range of abiotic conditions. However, our results also indicate that some individual plant species may overlap with the syrphid community for fewer days under continued climate change. This highlights the role of interannual variation in these flower-syrphid interactions and shows that species-level responses can differ from community-level responses in nonintuitive ways.

AB Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an important tool to assess the impact of global environmental change. Many species exhibit ecologically relevant intraspecific variation, and few studies have analyzed its relevance for SDM. Here, we compared three SDM techniques for the highly variable species Pinus contorta. First, applying a conventional SDM approach, we used MaxEnt to model the subject as a single species (species model), based on presenceabsence observations. Second, we used MaxEnt to model each of the three most prevalent subspecies independently and combined their projected distributions (subspecies model). Finally, we used a universal growth transfer function (UTF), an approach to incorporate intraspecific variation utilizing provenance trial tree growth data. Different model approaches performed similarly when predicting current distributions. MaxEnt model discrimination was greater (AUC species model: 0.94, subspecies model: 0.95, UTF: 0.89), but the UTF was better calibrated (slope and bias species model: 1.31 and 0.58, subspecies model: 1.44 and 0.43, UTF: 1.01 and 0.04, respectively). Contrastingly, for future climatic conditions, projections of lodgepole pine habitat suitability diverged. In particular, when the species' intraspecific variability was acknowledged, the species was projected to better tolerate climatic change as related to suitable habitat without migration (subspecies model: 26% habitat loss or UTF: 24% habitat loss vs. species model: 60% habitat loss), and given unlimited migration may increase amount of suitable habitat (subspecies model: 8% habitat gain or UTF: 12% habitat gain vs. species model: 51% habitat loss) in the climatic period 20702100 (SRES A2 scenario, HADCM3). We conclude that models derived from within-species data produce different and better projections, and coincide with ecological theory. Furthermore, we conclude that intraspecific variation may buffer against adverse effects of climate change. A key future research challenge lies in assessing the extent to which species can utilize intraspecific variation under rapid environmental change.

AB Non-urbanized areas (NUAs) are outdoor places with significant amounts of vegetation. They are mainly semi-natural patches that represent the last remnants of nature in metropolitan areas. As part of the agricultural and green infrastructure they provide ecosystem services, such as purification of air and water, mitigation of floods and droughts, re-generation of soil fertility, moderation of temperature extremes and enhancing of landscape quality. Like all natural ecosystems. NUAs today are endangered by urban sprawl, which is the main cause of their fragmentation and loss of evapotranspiration features. For these reasons, the protection of these areas is a fundamental issue for land-use planning, and it requires appropriate strategies for their management. We propose a land-use suitability strategy, based on five different analytical phases, to address the land-use of NUAs: (1) land-use and land cover analysis quantifies the percentage of evapotranspiring surface for each land-use; (2) fragmentation analysis assesses the size and density of NUAs: (3) proximity analysis takes into account the degree to which NUAs are close to residential areas; (4) the results from these analyses are integrated in a land-use suitability matrix, which produces as output a new scenario of prospective land-uses for NUAs; (5) a compatibility matrix verifies the correspondence of these new land-uses with the current ones to confirm or modify the proposed land-uses. The resulting scenario allows to enhance the production of ecosystem services and define new appropriate land-uses for NUAs within the agricultural and green infrastructure. The method is tested on three municipalities within the Catania metropolitan area (Italy), characterized by a considerable urban sprawl. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global environmental challenges require approaches that integrate biodiversity conservation, food production, and livelihoods at landscape scales. We reviewed the approach of conserving biodiversity on "high-nature-value" (HNV) farmland, covering 75 million ha in Europe, from a resilience perspective. Despite growing recognition in natural resource policies, many HNV farmlands have vanished, and the remaining ones are vulnerable to socioeconomic changes. Using landscape-level cases across Europe, we considered the following social-ecological system properties and components and their integration into HNV farmland management: (1) coupling of social and ecological systems, (2) key variables, (3) adaptive cycles, (4) regime shifts, (5) cascading effects, (6) ecosystem stewardship and collaboration, (7) social capital, and (8) traditional ecological knowledge. We argue that previous conservation efforts for HNV farmland have focused too much on static, isolated, and monosectoral conservation strategies, and that stimulation of resilience and adaptation is essential for guiding HNV farmland through rapid change.

AB Current research on macronutrient cycling in UK agricultural systems aims to optimise soil and nutrient management for improved agricultural production and minimise effects on the environment and provision of ecosystem services. Nutrient use inefficiencies can cause environmental pollution through the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and of soluble and particulate forms of N, P and carbon (C) in leachate and run-off into watercourses. Improving nutrient use efficiencies in agriculture calls for the development of sustainable nutrient management strategies: more efficient use of mineral fertilisers, increased recovery and recycling of waste nutrients, and, better exploitation of the substantial inorganic and organic reserves of nutrients in the soil. Long-term field experimentation in the UK has provided key knowledge of the main nutrient transformations in agricultural soils. Emerging analytical technologies, especially stable isotope labelling, that better characterise macronutrient forms and bioavailability and improve the quantification of the complex relationships between the macronutrients in soils at the molecular scale, are augmenting this knowledge by revealing the underlying processes. The challenge for the future is to determine the relationships between the dynamics of N, P and C across scales, which will require both new modelling approaches and integrated approaches to macronutrient cycling.

AB Sea ice conditions in the Antarctic affect the life cycle of the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). We present a population projection for the emperor penguin population of Terre Adelie, Antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SICa) affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual SICa, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in SICa. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in Terre Adelie. The output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of SICa, which in turn drive the population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adelie emperor penguin population of 81% by the year 2100. We find a 43% chance of an even greater decline, of 90% or more. The uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than population increases. We conclude that climate change is a significant risk for the emperor penguin. Our analytical approach, in which demographic models are linked to IPCC climate models, is powerful and generally applicable to other species and systems.

AB In response to climate change and other threatening processes there is renewed interest in the role of refugia and refuges. In bioregions that experience drought and fire, micro-refuges can play a vital role in ensuring the persistence of species. We develop and apply an approach to identifying potential micro-refuges based on a time series of remotely sensed vegetation greenness (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the sunlit canopy; fPAR). The primary data for this analysis were NASA MODIS 16-day L3 Global 250 m (MOD13Q1) satellite imagery. This method draws upon relevant ecological theory (source sink habitats, habitat templet) to calculate a micro-refuge index, which is analyzed for each of the major vegetation ecosystems in the case-study region (the Great Eastern Ranges of New South Wales, Australia). Potential ecosystem greenspots were identified, at a range of thresholds, based on an index derived from: the mean and coefficient of variance (COV) of fPAR over the 10-year time series; the minimum mean annual (PAR; and the COV of the 12 values of mean monthly fPAR. These greenspots were mapped and compared with (1) an index of vascular plant species composition, (2) environmental variables, and (3) protected areas. Potential micro-refuges were found within all vegetation ecosystem types. The total area of ecosystem greenspots within the upper 25% threshold was 48 406 ha; around 0.2% of the total area of native vegetation (23.9 x 10(6) ha) in the study region. The total area affected by fire was 3.4 x 10(6) ha. The results of the environmental diagnostic analysis suggest deterministic controls on the geographical distribution of potential micro-refuges that may continue to function under climate change. The approach is relevant to other regions of the world where the role of micro-refuges in the persistence of species is recognized, including across the world's arid zones and, in particular, for the Australian, southern African, and South American continents. Micro-refuge networks may play an important role in maintaining beta-diversity at the bio-region scale and contribute to the stability, resilience, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems in the face of ever-growing pressures from human-forced climate change, land use, and other threatening processes.

TI Contrasting patterns in species richness of birds, butterflies and

AB Aim Urbanization is a major driver of global land-use change, substantially modifying patterns of biodiversity. Managing these impacts has become a conservation priority. The creation and maintenance of greenways, such as river corridors, is frequently promoted as a strategy for mitigating habitat fragmentation in urban areas by bringing semi-natural habitat cover into city centres. However, there is little evidence to support this assertion. Here, we examine whether riparian zones maintain semi-natural habitat cover in urban areas and how species richness varies along such zones. Location Sheffield, Northern England. Methods Multiple taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies, plants) were surveyed at 105 sites spanning seven riparian corridors that transect the study system. For all groups, we model the relationships between species richness and environmental variables pertinent to an urban system. To test whether riparian zones can act to maintain semi-natural habitats within a city, we modelled the proportion of semi-natural land cover within 250 m grid squares that do, and do not, contain a river. Results Species richness varied markedly in relation to distance from the urban core. Trends differed both between taxonomic groups and between rivers, reflecting the complex patterns of environmental variation associated with cities. This suggests that biodiversity surveys that focus on a single group or transect cannot reliably be used as surrogates even within the same city. Nonetheless, there were common environmental predictors of species richness. Plant, avian and butterfly richness all responded positively to Habitat Diversity and the latter two declined with increases in sealed surface. Main conclusions Multiple transects and taxonomic groups are required to describe species richness responses to urbanization as no single pattern is evident. Although riparian zones are an important component of the mosaic of urban habitats, we find that river corridors do not disproportionately support tree and Natural Surface Cover when compared to non-riverine urban areas.

AB Natural populations are confronted with multiple selection pressures resulting in a mosaic of environmental stressors at the landscape level. Identifying the genetic underpinning of adaptation to these complex selection environments and assigning causes of natural selection within multidimensional selection regimes in the wild is challenging. The water flea Daphnia is a renowned ecological model system with its well-documented ecology, the possibility to analyse subfossil dormant egg banks and the short generation time allowing an experimental evolution approach. Capitalizing on the strengths of this model system, we here link candidate genome regions to three selection pressures, known to induce micro-evolutionary responses in Daphnia magna: fish predation, parasitism and land use. Using a genome scan approach in space, time and experimental evolution trials, we provide solid evidence of selection at the genome level under well-characterized environmental gradients in the wild and identify candidate genes linked to the three environmental stressors. Our study reveals differential selection at the genome level in Daphnia populations and provides evidence for repeatable patterns of local adaptation in a geographic mosaic of environmental stressors fuelled by standing genetic variation. Our results imply high evolutionary potential of local populations, which is relevant to understand the dynamics of trait changes in natural populations and their impact on community and ecosystem responses through eco-evolutionary feedbacks.

ID WATER-QUALITY; CONSERVATION; INDICATORS; RECOVERY
AB The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated ecosystem assessments.

AB Research on tropical dry forest (TDF) succession i0s needed for effective conservation and management of this threatened and understudied ecosystem. We used a highly replicated chronosequence within a 37,242-ha TDF landscape to investigate successional patterns by plant size class and to evaluate the influence of stand age, topographic position, soil properties and spatial autocorrelation on forest structure and composition. We used a SPOT5 satellite image to obtain a land-cover thematic map, and sampled woody vegetation (adults: >5 cm diam; saplings: 15 cm) and soil properties in 168 plots distributed among four vegetation classes: VC1 (38-yr-old forest), VC2 (915-yr-old forest), VC3 (>15-yr-old forest on flat areas), VC4 (>15-yr-old forest on hills). Stem density decreased with stand age and was lowest in VC3, while height, basal area and species density increased with age and were higher in older than in younger forests. Topographic position also influenced forest structure and composition. Basal area and height were largely determined by stand age, whereas stem and species density, and composition were influenced mostly by soil variables associated with fertility, and by spatial autocorrelation. Adults and saplings showed contrasting patterns and correlates of community structure, but similar patterns and correlates of composition, possibly due to the prevalence of coppicing. Our results show that our sampling approach can overcome several limitations of chronosequence studies, and provide insights in the patterns and drivers of succession, as well as guidelines for forest management and conservation.

AB We apply the concept of biodiversity hotspot analysis (the identification of biogeographical regions of high species diversity) to identify invasion hotspots areas of potentially suitable climate for multiple non-native plant species in Australia under current and future climates. We used the species distribution model Maxent to model climate suitability surfaces for 72 taxa, recognized as Weeds of National Significance (WoNS) in Australia, under current and projected climate for 2020 and 2050. Current climate suitability layers were summed across all 72 species, and we observed two regions of high climatic suitability corresponding to the top 25th percentile of combined climatic suitability values across Australia. We defined these as potential invasion hotspots. Areas of climatic suitability equivalent to the hotspot regions were identified in the composite maps for 2020 and 2050, to track spatial changes in the hotspots over the two time steps. Two potential invasion hotspot regions were identified under current and projected climates: the south west corner of Western Australia (SW), and south eastern Australia (SE). Herbarium data confirmed the presence of 73% and 99% of those species predicted to be in each hotspot respectively, suggesting that the SE has greater invasion potential. The area of both hotspots was predicted to retract southward and towards the coast under future climate scenarios, reducing in size by 81% (SW) and 71% (SE) by 2050. This reduction was driven by the dominance of southern temperate invasive plant species in the WoNS list (47 of the 72), of which 44 were predicted to experience reductions in their bioclimatic range by 2050. While climate is likely to become less suitable for the majority of WoNS in the future, potential invasion hotspots based on climate suitability are likely to remain in the far south of eastern Australia, and in the far south west of Western Australia by 2050.

AB High precision measurements of Delta C-14 were conducted for monthly samples of CO2 from seven global stations over 2- to 16-year periods ending in 2007. Mean Delta C-14 over 2005-07 in the Northern Hemisphere was 5 parts per thousand lower than Delta C-14 in the Southern Hemisphere, similar to recent observations from I. Levin. This is a significant shift from 1988-89 when Delta C-14 in the Northern Hemisphere was slightly higher than the South. The influence of fossil fuel CO2 emission and transport was simulated for each of the observation sites by the TM3 atmospheric transport model and compared to other models that participated in the Transcom 3 Experiment. The simulated interhemispheric gradient caused by fossil fuel CO2 emissions was nearly the same in both 1988-89 and 2005-07, due to compensating effects from rising emissions and decreasing sensitivity of Delta C-14 to fossil fuel CO2. The observed 5 parts per thousand shift must therefore have been caused by non-fossil influences, most likely due to changes in the air-sea C-14 flux in the Southern Ocean. Seasonal cycles with higher Delta C-14 in summer or fall were evident at most stations, with largest amplitudes observed at Point Barrow (71 degrees N) and La Jolla (32 degrees N). Fossil fuel emissions do not account for the seasonal cycles of Delta C-14 in either hemisphere, indicating strong contributions from non-fossil influences, most likely from stratosphere-troposphere exchange.

AB Phytoliths are noncrystalline minerals that form inside cells and cell walls of different parts of plants. Organic carbon in living cells can be occluded in phytoliths during plant growth. It has been documented that the occluded carbon within phytoliths is an important long-term terrestrial carbon reservoir that has a major role in the global carbon cycle. Common millet and foxtail millet have become typical dry-farming crops in China since the Neolithic Age. The study of carbon conservation within phytoliths in these crops could provide insights into anthropogenic influences on the carbon cycle. In this study, we analyzed the carbon content in phytoliths of common millet and foxtail millet. The results indicated that (1) common millet and foxtail millet contained 0.136% +/- 0.070% and 0.129%+/- 0.085% phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) on a dry mass basis, respectively; (2) based on the mean annual production of common millet and foxtail millet in the last 10 years, the phytolith occluded carbon accumulation rate of common millet and foxtail millet was approximately 0.023 +/- 0.015 and 0.020 +/- 0.010 t CO(2) ha(-1) a(-1), respectively; (3) assuming a similar phytolith occluded carbon accumulation rate as for common millet (the highest accumulation rate was 0.038 t CO(2) ha(-1) a(-1)), this could result in the sequestration of 2.37 x 10(6) t CO(2) per year for the 62.4 x 10(6) ha dry-farming crops in China. Although there was a decline in the annual production rate and planting area of foxtail millet during 1949 to 2008, the total phytolith carbon sequestration rate was 7x10(6) t CO(2) within the 60-year period. However, phytolith occluded carbon has not yet been fully considered as a global carbon sink. Also, this carbon fraction is probably one of the best candidates for the missing carbon sink.

AB A major challenge in behavioural and evolutionary ecology is to understand the evolution and maintenance of consistent behavioural differences among individuals within populations, often referred to as animal 'personalities'. Here, we present evidence suggesting that sexual selection may act on such personality differences in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), as females seem to choose males on the basis of their exploratory behaviour per se, while taking into account their own personality. After observing a pair of males, whose apparent levels of exploration were experimentally manipulated, females that exhibited low-exploratory tendencies showed no preference during mate choice for males that had appeared to be either 'exploratory' or 'unexploratory'. In contrast, intermediate and highly exploratory females preferred apparently exploratory males over apparently unexploratory ones. Our results suggest that behavioural or genetic compatibility for personality traits might be important for mate choice, at least for exploratory individuals.

AB The communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonizing the roots of three mangrove species were characterized along a tidal gradient in a mangrove swamp. A fragment, designated SSU-ITS-LSU, including part of the small subunit (SSU), the entire internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and part of the large subunit (LSU) of rDNA from samples of AMF-colonized roots was amplified, cloned and sequenced using AMF-specific primers. Similar levels of AMF diversity to those observed in terrestrial ecosystems were detected in the roots, indicating that the communities of AMF in wetland ecosystems are not necessarily low in diversity. In total, 761 Glomeromycota sequences were obtained, which grouped, according to phylogenetic analysis using the SSU-ITS-LSU fragment, into 23 phylotypes, 22 of which belonged to Glomeraceae and one to Acaulosporaceae. The results indicate that flooding plays an important role in AMF diversity, and its effects appear to depend on the degree (duration) of flooding. Both host species and tide level affected community structure of AMF, indicating the presence of habitat and host species preferences.

AB In this paper, we discuss a stochastic density dependent predator-prey system with Beddington-DeAngelis functional response. First, we show that this system has a unique positive solution as this is essential in any population dynamics model. Then, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of this system. When the white noise is small, the stochastic system imitates the corresponding deterministic system. Either there is a stationary distribution, or the predator population will die out. While if The white noise is large, besides the extinction of the predator population, both species in the system may also die out, which does not happen in the deterministic system. Finally, simulations are carried out to conform to our results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wallace's Line or its variants divide the Malay Archipelago or Malesia into a western and eastern area, but is this suitable for plant distributions? Indeed, all boundaries satisfactorily divide Malesia into two parts, stopping far more species east or west of a line than disperse over the boundary. However, phenetic analyses (principal components analysis, nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) of 7340 species distributions revealed a stronger partitioning of Malesia into three instead of two regions: the western Sunda Shelf minus Java (Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo), central Wallacea (Philippines, Sulawesi, Lesser Sunda Islands, Moluccas, with Java), and the eastern Sahul Shelf (New Guinea). Java always appears to be part of Wallacea, probably because of its mainly dry monsoon climate. The three phytogeographic areas equal the present climatic division of Malesia. An everwet climate exists on the Sunda and Sahul Shelves, whereas most of Wallacea has a yearly dry monsoon. During glacial maxima, the Sunda and Sahul Shelves became land areas connected with Asia and Australia, respectively, whereas sea barriers remained within Wallacea. Consequently, the flora of the two shelves is more homogeneous than the Wallacean flora. Wallacea is a distinct area because it comprises many endemic, drought tolerant floristic elements.

AB Top-down control has been extensively documented in food webs based on living plants, where predator limitation of herbivores can cascade to facilitate plant growth (the green-world hypothesis), particularly in grasslands and aquatic systems. Yet the ecosystem role of predators in detrital food webs is less explored, as is the potential effect of climate warming on detritus-based communities. We here show that predators have a "brown-world" role in decomposer communities via a cascading top-down control on plant growth, based on the results of an experiment that factorially manipulated presence and size of two predator species as well as temperature (warmed vs. unwarmed). The inclusion of predatory beetles significantly decreased abundance of coprophagous beetles and thus the rate of dung decomposition and productivity of plants growing surrounding the dung. Moreover, the magnitude of these decreases differed between predator species and, for dung loss, was temperature dependent. At ambient temperature, the larger predators tended to more strongly influence the dung loss rate than did the smaller predators; when both predators were present, the dung loss rate was higher relative to the treatments with the smaller predators but comparable to those with the larger ones, suggesting an antagonistic effect of predator interaction. However, warming substantially reduced dung decomposition rates and eliminated the effects of predation on dung decomposition. Although warming substantially decreased dung loss rates, warming only modestly reduced primary productivity. Consistent with these results, a second experiment exploring the influence of the two predator species and warming on dung loss over time revealed that predatory beetles significantly decreased the abundance of coprophagous beetles, which was positively correlated with dung loss rates. Moreover, experimental warming decreased the water content of dung and hence the survival of coprophagous beetles. These results confirm that the "brown-world" effect of predator beetles was due to cascading top-down control through coprophagous beetles to nutrient cycling and primary productivity. Our results also highlight potentially counterintuitive effects of climate warming. For example, global warming might significantly decrease animal-mediated decomposition of organic matter and recycling of nutrients in a future warmed world.

AB Inferring the role of interactions in territorial animals relies upon accurate recordings of the behaviour of neighbouring individuals. Such accurate recordings are rarely available from field studies. As a result, quantification of the interaction mechanisms has often relied upon theoretical approaches, which hitherto have been limited to comparisons of macroscopic population-level predictions from un-tested interaction models. Here we present a quantitative framework that possesses a microscopic testable hypothesis on the mechanism of conspecific avoidance mediated by olfactory signals in the form of scent marks. We find that the key parameters controlling territoriality are two: the average territory size, i.e. the inverse of the population density, and the time span during which animal scent marks remain active. Since permanent monitoring of a territorial border is not possible, scent marks need to function in the temporary absence of the resident. As chemical signals carried by the scent only last a finite amount of time, each animal needs to revisit territorial boundaries frequently and refresh its own scent marks in order to deter possible intruders. The size of the territory an animal can maintain is thus proportional to the time necessary for an animal to move between its own territorial boundaries. By using an agent-based model to take into account the possible spatio-temporal movement trajectories of individual animals, we show that the emerging territories are the result of a form of collective animal movement where, different to shoaling, flocking or herding, interactions are highly heterogeneous in space and time. The applicability of our hypothesis has been tested with a prototypical territorial animal, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).

AB The objectives of this work were to examine the past, current and potential influence of global climate change on the spatial distribution of some commercially exploited fish and to evaluate a recently proposed new ecological niche model (ENM) called nonparametric probabilistic ecological niche model (NPPEN). This new technique is based on a modified version of the test called Multiple Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) using the generalized Mahalanobis distance. The technique was applied in the extratropical regions of the North Atlantic Ocean on eight commercially exploited fish species using three environmental parameters (sea surface temperature, bathymetry and sea surface salinity). The numerical procedure and the model allowed a better characterization of the niche (sensu Hutchinson) and an improved modelling of the spatial distribution of the species. Furthermore, the technique appeared to be robust to incomplete or bimodal training sets. Despite some potential limitations related to the choice of the climatic scenarios (A2 and B2), the type of physical model (ECHAM 4) and the absence of consideration of biotic interactions, modelled changes in species distribution explained some current observed shifts in dominance that occurred in the North Atlantic sector, and particularly in the North Sea. Although projected changes suggest a poleward movement of species, our results indicate that some species may not be able to track their climatic envelope and that climate change may have a prominent influence on fish distribution during this century. The phenomenon is likely to trigger locally major changes in the dominance of species with likely implications for socio-economical systems. In this way, ENMs might provide a new management tool against which changes in the resource might be better anticipated.

AB Understanding marine ecosystem dynamics is a key challenge and opportunity facing us. One of the ways we can continue to unravel and understand marine ecosystem dynamics is via ecosystem modeling. We used one such model. ATLANTIS, to help explore the dynamics of the Northeast United States (NEUS) Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). We have parameterized ATLANTIS for the NEUS LME by including major functional groups across a range of biota, the physiographic dynamics of the ecosystem, and the major fishing fleets. The objectives of this work were to describe the application of this ATLANTIS NEUS model; briefly highlight modeling skill; note areas for further improvement, data gaps, major lessons learned, and how our understanding of the ecosystem was enhanced as we executed the modeling process; and note how these model outputs could inform living marine resource management in this region. The preliminary results we show here describe outputs from a multivariate, multispecies, multifactorial modeling approach. Our modeling skill is reasonable, as determined by the fact that over 90% of our fleet effort estimates, nearly 80% of our functional group catches, and 100% of our main functional group biomasses were within limits of tolerance. Moreover, the general patterns and phenology of major events were replicated consistently, both in space and time across a broad suite of physical, chemical, biological and human factors. These include several taxa groups such as primary producers, zooplankton, benthos, fishes, marine mammals, as well as nutrients, landings, and fishing effort. Conversely, as expected, there were some groups or fleets that did exceed levels of tolerance. These were mostly invertebrate groups such as shrimp, squid or gelatinous zooplankton, groups which are notorious for being difficult to model. Yet the major taxa groups and main fishing fleets were all well within levels of tolerance. Thus, we assert that with the majority of all main processes and state variables simulated, this ATLANTIS model can indeed reasonably approximate observations for the NEUS LME across a range of factors, and more importantly can be used to evaluate the relative prominence across a range of factors that contribute to the dynamics of this marine ecosystem.

AB Plant invasions are known to have negative impacts on native plant communities, yet their influence on higher trophic levels has not been well documented. Past studies investigating the effects of invasive plants on herbivores and carnivores have been largely observational in nature and thus lack the ability to tease apart whether differences are a cause or consequence of the invasion. In addition, understanding how plant traits and plant species compositions change in invaded habitats may increase our ability to predict when and where invasive plants will have effects that cascade to animals. To assess effects on arthropods, we experimentally introduced a non-native plant (Microstegium vimineum, Japanese stiltgrass) in a community re-assembly experiment. We also investigated possible mechanisms through which the invader could affect associated arthropods, including changes in native plant species richness, above-ground plant biomass, light availability and vegetation height. In experimentally invaded plots, arthropod abundance was reduced by 39%, and species richness declined by 19%. Carnivores experienced greater reductions in abundance than herbivores (61% vs 31% reduction). Arthropod composition significantly diverged between experimentally invaded and control plots, and particular species belonging to the abundant families Aphididae (aphids), Formicidae (ants) and Phalacridae (shining flower beetles) contributed the most to compositional differences. Among the mechanisms we investigated, only the reduction in native plant species richness caused by invasion was strongly correlated with total arthropod abundance and richness. In sum, our results demonstrate negative impacts of M. vimineum invasion on higher trophic levels and suggest that these effects occur, in part, indirectly through invader-mediated reductions in the richness of the native plant community. The particularly strong response of carnivores suggests that plant invasion could reduce top-down control of herbivorous species for native plants.

AB This article describes the process and outcomes of a pilot community-based adaptation (CBA) project implemented on Druadrua Island in Fiji. Although many people promote the use of CBA, written material about the topic is limited and poorly informed by theory or evidence. This article aims to contribute to the literature on CBA by describing the theory and process used to implement a CBA project and the changes that resulted in a small island community in the northeastern part of Fiji. The project outcomes include a renewed focus on community adaptive management of natural resources, increased awareness of climate change, and an increase in the community's access to resources from external organizations. The article concludes with a summary of lessons learned and recommendations for future CBA projects. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. WIREs Clim Change 2010 1 751-763

AB Autocorrelation has been viewed as a problem in telemetry studies because sequential observations are not independent in time or space, therefore violating assumptions for statistical inference. Yet nearly all ecological and behavioural data are autocorrelated in both space and time. We argue that there is much to learn about the structure of ecological and behavioural data from patterns of autocorrelation. Such patterns include periodicity in movement and patchiness in spatial data, which can be characterized by an autocorrelogram, semivariogram or spectrum. We illustrate the utility of temporal autocorrelation functions (ACFs) for analysing step-length data from GPS telemetry of wolves (Canis lupus), cougars (Puma concolor), grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and elk (Cervus elaphus) in western Alberta. ACFs often differ by season, reflecting differences in foraging behaviour. In wilderness landscapes, step-length ACFs for predators decay slowly to apparently random patterns, but sometimes display strong daily rhythms in areas of human disturbance. In contrast, step lengths of elk are consistently periodic, reflecting crepuscular activity.

AB P>1. Introduced plants have the potential to rapidly evolve traits of ecological importance that may add to their innate potential to become invasive. During invasions, selection may favour genotypes that are already pre-adapted to conditions in the new habitat and, over time, alter the characteristics of subsequent generations.
   2. Spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) occurs in two predominantly spatially separated cytotypes in its native range (Europe-Western Asia), but currently only the tetraploid form has been confirmed in the introduced range (North America), where it is invasive. We used several common garden experiments to examine, across multiple populations, whether tetraploids and diploids from the native range differ in life cycle, leaf traits and reproductive capacity and if such differences would explain the predominance of tetraploids and their advance into new habitats in the introduced range. We also compared the same traits in tetraploids from the native and introduced range to determine whether any rapid adaptive changes had occurred since introduction that may have enhanced invasive potential of the species in North America.
   3. We found tetraploids had lower specific leaf area, less lamina dissection and fewer, narrower leaves than diploids. Diploids exhibited a monocarpic life cycle and produced few if any accessory rosettes. Diploids produced significantly more seeds per capitulum and had more capitula per plant than tetraploids. In contrast, the vast majority of European tetraploids continued to flower in both seasons by regenerating from multiple secondary rosettes, demonstrating a predominantly polycarpic life cycle.
   4. During early growth tetraploids from North America achieved greater biomass than both tetraploids and diploids from the native range but this did not manifest as larger above-ground biomass at maturity. In North American tetraploids there was also evidence of a shift towards a more strictly polycarpic life cycle, less leaf dissection, greater carbon investment per leaf, and greater seed production per capitulum.
   5.Synthesis. Our results suggest that the characteristics of tetraploid C. stoebe pre-adapted them (compared to diploid conspecifics) for spread and persistence of the species into habitats in North America characterized by a more continental climate. After the species' introduction, small but potentially important shifts in tetraploid biology have occurred that may have contributed significantly to successful invasion.

AB The aim of this work on tumour-immune system (T-IS) interaction is to assess the effect of delays concerning the stimulation of the immune system by tumour cells, as well as the interplay between antitumour immunotherapies and delays. After defining a new family of super-macroscopic models for the T-IS interaction, we introduce a constant delay in the proliferation of immune effectors. We then investigate, both analytically and by means of simulations, the stability of equilibria and the onset of sustained oscillations through Hopf bifurcations. Both constant and exponentially distributed lags are considered. Inparticular, in the case of periodically varying immunotherapies we show that nonlinear resonances and chaos may arise, although for parameters slightly outside the range of biological realism.

ID EVOLUTION; SELECTION
AB We analyze mathematical models to examine how the genetic basis of fitness affects the persistence of a population suddenly encountering a harsh environment where it would go extinct without evolution. The results are relevant for novel introductions and for an established population whose existence is threatened by a sudden change in the environment. The models span a range of genetic assumptions, including identical loci that contribute to absolute fitness, a two-locus quantitative genetic model with nonidentical loci, and a model with major and minor genes affecting a quantitative trait. We find as a general (though not universal) pattern that prospects for persistence narrow as more loci contribute to fitness, in effect because selection per locus is increasingly weakened with more loci, which can even overwhelm any initial enhancement of fitness that adding loci might provide. When loci contribute unequally to fitness, genes of small effect can significantly reduce extinction risk. Indeed, major and minor genes can interact synergistically to reduce the time needed to evolve growth. Such interactions can also increase vulnerability to extinction, depending not just on how genes interact but also on the initial genetic structure of the introduced, or newly invaded, population.

AB Litter quality is often considered the main driver of decomposition rate. The objective of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of two other tree-driven mechanisms, litter mixing and forest floor conditions, to foliar litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics for trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) using a microcosm approach. Results based on mixed linear models show that the greater influence over these processes was obtained through litter quality followed by forest floor conditions and litter mixing. Specifically, the results indicate that significantly more C and nutrients were mineralized (i) from aspen than from spruce litter, (ii) from spruce litter in mixture with aspen litter than from spruce litter applied singly, and (iii) from litter incubated on forest floor from the aspen stand rather than from the spruce stand, except for nutrients in the spruce litter. Collectively, our results show that the litter and forest floor material from aspen both favour decomposition and nutrient mineralization processes. Hence, we provide evidence that the effect of tree species on litter decomposition may not only be caused by the properties of its litter but also, indirectly, by the specific conditions and the decomposer community that tree species develop in their forest floor.

AB Coevolution can be a potent force in maintaining and generating biological diversity. Although coevolution is likely to have played a key role in the early development of mycorrhizal interactions, it is unclear how important coevolutionary processes are for ongoing trait evolution in those interactions. Empirical studies have shown that candidate coevolving traits, such as mycorrhizal colonization intensity, exhibit substantial heritable genetic variation within plant and fungal species and are influenced by plant genotype x fungal genotype interactions, suggesting the potential for ongoing coevolutionary selection. Selective source analysis (SSA) could be employed to build on these results, testing explicitly for ongoing coevolutionary selection and analyzing the influence of community context on local coevolutionary selection. Recent empirical studies suggest the potential for coevolution to drive adaptive differentiation among populations of plants and fungi, but further studies, especially using SSA in the context of field reciprocal transplant experiments, are needed to determine the importance of coevolutionary selection compared with nonreciprocal selection on species traits.

AB Accurately predicting errors related to preservation, lipid extraction, and lipid normalization on chemical tracers would enable the use of archived samples in long-term studies of trophic ecology and habitat use of aquatic species. We determined whether stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios and concentrations of 14 trace elements can be accurately predicted from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-preserved mammal skin, which would provide equivalent estimates to that from unpreserved tissue. We tested 3 lipid-correction approaches for applicability to cetacean skin, a largely unexplored taxon and tissue, and provide a model for evaluating impacts of errors from lipid extraction or normalization on diet composition estimated using isotopic mixing models. DMSO had unpredictable effects on trace element concentrations, rendering DMSO-preserved samples inefficient for retrospective studies. However, lipid extraction and DMSO preservation resulted in predictable and similar, although not identical, effects on isotopic signatures across 4 cetacean species with different skin structure and thickness, making correction for these effects a potentially viable alternative to lipid and DMSO extraction. Generally, lipid-normalization models were reliable when applied to cetacean skin, as errors were similar to those from other species or tissues. Because model fit generally improved with data specificity, developing tissue-and species-specific parameters and equations is probably more important than model choice, although the mass-balance model was considered the most robust across aquatic vertebrates and tissues. The effects of errors associated with the various treatments and lipid normalization on isotopic mixing results increased as the isotopic distance among prey sources decreased, suggesting that empirical corrections as an alternative to delta C-13 determination from lipid-extracted duplicate samples need to be evaluated a priori relative to study objectives and anticipated results.

AB The recently developed PTR-TOF instrument was evaluated to measure methanol fluxes emitted from grass land using the eddy covariance method. The high time resolution of the PTR-TOF allowed storing full mass spectra up to m/z 315 with a frequency of 10 Hz. Three isobaric ions were found at a nominal mass of m/z 33 due to the high mass resolving power of the PTR-TOF. Only one of the three peaks contributed to eddy covariance fluxes. The exact mass of this peak agrees well with the exact mass of protonated methanol (m/z 33.0335). The eddy covariance methanol fluxes measured with PTR-TOF were compared to virtual disjunct eddy covariance methanol fluxes simultaneously measured with a conventional PTR- MS. The methanol fluxes from both instruments show excellent agreement.

AB P> Many hypotheses about species coexistence involve differential resource use and trade-offs in species' life-history traits. Quantifying resource use across most species in diverse communities, although, has seldom been attempted.
   We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the light dependence of recruitment in 263 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Panama. Data on sapling recruitment were obtained using the 1985-1990 and 1990-1995 census intervals. Available light was estimated for each recruit from yearly censuses of canopy density.
   We use a power function (linear log-log relationship) to model the light effect on recruitment. Different responses of recruitment to light are expressed by the light effect parameter b. The distribution of b had a central mode at 0.8, suggesting that recruitment of many species responds nearly linearly to increasing light.
   Nearly every species showed increases in recruitment with increasing light. Just nine species (3%) had recruitment declining with light, while 198 species (75%) showed increasing recruitment in both census intervals. Most of the increases in recruitment were decelerating, i.e. the increase was less at higher light (b < 1). In the remaining species, the response to light varied between census intervals (24 species) or species did not have recruits in both intervals (41 species).
   Synthesis. Nearly all species regenerate better in higher light, and recruitment responses to light are spread along a continuum ranging from modest increase with light to a rather strict requirement for high light. These results support the hypothesis that spatio-temporal variation in light availability may contribute to the diversity of tropical tree species by providing opportunities for niche differentiation with respect to light requirements for regeneration.

In addition to deforestation (clearing of forest), we also estimate clearing rates and emissions for savannas (especially the cerrado, or central Brazilian savanna), which have not been included in Brazil's monitoring of deforestation. The rate of clearing of savannas was much more rapid in the 1980s and 1990s than in recent years. Over the 2006-2007 period (one year) 204 x 10(3) ha of forest and 30 x 10(3) ha of savanna were cleared in Mato Grosso, representing a gross loss of biomass carbon (above + belowground) of 66.0 and 1.8 x 10(6) MgC, respectively. In the same year in Rondonia, 130 x 10(3) ha of forest was cleared, representing gross losses of biomass of 40.4 x 10(6) MgC. Data on clearing of savanna in Rondonia are unavailable, but the rate is believed to be small in the year in question. Net losses of carbon stock for Mato Grosso forest, Mato Grosso savanna and Rondonia forest were 29 0, 0.5 and 18.5 x 10(6) MgC, respectively. Including soil carbon loss and the effects of trace-gas emissions (using global warming potentials for CH4 and N2O from the IPCC's 2007 Fourth Assessment Report), the impact of these emission sources totaled 30 9, 0.6 and 25.4 x 10(6) Mg CO2-equivalent C, respectively. These impacts approximate the combined effect of logging and clearing because the forest biomasses used are based on surveys conducted before many forests were exposed to logging. The total emission from Mato Grosso and Rondonia of 56.9 x 10(6) Mg CO2-equivalent C can be compared with Brazil's annual emission of approximately 80 x 10(6) MgC from fossil-fuel combustion.

AB Studies from throughout the world have provided evidence that climate change is already affecting the ecology and persistence of species. Japan contributes valuable insights into understanding these changes through long-term records of the timing of cherry blossoms and other phenomena of ecological and cultural interest. The wide latitudinal spread of Japan also provides an opportunity to examine species over a broad range of environmental conditions. In this review, we examine phenological studies that have taken place in Japan and summarize their significance to climate change and conservation research. In Kyoto, records of the timing of celebrations of cherry blossom festivals going back to the 9th century reconstruct the past climate and demonstrate the local increase in temperature associated with global warming and urbanization. This record is probably the longest annual record of phenology from anyplace in the world and shows that cherries are currently flowering earlier than they have at any time during the previous 1200 years. Detailed mapping of cherry tree flowering times in and around Osaka and other cities in Japan show that urbanization causes plants to flower earlier within the city environs than in nearby parks and outlying suburban areas. Flowering records from a large cherry arboretum at Mt. Takao, on the outskirts of Tokyo, show that both among and within species, early flowering is associated with greater responsiveness to temperature variation. Lastly, records of phenology for a wide range of plants and animals recorded at over 100 weather stations throughout Japan show that species vary greatly in their phenological responses to climate change, and highlight ecological relationships that need to be investigated in the field. Together, these studies provide important insights into how species are responding to climate change in Japan. Further research, particularly targeted field observations and experiments, is needed to build on these findings and to improve our understanding of how climate change is altering biological communities and how it will continue to affect them in the future.

AB By comparing the isotopic composition of tissues deposited at different times, we can identify individuals that shift diets over time and individuals with constant diets. We define an individual as an isotopic specialist if tissues deposited at different times have similar isotopic composition. If tissues deposited at different times differ in isotopic composition we define an individual as an isotopic generalist. Individuals can be dietary generalists but isotopic specialists if they feed on the same resource mixture at all times. We assessed the degree of isotopic and dietary specialization in three related Chilean bird species that occupy coastal and/or freshwater environments: Cinclodes oustaleti, Cinclodes patagonicus, and Cinclodes nigrofumosus. C. oustaleti individuals were both isotopic and dietary generalists. Tissues deposited in winter (liver and muscle) had distinct stable C (delta C-13) and stable N isotope ratio (delta N-15) values from tissues deposited in the summer (wing feathers) suggesting that birds changed the resources that they used seasonally from freshwater habitats in the summer to coastal habitats in the winter. Although the magnitude of seasonal isotopic change was high, the direction of isotopic change varied little among individuals. C. patagonicus included both isotopic specialists and generalists, as well as dietary specialists and generalists. The isotopic composition of the feathers and liver of some C. patagonicus individuals was similar, whereas that of others differed. In C. patagonicus, there were large inter-individual differences in the magnitude and the direction of seasonal isotopic change. All individuals of C. nigrofumosus were both isotopic and dietary specialists. The distribution of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values overlapped broadly among tissues and clustered in a small, and distinctly intertidal, region of delta space. Assessing individual specialization and unraveling the factors that influence it, have been key questions in animal ecology for decades. Stable isotope analyses of several tissues in appropriate study systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to answer them.

AB Variance in reproductive success among individuals is a defining characteristic of many social vertebrates. Yet, our understanding of which male attributes contribute to reproductive success is still fragmentary in most cases. Male-male reproductive coalitions, where males jointly display to attract females, are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists because one male appears to forego reproduction to assist the social partner. By examining the relationship between social behaviour and reproductive success, we can elucidate the proximate function of coalitions in the context of mate choice. Here, we use data from a 4-year study of wire-tailed manakins (Pipra filicauda) to provide molecular estimates of reproductive skew and to test the hypothesis that male-male social interactions, in the context of coordinated displays, positively influence a male's reproductive success. More specifically, we quantify male-male social interactions using network metrics and predict that greater connectivity will result in higher relative reproductive success. Our data show that four out of six leks studied had significant reproductive skew, with success apportioned to very few individuals in each lek. Metrics of male social affiliations derived from our network analysis, especially male connectivity, measured as the number of males with whom the focal male has extended interactions, were strong predictors of the number of offspring sired. Thus, network connectivity is associated with male fitness in wire-tailed manakins. This pattern may be the result of shared cues used by both sexes to assess male quality, or the result of strict female choice for coordinated display behaviour.

AB It is now widely accepted that modern humans dispersed from Africa some time after 100 ka, arriving in Australia before 40 ka via a route known as the southern arc. Along this route modern humans would have encountered new and diverse environments but their dispersal into and settlement of new areas was rapid. Language and other symbolic behaviours would have contributed to the flexibility of social and economic strategies required for such rapid dispersal and colonisation. However, there is generally little material evidence in the southern arc for the existence of this symbolic behaviour, except in Australia. We believe that previous assessments of the quantities of such evidence in Australia have underestimated its abundance. The crucial point is that colonisation of the southern arc is itself evidence for the existence of complex information exchange systems, planning depth and symbolic conceptualisation.

   EXTINCTION; PATTERNS
AB Habitat suitability models are usually produced using species presence or habitat selection, without taking into account the demographic performance of the population considered. These models cannot distinguish between sink and source habitats, causing problems especially for species with low reproductive rates and high susceptibility to low levels of mortality as in the case of the critically endangered Apennine brown bear Ursus arctos marsicanus.
   We developed a spatial model based on bear presence (2544 locations) and mortality data (37 locations) used as proxies for demographic performance. We integrated an occurrence and a mortality-risk Ecological Niche Factor Analysis model into a final two-dimensional model that can be used to distinguish between attractive sink-like and source-like habitat.
   Our integrated model indicates that a traditional habitat suitability model can provide misleading management and conservation indications, as 43% of the area suitable for the occurrence model is associated with high mortality risk. Areas of source-like habitat for the Apennine bears (highly elevated areas rich in beech forests, far from roads, and with low human density and cultivated fields) are still present, including outside the currently occupied range. However, attractive sink-like habitat (associated with high levels of pasture, low extent of mountain meadows, low steepness, low elevation, and closeness to secondary and urban roads) are present even inside protected areas.
   Synthesis and applications. Identifying attractive sink-like habitat is crucial to prevent inappropriate management and to effectively address conservation issues: whereas existing source-like habitats should be preserved to halt habitat loss and degradation, attractive sink-like habitat should be managed to mitigate mortality risks or to decrease their attractiveness. In particular, area-specific management interventions and proactive actions (increased patrolling, road closure, human activity management, threat monitoring, etc.) aimed at reducing human-caused mortality are critical for the Apennine brown bear.

AB Under chronic stress, carotenoid-based colouration has often been shown to fade. However, the ecological and physiological mechanisms that govern colouration still remain largely unknown. Colour changes may be directly induced by the stressor (for example through reduced carotenoid intake) or due to the activation of the physiological stress response (PSR, e. g. due to increased blood corticosterone concentrations). Here, we tested whether blood corticosterone concentration affected carotenoid-based colouration, and whether a trade-off between colouration and PSR existed. Using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), we correlatively and experimentally showed that elevated blood corticosterone levels are associated with increased redness of the lizard's belly. In this study, the effects of corticosterone did not depend on carotenoid ingestion, indicating the absence of a trade-off between colouration and PSR for carotenoids. While carotenoid ingestion increased blood carotenoid concentration, colouration was not modified. This suggests that carotenoid-based colouration of common lizards is not severely limited by dietary carotenoid intake. Together with earlier studies, these findings suggest that the common lizard's carotenoid-based colouration may be a composite trait, consisting of fixed (e. g. genetic) and environmentally elements, the latter reflecting the lizard's PSR.

AB 1. Using species distribution data from 111 aquifers distributed in nine European regions, we examined the pairwise relationships between local species richness (LSR), dissimilarity in species composition among localities, and regional species richness (RSR). In addition, we quantified the relative contribution of three nested spatial units - aquifers, catchments and regions - to the overall richness of groundwater crustaceans.
   2. The average number of species in karst and porous aquifers (LSR) varied significantly among regions and was dependent upon the richness of the regional species pool (RSR). LSR-RSR relationships differed between habitats: species richness in karstic local communities increased linearly with richness of the surrounding region, whereas that of porous local communities levelled off beyond a certain value of RSR.
   3. Dissimilarity in species composition among aquifers of a region increased significantly with increasing regional richness because of stronger habitat specialisation and a decrease in the geographic range of species among karst aquifers. Species turnover among karst aquifers was positively related to RSR, whereas this relationship was not significant for porous aquifers.
   4. The contribution of a given spatial unit to total richness increased as size of the spatial unit increased, although 72% of the overall richness was attributed to among-region diversity. Differences in community composition between similar habitats in different regions were typically more pronounced than between nearby communities from different habitats.
   5. We conclude by calling for biodiversity assessment methods and conservation strategies that explicitly integrate the importance of turnover in community composition and habitat dissimilarity at multiple spatial scales.

Leaf phenology and freeze tolerance of the invasive shrub Amur honeysuckle and potential native competitors. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 136: 212-220. 2009-The non-native invasive deciduous shrub Lonicera maackii causes a reduction in plant growth and species diversity under its canopy. The mechanisms of these effects are not fully understood, but an apparent difference between L. maackii and native shrub species is its extended leaf duration. We tested the hypothesis that L. maackii has a longer leaf duration than native shrub species found in the same habitats. Leaf phenology of L. maackii and the native deciduous shrubs Asimina triloba and Lindera benzoin was observed at four sites in central Kentucky (USA) from March until December, 2007. Additionally, a late spring freeze allowed for examination of freeze tolerance among the three test species. Lonicera maackii leaf development was two to three weeks earlier than the natives in March and early April. A hard freeze in early April caused significant (P < 0.05) leaf mortality to both of the native species (60-100% leaf mortality at 3 of 4 sites) while L. maackii showed no observable damage. L. maackii had a later transition to fall color and leaf abscission than the native species, which were at a significantly later stage of development (closer to leaf abscission) for a period of four to six weeks. These data suggest two advantages for L. maackii over potential native competitors: 1) greater access to carbon via a longer leaf duration, and 2) a greater capacity to withstand freezing temperatures.

AB Background: Extravagant ornaments used as social signals evolved to advertise their bearers' quality. The Immunocompetence Handicap Hypothesis proposes that testosterone-dependent ornaments reliably signal health and parasite resistance; however, empirical studies have shown mixed support. Alternatively, immune function and parasite resistance may be indirectly or directly related to glucocorticoid stress hormones. We propose that an understanding of the interplay between the individual and its environment, particularly how they cope with stressors, is crucial for understanding the honesty of social signals.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed corticosterone deposited in growing feathers as an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in a wild territorial bird, the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. We manipulated two key, interrelated components, parasites and testosterone, which influence both ornamentation and fitness. Birds were initially purged of parasites, and later challenged with parasites or not, while at the same time being given testosterone or control implants, using a factorial experimental design. At the treatment level, testosterone enhanced ornamentation, while parasites reduced it, but only in males not implanted with testosterone. Among individuals, the degree to which both parasites and testosterone had an effect was strongly dependent on the amount of corticosterone in the feather grown during the experiment. The more stressors birds had experienced (i.e., higher corticosterone), the more parasites developed, and the less testosterone enhanced ornamentation.
   Conclusions/Significance: With this unique focus on the individual, and a novel, integrative, measure of response to stressors, we show that ornamentation is ultimately a product of the cumulative physiological response to environmental challenges. These findings lead toward a more realistic concept of honesty in signaling as well as a broader discussion of the concept of stress.

AB Fish are attracted to floating structures, including coastal cage fish farms, sometimes in dense aggregations. To understand better the influence of aquaculture on wild fish stocks, we carried out seasonal visual censuses around three southwestern Mediterranean farms over 2 years to assess the temporal patterns of the aggregated fish assemblage. In addition, we analysed the diet of the five most abundant species. Aggregations around all farms were large throughout the year, although species composition and abundance differed among farms and seasons. Fish farms are attractive habitats for certain species of wild fish in specific seasons. Adult fish of reproductive size dominated the assemblages, and stomach content analysis revealed that 66-89% of fish of the five most abundant taxa had consumed food pellets lost from the cages. We estimated that wild fish consume up to 10% of the pellets used at farms, indicating that food is a key attractant. Regional monitoring of farm-associated wild fish assemblages could aid management of the interaction of aquaculture and wild fish resources, because changes in feeding behaviour may have consequences for fish populations and local fisheries.

AB Technological and methodological advances have facilitated tremendous growth in hydrology during the last century; however, there are also concerns that these advances indirectly contribute to additional problems in our research. An insight into hydrologic literature reveals our tendency to develop more complex models than perhaps needed, and our increasing emphasis on individual mathematical techniques rather than general hydrologic issues. Some recent studies of diverse forms have suggested that simplification in modeling and development of a common framework may help alleviate these problems. The present study is intended to bring such studies together towards a more coherent approach to research in catchment hydrology. This is done by highlighting the need for model simplification and generalization and proposing some potential directions for achieving such. Through a discussion of difficulties in data measurements, the need for moving beyond the notion of "modeling everything" to the notion of "capturing the essential features" is explained; the concept of dominant processes in model simplification and the utility of integration of concepts for modeling improvement are discussed. Formulation of a catchment classification framework is advocated as a possible means for a common framework in hydrology, and the role of dominant processes in this formulation is presented; the problems due to adoption of different modeling terminologies are highlighted and potential ways to overcome such are also discussed.

   BIVALVIA; DYNAMICS
AB Mussel populations and the environments they inhabit are heterogeneous and fragmented. We review 3 areas in which principles of landscape ecology might be applied to the scientific understanding and management of freshwater mussels. First, recent studies show that hydraulics can be used successfully to delineate patches of mussel habitat, but additional variables such as host fish, food, or predators are probably important under certain conditions. However, research on patch dynamics in freshwater mussels is in its infancy, and we do not know if existing methods to delineate patches are adequate. Second, mussel ecologists are starting to think about the importance of connectivity among habitat patches. Major challenges will be to determine whether connectivity can be estimated in the field and whether human activities that reduce connectivity (e.g., dams) have produced large extinction debts in mussel populations. Third, we need to better understand the links between events on the watershed (e.g., timing and amounts of water, nutrient, and sediment inputs) and the quality, extent, location, and connections among patches of mussel habitats. Because of its focus on patterns and processes, landscape ecology has the potential to improve scientific understanding and management of mussel populations and, in particular, to help define the best spatial scales for scientific studies and management activities.

AB Although convergence is recognized as a central concept in evolutionary biology, very few tools are available for the quantitative study of this phenomenon. Moreover, although many evolutionary assertions assume that convergence should be rare in the absence of influences on organismal phenotypes such as natural selection or constraint, no studies have tested whether this is the case. I simulate random evolution (Brownian motion model) of quantitative characters along phylogenies with varying numbers of terminal taxa, numbers of traits, variance structure, and tree balance, and quantify the amount of convergence observed in these datasets using four metrics. The amount of convergence observed in a dataset increases with increasing number of taxa and decreasing number of traits, approaching the maximum possible amount of convergence under certain circumstances. Some convergence is expected in almost all datasets. Comparison of empirical datasets to those produced by random evolution provides a test of whether empirical datasets actually show elevated levels of convergence. Out of three test datasets, two show more convergence than expected. Given that high levels of convergence can be produced simply by random evolution, no explanation may be necessary for instances of convergence discovered in an evolutionary investigation.

AB Many prey species, including amphibian larvae, can adaptively alter coloration and morphology to become more or less conspicuous to predators. Despite abundant research on predator-induced plasticity in tadpoles, the combination of color and morphological responses to predators remains largely unexplored. We measured predator-induced morphological and color plasticity in tadpoles. We reared tadpoles of the neotropical treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus with dragonfly nymph or fish predators, or in a predator-free control. After 10 days, we digitally photographed tadpoles and measured eight morphometric variables and five tail color variables. Tadpoles reared with nymphs developed the largest and reddest tails, but incurred a developmental cost, being the smallest overall. Cues from fish induced an opposite tail phenotype in tadpoles, causing shallow achromatic tails. Control tadpoles developed intermediate tail phenotypes. This provides the first experimental evidence that tadpoles can shift both color and morphology in opposite, predator-specific directions in response to a fish and an odonate predator. Despite mean differences, however, there was substantial variation in the degree of phenotype induction across treatments. Tail redness was correlated with tail spot size, but not perfectly, indicating that color and morphology may be partially decoupled in D. ebraccatus. Balancing selection from multiple conflicting predators may result in genetic variation for developmental plasticity.

AB The ecological consequences of climate change are determined by many climate parameters, not just by the commonly investigated changes in mean temperature and rainfall. More comprehensive studies, including analyses of climate variability, extremes and aggregate changes in the climate system, can improve the understanding of the nature, and therefore possible consequences, of recent changes in climate. Here climate trends on the sub-Antarctic Marion Island are documented (between 1949 and 2003) in more detail than previously. Significant trends in biologically-relevant, and previously unexplored, parameters were observed, and the potential ecological consequences of these changes discussed. For example, the decline in precipitation experienced on the island comprises a trend for longer dry spells punctuated by fewer and smaller precipitation events. This more detailed understanding of the island's drying trends enables more accurate predictions about its impacts, including, for example, particularly severe effects on plant species growing in soils with poor water-holding capacity. Therefore, in addition to changes in average conditions, more inclusive climate analyses should also examine trends in climatic variability and extremes, for individual climate parameters as well as for the climate system as a whole.

AB Dramatic shifts in community composition occur between vertical and horizontal rocky surfaces in subtidal environments worldwide, yet the forces mediating this transition are poorly understood. Vertical rock walls are often covered by lush, diverse communities of sessile suspension-feeding invertebrates, while adjacent horizontal substrates are dominated by algae, or corals in the tropics. Multiple factors, including light, sedimentation, water flow, and predation have been proposed to explain this pattern, but experimental tests of these hypotheses are lacking. We manipulated light level and predation to test whether variation in these mechanisms could be responsible for the shift in composition of sessile communities between vertical and horizontal surfaces in the rocky subtidal Gulf of Maine. Shaded horizontally oriented granite plots were dominated by invertebrates (e. g., ascidians, barnacles, bryozoans) after 25 months. Unshaded plots were dominated by macroalgae, which was virtually absent in shaded plots. Exclusion of grazers with cages had no effect on percent cover of invertebrates or algae. Preferential settlement of invertebrate larvae to shaded plots, due to larval behaviors such as negative phototaxis, did not seem to play a role. Shading likely affects post-settlement mortality of invertebrates by alleviating competition for space with algae, although greater abundance of micropredators in algal-dominated communities could also be important. Communities on shaded plots lacked many taxa present on natural wall communities, likely due to greater disturbance on horizontal substrates and/or lack of sufficient time for colonization of these taxa. These results suggest that light plays a key role in controlling the structure, composition, and function of shallow subtidal communities.

AB Research into the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has mainly focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem properties in plant communities and, more recently, in food webs. Although there is growing recognition of the significance of nontrophic interactions in ecology, these interactions are still poorly studied theoretically, and their impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is largely unknown. Existing models of mutualism usually consider only one type of species interaction and do not satisfy mass balance constraints. Here, we present a model of an interaction web that includes both trophic and nontrophic interactions and that respects the principle of mass conservation. Nontrophic interactions are represented in the form of interaction modifications. We use this model to study the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem properties that emerges from the assembly of entire interaction webs. We show that ecosystem properties such as biomass and production depend not only on species diversity but also on species interactions, in particular on the connectance and magnitude of nontrophic interactions, and that the nature, prevalence, and strength of species interactions in turn depend on species diversity. Nontrophic interactions alter the shape of the relationship between biodiversity and biomass and can profoundly influence ecosystem processes. (

AB Although trait evolution over contemporary timescales is well documented, its influence on ecological dynamics in the wild has received much less attention particularly compared to traditional ecological and environmental factors. For example, evolution over ecologically relevant timescales is expected in populations that colonize new habitats, where it should theoretically enhance fitness, associated vital rates of survival and reproduction, and population growth potential. Nonetheless, success of exotic species is much more commonly attributed to ecological aspects of habitat quality and 'escape from enemies' in the invaded range. Here, we consider contemporary evolution of vital rates in introduced Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that quickly colonized New Zealand and diverged over c. 26 generations. By using experimental translocations, we partitioned the roles of evolution and habitat quality in modifying geographical patterns of vital rates. Variation in habitat quality within the new range had the greatest influence on broad geographical patterns of vital rates, but locally adapted salmon still exhibited more than double the vital rate performance, and hence fitness, of nonlocal counterparts. The scope of this fitness evolution far exceeds the scale of divergence in trait values for these populations, or even the expected fitness effects of particular traits. These results suggest that contemporary evolution can be an important part of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of invasions and highlight the need for studies of the emergent fitness and ecological consequences of such evolution, rather than just changes in trait values.

AB Coral reef conservation strategies such as marine protected areas have met limited success in many developing countries. Some researchers attribute part of these shortcomings to inadequate attention to the social context of conserving marine resources. To gain insights into applying Western conservation theory more successfully in the socioeconomic context of developing countries, this study examines how long-enduring, customary reef closures appear to reflect local socioeconomic conditions in two Papua New Guinean communities. Attributes of the customary management (including size, shape, permanence, and gear restrictions) are examined in relation to prevailing socioeconomic conditions (including resource users' ability to switch gears, fishing grounds, and occupations). Customary closures in the two communities appear to reflect local socioeconomic circumstances in three ways. First, in situations where people can readily switch between occupations, full closures are acceptable with periodic harvests to benefit from the closure. In comparison, communities with high dependence on the marine resources are more conducive to employing strategies that restrict certain gear types while still allowing others. Second, where there is multiple clan and family spatial ownership of resources, the communities have one closure per clan/family; one large no-take area would have disproportionate affect on those compared to the rest of the community. In contrast, communities that have joint ownership can establish one large closure as long as there are other areas available to harvest. Third, historical and trade relationships with neighboring communities can influence regulations by creating the need for occasional harvests to provide fish for feasts. This study further demonstrates the importance of understanding the socioeconomic context of factors such as community governance and levels of dependence for the conservation of marine resources.

AB 1. Plant functional types (PFTs) are groups of species sharing traits that govern their mechanisms of response to environmental perturbations such as recurring fires, inundation, grazing, biological invasions and global climate change. The key components of a PFT approach are an underlying model of vegetation dynamics for a given system and a classification of functional types based on traits deduced from key processes in the model.
   2. Prediction and generalization underpin the potential utility of the PFT approach for understanding ecosystem behaviour. For PFTs to be useful in ecosystem management, they (in concert with their underlying model) must reliably predict vegetation change under given environmental scenarios and they must produce robust generalizations across the species that are classified and the range of environments in which they occur.
   3. The efficacy of plant functional types has been explored using various approaches in a wide range of ecosystems. However, very few studies have tested the accuracy and generality of PFT predictions against vegetation changes observed empirically over medium to long time scales.
   4. We applied this approach to examine the predictive accuracy and generality of a PFT classification and an associated model of vegetation dynamics for a fire-prone, species-rich wet heathland in south-eastern Australia. We assigned each species to one of six PFTs derived using a deductive approach based on the vital attributes scheme. We measured their initial abundance at a set of sample sites distributed across local environmental gradients. We used the PFT traits and processes in the underlying model to predict qualitative changes in abundance in response to a fire regime scenario observed at the sample sites during a subsequent period of 21 years. We then re-surveyed the sample sites to compare predictions with observed changes in abundance.
   5. The PFTs and their underlying model produced an accurate prediction of average vegetation responses over the 21-year period. The majority of species within each PFT exhibited the predicted response and few species had strongly opposing responses in different environments. However, not all species within a PFT underwent the predicted direction of change, and responses of individual species were not uniform across the environmental gradients.
   6. Synthesis. We conclude that plant functional types based on vital attributes are very useful tools for prediction and generalization in ecosystem management, although interpretations need to be tempered by the fact that PFTs may not accurately predict responses of all species across all environments.

AB Trophic linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are increasingly recognized as.important yet poorly known features of food webs. Here we describe research to understand the dynamics of lake food webs in relation to a native riparian amphibian and its interaction with introduced trout. The mountain yellow-legged frog Rana muscosa is endemic to alpine watersheds of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Transverse Ranges of California, but it has declined to a small fraction of its historical distribution and abundance. Although remaining frogs and introduced trout feed in different habitats of alpine lakes, our stable-isotope analyses clearly show that the same resource base of benthic invertebrates sustains their growth. During one period, insect emergence from naturally fishless lakes was nearly 20-fold higher compared to adjacent lakes with trout, showing that fish reduce availability of aquatic prey to amphibious and terrestrial consumers. Although trout cannot prey on adult frogs due to gape limitation, foraging post-metamorphic frogs are 10 times more abundant in the absence of trout, suggesting an important role for competition for prey by trout in highly unproductive alpine watersheds. Most Sierran lakes contain fish, and those that do not are usually small isolated ponds; in our study, these two lake types supported the lowest densities of post-metamorphic frogs, and these frogs were less reliant on local, benthic sources of productivity. Since Rana muscosa was formerly the most abundant vertebrate in the Sierra Nevada, the reduction in energy flow from lake benthos to this consumer due to fish introductions may have had negative consequences for its numerous terrestrial predators, many of which have also declined. We suggest that disruptions of trophic connections between aquatic and terrestrial food webs are an important but poorly understood consequence of fish introduction to many thousands of montane lakes and streams worldwide and may contribute to declines of native consumers in riparian habitats.

AB The amount of genetic structure in marine invertebrates is often thought to be negatively correlated with larval duration. However, larval retention may increase genetic structure in species with long-lived planktonic larvae, and rafting provides a means of dispersal for species that lack a larval dispersal phase. We compared genetic structure, demographic histories and levels of gene flow of regional lineages (in most cases defined by biogeographic region) of five southern African coastal invertebrates with three main types of larval development: (1) dispersal by long-lived planktonic larvae (mudprawn Upogebia africana and brown mussel Perna perna), (2) abbreviated larval development (crown crab Hymenosoma orbiculare) and (3) direct development (estuarine isopod Exosphaeroma hylecoetes and estuarine cumacean Iphinoe truncata). We hypothesized that H. orbiculare, having abbreviated larval development, would employ a strategy of larval retention, resulting in genetic structure comparable to that of the direct developers rather than the planktonic dispersers. However, regional population structure was significantly lower in all species with planktonic larvae, including H. orbiculare, than in the direct developers. Moreover, nested clade analysis identified demographic histories resulting from low levels of gene flow (isolation by distance and allopatric fragmentation) in the direct developers only, and migration rates were significantly higher in all three species having planktonic larvae than in the direct developers. We conclude that the amount of genetic structure within marine biogeographic regions strongly depends on the presence or absence of free-swimming larvae. Whether such larvae are primarily exported or retained, whether they have long or short larval duration, and whether or not they are capable of active dispersal seems to have little effect on connectivity among populations.

TI An incentive mechanism for reducing emissions from conversion of intact
   and non-intact forests
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID COVER CHANGE; DEFORESTATION
AB This paper presents a new accounting mechanism in the context of the UNFCCC issue on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries, including technical options for determining baselines of forest conversions. This proposal builds on the recent scientific achievements related to the estimation of tropical deforestation rates and to the assessment of 'Cyintact' forest areas. The distinction between 'Cyintact' and 'Cynon intact' forests used here arises from experience with satellite-based deforestation measurements and allows accounting for carbon losses from forest degradation. The proposed accounting system would use forest area conversion rates as input data. An optimal technical solution to set baselines would be to use historical average figures during the time period from 1990 to 2005. The system introduces two different schemes to account for preserved carbon: one for countries with high forest conversion rates where the desired outcome would be a reduction in their rates, and another for countries with low rates. A 'Cyglobal' baseline rate would be used to discriminate between these two country categories (high and low rates). For the hypothetical accounting period 2013-2017 and considering 72% of the total tropical forest domain for which data are available, the scenario of a 10% reduction of the high rates and of the preservation of low rates would result in approximately 1.6 billion tCO(2) of avoided emissions. The resulting benefits of this reduction would be shared between those high-rate countries which reduced deforestation and those low-rate countries which did not increase their deforestation over an agreed threshold (e.g., half of "global" baseline rate).

AB In cooperatively breeding species, reproductive decisions and breeding roles may be influenced by environmental ( food resources) or social factors ( reproductive suppression of subordinates by dominants). Studies of glucocorticoid stress hormones in cooperatively breeding species suggest that breeding roles and hormone levels are related to the relative costs of dominance and subordination, which are driven primarily by social interactions. Few studies, however, have considered how environmental factors affect glucocorticoid levels and breeding roles in cooperative breeders, even though environmental stressors modulate seasonal glucocorticoid release and often influence breeding roles. I examined baseline and stress-induced levels of the glucocorticoid corticosterone ( CORT) across 4 years in the plural breeding superb starling, Lamprotornis superbus, to determine whether ( i) environmental factors ( namely rainfall) directly influence breeding roles or ( ii) environmental factors influence social interactions, which in turn drive breeding roles. Chronic baseline and maximal stress-induced CORT changed significantly across years as a function of pre-breeding rainfall, but dominant and subordinate individuals responded differently. Pre-breeding rainfall was also correlated directly with breeding roles. The results are most consistent with the hypothesis that environmental conditions influenced the relative costs of dominance and subordination, which in turn affected the degree and intensity of social interactions and ultimately reproductive decisions and breeding roles.

AB Two genetically distinct potato psyllid populations [Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) (Homoptera: Psyllidae)] were identified in our previous study: native and invasive. The invasive population, ranging from Baja, Mexico to central California, was the result of a recent invasion, while the native population is endemic to Texas. The native (Texas) and invasive (California) populations were collected from tomato and pepper, respectively, and were examined on both hosts to test the comparative fitness of invasive populations. Our results indicated that on both plant hosts, psyllids from the native range demonstrated higher survivorship, a higher growth index, and shorter development times than the psyllids from invasive populations. The fecundity of the native-range psyllids also was significantly higher than that of invasive psyllids on tomato, but not on pepper. For the native population, host plant differences for all fitness measurements were not significant. However, within the invasive population, psyllids feeding on tomatoes showed consistently better survivorship and a higher growth index than those feeding on pepper, despite the decreased developmental time required on peppers. The LC50 values (concentrations causing 50% mortality) of both populations were determined for three pesticides. Resistance to two of these pesticides was found in the invasive population. Thus, the invasive quality of the California populations may be related to increased pesticide resistance. However, it is impossible to determine if the California population was preadapted to pesticide resistance, or if the resistance developed after the range expansion and is simply a contributing factor to maintaining the expansion.

AB During colonization of new habitats, the sequence of arrival among species is in many cases determined by chance. Priority effects imply that differences in arrival time may lead to long-lasting differences in species dominance. To evaluate the importance of priority effects, we performed a community assembly experiment, manipulating the inoculation order of three large cladoceran zooplankton species. The inoculation treatments were crossed with a predation treatment to test whether the presence of a predator (larvae of the phantom midge Chaoborus) results in changes in the strength of species sorting and priority effects. Our results clearly demonstrate priority effects, but also that the presence of a predator impacts both community assembly and the strength of priority effects. In the predation-free treatments, communities were dominated by either Daphnia magna or Daphnia obtusa, depending on the species arrival sequence. Whenever D. obtusa was inoculated after D. magna, the species displayed negative growth. In the presence of Chaoborus predation, the communities were generally dominated by the third species, Simocephalus vetulus. Here, the growth of D. magna was negative when the species was inoculated as second or third. Overall, our results underscore the importance of both priority effects and species sorting during community assembly.

AB 15 lake islands and two mainland sites of Mamry lake in Poland were sampled to investigate community structures and patterns of co-occurrences of ground beetles (Carabidae). The total ground beetle metacommunity of 71 species was divided into a group of core species occupying at least half of all study sites and of satellite species, which occurred at two sites or less. This division is mirrored by reduced dispersal abilities and non-random patterns of site occupancy. Core and satellite species also differed in patterns of relative abundance. The core group followed a lognormal distribution, the satellite group a power function as predicted by the self-similarity model of occurrence. We conclude that the division into core and satellite species is not a sample artefact but reflects different life history strategies. We also conclude that current models of niche division and co-occurrence might miss important aspects of community structure if they do not refer to patterns of dispersal.
   From these findings we infer that the regional distribution of core species might be shaped by species interactions and processes of niche divisions whereas the spatial distribution of satellite species are best interpreted as stemming from random dispersal.

AB Eyewitness accounts written by early travellers to 'the new worlds' provide valuable insights into how seascapes once looked. Although this kind of information has been widely used to chart human impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, it has been greatly overlooked in the marine realm. Here we present a synthesis of 16th to 19th century travellers' descriptions of the Gulf of California and its marine wildlife. The diaries written by conquerors, pirates, missionaries and naturalists described a place in which whales were 'innumerable,' turtles were 'covering the sea' and large fish were so abundant that they could be taken by hand. Beds of pearl oysters that are described had disappeared by 1940 and only historical documents reveal the existence of large, widespread, deep pearl oyster reefs, whose ecology and past functions we know little about. Disqualifying the testimonies of early visitors to a region as 'anecdotal' is dangerous; it may lead to setting inappropriate management targets that could lead to the extinction of species that are rare today but were once much more abundant. Moreover, it represents unfair historical judgement on the work of early natural historians, scholars and scientists. We suggest that the review and analytical synthesis of reports made by early travellers should become part of the pre-requisites for deciding how to manage marine ecosystems today.

AB Vascular plants are quickly emerging as one of the best indicators of human-mediated disturbances in the environment. We developed a plant-based index of biological integrity (IBI) to evaluate headwater wetland condition in response to anthropogenic disturbances in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province of central Pennsylvania. To construct the 1131, we evaluated 50 attributes of the plant community, including species richness, diversity, and evenness. Disturbance was quantified for each site using information on surrounding land use, buffer characteristics, and an assessment of potential site stressors. Ecological dose-response curves were then plotted to evaluate the relationship between each attribute and the disturbance score. Eight attributes showed a consistent and strong response to disturbance and were selected as metrics: adjusted FQAl, % cover of tolerant plant species, % annual species, % non-native species, % invasive species, % trees, % vascular cryptogams, and % cover of Phalaris arundinacea. All metrics were highly and significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with disturbance as were IBI scores. To test the IBI, we used data from 47 sites collected as part of the Juniata Wetland Monitoring Project. The metrics and 1131 scores for this data set were also significantly correlated with disturbance. Although, to date, very few plant-based IBIs are in use, studies from Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Ohio, as well as our study in Pennsylvania demonstrate the efficacy of plant community measures in assessing the overall condition of wetlands.

The main driver behind this is an awareness that biodiversity loss operates at large spatial scales and generally involves reductions and changes in species at different trophic levels simultaneously. Evaluating how ecosystem processes are likely to change following species loss at multiple trophic levels will be difficult because of the feedbacks between levels and between levels and the ecosystem processes of interest. Similarly, carrying out manipulative experiments designed to accommodate multiple trophic levels at the landscape scales in which society is interested will be extremely challenging. Novel approaches, such as the BioMERGE (Biotic Mechanisms of Ecosystem Regulation in the Global Environment) initiative, are needed. In addition, future work should be more services-oriented, rather than process-oriented, if effects of biodiversity change on services are to be properly assessed. Finally, the application of mainstream ecosystem ecology to biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research seems to have been neglected to date. In this respect, there is potential for the mass-balance approach to contribute to the debate.

AB A fundamental question in guild studies is how to separate species into guilds. In a seminal manuscript, Fauchald & Jumars [Oceanography and Marine Biology, Annual Review 17 (1979) 193] summarized polychaete feeding biology and proposed a conceptual framework to test hypotheses on the sympatric occurrence of congeners with limited morphological differentiation. Twenty-six years after this publication, few studies have tested the validity and practical functioning of this scheme of polychaete feeding guilds and then only using part of the classification. The objective of the present study was to analyze the applicability of polychaete feeding guilds to ecological and environment assessments. Two data sets from Santa Catarina Island Bay, southern Brazil, were used. The first data set deals with spatial distribution of natural polychaete assemblages along the bay. The second data set treats fauna in urbanized versus relatively pristine mangroves. Multivariate analysis showed similar patterns in sample groups formed using guilds or densities and composition data. The role of feeding guilds in benthic systems was assessed through comparison with environmental variables. The polychaete assemblage from the Bay was related to sediment type. Motile and discretely motile carnivores and herbivores with jawed probosces matched coarse sands; surface deposit feeders and filter feeders were found in fine sands; and surface and subsurface deposit feeders and carnivores, all with soft probosces matched silt and clay sediments. The data analyses in mangroves showed surface deposit feeders and filter feeders in undisturbed sites and omnivorous species in disturbed ones. The polychaete feeding guilds appear relevant to assembly rules based on resource availability, to resource partitioning and to interspecific competition.

AB The Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis predicts that introduced plants should lose enemy resistance and in turn evolve increased size or fecundity. We tested the first prediction of this hypothesis by growing introduced North American and native European genotypes of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) in common gardens in the state of Washington, USA, and in Girona, Spain. In both gardens we measured levels of hypericin and pseudohypericin (and in Washington, hypericide)-compounds known to be toxic to generalist pathogens and herbivores. In a third common garden, in Spain, we experimentally manipulated native pathogen pressure (by treating plants with fungicides) and quantified how pathogen resistance varied between North American and European genotypes. North American St. John's Wort had lower levels of hypericin than European conspecifies in common gardens in Washington and Spain. North American plants also produced less hypericide (in Washington) and pseudohypericin (in Spain) than did European plants. In Spain. individuals were attacked by three generalist pathogens: Collelotrichum Sp. (Coelomycetes). Alternaria sp. (Hyphomycetes), and Fusarium oxysporum (Hyphomycetes). A higher percentage of individuals from North American Populations were infected by pathogens and died from pathogen attack compared to European genotypes. Infection also appeared to reduce plant size and fecundity; these negative effects were similar in Magnitude for North American and European genotypes. Taken together, results indicate that introduced St. John's Wort has lost enemy resistance. However, contrary to EICA, Current and previous results indicate that these chances have not been associated with an increase in plant size or fecundity.

AB Common raccoons (Procyon lotor (L., 1758)), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana Kerr, 1792), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis (Schreber, 1776)) are common urban inhabitants, yet their relative demographic response to urbanization is unknown. Urbanization often affects community structure, and understanding these effects is essential in rapidly changing landscapes. We examined mesopredator-community structure in small and large patches of natural habitat surrounded by urban, suburban, or rural matrices. We created generalized logit models using road-survey and livetrapping data to examine effects of surrounding land use on proportions of opossums and skunks relative to raccoons, while accounting for effects of season and year and their interactions. For large sites, the land use x season model was chosen for both data sets, and occurrence of opossums and skunks relative to raccoons was higher at the rural site (P < 0.001 for all tests). For small sites, the land-use model best fit the road-survey data, with a higher occurrence of skunks relative to raccoons at the rural site (chi(2) = 21.06, df = 1, P < 0.001). However, the season model best fit the trapping data for small sites. Our data indicated that raccoons exhibited a greater demographic response to urbanization, suggesting that they exploit anthropogenic resources more efficiently. Although numerous reasons exist for disparity in anthropogenic-resource use, differences in intraspecific tolerance and the role of learning in foraging behaviors were best supported by our observations.

AB 1. Describing and understanding patterns in biological diversity along major geographical gradients is an important topic in ecology. Samples collected from a large number of physically and chemically comparable stream sites along a 4000 m gradient of altitude in the Andes of Ecuador served to characterise patterns of family richness of aquatic macroinvertebrates at the scale of the stream site (local) and at that of discrete altitudinal zones.
   2. Both mean local and zonal family richness decreased by about 50% from sea level to 4000 m a.s.l. Local richness declined linearly, while zonal richness remained constant from sea level up to a threshold altitude of about 1800 m, whereafter it decreased.
   3. From sea level to 1800 m few families were lost from zonal richness and few were gained. From 1800 to 3800 m the decrease in the number of families was accounted for by a loss of families present in lowland streams, with few new families gained. Hence, there was relatively little turnover of families along the entire gradient.
   4. The diverging pattern of local and zonal richness was caused by sporadically occurring families inflating zonal richness at mid-altitudes. If the sporadic families were represented by the same species found commonly in the lowlands, then the mid-altitudinal zonal richness would be maintained by a 'rescue effect'. More probably, however, the sporadically occurring families found at mid-altitudes are each represented by new species replacing each other along the gradient, the families progressively diminishing in species richness and occurrence as the overall temperature tolerance of the family is approached.
   5. This study demonstrates that spatial scale affects altitudinal patterns in the taxonomic richness of stream invertebrates. It also showed that family-level identification can facilitate interpretation of sources and sinks of biodiversity along geographic gradients.

AB Ram feeding is the process by which a predatory fish uses a high-velocity lunge or chase to overtake its prey. This study compares the strike and prey capture behaviors and kinematics of three species of ram-feeding fishes: Florida gar Lepisosteus platyrhincus, redfin needlefish Strongylura notata, and great barracuda Sphyraena barracuda. These ram-feeding piscivores are morphologically similar with fusiform bodies, posteriorly placed dorsal and anal fins, and large, conical teeth. Strike and prey capture kinematics for five individuals of each species were recorded with high-speed video. Pre-strike behavior in L. platyrhincus consists of a slow stalk, resulting in the close, lateral positioning of the predator's head relative to the prey. Lepisosteus employ a sideways lunge of the head during the strike, which lasts only 25-40 ms and is the most rapid strike among these three species. Strongylura notata and Sphyraena barracuda exhibit longitudinal orientation to the prey before the strike, followed by a high velocity, head-on lunge, initiated by an s-start in Sphyraena barracuda. Prey capture in adult L. platyrhincus and Strongylura notata is characterized by the jaws closing on the prey, with the prey held orthogonal to the jaws. This is followed by manipulation using the inertia of the prey to reposition the prey head first, and then suction transport into the buccal cavity. Prey capture in juvenile Sphyraena is accomplished by closing the jaws after the prey has entered the buccal cavity, resulting in possible ram transport of the prey with no oral manipulation under these experimental conditions. Although these three species all employ ram feeding for prey capture of elusive prey, each species has a unique repertoire that appears to minimize hydrodynamic constraints and prey response, utilize locomotory capabilities, and may be suited to each species' specific habitat.

AB Recent studies of the forces behind the diversification of parasite assemblages have shed light on many aspects of parasite biodiversity. By using only parasite species richness as their measure of diversity, however, previous investigations have ignored the relatedness among parasite species and the taxonomic structure of the assemblages, which contain much information about their evolutionary origins. Here, we performed a comparative analysis across 50 species of fish from the coast of Brazil; we evaluated the effects of several host traits (body size, social behaviour, feeding habits, preference for benthic vs. pelagic habitats, depth range, and ability to enter brackish waters) on the diversity of their assemblages of metazoan parasites. As measures of diversity, we used parasite species richness, as well as the average taxonomic distinctness of the assemblage and its variance; the latter measures are based on the average taxonomic distance between any two parasite species in an assemblage. Unlike parasite species richness, taxonomic distinctness,vas unaffected by the number of host individuals examined per species. Fish body length proved to be the main predictor of parasite species richness, even when controlling for the confounding influences of host phylogeny and sampling effort, although it did not correlate with measures of parasite taxonomic distinctness. Predatory fish also had higher parasite species richness than planktivores, but this trend could not be confirmed using phylogenetically independent contrasts between host taxa. The main host feature associated with the taxonomic diversity of parasites was schooling behaviour, with schooling fish having more taxonomically diverse parasite assemblages than those of their non-schooling relatives. When focusing on endoparasite species only, both predatory feeding habits and a broad depth range were associated with the taxonomic distinctness of parasites. Our results suggest that certain host traits (i.e. body size) determine how many parasite species a host can accumulate over evolutionary time, whereas different host features influence the processes causing the taxonomic diversification of parasite assemblages.

AB The water louse Asellus aquaticus is a widespread, euryoecious species, mostly uniform throughout its range. However, six subspecies are known from the Dinaric karst in the northwestern Balkans. They include some specialized subterranean populations. The pattern of genetic variation among subterranean and surface populations in this hydrographically highly fragmented karst region was investigated using a 653 bp fragment of the mitochondrial gene (COI). Sequencing of 168 individuals from 25 localities revealed 72 haplotypes. AMOVA and methods of phylogenetic reconstruction all uncovered hydrographic structuring of genetic variation of the populations. Nested clade analysis pointed out several fragmentation events, along with some range expansions within hydrographical systems. By superimposing the subterranean mode of life on the phylogeographical pattern, three independent cave colonizations could be inferred within a distance of < 100 km. Caves were invaded after the ancestral surface populations became isolated through vicariant fragmentation. A possible scenario of hydrographic history of the region was constructed combining the molecular data with palaeogeographical information.

AB Comparative genetic linkage maps provide a powerful tool for the study of karyotypic evolution. We constructed a joint SSR/RAPD genetic linkage map of the Helianthus petiolaris genome and used it, along with an integrated SSR genetic linkage map derived from four independent H. annuus mapping populations, to examine the evolution of genome structure between these two annual sunflower species. The results of this work indicate the presence of 27 colinear segments resulting from a minimum of eight translocations and three inversions. These 11 rearrangements are more than previously suspected on the basis of either cytological or genetic map-based analyses. Taken together, these rearrangements required a minimum of 20 chromosomal breakages/fusions. On the basis of estimates of the time since divergence of these two species (750,000-1,000,000 years), this translates into an estimated rate of 5.5-7.3 chromosomal rearrangements per million years of evolution, the highest rate reported for any taxonomic group to date.

AB The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) if morphological characters of littoral and pelagic brook charr are inherited by their progeny when both forms are raised in the same conditions; (2) if sexual dimorphism would account for part of the variation in littoral and pelagic brook charr morphology; (3) the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to trophic polymorphism of brook charr; and (4) if a fish that had already performed one plastic response can reverse this response in a functional direction when shifted to an alternative habitat (e.g. littoral to pelagic). We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment over 16 months after hatching in which fish of both ecotypes were fed in artificial pelagic (prey captured in the water column) and littoral (prey captured on the bottom) habitats. The results show that morphological differences between littoral and pelagic brook charr are heritable and related to both genetic and environmental factors. The percent variation of fish morphology explained by the effects of genetic and environmental factors was 17% and 15% respectively when the effect of sex was controlled, and 13% and 26% respectively when the effect of sex was not accounted for, indicating that sexual dimorphism accounts for an important part of the overall variation in brook charr morphology. The shift of some individuals from their initial to the opposite habitat from months 12-16 highlighted the role of the genetic and environmental factors as well as the magnitude of morphological plasticity: some characters remained unchanged during this 4-month shift, while some others exhibited a complete reversal, in line with the predictions of functional morphology. This result indicates that some characters are under pure environmental control and are not fixed after a fish has adopted a given strategy.

AB Most conceptual marine eutrophication models predict that ephemeral and epiphytic macroalgae will become substantially more abundant with increasing nutrient richness. This expectation is based on the fact that most of these fast-growing algae possess high requirements for inorganic N and P and, therefore, suffer from nutrient limitation under nutrient poor conditions. We tested the hypothesis that nutrient enrichment will stimulate the abundance of ephemeral macroalgae by studying the abundance and species composition of these algae on several types of substrata along an artificial nutrient gradient. The total biomass of ephemeral macroalgae differed considerably among different types of substrata.
   The total ephemeral load was significantly higher on consolidated substrata than on large perennial algae, but we were unable to detect any systematic increase in the abundance of these ephemerals with increasing nutrient richness. We found, however, indications that the composition of the ephemeral assemblage changed with nutrient richness. Hence, corticated filamentous algae (mostly red algae) were more abundant at low nutrient richness while thin foliose algae (mainly green species) tended to become more abundant with increasing nutrient richness in most of the surveyed assemblages.

AB Surface waterblooms of toxic cyanobacteria (scums) interfere with the use of lakes, for instance in the production of drinking water or for recreation. Routine monitoring data are not sufficient for early warning due to the large temporal and spatial variability in the occurrence of surface waterblooms, and the time lag between the formation of the scum and the availability of relevant information for risk management. We combined a "traditional" dynamic simulation model based upon differential equations with fuzzy logic to describe the three main conditions governing surface waterbloom formation: (1) a preexisting population of cyanobacteria, (2) buoyancy of the cells, and (3) stability of the water column. The attributes and membership functions of the fuzzy model were based on earlier field studies of diel changes in buoyancy and vertical distribution of cyanobacteria. The model was applied without further calibration to the large lake IJsselmeer (1200 km(2)) in the Netherlands, and we validated the model output using 12 years of NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers) satellite images on which surface blooms are discernible as an enhanced vegetation index or increased surface water temperature. Existing surface blooms were predicted with high accuracy, but additional blooms were also predicted. A statistical test (Cohen's Kappa) showed that correct predictions of the absence or presence of surface blooms were highly unlikely to have occurred by chance only. The model can be used to predict the occurrence of surface waterblooms in advance on the basis of the long-term weather forecast, leaving time for appropriate management of the problem. The lake management has expressed interest in converting the present model into a fully operational-online-early warning system.

AB Since the opening of the Suez Canal in the 19th century, a growing number of teleosts species have become permanently established in the eastern Mediterranean. As environmental parameters in the Mediterranean are very different from those in the Red Sea, there is an opportunity to evaluate the gene flow associated with the acclimatisation of these species to their new environment. Initial colonisation may have been restricted to individuals with marginal genotypes compared to populations of the Red Sea, eventually better adapted to the Mediterranean environment. Alternatively, colonisation may have occurred without major genetic differentiation, due to a large flux of immigrants and a continuous gene flow from the populations of origin. Using different molecular genetic techniques (mitochondrial DNA, Exon-Primed Intron-Crossing PCR amplification (EPIC) and Inter-Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSRs), patterns of genetic differentiation on both sides of the Suez isthmus were tested on two Lessepsian rabbitfish species (Siganus rivulatus and Siganus luridus). The absence of genetic differentiation between Mediterranean and Red Sea populations in both species showed that a great number of migrants participated to the colonisation of the Mediterranean, excluding any bottleneck event. This colonisation success suggests large eco-physiological plasticity in S. rivulatits and S. luridus that allowed them to thrive in the new environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Models used to predict species' potential distributions have been described as either correlative or mechanistic. We attempted to determine whether correlative models could perform as well as mechanistic models for predicting species potential distributions, using a case study. We compared potential distribution predictions made for a coastal dune plant (Scaevola plumieri) along the coast of South Africa, using a mechanistic model based on summer water balance (SWB), and two correlative models (a profile and a group discrimination technique). The profile technique was based on principal components analysis (PCA) and the group-discrimination technique was based on multiple logistic regression (LR). Kappa (kappa) statistics were used to objectively assess model performance and model agreement. Model performance was calculated by measuring the levels of agreement (using kappa) between a set of testing localities (distribution records not used for model building) and each of the model predictions. Using published interpretive guidelines for the kappa statistic, model performance was "excellent" for the SWB model (kappa = 0.852), perfect for the LR model (kappa = 1.000), and "very good" for the PCA model (kappa = 0.721). Model agreement was calculated by measuring the level of agreement between the mechanistic model and the two correlative models. There was "good" model agreement between the SWB and PCA models (kappa = 0.679) and "very good" agreement between the SWB And LR models (kappa = 0.786). The results suggest that correlative models can perform as well as or better than simple mechanistic models. The predictions generated from these three modelling designs are likely to generate different insights into the potential distribution and biology of the target organism and may be appropriate in different situations. The choice of model is likely to be influenced by the aims of the study, the biology of the target organism, the level of knowledge the target organism's biology, and data quality.

AB Currently there is no single accepted hypothesis to explain gall-forming insect species richness at a particular locality. Hygrothermal stress, soil nutrient availability, plant species richness, plant structural complexity, plant family or genus size, and host plant geographical range size have all been implicated in the determination of gall-forming insect species richness. Previous studies of such richness at xeric sites have included predominantly scleromorphic vegetation, usually on nutrient-poor soils. This study is the first to investigate gall-forming insect species richness of xeric, non-scleromorphic vegetation. Two habitat types were sampled at each of five localities across a rainfall gradient in the savanna biome of South Africa. The habitat types differed with respect to plant species composition and topography. Gall-forming insect species richness did not increase with increasing hygrothermal stress or decreasing soil fertility. Rather, gall-forming insect species richness was largely dependent on the presence of Terminalia sericea as well as other members of the Combretaceae and Mimosaceae. Plots where all these taxa were present had the highest gall-forming insect species richness, up to 15 species, whereas plots with none of these taxa had a maximum of four galling-insect species. Despite herb, shrub and tree strata not differing in gall-forming insect species richness, insect galls were more common on woody than non-woody plants. Also, stem galls were more frequent than apical or leaf galls. An alternative hypothesis to explain local gall-forming insect species richness is suggested: galling insects may preferentially select those plant species with characteristics such as chemical toxicity, mechanical strength, degree of lignification or longevity that can be manipulated to benefit the galler. Thus plant community composition should be considered when attempting to explain gall-forming insect species richness patterns.

AB Mechanisms that maintain species isolation within sympatric congeners have attracted analysis in many kinds of organisms, but not in snakes. We studied two sibling species of amphibious sea snakes (Laticauda colubrina and L. frontalis) on the island of Efate, in the Pacific Ocean republic of Vanuatu, The two taxa are almost identical morphologically, except that L. colubrina grows much larger than L. frontalis. No natural hybrids have been reported, and geographic distributions of the two taxa suggest the possibility of sympatric speciation. Our fieldwork shows that the two taxa are often syntopic and overlap in breeding seasons. Behavioral studies in outdoor arenas show that the separation between these two taxa is maintained by species-specific cues that control male courtship. Males of both species courted conspecific females but not heterospecific females. The proximate mechanism driving this separation involves chemical cues. Adult females of both taxa possess distinctive lipids in the skin. Males directed courtship behavior (chin-pressing) to hexane-extracted samples of lipids from conspecific but not heterospecific females. Males of the dwarf species (L. frontalis) were more selective courters than were those of the larger taxon (L. colubrina), perhaps because a preference for courting larger females means that L. colubrina males would be unlikely to court L. frontalis-sized (i.e., small) females even in the absence of pheromonal barriers.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB Populations in nature face a number of factors that can alter their traits and subsequent performance. Predation is one factor that can have widespread effects on the mean trait value in a prey population because predators can impact prey traits through a number of processes. Predators can directly induce prey phenotypes through visual and chemical cues, predators can indirectly alter prey phenotypes by thinning the prey population (thereby reducing competition), and predators can cause selection on prey phenotypes through nonrandom killing. Ecologists are beginning to understand each of these three processes in isolation, but these processes act on prey phenotypes simultaneously, and we lack information on the relative importance of these processes in determining the final phenotype of prey.
   I used a system of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) and dragonfly predators (Anax longipes) to determine the separate and combined impacts of induction, thinning, and selection on the behavior, morphology, and growth of tadpoles reared in aquatic mesocosms. Using combinations of hand thinning, cues emitted from caged predators, and lethal predators, I demonstrated that the impact of lethal predators on growth was mediated primarily through thinning, the impact on morphology was primarily through induction, and the impact on behavior was affected similarly through thinning and induction. Surprisingly, while we know from numerous studies that the dragonflies kill tadpoles nonrandomly, selection did not have a significant impact on the final phenotypes of the tadpoles. This work appears to be the first study that identifies the relative magnitudes of the three predatory processes on a suite of prey phenotypes. The three processes can have opposing or supporting effects, the relative magnitudes of which likely differ among systems, illustrating why we often observe contradictory results when we examine the impact of lethal predators on prey phenotypes. Thus, it is important that we identify the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of predation, rather than simply observing the outcomes and then inferring which processes are responsible.

AB Hybrid sterility is thought to be due to deleterious epistatic interactions between genes from different species. Here we demonstrate that dominant genic incompatibility does not contribute to sterility in hybrids between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and five closely related species. Sterile diploids were made fertile by genome doubling to produce hybrid tetraploids. Based on these and previous results, we conclude that neither genic incompatibility nor classical chromosomal speciation models apply.

AB [1] The northern latitudes have warmed by similar to0.8degreesC since the early 1970s, but not all areas have warmed equally. Eurasia shows an overall warming trend, while North America exhibits warming at a lower rate and even a slight cooling trend during the last 50 years in the eastern United States. We analyzed a recently developed satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data set (July 1981 to December 1999) to assess vegetation response to these temperature changes. An index of persistence of the NDVI trend was used to generate patches of different levels of persistence. The persistence data were analyzed for patch area, patch perimeter, patch number, patch coherence, largest patch size, patch fragmentation, pixel contiguity, pixel clustering, and conditional probability of pixel adjacency. We address two questions: (1) Is there a difference in the spatial pattern of long-term NDVI increase in comparison to short-term increase? and (2) Are there differences in the spatial patterns of patches between Eurasia and North America? The results indicate a persistent and spatially extensive and connected greening trend in Eurasia, relative to North America. The regions showing short-term greening in Eurasia show a scattered pattern of spatially remote small patches. In North America the long-term greening pattern is spatially fragmented, and a mixture of short-and long-term NDVI increase is found, unlike in Eurasia. Therefore we conclude that the greening trend in Eurasia is more persistent and spatially extensive than in North America, which is qualitatively consistent with near-surface air temperature observations.

AB The concentration of contaminants usually decreases with increasing distance from a point-source disturbance, so sampling to detect ecological impacts is usually done at 1 spatial scale, often at regular intervals from the point of discharge. There is, however, concern that the choice of an inappropriate scale will cause failure to detect impacts or failure to identify and estimate the size of impacts. In this study, the putative impact of a shoreline sewage outfall on the abundance of green ephemeral algae and gastropods was sampled at 2 spatial scales (tens of metres and several kilometres from the point of discharge) in order to determine whether the ecological impact of effluent was comparable across these, as would be expected if the abundance of species follows the gradient of contaminants. Such sampling also enabled the putative impact of this outfall on the spatial variability of taxa to be examined at 3 spatial scales: (1) among quadrats in the site with the outfall compared to variance among quadrats in other sites on the shore with the outfall; (2) among quadrats in non-outfall sites on the shore with the outfall compared with variance among quadrats in sites on control shores; (3) between non-outfall sites on the shore with the outfall in comparison to among sites on the control shores. A greater abundance of Enteromorpha spp. was found close to the outfall than further away at both spatial scales. Patterns in the abundance of many other taxa differed between the 2 spatial scales of sampling. The density of the limpet Patelloida latistrigata was much greater close to than far from the outfall, when considered on a large spatial scale. At the smaller scale among sites on a single shore, the impact was completely reversed-densities were much smaller close to than away from the outfall. Variances, like abundances, did not always follow the gradient of contaminants and different patterns were often seen at different spatial scales. Thus, putative impacts should be sampled on multiple spatial scales using nested sampling designs. Where this is not possible, the spatial scale at which an impact might be detected or interpreted needs to be clearly stated because the generalisation that a disturbance has a similar impact at all spatial scales relevant to the population being studied cannot be made without explicit tests.

AB Few studies have investigated the effects of urban landscape composition on avian habitat selection at urban-park edges. I assessed how the number of species, density of guilds, and density of individual species varied between edge and interior habitats in six large wooded parks in Madrid (Spain), and analysed such patterns in relation to habitat structure, car traffic, and pedestrian traffic. Few differences in habitat structure were found; whereas car and pedestrian traffic were significantly higher at edges. Species foraging in trees and on the ground, and nesting in trees and in tree cavities had lower numbers and breeding densities at edges, probably as a result of the disturbance from traffic noise and pedestrians. Species highly habituated to human activities (House Sparrows Passer domesticus and Rock Doves Columba livia) displayed opposite patterns, with higher breeding densities at urban-park edges, probably due to their higher foraging opportunities (refuse, people leftovers, deliberate feeding) and nest site availability in adjacent buildings. Urbanisation sprawl may increase the prevalence of edge specialists and diminish the representation of species with specific habitat requirements.

AB One of the main tasks confronting community ecologists is to explain why a particular site harbours a certain number of species. The site might range from a drop of water to the whole Earth, and the species might be drawn from a very restricted taxon or include all living organisms. The common problem, however, is to understand the relative importance of speciation and extinction and, more locally, of immigration and loss. speciation is the ultimate motor driving biodiversity and ecologists need to know the factors influencing rates of speciation, and whether there is a feedback, positive or negative, between species numbers and the generation of new tare. However, the relative importance of speciation and other factors determining species numbers varies crucially across different scales of enquiry. Here, we explore some of these issues as we move from a macro- to microscale perspective, focusing on a limited number of studies that we believe make important advances in the field.

AB We constructed a regression model for the relationship between stable-hydrogen isotope ratios in immature Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii) feathers (deltaD(f)) and precipitation in areas where feathers were grown (deltaD(p)) across much of the latitudinal and longitudinal extent of the species' breeding range. We used our model to estimate deltaD(p) values from deltaD(f) values of immature Cooper's Hawks captured during migration in the Florida Keys. We compared these estimated deltaD(p) values to a published map of deltaD(p) values of North American precipitation to learn the latitudinal origins of migrants. We reviewed previous migration banding studies to estimate the longitudinal range of migrants. Our analysis suggested that most of the immature Cooper's Hawks migrating through the Keys originated in natal areas in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions of the continent. We found no difference in the passage date of northern and southern birds or in the latitudinal origins of males and females. This new information will aid in the interpretation of population trends generated from the ongoing migration count in the Keys.

AB A number of ecological models have been developed to provide an understanding of the various biotic and abiotic components required to conserve biodiversity and to reconcile objectives and methods between those interested in the conservation of species (e.g., population management) and those advocating the conservation of spaces (e.g, protected areas). One of the better known efforts-pioneered in the Pacific Northwest of the United States-is a hierarchical ecological framework, that separates biodiversity into compositional, structural, and functional attributes at the genetic, population, community-ecosystem, and landscape levels of organization. We present an adaptation of this terrestrial framework consistent with the ecological function of marine environments. Our adaptation differs in its treatment of the community and ecosystem levels of organization. In our marine framework, the community level denotes predominantly the biotic community components of biodiversity, and the ecosystem level-consistent with marine terminology-denotes predominantly physical and chemical components. The community and ecosystem levels are further separated into those attributes based on ecological structures such as depth or species richness and those based on ecological processes such as water motion or succession. The distinction between the biotic (genetic, population, and community) and abiotic (ecosystem) is required because the biological components of biodiversity such as competition or predation are often more difficult to observe than the abiotic components such as upwellings, substratum, or temperature. As a result, efforts to conserve marine biodiversity are often dependent on the observable abiotic (ecosystem) components, which can be used as surrogates for the identification and monitoring of biotic (community) components. We used our hierarchical framework to identify, and suggest how conservation strategies could be implemented in marine environments depending on whether existing data are to be used or new data are to be collected.

AB Parasitoids are the most important natural enemies of many insect species. Larvae of many Drosophila species can defend themselves against attack by parasitoids through a cellular immune response called encapsulation. The paper reviews recent studies of the evolutionary biology and ecological genetics of resistance in Drosophila, concentrating on D. melanogaster. The physiological basis of encapsulation, and the genes known to interfere with resistance are briefly summarized. Evidence for within- and between-population genetic variation in resistance from isofemale line, artificial selection and classical genetic studies are reviewed. There is now firm evidence that resistance is costly to Drosophila, and the nature of this cost is discussed, and the possibility that it may involve a reduction in metabolic rate considered. Comparative data on encapsulation and metabolic rates across seven Drosophila species provides support for this hypothesis. Finally, the possible population and community ecological consequences of evolution in the levels of host resistance are examined.

AB When interspecific competitors resolve their co-existence by habitat segregation, their competition might, like a ghost, be invisible because the species occupy separate habitats. Population fluctuations should often bring the species into competition in jointly occupied habitats where their competition can be measured by habitat isodars (lines or planes of density where the expected fitness of individuals is the same in all occupied habitats). We tested the theory by calculating isodars for two species of lemmings with distinct habitat preferences When population densities are high, both habitats are occupied by both species But as densities decline, habitat isodars suggest that the joint dynamics of each species pass through a region where each occupies a separate habitat (the ghost of competition). the competition was asymmetrical. The density of collared lemmings in their preferred habitat was reduced as the density of brown lemmings increased in the same habitat. But collared lemmings had no direct competitive effect on brown lemmings. The interspecific effect from brown lemmings was comparable to - possibly even in excess of - intraspecific competition for habitat. The asymmetric competition for habitat yields spectacular new kinds of isolegs categorizing habitat competition between co-existing species. Although current evidence implicates competition, the patterns are also consistent with apparent competition driven by specialized predators. Regardless of whether lemming habitat use reflects true or apparent competition, the associated density dependent differences in habitat preference are likely to have major consequences for the nonstable dynamics of lemmings and non-linear lemming isoclines.

AB The carbon balance is ill defined for agricultural lands so that their role in global C balance cannot be accurately estimated. Changes in agriculture in the last 50 years have resulted in a general increase in grain yields, total net annual production (TNAP), and C input to the soil. Amounts of C returned annually with crop residues on Sanborn Field, one of the oldest experimental fields in the United Slates, increased after 1950, and this was accompanied by C accumulation in soils. Under wheat monocrop (with mineral fertilizer), C accumulated at a rate of 50 g m(-2) year(-1). A 3-year rotation (corn/wheat/clover) with manure and nitrogen applications sequestered 150 g m(-2) year(-1) of C. Total C balance for the wheat and corn production area in the United States, approximated on the basis of these rates, indicates that at least 32 Tg C was sequestered annually during the last 40-50 years.

AB We quantitatively assessed rodent dispersal of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a lowland tropical rain forest. We examined fecal pellets from seven rodent species of the genera Proechimys, Oryzomys, and Mesomys trapped each month from August 1983 through July 1984 at the Cocha Cashu field station in Manu National Park, Peru.
   We found sporocarps of Sclerocystis coremioides and spores of four Glomus species in 69.3% of fecal samples, with 37.5% of samples containing 2-4 fungus species. There were median numbers of 8.6 S. coremioides sporocarps and 712 Glomus spores/0.1 g feces. S. coremioides and all Glomus species comprised up to 4.1 and 5.4% of fecal mass, respectively. We did not detect differences in fungus consumption by rodent species or sex, but did find significant differences between rodent genera. More than 60% of Proechimys samples contained glomalean fungi in contrast to approximate to 37% of Oryzomys samples. Occurrence of the two fungus genera in feces differed seasonally but was generally congruent between Proechimys and Oryzomys. Glomus presence in feces is significantly positively associated with the dry season. Both rodent genera together annually pass 2.96 x 10(5) S. coremioides sporocarps and 7.30 x 10(7) Glomus spores/ha at Cocha Cashu. We concluded that Proechimys and Oryzomys are likely to be important agents of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus spore dispersal.

AB We investigated the cost of first-time breeding in a population of Lesser Snow Geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) nesting at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, Canada. We estimated local survival and capture probabilities of female geese by capture-recapture analysis. We first found that birds were less likely to be recaptured one year after their first successful breeding than on later occasions. Since only successfully nesting birds are captured, this suggests that first-time breeding affects the ability of nesting the next year. We then show that this effect of first breeding is much more severe for birds nesting at age 2 (the youngest age at which Lesser Snow Geese can breed) than for birds starting to breed at an older age. Finally, we compare the mean expected Lifetime reproductive success for birds breeding for the first time as two-year-olds or as three-year-olds, conditionally on their survival until age 4. On average, birds first nesting as two-year-olds produce similar numbers of offspring in a lifetime as birds starting at age 3.

AB 1. The feeding guild is a useful tool for analysing community structure. Unfortunately, although there has been much work done on guilds of forest and woodland birds, there have been few studies in which differences between habitats have been assayed for consistency of guild structure. This can be done only by surveying replicate sites of each habitat type because this yields an indication of similarity between sites of the same class of habitat. If guild structure differs little between each replicate site, then one has confidence that that structure meaningfully characterizes the habitat type in question.
   2. In this study, foraging information is used to produce a guild classification for birds of forests and woodlands of central Victoria, Australia. Four replicate sites of five forest and woodland classes were censued.
   3. Guild structures in two habitat classes (open woodlands of the Goulburn River valley, and Gippsland manna gum Eucalyptus pryoriana woodlands) were distinct from both each other and also from those of three other habitat types (montane forests, foothill woodlands, and box-ironbark dominated forests). There was little differentiation between the latter three habitat types.
   4. Much the same guild structure occurred in replicate sites of each habitat class, indicating that there is a systematic basis for guild structure that can be broadly related to habitat structure. In some habitats, maintenance of guild structure from replicate to replicate is mediated by similar arrays of species, whilst in other habitat types, there are significant differences in the actual species occupying guilds even though numbers of species in each guild are similar. Thus, use of replicate sites provides important additional information on how guilds are composed in different habitats.

AB Three different approaches for assessing the impact of a permanent increase in water level on wetland vegetation were studied using a long-term, controlled. and replicated experiment. These three approaches were: (1) digitized vegetation maps derived from aerial photographs; (2) vegetation data (species abundance, species diversity) from 10 permanent quadrats in each cell;, and (3) Bray-Curtis similarity indices comparing the composition of the vegetation in permanent quadrats within a cell and among cells. This study was conducted in a 10-celled wetland complex in the Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada. There were three water level treatments: (1) the normal or mean regulated water level in the surrounding Delta Marsh, (2) the medium (30 cm above normal), and (3) the high (60 cm above normal). There were four, three, and three cells (ranging in total area from 6 to 8 ha), respectively, in each treatment. The vegetation in all cells had been reestablished with a drawdown just prior to this study. To reduce cell-to-cell variation, we adjusted the indicators derived from vegetation maps from 1985 through 1989 by subtracting the mean values of the same indicators in 1979 and 1980, after 15-16 yr of normal water level conditions. The adjusted percentage of a cell covered with open water increased significantly and two other adjusted indicators, the number of vegetation types and the number of multispecies vegetation types, decreased significantly in the flooded treatments. The percentage of a cell covered with sparse emergent vegetation and percentage covered with standing litter did not differ significantly among treatments. In permanent quadrats, species richness, total shoot density of the emergent species, and the Shannon diversity index showed significant treatment effects: all three declined in the flooded treatments. The Simpson's index, however, did not show a treatment effect. When Bray-Curtis similarity indices comparing the vegetation either among permanent quadrats within a cell or for the same permanent quadrat in a cell among years were used, either within-cell vegetation heterogeneity or ongoing successional changes in the vegetation made it impossible to detect treatment effects.

AB Life history theory suggests that reproduction at one point in time involves costs in terms of energy, reduced survival, or probability of reproduction at a future point in time. In long-lived iteroparous organisms, initiating reproduction at a relatively young age may exact a cost in terms of reduced survivorship, but an early age of first reproduction could be beneficial if it lengthens the breeding lifespan. Data collected over 30 years from one population of rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, were analyzed to determine the fertility and survivorship costs of initiating reproduction at a relatively young age. Low population density and high social status increased the chances of accelerating age at first parturition, but high dominance rank was not associated with greater lifetime reproductive success. Rapid reproductive maturation neither reduced short-term survivorship nor decreased lifespan. Fertility costs arose if young females reared a male, but not female, offspring. The fitness consequences of rapid reproductive maturation depend upon longevity, with age at death having a significantly greater impact on lifetime reproductive success than age at first parturition.

AB Life-history traits of 101 clones from two populations of Daphnia magna were measured under controlled environmental conditions in the laboratory.  Some individuals had four juvenile instars, other had five.  This depended on their length at birth and on the population they came from.  Females in the group with five juvenile instars were smaller at birth but larger and older at maturity than those with four juvenile instars.  Within groups of females with equal numbers of peradult instars (instar groups) age and size at maturity increased with size at birth.  This relationship differed significantly among instar groups for both age and size at maturity.  Significant differences in age and size at maturity between two populations become non-significant when size at birth was used as a covariable in ANCOVA.  Within populations, size at birth depended on the clone and on the parity of the clutch.  First-clutch offspring were considerably smaller than those from later clutches.  The results suggest that variability in life-history traits is common within and between clones, but that most of this variation can be accounted for by size at birth and the number of pre-adult instars.

AB The tropics are the source of most biodiversity yet inadequate sampling obscures answers to fundamental questions about how this diversity evolves. We leveraged samples assembled over decades of fieldwork to study diversification of the largest tropical bird radiation, the suboscine passerines. Our phylogeny, estimated using data from 2389 genomic regions in 1940 individuals of 1287 species, reveals that peak suboscine species diversity in the Neotropics is not associated with high recent speciation rates but rather with the gradual accumulation of species over time. Paradoxically, the highest speciation rates are in lineages from regions with low species diversity, which are generally cold, dry, unstable environments. Our results reveal a model in which species are forming faster in environmental extremes but have accumulated in moderate environments to form tropical biodiversity hotspots.

AB Plants benefit from associations with a diverse community of root-colonizing microbes. Deciphering the mechanisms underpinning these beneficial services are of interest for improving plant productivity. We report a plant-beneficial interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and the root microbiota under iron deprivation that is dependent on the secretion of plant-derived coumarins. Disrupting this pathway alters the microbiota and impairs plant growth in iron-limiting soil. Furthermore, the microbiota improves ironlimiting plant performance via a mechanism dependent on plant iron import and secretion of the coumarin fraxetin. This beneficial trait is strain specific yet functionally redundant across phylogenetic lineages of the microbiota. Transcriptomic and elemental analyses revealed that this interaction between commensals and coumarins promotes growth by relieving iron starvation. These results show that coumarins improve plant performance by eliciting microbe-assisted iron nutrition. We propose that the bacterial root microbiota, stimulated by secreted coumarins, is an integral mediator of plant adaptation to ironlimiting soils.

AB There is increasing interest in the plant microbiome as it relates to both plant health and agricultural sustainability. One key unanswered question is whether we can select for a plant microbiome that is robust after colonization of target hosts. We used a successive passaging experiment to address this question by selecting upon the tomato phyllosphere microbiome. Beginning with a diverse microbial community generated from field -grown tomato plants, we inoculated replicate plants across 5 plant genotypes for 4 45-d passages, sequencing the microbial community at each passage. We observed consistent shifts in both the bacterial (165 amplicon sequencing) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer region amplicon sequencing) communities across replicate lines over time, as well as a general loss of diversity over the course of the experiment, suggesting that much of the naturally observed microbial community in the phyllosphere is likely transient or poorly adapted within the experimental setting. We found that both host genotype and environment shape microbial composition, but the relative importance of genotype declines through time. Furthermore, using a community coalescence experiment, we found that the bacterial community from the end of the experiment was robust to invasion by the starting bacterial community. These results highlight that selecting for a stable microbiome that is well adapted to a particular host environment is indeed possible, emphasizing the great potential of this approach in agriculture and beyond. In light of the consistent response of the microbiome to selection in the absence of reciprocal host evolution (coevolution) described here, future studies should address how such adaptation influences host health.

AB Adaptive radiation plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the evolutionary process. However, the concept has provoked strong and differing opinions concerning its definition and nature among researchers studying a wide diversity of systems. Here, we take a broad view of what constitutes an adaptive radiation, and seek to find commonalities among disparate examples, ranging from plants to invertebrate and vertebrate animals, and remote islands to lakes and continents, to better understand processes shared across adaptive radiations. We surveyed many groups to evaluate factors considered important in a large variety of species radiations. In each of these studies, ecological opportunity of some form is identified as a prerequisite for adaptive radiation. However, evolvability, which can be enhanced by hybridization between distantly related species, may play a role in seeding entire radiations. Within radiations, the processes that lead to speciation depend largely on (1) whether the primary drivers of ecological shifts are (a) external to the membership of the radiation itself (mostly divergent or disruptive ecological selection) or (b) due to competition within the radiation membership (interactions among members) subsequent to reproductive isolation in similar environments, and (2) the extent and timing of admixture. These differences translate into different patterns of species accumulation and subsequent patterns of diversity across an adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiations occur in an extraordinary diversity of different ways, and continue to provide rich data for a better understanding of the diversification of life.

AB This study deals with approaches for a social-ecological friendly European bioeconomy based on biomass from industrial crops cultivated on marginal agricultural land. The selected crops to be investigated are: Biomass sorghum, camelina, cardoon, castor, crambe, Ethiopian mustard, giant reed, hemp, lupin, miscanthus, pennycress, poplar, reed canary grass, safflower, Siberian elm, switchgrass, tall wheatgrass, wild sugarcane, and willow. The research question focused on the overall crop growth suitability under low-input management. The study assessed: (i) How the growth suitability of industrial crops can be defined under the given natural constraints of European marginal agricultural lands; and (ii) which agricultural practices are required for marginal agricultural land low-input systems (MALLIS). For the growth-suitability analysis, available thresholds and growth requirements of the selected industrial crops were defined. The marginal agricultural land was categorized according to the agro-ecological zone (AEZ) concept in combination with the marginality constraints, so-called marginal agro-ecological zones' (M-AEZ). It was found that both large marginal agricultural areas and numerous agricultural practices are available for industrial crop cultivation on European marginal agricultural lands. These results help to further describe the suitability of industrial crops for the development of social-ecologically friendly MALLIS in Europe.

AB The use of semi-isolated habitats such as oceanic islands, lakes and mountain summits as model systems has played a crucial role in the development of evolutionary and ecological theory. Soon after the discovery of life in caves, different pioneering authors similarly recognized the great potential of these peculiar habitats as biological model systems. In their 1969 paper in Science, 'The cave environment', Poulson and White discussed how caves can be used as natural laboratories in which to study the underlying principles governing the dynamics of more complex environments. Together with other seminal syntheses published at the time, this work contributed to establishing the conceptual foundation for expanding the scope and relevance of cave-based studies. Fifty years after, the aim of this review is to show why and how caves and other subterranean habitats can be used as eco-evolutionary laboratories. Recent advances and directions in different areas are provided, encompassing community ecology, trophic-webs and ecological networks, conservation biology, macroecology and climate change biology. Special emphasis is given to discuss how caves are only part of the extended network of fissures and cracks that permeate most substrates and, thus, their ecological role as habitat islands is critically discussed. Numerous studies have quantified the relative contribution of abiotic, biotic and historical factors in driving species distributions and community turnovers in space and time, from local to regional scales. Conversely, knowledge of macroecological patterns of subterranean organisms at a global scale remains largely elusive, due to major geographical and taxonomical biases. Also, knowledge regarding subterranean trophic webs and the effect of anthropogenic climate change on deep subterranean ecosystems is still limited. In these research fields, the extensive use of novel molecular and statistical tools may hold promise for quickly producing relevant information not accessible hitherto.

AB Reforesting and managing ecosystems have been proposed as ways to mitigate global warming and offset anthropogenic carbon emissions. The intent of our opinion piece is to provide a perspective on how well plants and ecosystems sequester carbon. The ability of individual plants and ecosystems to mine carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as defined by rates and cumulative amounts, is limited by laws of physics and ecological principles. Consequently, the rates and amount of net carbon uptake are slow and low compared to the rates and amounts of carbon dioxide we release by fossil fuels combustion. Managing ecosystems to sequester carbon can also cause unintended consequences to arise. In this paper, we articulate a series of key take-home points. First, the potential amount of carbon an ecosystem can assimilate on an annual basis scales with absorbed sunlight, which varies with latitude, leaf area index and available water. Second, efforts to improve photosynthesis will come with the cost of more respiration. Third, the rates and amount of net carbon uptake are relatively slow and low, compared to the rates and amounts and rates of carbon dioxide we release by fossil fuels combustion. Fourth, huge amounts of land area for ecosystems will be needed to be an effective carbon sink to mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions. Fifth, the effectiveness of using this land as a carbon sink will depend on its ability to remain as a permanent carbon sink. Sixth, converting land to forests or wetlands may have unintended costs that warm the local climate, such as changing albedo, increasing surface roughness or releasing other greenhouse gases. We based our analysis on 1,163 site-years of direct eddy covariance measurements of gross and net carbon fluxes from 155 sites across the globe.

AB Despite the general appreciation that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can influence decomposition of organic materials, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigated whether AMF influence decomposition and change the associated soil bacterial and fungal communities through nutrient acquisition and whether this effect is altered by the level of soil phosphorus (P). We conducted a pot experiment using Medicago truncatula as host plant without or with AMF (a mixture of six species) and with two levels of soil P (4 and 24 mg kg(-1)). Hyphal-ingrowth mesh bags (which excluded roots but not hyphae or other microbes) were used to measure the effect of AMF hyphae on decomposition. Maize leaves dual-labeled with N-15:C-13 stable isotopes were used as the organic substrate. Bacterial and fungal communities were accessed via sequencing of partial 16S rRNA and ITS genes. The results showed the N-15 and C-13 content of the organic matter remaining in the mesh bags under low soil P availability were significantly lower in the treatment with AMF than without AMF. Under high soil P availability, however, no significant difference of N-15 content remaining was found between AMF and non-AMF treatments, while C-13 content remaining was higher in AMF than in non-AMF treatment. Levels of mycorrhizal colonization and (1) N-5 transport from organic matter to the host by AMF hyphae were higher at low P availability than at high P availability, suggesting that the host can acquire more nutrients through the AM from organic matter when soil P availability was low. The composition of bacterial and fungal communities were altered by AMF at both soil P levels. For bacterial community, the richness and diversity were higher with low P availability, especially for the phyla Saccharibacteria and Nitrospirae. For fungal community, AMF increased the richness but not the diversity under low P availability. Together, we show that AMF acquire nutrients from organic matter for host, influence decomposition and alter the bacterial and fungal communities, and that these effects were modulated by the soil P availability.

AB Background: Calorie restriction (CR), which has a potent anti-inflammaging effect, has been demonstrated toinduce dramatic changes in the gut microbiota. Whether the modulated gut microbiota contributes to the attenuation of inflammation during CR is unknown, as are the members of the microbial community that may be key mediators of this process.
   Results: Here, we report that a unique Lactobacillus-predominated microbial community was rapidly attained in mice within 2 weeks of CR, which decreased the levels of circulating microbial antigens and systemic inflammatory markers such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Lactobacillus murinus CR147, an isolate in the most abundant operational taxonomic unit (OTU) enriched by CR, downregulated interleukin-8 production in TNF-alpha-stimulated Caco-2 cells and significantly increased the lifespan and the brood size of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In gnotobiotic mice colonized with the gut microbiota from old mice, this strain decreased their intestinal permeability and serum endotoxin load, consequently attenuating the inflammation induced by the old microbiota.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that a strain of Lactobacillus murinus was promoted in CR mice and causatively contributed to the attenuation of ageing-associated inflammation.

AB The notion and assessment of ecosystem services (ES) values is becoming an established part of the discourse regarding urban green space performance. Yet, underlying factors enabling ES values are still poorly understood. We assume the production of ES value crucial for environmental stewardship in cities, and aimed in this study to uncover their key enabling factors. This study has been developed on a broad data base including a survey (n = 201), interviews (n = 46), field observation and remote sensing from 27 urban gardens in Barcelona, Spain, including municipal 'allotment gardens' and 'civic gardens' emerging from bottom-up initiatives. In a first step, we distinguished different urban gardens types regarding the ES values they provide. In a second step, we tested specific garden characteristics including (a) user profiles, (b) biophysical garden properties, and (c) institutional settings for their specific importance to trigger ES values. Results showed ES values to significantly differ with the types of gardens. For example, classical allotment gardens are more likely to provide recreational values, while emerging civic gardens are more likely to produce place-making and social cohesion. A main finding from our study is the importance of social and institutional garden characteristic as enabling factors of ES values. Results indicate, for example, a correlation between childhood experiences and a higher appreciation of ES. Our results further indicate that civic gardens with broader property rights and decision-capacities are more likely to enhance stewardship action. In providing a differentiated understanding of the ES value(s) of urban gardens, this study highlights the potential for green space planning in cities to steer the stewardship of urban gardens by providing institutional and physical space for civic gardening initiatives.

The increase in global population and the related growing demand for food and other services are exerting unsustainable pressures on natural resources, compromising their use within the ecosystems' carrying capacity. Progressively, studies and initiatives have been developed with the aim of identifying win-win share strategies, which may compensate the sectoral demands of natural resources, addressing the need of a holistic and interdisciplinary nexus approach. In this study, thus emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach and highlighting the fundamental role of ecosystems, we propose a synthesis matrix system that describes the complex and closely bound relationship between natural resources use for food (specifically water, land), energy (defined as ecosystem service flows in our matrix system) and ecosystems, along the lines of the concept of ecosystem-water-food-land-energy nexus. The synthesis matrix system could be defined for different scales, both from the global to the local scale and has been designed to include impacts and nexus with climate change. The matrix aims at integrating quantitative and qualitative aspects, which are often neglected in traditional approaches of impact assessment. The complexity of the interactions between the different components of the nexus requires relying not only on quantitative evidences but also on expert judgment. A sensitivity check has been conducted to illustrate how to verify the convergence of expert-judgment from different experts. Moreover, being the matrix meant for supporting holistic assessment of supply chain, in the present study, the integration of the matrix within life cycle assessment (LCA) is proposed. However, in order to support the analysis of interconnections among impacts, further methodological development of the LCA methods is needed. An illustrative example related to the competition for water, land and food bioenergy production is depicted. The matrices show that there are predominantly negative impacts given by sectoral uses of resources on the provision of ecosystem services, an issue that requires most focus on resource efficiency and on the environmental and economic impacts of natural resources use while reducing the trade-offs between the sectoral demands.

AB Disease emergence events regularly result from human activities such as agriculture, which frequently brings large populations of genetically uniform hosts into contact with potential pathogens. Although viruses cause nearly 50% of emerging plant diseases, there is little systematic information about virus distribution across agro-ecological interfaces and large gaps in understanding of virus diversity in nature. Here we applied a novel landscape-scale geometagenomics approach to examine relationships between agricultural land use and distributions of plantassociated viruses in two Mediterranean-climate biodiversity hotspots (Western Cape region of South Africa and Rhone river delta region of France). In total, we analysed 1725 geo-referenced plant samples collected over two years from 4.5 x 4.5 km2 grids spanning farmlands and adjacent uncultivated vegetation. We found substantial virus prevalence (25.8-35.7%) in all ecosystems, but prevalence and identified family-level virus diversity were greatest in cultivated areas, with some virus families displaying strong agricultural associations. Our survey revealed 94 previously unknown virus species, primarily from uncultivated plants. This is the first effort to systematically evaluate plant-associated viromes across broad agro-ecological interfaces. Our findings indicate that agriculture substantially influences plant virus distributions and highlight the extent of current ignorance about the diversity and roles of viruses in nature.

AB The establishment of interdisciplinary Master's and PhD programs in sustainability science is opening up an exciting arena filled with opportunities for early-career scholars to address pressing sustainability challenges. However, embarking upon an interdisciplinary endeavor as an early-career scholar poses a unique set of challenges: to develop an individual scientific identity and a strong and specific methodological skill-set, while at the same time gaining the ability to understand and communicate between different epistemologies. Here, we explore the challenges and opportunities that emerge from a new kind of interdisciplinary journey, which we describe as 'undisciplinary.' Undisciplinary describes (1) the space or condition of early-career researchers with early interdisciplinary backgrounds, (2) the process of the journey, and (3) the orientation which aids scholars to address the complex nature of today's sustainability challenges. The undisciplinary journey is an iterative and reflexive process of balancing methodological groundedness and epistemological agility to engage in rigorous sustainability science. The paper draws upon insights from a collective journey of broad discussion, reflection, and learning, including a survey on educational backgrounds of different generations of sustainability scholars, participatory forum theater, and a panel discussion at the Resilience 2014 conference (Montpellier, France). Based on the results from this diversity of methods, we suggest that there is now a new and distinct generation of sustainability scholars that start their careers with interdisciplinary training, as opposed to only engaging in interdisciplinary research once strong disciplinary foundations have been built. We further identify methodological groundedness and epistemological agility as guiding competencies to become capable sustainability scientists and discuss the implications of an undisciplinary journey in the current institutional context of universities and research centers. In this paper, we propose a simple framework to help early-career sustainability scholars and well-established scientists successfully navigate what can sometimes be an uncomfortable space in education and research, with the ultimate aim of producing and engaging in rigorous and impactful sustainability science.

AB The role of behavior in evolution has long been discussed, with some arguing that behavior promotes evolution by exposing organisms to selection (behavioral drive) and others proposing that it inhibits evolution by shielding organisms from environmental variation (behavioral inertia). However, this discussion has generally focused on the effects of behavior along a single axis without considering that behavior simultaneously influences selection in various niche dimensions. By examining evolutionary change along two distinct niche axesstructural and thermalwe propose that behavior simultaneously drives and impedes evolution in a group of Anolis lizards from the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Specifically, a behavioral shift in microhabitat to boulders at high altitude enables thermoregulation, thus forestalling physiological evolution in spite of colder environments. This same behavioral shift drives skull and limb evolution to boulder use. Our results emphasize the multidimensional effects of behavior in evolution. These findings reveal how, rather than being diametrically opposed, niche conservatism and niche lability can occur simultaneously. Furthermore, patterns of niche evolution may vary at different geographic scales: because of thermoregulatory behavior, lizards at high and low elevation share similar microclimatic niches (consistent with niche conservatism) while inhabiting distinct macroclimatic environments (consistent with niche divergence). Together, our results suggest that behavior can connect patterns of niche divergence and conservatism at different geographic scales and among traits.

AB Urbanization, one of the most important anthropogenic impacts on Earth, is rapidly expanding worldwide. This expansion of urban land-covered areas is known to significantly reduce different components of biodiversity. However, the global evidence for this effect is mainly focused on a single diversity measure (species richness) with a few local or regional studies also supporting reductions in functional diversity. We have used birds, an important ecological group that has been used as surrogate for other animals, to investigate the hypothesis that urbanization reduces the global taxonomical and/or evolutionary diversity. We have also explored whether there is evidence supporting that urban bird communities are evolutionarily homogenized worldwide in comparison with nonurban ones by means of using evolutionary distinctiveness (how unique are the species) of bird communities. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify the effect of urbanization in more than one single diversity measure as well as the first time to look for associations between urbanization and phylogenetic diversity at a large spatial scale. Our findings show a strong and globally consistent reduction in taxonomic diversity in urban areas, which is also synchronized with the evolutionary homogenization of urban bird communities. Despite our general patterns, we found some regional differences in the intensity of the effect of cities on bird species richness or evolutionary distinctiveness, suggesting that conservation efforts should be adapted locally. Our findings might be useful for conservationists and policymakers to minimize the impact of urban development on Earth's biodiversity and help design more realistic conservation strategies.

AB Despite the prevalence of damming as a global disturbance to river habitats, detailed reach-based assessments of the ecological effects of dams are lacking, particularly across large spatial extents. Using data from nearly 50,000 large dams, we assessed stream network fragmentation and flow alteration by large dams for streams of the conterminous USA. We developed 21 dam metrics characterizing a diversity of dam influences operating at both localized (e.g., distances-to-dams) and landscape scales (e.g., cumulative reservoir storage throughout stream networks) for every stream reach in the study region. We further evaluated how dams have affected stream fish assemblages within large ecoregions using more than 37,000 stream fish samples. Stream's have been severely fragmented by large dams, with the number of stream segments increasing by 801% compared to free-flowing streams in the absence of dams and a staggering 79% of stream length is disconnected from their outlet (i.e., oceans and Great Lakes). Flow alteration metrics demonstrate a landscape-scale disturbance of dams, resulting in total upstream reservoir storage volumes exceeding estimated annual discharge volumes of many of the nation's largest rivers. Further, we show large-scale changes in fish assemblages With dams. Species adapted to lentic habitats increase with dams across the conterminous USA, while rheophils, lithophils, and intolerant fishes decrease with dams. Overall, fragmentation and flow alteration by dams have affected fish assemblages as Much or more than other anthropogenic stressors, with dam effects generally increasing with stream size. Dam-induced stream fragmentation and flow alteration are critical natural resource issues. This study emphasizes the importance of considering dams as a landscape-scale disturbance to river habitats along with the need to assess differential effects that dams may have on river habitats and the fishes they support. Together, these insights are essential for more effective conservation of stream resource's and biotic communities globally. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The study of leaf functional trait relationships, the so-called leaf economics spectrum(1,2), is based on the assumption of high-light conditions (as experienced by sunlit leaves). Owing to the exponential decrease of light availability through canopies, however, the vast majority of the world's vegetation exists in at least partial shade. Plant functional traits vary in direct dependence of light availability(3), with different traits varying to different degrees, sometimes in conflict with expectations from the economic spectrum(3). This means that the derived trait relationships of the global leaf economic spectrum are probably dependent on the extent to which observed data in existing large-scale plant databases represent high-light conditions. Here, using an extensive worldwide database of within-canopy gradients of key physiological, structural and chemical traits(3), along with three different global trait databases(4,5), we show that: (1) accounting for light-driven trait plasticity can reveal novel trait relationships, particularly for highly plastic traits (for example, the relationship between net assimilation rate per area (A(a)) and leaf mass per area (LMA)); and (2) a large proportion of leaf traits in current global plant databases reported as measured in full sun were probably measured in the shade. The results show that even though the majority of leaves exist in the shade, along with a large proportion of observations, our current understanding is too focused on conditions in the sun.

AB 1. Habitat choice is an evolutionary product of animals experiencing increased fitness when preferentially occupying high-quality habitat. However, an ecological trap (ET) can occur when an animal is presented with novel conditions and the animal's assessment of habitat quality is poorly matched to its resulting fitness.
   2. We tested for an ET for grizzly (brown) bears using demographic and movement data collected in an area with rich food resources and concentrated human settlement.
   3. We derived measures of habitat attractiveness from occurrence models of bear food resources and estimated demographic parameters using DNA mark-recapture information collected over 8 years (2006-2013). We then paired this information with grizzly bear mortality records to investigate kill and movement rates.
   4. Our results demonstrate that a valley high in both berry resources and human density was more attractive than surrounding areas, and bears occupying this region faced 17% lower apparent survival. Despite lower fitness, we detected a net flow of bears into the ET, which contributed to a study-wide population decline.
   5. This work highlights the presence and pervasiveness of an ET for an apex omnivore that lacks the evolutionary cues, under human-induced rapid ecological change, to assess trade-offs between food resources and human-caused mortality, which results in maladaptive habitat selection.

AB The Upper Mississippi River System, including the Illinois River, has been invaded by a number of nonnative species including silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitirx and bighead carp H. nobilis, collectively referred to here as Asian carps. Silver carp densities in the Illinois River have increased dramatically and now represent some of the highest densities of wild silver carp anywhere in the world. Asian carps have the potential to alter existing ecosystems by consuming planktonic resources and therefore, could have the ability to alter existing fish communities as most fishes are dependent on planktonic resources during early development. However, identifying the relationship of fish community structure to the establishment of Asian carps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Using long-term fish community data collected by the Upper Mississippi River Restoration's Long Term Resource Monitoring element, we investigate changes in fish community structure pre- and post-establishment of Asian carps. Significant differences in the pre- and post-establishment communities were observed for the majority of gears and habitats. Species contributing to changes between establishment periods included most sportfish species and catostomids, which were less abundant post-establishment of Asian carps, while shortnose gar, grass carp, and emerald shiner were more abundant. While our analyses show Asian carps are likely contributing to major differences in fish community structure, future research and long-term monitoring should investigate the mechanisms and interactions responsible for community changes as well as identifying any potential concurrent or confounding factors such as changes in river hydrology or sedimentation.

AB Given the predicted expansion of cities throughout the world, understanding the effect of urbanization on bee fauna is a major issue for the conservation of bees. The aim of this study was to understand how urbanization affects wild bee assemblages along a gradient of impervious surfaces and to determine the influence of landscape composition and floral resource availability on these assemblages. We chose 12 sites with a proportion of impervious surfaces (soil covered by parking, roads, and buildings) ranging from 0.06% to 64.31% within a 500m radius. We collected using pan trapping and estimated the landscape composition of the sites within a 500m radius and the species richness of plant assemblages within a 200 m radius. We collected 1104 bees from 74 species. The proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale had a negative effect on wild bee abundance and species richness, whereas local flower composition had no effect. Ground-nesting bees were particularly sensitive to the urbanization gradient. This study provides new evidences of the impact of urbanization on bee assemblages and the proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale emerged as a key factor that drives those assemblages.

AB AimWhether the gradients of global diversity conform to equilibrium or non-equilibrium dynamics remains an unresolved question in ecology and evolution. Here, we evaluate four prominent hypotheses which invoke either equilibrium (more individuals, niche diversity) or non-equilibrium dynamics (diversification rate, evolutionary time) to explain species richness and functional diversity of mammals worldwide.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe combine structural equation modelling with simulations to examine whether species richness and functional diversity are in equilibrium with environmental conditions (climate, productivity) or whether they vary with non-equilibrium factors (diversification rates, evolutionary time). We use the newest and most inclusive phylogenetic, distributional and trait data for mammals.
   ResultsWe find that species richness and functional diversity are decoupled across multiple regions of the world. While species richness correlates closely with environmental conditions, functional diversity depends mostly on non-equilibrium factors (evolutionary time to overcome niche conservatism). Moreover, functional diversity plateaus with species richness, such that species-rich regions (especially the Neotropics) host many species that are apparently functionally redundant.
   Main conclusionsWe conclude that species richness depends on environmental factors while functional diversity depends on the evolutionary history of the region. Our work further challenges the classic notion that highly productive regions host more species because they offer a great diversity of ecological niches. Instead, they suggest that productive regions offer more resources, which allow more individuals, populations and species to coexist within a region, even when the species are apparently functionally redundant (the more individuals hypothesis). Together these findings demonstrate how ecological (the total amount of resources) and evolutionary factors (time to overcome niche conservatism) might have interacted to generate the striking diversity of mammals and their life histories.

AB Governance networks can facilitate coordinated action and shared opportunities for learning among conservation scientists, policy makers, and communities. However, governance networks that link local, regional, and international actors just as often reflect social relationships and arrangements that can undermine conservation efforts, particularly those concerning community-level priorities. Here, we identify three waypoints or navigational guides to help researchers and practitioners explore these networks, and to inspire them to consider in a more systematic manner the social rules and relationships that influence conservation outcomes. These waypoints encourage those engaged in community-based conservation (CBC) to: (1) think about the networks in which they are embedded and the constellation of actors that influence conservation practice; (2) examine the values and interests of diverse actors in governance, and the implications of different perspectives for conservation; and (3) consider how the structure and dynamics of networks can reveal helpful insights for conservation efforts. The three waypoints we highlight synthesize an interdisciplinary literature on governance networks and provide key insights for conservation actors navigating the challenges of CBC at multiple scales and levels.

AB Straw return is a widely recognized strategy for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and improving soil quality and crop productivity. A 4-year-long field experiment established in 2008 was conducted to investigate the effects of the combined return of maize and wheat straw on the SOC stock at a soil depth of 0-20 cm in an intensive summer maize (Zea mays L.)-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system in the Guanzhong Plain. The study involved four treatments with four replicates: low return of maize and wheat straw (ML-WL), low return of maize straw and high return of wheat straw (ML-WH), high return of maize straw and low return of wheat straw (MH-WL), and high return of maize and wheat straw (MH-WH). Compared with the SOC stock in the pre-experimental soil, the SOC stock in the 0-20 cm soil layer decreased by 2.6% under the ML-WL treatment, and in contrast, increased by 1.9% in ML-WH and 14.4% in MH-WH. Similarly, the stabilization rate gradually increased from 2.4% in ML-WH to 10.0% in MH-WH, though an obvious decrease of 6.8% was found in the ML-WL treatment. A significant linear relationship (P < 0.05) was found between SOC sequestration and the cumulative plant derived C input to the soil. A minimum C input of 4.07 Mg ha(-1) year was required to maintain the initial level of SOC. However, a significant relationship (P < 0.05) also existed between the cumulative plant derived C input and non-sequestered C. Moreover, the ranking of the treatments with respect to yield and the sustainable yield index (SYI) of maize and wheat was ML-WL < ML-WH < MH-WL < MH-WH. The average SYI of maize and wheat reached a maximum value of 0.651 when the plant-derived C input was 10.51 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), which was higher than the maximum value (SYI of 0.64, plant-derived C input of 9.76 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) found in the MH-WH treatment. Although the high return of maize and wheat straw was the best treatment in this research, more suitable practices, such wheat straw return including longer stubble or maize straw return in combination with sub-soiling, might increase yield and soil C sequestration, ultimately achieving sustained agricultural development in this cropping system.

AB The measurement of stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes in tissues of organisms has formed the foundation of isotopic food web reconstructions, as these values directly reflect assimilated diet. In contrast, stable hydrogen (delta H-2) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope measurements have typically been reserved for studies of migratory origin and paleoclimate reconstruction based on systematic relationships between organismal tissue and local environmental water. Recently, innovative applications using delta H-2 and, to a lesser extent, delta O-18 values have demonstrated potential for these elements to provide novel insights in modern food web studies. We explore the advantages and challenges associated with three applications of delta H-2 and delta O-18 values in food web studies. First, large delta H-2 differences between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem end members can permit the quantification of energy inputs and nutrient fluxes between these two sources, with potential applications for determining allochthonous vs. autochthonous nutrient sources in freshwater systems and relative aquatic habitat utilization by terrestrial organisms. Next, some studies have identified a relationship between delta H-2 values and trophic position, which suggests that this marker may serve as a trophic indicator, in addition to the more commonly used delta N-15 values. Finally, coupled measurements of delta H-2 and delta O-18 values are increasing as a result of reduced analytical challenges to measure both simultaneously and may provide additional ecological information over single element measurements. In some organisms, the isotopic ratios of these two elements are tightly coupled, whereas the isotopic disequilibrium in other organisms may offer insight into the diet and physiology of individuals. Although a coherent framework for interpreting delta H-2 and delta O-18 data in the context of food web studies is emerging, many fundamental uncertainties remain. We highlight directions for targeted research that will increase our understanding of how these markers move through food webs and reflect ecological processes.

AB Human activities are causing rapid environmental change at a global scale. Urbanization is responsible for some of the most extreme human-altered habitats and is a known driver of evolutionary change, but evidence and understanding of these processes is limited. Here, we investigate the potential underlying mechanisms contributing to the contemporary evolution of migration behaviour in the Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla). Blackcaps from central Europe have been wintering in urban areas of Britain with increasing frequency over the past 60years, rather than migrating south to the Mediterranean. It has been hypothesized that the popularization of providing supplementary foods for wild birds within Britain may have influenced this marked migratory change, but quantifying the selective forces shaping evolutionary changes remains challenging. Using a long-term national scale data set, we examine both the spatial distribution and interannual variation in blackcap wintering behaviour in Britain in relation to supplementary food availability and local climate. Over a 12-year period, we show that blackcaps are becoming increasingly associated with the provision of supplementary foods in British gardens, and that the reliability of bird food supplies is influencing their winter distribution at a national scale. In addition, local climatic temperatures and broader scale weather variation are also important determinants of blackcap wintering patterns once they arrive in Britain. Based on our findings, we conclude that a synergistic effect of increased availability of feeding resources, in the form of garden bird food, coupled with climatic amelioration, has enabled a successful new wintering population to become established in Britain. As global biodiversity is threatened by human-induced environmental change, this study presents new and timely evidence of the role human activities can play in shaping evolutionary trajectories.

AB The factors and processes driving cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems have been extensively studied in the past decade. A growing number of these studies concern the direct or indirect interactions between cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. The presence of bacteria that are directly attached or immediately adjacent to cyanobacterial cells suggests that intense nutrient exchanges occur between these microorganisms. In order to determine if there is a specific association between cyanobacteria and bacteria, we compared the bacterial community composition during two cyanobacteria blooms of Anabaena (filamentous and N-2-fixing) and Microcystis (colonial and non-N-2 fixing) that occurred successively within the same lake. Using high-throughput sequencing, we revealed a clear distinction between associated and free-living communities and between cyanobacterial genera. The interactions between cyanobacteria and bacteria appeared to be based on dissolved organic matter degradation and on N recycling, both for N-2-fixing and non N-2-fixing cyanobacteria. Thus, the genus and potentially the species of cyanobacteria and its metabolic capacities appeared to select for the bacterial community in the phycosphere.

AB Plantings in residential neighborhoods can support wild pollinators. However, it is unknown how effectively wild pollinators maintain pollination services in small, urban gardens with diverse floral resources. We used a 'mobile garden' experimental design, whereby potted plants of cucumber, eggplant, and purple coneflower were brought to 30 residential yards in Chicago, IL, USA, to enable direct assessment of pollination services provided by wild pollinator communities. We measured fruit and seed set and investigated the effect of within-yard characteristics and adjacent floral resources on plant pollination. Increased pollinator visitation and taxonomic richness generally led to increases in fruit and seed set for all focal plants. Furthermore, fruit and seed set were correlated across the three species, suggesting that pollination services vary across the landscape in ways that are consistent among different plant species. Plant species varied in terms of which pollinator groups provided the most visits and benefit for pollination. Cucumber pollination was linked to visitation by small sweat bees (Lasioglossum spp.), whereas eggplant pollination was linked to visits by bumble bees. Purple coneflower was visited by the most diverse group of pollinators and, perhaps due to this phenomenon, was more effectively pollinated in florally-rich gardens. Our results demonstrate how a diversity of wild bees supports pollination of multiple plant species, highlighting the importance of pollinator conservation within cities. Non-crop resources should continue to be planted in urban gardens, as these resources have a neutral and potentially positive effect on crop pollination.

The EM fungal community consisted of 393 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), belonging to 21 EM fungal lineages, in which three EM fungal lineages and 11 EM fungal OTUs showed significantly biased occurrence among the young, intermediate and old forests. The EM fungal community was structured by environmental selection and dispersal limitation in old forest, but only by environmental selection in young, intermediate, and whole forests. Furthermore, the EM fungal community was affected by different factors in the different forest successional stages, and the importance of these factors in structuring EM fungal community dramatically decreased along the secondary forest succession series. This study suggests that different assembly mechanisms operate on the EM fungal community at different stages in secondary subtropical forest succession.

AB Public parks commonly contain important habitat for urban biodiversity, and they also provide recreation opportunities for urban residents. However, the extent to which dual outcomes for recreation and conservation can be achieved in the same spaces remains unclear. We examine whether greater levels of (i) tree cover (i.e. park 'greenness') and (ii) native remnant vegetation cover (i.e. vegetation with high ecological value) attract or deter park visitors. This study is based on the park visitation behaviour of 670 survey respondents in Brisbane, Australia, detailing 1,090 individual visits to 324 urban parks. We first examined the presence of any clear revealed preferences for visiting parks with higher or lower levels of tree cover or remnant vegetation cover. We then examined the differences between each park visited by respondents and the park closest to their home, and used linear mixed models to identify socio-demographic groups who are more likely to travel further to visit parks with greater tree cover or remnant vegetation cover. Park visitation rates reflected the availability of parks, suggesting that people do not preferentially visit parks with greater vegetation cover despite the potential for improved nature-based experiences and greater wellbeing benefits. However, we discovered that people with a greater orientation towards nature (measured using the nature relatedness scale) tend to travel further for more vegetated parks. Our results suggest that to enhance recreational benefits from ecologically valuable spaces a range of social or educational interventions are required to enhance people's connection to nature.

   ECOSYSTEMS; NETWORK; FORESTS; CLIMATE
AB Exchanges of carbon, water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere are monitored by eddy covariance technique at the ecosystem level. Currently, the FLUXNET database contains more than 500 registered sites, and up to 250 of them share data (free fair-use data set). Many modelling groups use the FLUXNET data set for evaluating ecosystem models' performance, but this requires uninterrupted time series for the meteorological variables used as input. Because original in situ data often contain gaps, from very short (few hours) up to relatively long (some months) ones, we develop a new and robust method for filling the gaps in meteorological data measured at site level. Our approach has the benefit of making use of continuous data available globally (ERA-Interim) and a high temporal resolution spanning from 1989 to today. These data are, however, not measured at site level, and for this reason a method to downscale and correct the ERA-Interim data is needed. We apply this method to the level 4 data (L4) from the La Thuile collection, freely available after registration under a fair-use policy. The performance of the developed method varies across sites and is also function of the meteorological variable. On average over all sites, applying the bias correction method to the ERA-Interim data reduced the mismatch with the in situ data by 10 to 36%, depending on the meteorological variable considered. In comparison to the internal variability of the in situ data, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the in situ data and the unbiased ERA-I (ERA-Interim) data remains relatively large (on average over all sites, from 27 to 76% of the standard deviation of in situ data, depending on the meteorological variable considered). The performance of the method remains poor for the wind speed field, in particular regarding its capacity to conserve a standard deviation similar to the one measured at FLUXNET stations.

AB In recent years, the empirical literature linking environmental factors and human migration has grown rapidly and gained increasing visibility among scholars and the policy community. Still, this body of research uses a wide range of methodological approaches for assessing environment-migration relationships. Without comparable data and measures across a range of contexts, it is impossible to make generalizations that would facilitate the development of future migration scenarios. Demographic researchers have a large methodological toolkit for measuring migration as well as modeling its drivers. This toolkit includes population censuses, household surveys, survival analysis and multi-level modeling. This paper's purpose is to introduce climate change researchers to demographic data and methods and to review exemplary studies of the environmental dimensions of human migration. Our intention is to foster interdisciplinary understanding and scholarship, and to promote high quality research on environment and migration that will lead toward broader knowledge of this association.

AB Prolonged pair bonds have the potential to improve reproductive performance of socially monogamous animals by increasing pair familiarity and enhancing coordination and cooperation between pair members. However, this has proved very difficult to test robustly because of important confounds such as age and reproductive experience. Here, we address limitations of previous studies and provide a rigorous test of the mate familiarity effect in the socially monogamous blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, a long-lived marine bird with a high divorce rate. Taking advantage of a natural disassociation between age and pair bond duration in this species, and applying a novel analytical approach to a 24 year database, we found that those pairs which have been together for longer establish their clutches five weeks earlier in the season, hatch more of their eggs and produce 35% more fledglings, regardless of age and reproductive experience. Our results demonstrate that pair bond duration increases individual fitness and further suggest that synergistic effects between a male and female's behaviour are likely to be involved in generating a mate familiarity effect. These findings help to explain the age-and experience-independent benefits of remating and their role in life-history evolution.

AB Decentralized stormwater management approaches (e. g., biofiltration swales, pervious pavement, green roofs, rain gardens) that capture, detain, infiltrate, and filter runoff are now commonly used to minimize the impacts of stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces on aquatic ecosystems. However, there is little research on the effectiveness of retrofit, parcel-scale stormwater management practices for improving downstream aquatic ecosystem health. A reverse auction was used to encourage homeowners to mitigate stormwater on their property within the suburban, 1.8 km(2) Shepherd Creek catchment in Cincinnati, Ohio (USA). In 2007-2008, 165 rain barrels and 81 rain gardens were installed on 30% of the properties in four experimental (treatment) subcatchments, and two additional subcatchments were maintained as controls. At the base of the subcatchments, we sampled monthly baseflow water quality, and seasonal (5x/year) physical habitat, periphyton assemblages, and macroinvertebrate assemblages in the streams for the three years before and after treatment implementation. Given the minor reductions in directly connected impervious area from the rain barrel installations (11.6% to 10.4% in the most impaired subcatchment) and high total impervious levels (13.1% to 19.9% in experimental subcatchments), we expected minor or no responses of water quality and biota to stormwater management. There were trends of increased conductivity, iron, and sulfate for control sites, but no such contemporaneous trends for experimental sites. The minor effects of treatment on streamflow volume and water quality did not translate into changes in biotic health, and the few periphyton and macroinvertebrate responses could be explained by factors not associated with the treatment (e.g., vegetation clearing, drought conditions). Improvement of overall stream health is unlikely without additional treatment of major impervious surfaces (including roads, apartment buildings, and parking lots). Further research is needed to define the minimum effect threshold and restoration trajectories for retrofitting catchments to improve the health of stream ecosystems.

AB Phenological data are simple yet sensitive indicators of climate change impacts on ecosystems, but observations have not been made routinely or extensively enough to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns across most continents, including North America. As an alternative, many studies use weather-based algorithms to simulate specific phenological responses. Spring Indices (SI) are a set of complex phenological models that have been successfully applied to evaluate variations and trends in the onset of spring across the Northern Hemisphere's temperate regions. To date, SI models have been limited by only producing output in locations where both the plants' chilling and warmth requirements are met. Here, we develop an extended form of the SI (abbreviated SI-x) that expands their application into the subtropics by ignoring chilling requirements while still retaining the utility and accuracy of the original SI (now abbreviated SI-o).The validity of the new indices is tested, and regional SI anomalies are explored across the data-rich continental United States. SI-x variations from 1900 to 2010 show an abrupt and sustained delay in spring onset of about 4-8d (around 1958) in parts of the Southeast and southern Great Plains, and a comparable advance of 4-8d (around 1984) in parts of the northern Great Plains and the West. Atmospheric circulation anomalies, linked to large-scale modes of variability, exert modest but significant roles in the timing of spring onset across the United States on interannual and longer timescales. The SI-x are promising metrics for tracking spring onset variations and trends in mid-latitudes, relating them to relevant ecological, hydrological, and socioeconomic phenomena, and exploring connections between atmospheric drivers and seasonal timing.

AB Stable isotope and fatty acid trophic markers (FATMs) were used to assess carbon flow and trophic structures of sympagic, pelagic and benthic communities in high-Arctic Svalbard. Three regions were sampled: Northwest Svalbard - dominated by Atlantic water (AtW) and limited seasonal sea ice; Northern Svalbard - dominated by AtW and perennial sea ice; and Northeast Svalbard - dominated by Arctic water (ArW) and extensive seasonal sea ice. Three to four trophic levels (TL) were found in the three habitats, with a dominance of omnivores (TL = 2.4-2.7). Ice fauna relied on phytoplankton and ice algae, zooplankton primarily on phytoplankton, while benthos relied on ice algae/refractory material. Ice fauna (mean 39%; range 17-62%) and benthos (mean 25%; range 11-65%) had high proportions of diatom-FATMs, while zooplankton had equally high diatom- and Phaeocystis/dinoflagellate-FATMs (mean 11% and 15%, respectively). Calanus-FATMs were prominent in carnivorous ice fauna (up to 28%) and zooplankton (up to 38%), but also in benthic invertebrates (up to 41%). Ice fauna biomass was low. Biomass of zooplankton and benthic infauna were variable, but positively correlated to each other (r(2)=0.89; p<0.01) and sedimentary pigment concentrations (r(2)>0.40; p<0.05). The coinciding peak biomasses of zooplankton and benthos in Northeast Svalbard can be explained by allochthonous organic matter of ice algal origin and highly specialized Arctic zooplankton utilizing both ice algae and phytoplankton carbon sources.

AB Assessing the trophic role and interaction of an animal is key to understanding its general ecology and dynamics. Conventional techniques used to elucidate diet, such as stomach content analysis, are not suitable for large threatened marine species. Non-lethal sampling combined with biochemical methods provides a practical alternative for investigating the feeding ecology of these species. Stable isotope and signature fatty acid analyses of muscle tissue were used for the first time to examine assimilated diet of the reef manta ray Manta alfredi, and were compared with different zooplankton functional groups (i.e. near-surface zooplankton collected during manta ray feeding events and non-feeding periods, epipelagic zooplankton, demersal zooplankton and several different zooplankton taxa). Stable isotope delta N-15 values confirmed that the reef manta ray is a secondary consumer. This species had relatively high levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) indicating a flagellate-based food source in the diet, which likely reflects feeding on DHA-rich near-surface and epipelagic zooplankton. However, high levels of omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and slightly enriched delta C-13 values in reef manta ray tissue suggest that they do not feed solely on pelagic zooplankton, but rather obtain part of their diet from another origin. The closest match was with demersal zooplankton, suggesting it is an important component of the reef manta ray diet. The ability to feed on demersal zooplankton is likely linked to the horizontal and vertical movement patterns of this giant planktivore. These new insights into the habitat use and feeding ecology of the reef manta ray will assist in the effective evaluation of its conservation needs.

AB Global bioclimatic datasets are being widely used in ecological research to estimate the potential distribution of species using Climate Envelope Models (CEMs). These datasets are easily available and offer high resolution information for all land areas globally. However, they have not been tested rigorously in smaller regions, and their use in regional CEM studies may pose problems derived from their poor representation of local climate features. Moreover, these problems may be enhanced when using CEMs for future climate projections-a topic of current active research-due to the uncertainty derived from the future altered climate scenarios. In this paper we use distributional data of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Northern Iberian Peninsula to analyze the discrepancies of the CEMs (predictive skill, variable importance and consistency using different predictor subsets) resulting from three alternative public, high-resolution climate datasets: a benchmarking regional climate dataset developed for the area of study (UC), the University of Barcelona Atlas for the Iberian Peninsula (UAB) and the worldwide WorldClim bioclimatic dataset (WC). The same CEM techniques (multiple logistic regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines) were applied to the different datasets, showing that the quality of the baseline climate has a great impact on the resulting models, as manifested by the different contributions of the bioclimatic predictors to the resulting models. Artifactual bioclimatic variables were found in some datasets, representing topographical features and spatial gradients, rather than true climatic patterns, thus significantly contributing to the models, although not for the right reasons. This causes a misleading model interpretation and problems for extrapolation in future climate conditions, as evidenced analyzing the future projections obtained using state-of-the-art regional climate projections from the ENSEMBLES project.

AB Large-bodied frugivores may play a key role in the networks of plants and their seed dispersers. These species, however, are often threatened by human impacts that lead to defaunation. In this paper, we discuss the potential implications of the loss of large frugivores for seed-dispersal networks. First, we review the role of large vertebrates as seed dispersers in different tropical ecosystems to show that these species are likely to be important components of seed-dispersal networks. Second, we showed that, despite their importance, large vertebrates are absent from most of the seed-dispersal networks described in the available literature. We identified three main reasons for this absence: (1) large vertebrates have already died out in the studied areas; (2) studies focus on particular taxonomic groups that consist mostly of small birds; and (3) it is inherently difficult to describe the interactions of naturally rare and secretive species such as large vertebrates. We argue that a proper evaluation of the importance of large frugivores within seed-dispersal networks would benefit from considering aspects other than the frequency of interactions. We suggest weighting pairwise interactions by their ecological consequences to quantify the contribution of large frugivores to outcomes of seed dispersal, such as landscape connectivity.

AB The evolution of reproductive isolation in an ecological context may involve multiple facets of species divergence on which divergent selection may operate. These include variation in quantitative phenotypic traits, regulation of gene expression, and differential transmission of particular allelic combinations. Thus, an integrative approach to the speciation process involves identifying the genetic basis of these traits, in order to understand how they are affected by divergent selection in nature and how they ultimately contribute to reproductive isolation. In the Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), dwarf and normal species pairs sympatrically occur in several North American postglacial lakes. The limnetic dwarf whitefish distinguishes from its normal benthic relative by numerous life history, behavioural, morphological and gene expression traits, in relation with the exploitation of distinct ecological niches. Here, we have applied the RAD-Sequencing method to a hybrid backcross family to reconstruct a high-density genetic linkage map and perform QTL mapping in the Lake Whitefish. The 3061cM map encompassed 3438 segregating RAD markers distributed over 40 linkage groups, for an average resolution of 0.89cM. We mapped phenotypic and expression QTL underlying ecologically important traits as well as transmission ratio distortion QTL, and identified genomic regions harbouring clusters of such QTL. A narrow genomic region strongly associated with sex determination was also evidenced. Positional and functional information revealed in this study will be useful in ongoing population genomic studies to illuminate our understanding of the genomic architecture of reproductive isolation between whitefish species pairs.

AB Understanding and quantifying constraints to multiple ecosystem service delivery and biodiversity is vital for developing management strategies for current and future human well-being. A particular challenge is to reconcile demand for increased food production with provision of other ecosystem services and biodiversity. Using a spatially extensive data base (covering Great Britain) of co-located biophysical measurements (collected in the Countryside Survey), we explore the relationships between ecosystem service indicators and biodiversity across a temperate ecosystem productivity gradient. Each service indicator has an individual response curve demonstrating that simultaneous analysis of multiple ecosystem services is essential for optimal service management. The shape of the response curve can be used to indicate whether land sharing' (provision of multiple services from the same land parcel) or land sparing' (single service prioritization) is the most appropriate option. Soil carbon storage and above-ground net primary production indicators were found to define opposing ends of a primary gradient in service provision. Biodiversity and water quality indicators were highest at intermediate levels of both factors, consistent with a unimodal relationship along a productivity gradient. Positive relationships occurred between multiple components of biodiversity, measured as taxon richness of all plants, bee and butterfly nectar plants, soil invertebrates and freshwater macroinvertebrates, indicating potential for management measures directed at one aspect of biodiversity to deliver wider ecosystem biodiversity. We demonstrate that in temperate, human-dominated landscapes, ecosystem services are highly constrained by a fundamental productivity gradient. There are immediate trade-offs between productivity and soil carbon storage but potential synergies with services with different shaped relationships to production. Synthesis and applications. Using techniques such as response curves to analyse multiple service interactions can inform the development of Spatial Decision Support tools and landscape-scale ecosystem service management options. At intermediate productivity, land-sharing' would optimize multiple services, however, to deliver significant soil carbon storage land-sparing' is required, that is, resources focused in low productivity areas with high carbon to maximize investment return. This study emphasizes that targets for services per unit area need to be set within the context of the national gradients reported here to ensure best use of limited resources.

AB Understanding diversity patterns along environmental gradients and their underlying mechanisms is a major topic in current biodiversity research. In this study, we investigate for the first time elevational patterns of vascular plant species richness and endemism on a long-isolated continental island (Crete) that has experienced extensive post-isolation mountain uplift. We used all available data on distribution and elevational ranges of the Cretan plants to interpolate their presence between minimum and maximum elevations in 100-m elevational intervals, along the entire elevational gradient of Crete (0-2400 m). We evaluate the influence of elevation, area, mid-domain effect, elevational Rapoport effect and the post-isolation mountain uplift on plant species richness and endemism elevational patterns. Furthermore, we test the influence of the island condition and the post-isolation mountain uplift to the elevational range sizes of the Cretan plants, using the Peloponnese as a continental control area. Total species richness monotonically decreases with increasing elevation, while endemic species richness has a unimodal response to elevation showing a peak at mid-elevation intervals. Area alone explains a significant amount of variation in species richness along the elevational gradient. Mid-domain effect is not the underlying mechanism of the elevational gradient of plant species richness in Crete, and Rapoport's rule only partly explains the observed patterns. Our results are largely congruent with the post-isolation uplift of the Cretan mountains and their colonization mainly by the available lowland vascular plant species, as high-elevation specialists are almost lacking from the Cretan flora. The increase in the proportion of Cretan endemics with increasing elevation can only be regarded as a result of diversification processes towards Cretan mountains (especially mid-elevation areas), supported by elevation-driven ecological isolation. Cretan plants have experienced elevational range expansion compared to the continental control area, as a result of ecological release triggered by increased species impoverishment with increasing elevation.

AB Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are fundamental in assessing soil variability and are regularly used in Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) as a scale benchmark for all the other environmental covariates. They are conventionally used at their original grid resolution with a conventional 3 x 3 window size for the computation of the derived terrain attributes. The choice of scale frames the analysis and shapes the end result suggesting that better attention and quantitative knowledge of scale may improve predictive performance. Previous studies have shown the influence of pixel size but have not investigated in detail the interacting effect between window and pixel sizes. The aim of this study was to examine the scale dependency of soil classification performance at the landscape scale using two machine-learning techniques commonly applied in DSM: artificial neural networks and random forest. These were applied in three different areas in terms of their geomorphology and soil type located in Ireland. A series of DEMs representing different scales were created from the original 20 m DEM by smoothing and re-sampling it with different window and pixel sizes for a total of 143 combinations: the original, 10 smoothed but not re-sampled, 12 re-sampled and not smoothed, and 120 smoothed and re-sampled. These were used to generate 11 terrain parameters from which 4 points per km(2) were randomly extracted and used to predict soil classes. The overall prediction accuracy in the three study areas varied between 35% and 60%. Pixel size was found significant in all areas, the interaction between window and pixel sizes significant in morphologically rough areas and window size was significant only in flat homogeneous areas at coarser resolutions (above 140 m in this study). In general, predictive performance was best at very fine and very coarse scales in morphologically varied areas, coarse scales in flat homogenous areas and relatively scale invariant in mixed areas. We conclude by examining whether this empirical approach is appropriate to compare scale combinations to obtain a better prediction accuracy of DSM techniques. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Local adaptation of populations along elevational gradients is well known, but conclusive evidence that such divergence has resulted in the origin of distinct species in parapatry remains lacking. We integrated morphological, vocal, genetic and behavioural data to test predictions pertaining to the hypothesis of parapatric ecological speciation associated with elevation in populations of a tropical montane songbird, the Grey-breasted Wood-wren (Henicorhina leucophrys: Troglodytidae), from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. We confirmed that two distinct populations exist along the elevational gradient. Phylogenetic analyses tentatively indicate that the two populations are not sister taxa, suggesting they did not differentiate from a single ancestor along the gradient, but rather resulted from separate colonization events. The populations showed marked divergence in morphometrics, vocalizations and genetic variation in mitochondrial and nuclear loci, and little to no evidence of hybridization. Individuals of both populations responded more strongly to their own local songs than to songs from another elevation. Although the two forms do not appear to have differentiated locally in parapatry, morphological and vocal divergence along the elevational gradient is consistent with adaptation, suggesting a possible link between adaptive evolution in morphology and songs and the origin of reproductive isolation via a behavioural barrier to gene flow. The adaptive value of phenotypic differences between populations requires additional study.

AB Smallholders' agroforests may be valuable for conserving tropical trees through three main mechanisms. First, trees planted and/or retained by farmers in agricultural landscapes where wild stands were once found may be circa situm reservoirs of biodiversity. Second, farmland trees may support conservation in situ by providing an alternative source of product to reduce extraction from forest, and by acting as 'corridors' or 'stepping stones' that connect fragmented wild stands. Third, the additional value that planting assigns to trees may result in greater interest in including them in seed collections, field trials and field 'genebanks' that support ex situ conservation. Here, we critically review the evidence for these mechanisms, and highlight areas for research and for intervention so that agroforestry practices can better support conservation in each setting, with an emphasis on often neglected genetic-level considerations. Based on current global challenges to diversity, conservation will need to rely increasingly on a smallholder-farm circa situm approach, but concerns on long-term effectiveness need to be properly quantified and addressed. Connectivity between widely dispersed, low density trees in agricultural landscapes is an important factor determining the success of the circa situm approach, while improving farmers' access to a diversity of tree germplasm that they are interested in planting is required. The circumstances in which agroforestry plantings can support in situ conservation need to be better defined, and research on the stability of active tree seed collections (how long are species and populations retained in them?) as ex situ reservoirs of biodiversity is needed.

AB Large mammalian carnivores are threatened by anthropogenic environmental impacts, particularly through habitat loss which often cause population declines. Understanding the extent of suitable habitat is therefore of great importance for carnivore conservation. The leopard (Panthera pardus) is a widespread and relatively common large carnivore, but the species is declining in large parts of its range. Using maximum entropy-based habitat models, we estimated the extent of suitable leopard habitat in South Africa, what variables that are associated with suitable leopard habitats, the extent of habitat that has been negatively impacted by human activity and the effectiveness of protected areas to capture suitable habitat. Suitable leopard habitat was highly fragmented. Although vegetation and physical variables were the most influential variables for habitat suitability, livestock farming primarily seem to underlie fragmentation. We suggest that the sustainability of the South African leopard population depends on maintaining dispersal routes between areas with suitable habitat. This will require mitigation of humancarnivore conflict in habitat corridors, particularly mitigation strategies targeting conflict between carnivores and livestock farmers. Because most suitable habitat occurred outside of protected areas, we also recommend that leopard conservation efforts should focus on areas that are not legally protected.

AB Agricultural intensification (AI) is currently a major driver of biodiversity loss and related ecosystem functioning decline. However, spatio-temporal changes in community structure induced by AI, and their relation to ecosystem functioning, remain largely unexplored. Here, we analysed 16 quantitative cereal aphid-parasitoid and parasitoid-hyperparasitoid food webs, replicated four times during the season, under contrasting AI regimes (organic farming in complex landscapes vs. conventional farming in simple landscapes). High AI increased food web complexity but also temporal variability in aphid-parasitoid food webs and in the dominant parasitoid species identity. Enhanced complexity and variability appeared to be controlled bottom-up by changes in aphid dominance structure and evenness. Contrary to the common expectations of positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, community complexity (food-web complexity, species richness and evenness) was negatively related to primary parasitism rates. However, this relationship was positive for secondary parasitoids. Despite differences in community structures among different trophic levels, ecosystem services (parasitism rates) and disservices (aphid abundances and hyperparasitism rates) were always higher in fields with low AI. Hence, community structure and ecosystem functioning appear to be differently influenced by AI, and change differently over time and among trophic levels. In conclusion, intensified agriculture can support diverse albeit highly variable parasitoid-host communities, but ecosystem functioning might not be easy to predict from observed changes in community structure and composition.

AB The area of forests planted with exotic tree species is increasing worldwide in order to fulfill various economic and environmental demands. Numerous species currently used in forest plantations are considered to be invasive in many parts of the world. Exotic plantation tree species are endowed with a series of life-history traits that are characteristic of invasive species: easy establishment, fast growth, high propagule pressure, and low or intermediate shade tolerance. In addition, plantation forestry presents many features that increase ecosystem invasibility, including a regime of frequent and intensive canopy disturbances, a dense network of roads and trails with continuous traffic, and wide plantation areas. Exotic trees planted for production purposes have strong direct positive economic impacts on the local and national economies of many countries, often leading to notable conflicts of interest when the species becomes invasive, as well as to negative impacts on the ecosystem. Studies and management programs mainly focus on Pinus and Acacia, which are used as model species. Complementary management strategies have been established to control these species at different stages of the invasion process. Knowledge gained is useful to predict problems in other regions of the world with the same species and to guide research or management actions on other problematic but less studied tree species.

AB Aim The relative importance of current climate and past historical legacies is hotly debated. Here, we assess their role in determining the global distribution and diversity patterns of palms (Arecaceae), a widespread, species-rich group of keystone ecological importance in tropical ecosystems. Location Global. Methods We assembled country-level species lists world-wide and compiled associated data on potential contemporary environmental drivers (current climate, habitat heterogeneity, area, and insularity), Quaternary glacialinterglacial climate change and major biogeographic regions to evaluate to what extent the global distribution and species richness patterns in palms reflect Quaternary climatic oscillations or regional effects reflecting pre-Quaternary legacies. We also assessed for the first time if historical legacies differ between continents and islands, providing novel insights into determinants of insular species richness. Results Palm species richness was significantly affected by Quaternary climate changes and further differed between biogeographic regions even when both current environmental conditions and Quaternary climate changes were accounted for. In contrast, global limits to the distribution of the palm family were best explained by current temperature while biogeographic regional differences were unimportant and Quaternary climate change caused only a small constraint. Historical legacies were weak on islands, with only a small regional effect and no effect of Quaternary climate changes. Main conclusions Strong historical legacies supplement current environment as determinants of palm species richness. These primarily comprise pre-Quaternary historical effects, reflected in low African species richness (possibly linked to pre-Quaternary extinctions) and outstandingly high Neotropical and Indomalayan palm species richness (possibly linked to these regions' long-term climatic suitability for palms). In contrast to species richness, the global distribution of the family range is largely in equilibrium with current climate. The small historical effects on islands are consistent with climatic buffering from their oceanic environment.

AB The Bay of Biscay (north-east Atlantic) is an open marine ecosystem of particular concern in current European environmental policies. Indeed, it supports both a high biological diversity and numerous anthropogenic activities such as important fisheries. For the first time, stable isotope analyses (SIA) of carbon and nitrogen and analysis of total mercury (T-Hg) concentrations in the muscle (edible flesh) were performed on adult stages of a wide range of species (i.e., 120 species) from various taxa and various habitats of this ecosystem. Concentrations of this non-essential metal, toxic to all living organisms, ranged from 39 to 5074 ng g(-1) dry weight. Calculations of species' trophic positions (TPs) through SIA revealed a limited effect of TP in explaining Hg bioaccumulation by high trophic level consumers in particular. On the contrary, our results suggest an important role of habitat and/or feeding zone, which strongly influence muscle Hg bioaccumulation. Deep-sea fish species effectively presented the highest Hg concentrations. Possible interactions between biological factors (e.g., age of deep-sea organisms) and bioavailability of the metal in the deep-sea environment are discussed to explain such enhanced bioaccumulation of Hg by deep-sea fauna in the Bay of Biscay. This study also highlights a potential risk for human health when deep-sea fish are consumed frequently. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Natural disturbance emulation (NDE) has been proposed as a general approach to ecologically sustainable forest management. We reviewed the concepts, theories, and strategies related to NDE in boreal forest management. We also reviewed publications that discussed NDE in the boreal forest in general and those that specifically compared NDE-based management with conventional even-aged management. The papers generally focused on northern North America and landscape-scale wildfire as the main disturbance factor, whereas information from Eurasia was exclusively theoretical. Within this limited scope, NDE was generally found to have a positive effect on biodiversity in terms of forest structure and species diversity when compared with conventional even-aged management. Studies on timber supply and social implications of NDE were so few that they preclude generalizations. We conclude that the ecological and economic performance of NDE as a management approach still remains poorly examined. To advance the development of NDE, particular attention should be given to (1) augmenting the knowledge base on natural range of variability of unmanaged forest ecosystems and evaluating the validity of this information in a changing climate, (2) fostering multidisciplinary research with better integration of ecological theory to both integrative and analytical research on NDE, and (3) better integration of socioeconomic concerns, adaptive management schemes, and international collaboration into NDE initiatives.

AB NAC (NAM/ATAF/CUC) proteins are one of the largest groups of transcription factors in plants. Although many NAC proteins based on Arabidopsis and rice genomes have been reported in a number of species, a complete survey and classification of all NAC genes in plant species from disparate evolutionary groups is lacking. In this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequences from nine major lineages of land plants to unveil the relationships between these proteins. Our results show that there are fewer than 30 NAC proteins present in both mosses and lycophytes, whereas more than 100 were found in most of the angiosperms. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that NAC proteins consist of 21 subfamilies, most of which have highly conserved non-NAC domain motifs. Six of these subfamilies existed in early-diverged land plants, whereas the remainder diverged only within the angiosperms. We hypothesize that NAC proteins probably originated sometime more than 400 million years ago and expanded together with the differentiation of plants into organisms of increasing complexity possibly after the divergence of lycophytes from the other vascular plants.

AB A critical part of ecological studies is to quantify how landscape spatial heterogeneity affects species' distributions. With advancements in remote sensing technology and GIS, we now live in a data-rich era allowing us to investigate species-environment relationships in heterogeneous landscapes at multiple spatial scales. However, the degree and type of spatial heterogeneity changes depending on the spatial scale at which species-environment relationships are analysed. Here we present the current spatial analytic methods used in ecological studies to quantify ecological spatial heterogeneity. To determine the key spatial scales at which underlying ecological processes act upon species, we recommend use of spectral decomposition techniques such as wavelet analysis or Moran's eigenvector maps. Following this, a suite of spatial regression methods can be used to quantify the relative influence of environmental factors on species' distributions. Finally, spatial graph metrics can be employed to quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneity on landscape connectivity across or within species' ranges and can be used as additional predictors in spatial regression models. We emphasize how spatial statistics, spatial regression, and spatial graph theory can be used to provide insights into how land-scape spatial complexity influences species distributions and to better understand species response to global change.

AB Predicting species' responses to the combined effects of habitat and climate changes has become a major challenge in ecology and conservation biology. However, the effects of climatic and habitat gradients on species distributions have generally been considered separately. Here, we explore the relationships between the habitat and thermal dimensions of the ecological niche in European common birds. Using data from the French Breeding Bird Survey, a large-scale bird monitoring program, we correlated the habitat and thermal positions and breadths of 74 bird species, controlling for life history traits and phylogeny. We found that cold climate species tend to have niche positions in closed habitats, as expected by the conjunction of the biogeographic history of birds' habitats, and their current continent-scale gradients. We also report a positive correlation between thermal and habitat niche breadths, a pattern consistent with macroecological predictions concerning the processes shaping species' distributions. Our results suggest that the relationships between the climatic and habitat components of the niche have to be taken into account to understand and predict changes in species' distributions.

AB Despite the wide acceptance of the "big-leaf" upscaling strategy in evapotranspiration modeling (e. g., the Penman-Monteith model), its usefulness in simulating canopy photosynthesis may be limited by the underlying assumption of homogeneous response of carbon assimilation light-response kinetics through the canopy. While previous studies have shown that the separation of the canopy into sunlit and shaded parts (i.e., two-leaf model) is typically more effective than big-leaf models for upscaling photosynthesis from leaf to canopy, a systematic comparison between these two upscaling strategies among multiple ecosystems has not been presented. In this study, gross primary productivity was modeled using two-leaf and big-leaf upscaling approaches in the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator for shrublands, broadleaf, and conifer forest types. When given the same leaf-level photosynthetic parameters, the big-leaf approach significantly underestimated canopy-level GPP while the two-leaf approach more closely predicted both the magnitude and day-to-day variability in eddy covariance measurements. The underestimation by the big-leaf approach is mostly caused by its exclusion of the photosynthetic contributions of shaded leaves. Tests of the model sensitivity to a foliage clumping index revealed that the contribution of shaded leaves to the total simulated productivity can be as high as 70% for highly clumped stands and seldom decreases below similar to 40% for less-clumped canopies. Our results indicate that accurate upscaling of photosynthesis across a broad array of ecosystems requires an accurate description of canopy structure in ecosystem models.

AB One of the most popular approaches for investigating the roles of niche and neutral processes driving metacommunity patterns consists of partitioning variation in species data into environmental and spatial components. The logic is that the distance decay of similarity in communities is expected under neutral models. However, because environmental variation is often spatially structured, the decay could also be attributed to environmental factors that are missing from the analysis. Here, we use a spatial autocorrelation analysis protocol, previously developed to detect isolation-by-distance in allele frequencies, to evaluate patterns of species abundances under neutral dynamics. We show that this protocol can be linked with variation partitioning analyses. Moreover, in an attempt to test the neutral model, we derive three predictions to be applied both to original species abundances and to abundances predicted by a pure spatial model species abundances will be uncorrelated; Moran's I correlograms will reveal similar short-distance autocorrelation patterns; an increasing degree of non-neutrality will tend to generate patterns of correlation among abundances within groups of species with similar correlograms (i.e. within species with neutral and non-neutral dynamics). We illustrate our protocol by analyzing spatial patterns in abundance of 28 terrestrially breeding anuran species from Central Amazonia. We recommend that researchers should investigate spatial autocorrelation patterns of abundances predicted by pure spatial models to identify similar patterns of spatial autocorrelation at short distances and lack of correlation between species abundances. Therefore, the hypothesis that spatial patterns in abundances are primarily due to pure neutral dynamics (rather than to missing spatiallystructured environmental factors) can be confirmed after taking environmental variables into account.

AB 1. Recent declines in honeybee populations have focused attention on the potential for unmanaged insects to replace them as pollinators of food crops. The capacity of unmanaged pollinators to replace services currently provided by honeybees depends on the spatial and temporal variability of these services, but few quantitative assessments currently exist.
   2. We investigated spatial variation in pollinator importance by comparing pollinator efficiency and effectiveness in stigmatic pollen loads, stigmatic contact and visitation rate between honeybees and the seven most abundant unmanaged taxa in 2007. We assessed temporal variability in pollinator visitation using floral visits recorded three times a day over four consecutive years (2005-2008) in 43 'Pak Choi' Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis mass flowering fields in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Further, we compared the aggregate effect of the unmanaged pollinator assemblage to the managed honeybee.
   3. Pak Choi was visited by many insect species that vary in abundance and effectiveness as pollen transfer agents. There was spatial variation in the four measures of pollinator importance. Pollen deposited on stigmas and flower visits per minute were not significantly different comparing the unmanaged assemblage to honeybees, although stigmatic contact and visitor abundance per number of open flowers were greater in honeybees.
   4. Unmanaged taxa were frequent visitors to the crop in all 4 years. The pooled services provided by the unmanaged assemblage did not differ within a day and were equal to or greater than those provided by honeybees in 2 of the 4 years. Pollinator importance changed little irrespective of the spatial and temporal variations among taxa.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The results of this study suggest that some unmanaged insect taxa are capable of providing consistent pollination services over a 4-year period in a commercial mass flowering crop. As these taxa already contribute substantially to the pollination of food crops, they offer a safety net in the case of sudden collapse of managed honeybee hives. To optimize pollination services, we recommend pollinator-specific farm management practices that consider the needs of both managed and unmanaged pollinator taxa.

AB 1. Ecologists are debating the relative role of deterministic and stochastic determinants of community structure. Although the high diversity and strong spatial structure of soil animal assemblages could provide ecologists with an ideal ecological scenario, surprisingly little information is available on these assemblages.
   2. We studied species-rich soil oribatid mite assemblages from a Mediterranean beech forest and a grassland. We applied multivariate regression approaches and analysed spatial autocorrelation at multiple spatial scales using Moran's eigenvectors. Results were used to partition community variance in terms of the amount of variation uniquely accounted for by environmental correlates (e.g. organic matter) and geographical position. Estimated neutral diversity and immigration parameters were also applied to a soil animal group for the first time to simulate patterns of community dissimilarity expected under neutrality, thereby testing neutral predictions.
   3. After accounting for spatial autocorrelation, the correlation between community structure and key environmental parameters disappeared: about 40% of community variation consisted of spatial patterns independent of measured environmental variables such as organic matter. Environmentally independent spatial patterns encompassed the entire range of scales accounted for by the sampling design (from tens of cm to 100 m). This spatial variation could be due to either unmeasured but spatially structured variables or stochastic drift mediated by dispersal. Observed levels of community dissimilarity were significantly different from those predicted by neutral models.
   4. Oribatid mite assemblages are dominated by processes involving both deterministic and stochastic components and operating at multiple scales. Spatial patterns independent of the measured environmental variables are a prominent feature of the targeted assemblages, but patterns of community dissimilarity do not match neutral predictions. This suggests that either niche-mediated competition or environmental filtering or both are contributing to the core structure of the community. This study indicates new lines of investigation for understanding the mechanisms that determine the signature of the deterministic component of animal community assembly.

TI Stable isotope profiles of large marine predators: viable indicators of

AB Understanding the role of predators is challenging but critical for ecosystem management. For community dynamics, predator-specific size-based variation in diet, trophic position, and habitat use are rarely accounted for. Using two applied tools (stable isotopes and stomach content data), we examined inter- and intra-species ontogenetic variability in diet (stomach contents), trophic position (TPSIA for delta N-15 and TPSCA for stomach contents), and habitat use (delta C-13) of two large sharks, the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and the dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus). Stomach contents identified size-based and gender-specific shifts in diet indicating resource partitioning for and between species. Calculated TP for the two sharks varied by method, either TPSIA or TPSCA and with species, size, and gender, but were complicated by differing baselines and broad functional prey groups, respectively. TP increased with size for S. lewini, but was low in large C. obscurus compared with small sharks. Size-based delta C-13 profiles indicated habitat partitioning by sex in S. lewini and a movement to shelf edge foraging in large C. obscurus. These results demonstrate that predators exert proportional size-based effects on multiple components of the marine system that are further complicated by species- and gender-specific strategies.

AB Aim Temporal transferability is an important issue when habitat models are used beyond the time frame corresponding to model development, but has not received enough attention, particularly in the context of habitat monitoring. While the combination of remote sensing technology and habitat modelling provides a useful tool for habitat monitoring, the effect of incorporating remotely sensed data on model transferability is unclear. Therefore, our objectives were to assess how different satellite-derived variables affect temporal transferability of habitat models and their usefulness for habitat monitoring.
   Location Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China.
   Methods We modelled giant panda habitat with the maximum entropy algorithm using panda presence data collected in two time periods and four different sets of predictor variables representing land surface phenology. Each predictor variable set contained either a time series of smoothed wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) or 11 phenology metrics, both derived from single-year or multi-year (i.e. 3-year) remotely sensed imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We evaluated the ability of models obtained with these four variable sets to predict giant panda habitat within and across time periods by using threshold-independent and threshold-dependent evaluation methods and five indices of temporal transferability.
   Results Our results showed that models developed with the four variable sets were all useful for characterizing and monitoring giant panda habitat. However, the models developed using multi-year data exhibited significantly higher temporal transferability than those developed using single-year data. In addition, models developed with phenology metrics, especially when using multi-year data, exhibited significantly higher temporal transferability than those developed with the time series.
   Main conclusions The integration of land surface phenology, captured by high temporal resolution remotely sensed imagery, with habitat modelling constitutes a suitable tool for characterizing wildlife habitat and monitoring its temporal dynamics. Using multi-year phenology metrics reduces model complexity, multicollinearity among predictor variables and variability caused by inter-annual climatic fluctuations, thereby increasing the temporal transferability of models. This study provides useful guidance for habitat monitoring through the integration of remote sensing technology and habitat modelling, which may be useful for the conservation of the giant panda and many other species.

TI Old-growth forest is what giant pandas really need

DE conservation policy; ecological scale; habitat suitability; giant panda
ID BAMBOO; SCALE
AB Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are an iconic conservation species, but despite significant research effort, do we understand what they really need? Estimating and mapping suitable habitat play a critical role in conservation planning and policy. But if assumptions about ecological needs are wrong, maps with misidentified suitable habitat will misguide conservation action. Here, we use an information-theoretic approach to analyse the largest, landscape-level dataset on panda habitat use to date, and challenge the prevailing wisdom about panda habitat needs. We show that pandas are associated with old-growth forest more than with any ecological variable other than bamboo. Other factors traditionally used in panda habitat models, such as topographic slope, are less important. We suggest that our findings are disparate from previous research in part because our research was conducted over a larger ecological scale than previous research conducted over more circumscribed areas within individual reserves. Thus, extrapolating from habitat studies on small scales to conservation planning on large scales may entail some risk. As the Chinese government is considering the renewal of its logging ban, it should take heed of the panda's dependency on old growth.

TI Mcheza: a workbench to detect selection using dominant markers
SO BIOINFORMATICS

DT Article
ID LOCI; POLYMORPHISM; POPULATIONS; DIVERGENCE
AB Motivation: Dominant markers (DArTs and AFLPs) are commonly used for genetic analysis in the fields of evolutionary genetics, ecology and conservation of genetic resources. The recent prominence of these markers has coincided with renewed interest in detecting the effects of local selection and adaptation at the level of the genome.
   Results: We present Mcheza, an application for detecting loci under selection based on a well-evaluated F-ST-outlier method. The application allows robust estimates to be made of model parameters (e.g. genome-wide average, neutral F-ST), provides data import and export functions, iterative contour smoothing and generation of graphics in an easy to use graphical user interface with a computation engine that supports multicore processors for enhanced performance. Mcheza also provides functionality to mitigate common analytical errors when scanning for loci under selection.

AB Dispersal strategies are important mechanisms underlying the spatial distribution and colonizing ability of all mobile species. In the current study, we use highly polymorphic microsatellite markers to evaluate local dispersal and colonization dynamics of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), an aquatic invader expanding its range from lake to river environments in its introduced North American range. Genetic structure, genotype assignment and genetic diversity were compared among 1262 round gobies from 20 river and four lake sites in three Great Lakes tributaries. Our results indicate that a combination of short-distance diffusion and long-distance dispersal, collectively referred to as 'stratified dispersal', is facilitating river colonization. Colonization proceeded upstream yearly (approximately 500 m/year; 2005-2009) in one of two temporal replicates while genetic structure was temporally stable. Contiguous dispersal from the lake was observed in all three rivers with a substantial portion of river fish (7.3%) identified as migrants. Genotype assignment indicated a separate introduction occurred upstream of the invasion front in one river. Genetic diversity was similar and relatively high among lake and recently colonized river populations, indicating that founder effects are mitigated through a dual-dispersal strategy. The remarkable success of round goby as an aquatic invader stresses the need for better diffusion models of secondary range expansion for presumably sessile invasive species.

AB P>1. Disease severity may be altered by the differential responses of hosts and parasites to rising temperatures leading to an increase or reduction in disease. The net effect of climate change on emerging diseases will reflect the effects of temperature on all life history stages of both hosts and parasites.
   2. To explore how climate change differentially influences hosts and parasites, we studied the effect of increasing temperatures on different life stages of the multi-host trematode parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae, which has been linked to the emerging phenomenon of amphibian limb malformations, and its snail intermediate host Planorbella trivolvis. We determined the effects of temperature on the development of R. ondatrae eggs and redia larvae and the effects of parasite exposure (exposed and sham-exposed), temperature (13, 20, and 26 degrees C) and their interaction on snail host vital rates, including growth, mortality and reproduction.
   3. Ribeiroia eggs developed four times faster at 26 degrees C than at 17 degrees C and did not develop at 12 degrees C. Higher temperatures increased snail growth, egg production and mortality. Infection interacted with temperature to enhance the growth of infected snails while reducing their fecundity at 26 degrees C. These results suggest that pathology associated with infection is amplified at higher temperatures.
   4. The timing of interactions between R. ondatrae and P. trivolvis may be influenced by their physiological responses to temperature. Temperature-driven increases in the growth of infected snails coupled with the cessation of parasite development at lower temperatures suggest that warming temperatures will change host-parasite dynamics. Taken together, these results indicate that future climate change could alter parasite abundance and pathology by creating a 'phenological mismatch' between snail hosts and parasites, potentially leading to infection of both snail and amphibian hosts in earlier and, in the case of amphibians, more vulnerable stages of development.

AB Urbanization induces changes in species abundance and richness that are beginning to be extensively described. However, the functional structure of urban communities still requires attention to provide a basis for a more accurate understanding of urban ecosystems' functioning. This study has been performed in order to assess functional changes in ecological communities related to changes of urban landscape features along an urbanization gradient. Species abundance and richness of birds and butterflies in the city parks of Marseille (south-east France) have been used to assess these changes. On the basis of easily accessible traits (reproduction parameters, size, feeding habits), we have examined whether different contexts of urbanization favour some strategies more than others. Some differences occur between butterflies and birds in terms of species abundance and richness through the urbanization gradient, showing that at least some species of birds manage to colonize city centre and/or exploit urban resources better than butterflies. But our results also clearly reveal general patterns in biological traits for both birds and butterflies that further reflect the gradient of urban features from outskirts to city centre. Species associated with the city centre tolerate a wide range of conditions whereas species associated with city outskirts have more specialized abilities. Urbanization acts as an environmental filter for bird and butterfly communities selecting species able to colonize and settle in the city centre on the basis of their biological traits. In our context, environmental filters induce a biotic homogenization with urbanization through loss of species (taxonomic homogenization) and over-representation of generalist species (functional homogenization). This homogenization reflects an underlying process of disruption of biotic interactions for butterflies and birds. This study has enabled us to identify a combination of biological traits sensitive to urban features that may represent useful indicators for both theoretical and applied purposes in order to understand the impact of urbanization on animal communities.

AB 1. Biodiversity, water quality and ecosystem processes in streams are known to be influenced by the terrestrial landscape over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Lumped attributes (i.e. per cent land use) are often used to characterise the condition of the catchment; however, they are not spatially explicit and do not account for the disproportionate influence of land located near the stream or connected by overland flow.
   2. We compared seven landscape representation metrics to determine whether accounting for the spatial proximity and hydrological effects of land use can be used to account for additional variability in indicators of stream ecosystem health. The landscape metrics included the following: a lumped metric, four inverse-distance-weighted (IDW) metrics based on distance to the stream or survey site and two modified IDW metrics that also accounted for the level of hydrologic activity (HA-IDW). Ecosystem health data were obtained from the Ecological Health Monitoring Programme in Southeast Queensland, Australia and included measures of fish, invertebrates, physicochemistry and nutrients collected during two seasons over 4 years. Linear models were fitted to the stream indicators and landscape metrics, by season, and compared using an information-theoretic approach.
   3. Although no single metric was most suitable for modelling all stream indicators, lumped metrics rarely performed as well as other metric types. Metrics based on proximity to the stream (IDW and HA-IDW) were more suitable for modelling fish indicators, while the HA-IDW metric based on proximity to the survey site generally outperformed others for invertebrates, irrespective of season. There was consistent support for metrics based on proximity to the survey site (IDW or HA-IDW) for all physicochemical indicators during the dry season, while a HA-IDW metric based on proximity to the stream was suitable for five of the six physicochemical indicators in the post-wet season. Only one nutrient indicator was tested and results showed that catchment area had a significant effect on the relationship between land use metrics and algal stable isotope ratios in both seasons.
   4. Spatially explicit methods of landscape representation can clearly improve the predictive ability of many empirical models currently used to study the relationship between landscape, habitat and stream condition. A comparison of different metrics may provide clues about causal pathways and mechanistic processes behind correlative relationships and could be used to target restoration efforts strategically.

AB As populations adapt to novel environments, divergent selection will promote heterogeneous genomic differentiation via reductions in gene flow for loci underlying adaptive traits. Using a data set of over 100 SNP markers, genome scans were performed to investigate the effect of natural selection maintaining differentiation in five lakes harbouring sympatric pairs of normal and dwarf lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). A variable proportion of SNPs (between 0% and 12%) was identified as outliers, which corroborated the predicted intensity of competitive interactions unique to each lake. Moreover, strong reduction in heterozygosity was typically observed for outlier loci in dwarf but not in normal whitefish, indicating that directional selection has been acting on standing genetic variation more intensively in dwarf whitefish. SNP associations in backcross hybrid progeny identified 16 genes exhibiting genotype-phenotype associations for four adaptive traits (growth, swimming activity, gill rakers and condition factor). However, neither simple relationship between elevated levels of genetic differentiation with adaptive phenotype nor conspicuous genetic signatures for parallelism at outlier loci were detected, which underscores the importance of independent evolution among lakes. The integration of phenotypic, transcriptomic and functional genomic information identified two candidate genes (sodium potassium ATPase and triosephosphate isomerase) involved in the recent ecological divergence of lake whitefish. Finally, the identification of several markers under divergent selection suggests that many genes, in an environment-specific manner, are recruited by selection and ultimately contributed to the repeated ecological speciation of a dwarf phenotype.

AB Previous studies deduced negative effects of urbanization on insect conservation from decline in species richness with increasing built-up areas. This is the first study that investigates insect extinction determined by urbanization using a long-time temporal data set from hidden literature data and museum collections. Analyses were conducted for four insect groups in urban Rome: butterflies, coprophagous scarabaeids, non-coprophagous scarabaeids and tenebrionids. A reconstruction of extinction trends from 1885 to 1999 indicates impressive declines in species richness, with differences according to the ecological characteristics of each insect group. Results obtained in this study suggest that insect conservation programs should involve a thorough assessment of which species of conservation concern benefit from green spaces in urban areas, and then the identification of important sites and appropriate measures for population management.

AB Recent studies have highlighted both the positive and negative impacts of species invasions. Most of these studies have been conducted on either immobile invasive plants or sessile fauna found at the base of food webs. Fewer studies have examined the impacts of vagile invasive consumers on native competitors. This is an issue of some importance given the controlling influence that consumers have on lower order plants and animals. Here, we present results of laboratory experiments designed to assess the impacts of unintended aquaculture releases of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), in estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico, on the functionally similar redspotted sunfish (Lepomis miniatus). Laboratory choice tests showed that tilapia prefer the same structured habitat that native sunfish prefer. In subsequent interspecific competition experiments, agonistic tilapia displaced sunfish from their preferred structured habitats. When a piscivore (largemouth bass) was present in the tank with both species, the survival of sunfish decreased. Based on these findings, if left unchecked, we predict that the proliferation of tilapia (and perhaps other aggressive aquaculture fishes) will have important detrimental effects on the structure of native food webs in shallow, structured coastal habitats. While it is likely that the impacts of higher trophic level invasive competitors will vary among species, these results show that consequences of unintended releases of invasive higher order consumers can be important.

AB To date the impact of thermal emissions has not been addressed in life cycle assessment despite the narrow thermal tolerance of most aquatic species. A method to derive characterization factors for the impact of cooling water discharges on aquatic ecosystems was developed which uses space and time explicit integration of fate and effects of water temperature changes. The fate factor is calculated with a 1-dimensional steady-state model and reflects the residence time of heat emissions in the river. The effect factor specifies the loss of species diversity per unit of temperature increase and is based on a species sensitivity distribution of temperature tolerance intervals for various aquatic species. As an example, time explicit characterization factors were calculated for the cooling water discharge of a nuclear power plant in Switzerland, quantifying the impact on aquatic ecosystems of the rivers Aare and Rhine. The relative importance of the impact of these cooling water discharges was compared with other impacts in life cycle assessment We found that thermal emissions are relevant for aquatic ecosystems compared to other stressors, such as chemicals and nutrients. For the case of nuclear electricity investigated, thermal emissions contribute between 3% and over 90% to Ecosystem Quality damage.

AB Parasitism is a common form of life and represents a strong selective pressure for host organisms. In response to this evolutionary pressure, vertebrates have developed genetically coded defences such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Mechanisms of parasite-mediated selection not only maintain outstanding polymorphism in these genes but have also been proposed to further promote host population divergence and ultimately speciation because it can drive evolution of local adaptation in which MHC genes play a crucial role. This review first highlights the dynamics and complexity of parasite-mediated selection in natural systems, which not only depends on dominating parasite strategies and on the taxonomic diversity of the parasite community but also includes the differences in parasite communities between habitats and niches, creating divergent selection on locally adapted populations. Then the different ways in which MHC genes potentially allow vertebrates to respond to these dynamics and to adapt locally are outlined. Finally, it is proposed that varying selection strength in time and space may lead to variation in the strength of precopulatory reproductive isolation which has evolved to maintain local adaptation.

AB The mechanisms permitting the co-existence of tree and grass in savannas have been a source of contention for many years. The two main classes of explanations involve either competition for resources, or differential sensitivity to disturbances. Published models focus principally on one or the other of these mechanisms. Here we introduce a simple ecohydrologic model of savanna vegetation involving both competition for water, and differential sensitivity of trees and grasses to fire disturbances. We show how the co-existence of trees and grasses in savannas can be simultaneously controlled by rainfall and fire, and how the relative importance of the two factors distinguishes between dry and moist savannas. The stability map allows to predict the changes in vegetation structure along gradients of rainfall and fire disturbances realistically, and to clarify the distinction between climate-and disturbance-dependent ecosystems.

AB In this paper, we attempt to analyse the respective influences of land-use and climate changes on the global and regional balances of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Two time periods are analysed: the historical period 1901-2000 and the period 2000-2100. The historical period is analysed using a synthesis of published data as well as new global and regional model simulations, and the future is analysed using models only. Historical land cover changes have resulted globally in SOC release into the atmosphere. This human induced SOC decrease was nearly balanced by the net SOC increase due to higher CO2 and rainfall. Mechanization of agriculture after the 1950s has accelerated SOC losses in croplands, whereas development of carbon-sequestering practices over the past decades may have limited SOC loss from arable soils. In some regions (Europe, China and USA), croplands are currently estimated to be either a small C sink or a small source, but not a large source of CO2 to the atmosphere.
   In the future, according to terrestrial biosphere and climate models projections, both climate and land cover changes might cause a net SOC loss, particularly in tropical regions. The timing, magnitude, and regional distribution of future SOC changes are all highly uncertain. Reducing this uncertainty requires improving future anthropogenic CO2 emissions and land-use scenarios and better understanding of biogeochemical processes that control SOC turnover, for both managed and un-managed ecosystems.

AB The ability to quantify dietary inputs using stable isotope data depends on accurate estimates of isotopic differences between a consumer (c) and its diet (d), commonly referred to as trophic discrimination factors (TDFs) and denoted by Delta(c-d). At present, TDFs are available for only a few mammals and are usually derived in captive settings. The magnitude of TDFs and the degree to which they vary in wild populations is unknown. We determined delta C-13 and delta N-15 TDFs for vibrissae (i.e., whiskers), a tissue that is rapidly becoming an informative isotopic substrate for ecologists, of a wild population of sea otters for which individual diet has been quantified through extensive observational study. This is one of the very few studies that report TDFs for free-living wild animals feeding on natural diets. Trophic discrimination factors of 2.2 parts per thousand +/- 0.7 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 3.5 parts per thousand +/- 0.6 parts per thousand for delta N-15 (mean +/- SD) were similar to those reported for captive carnivores, and variation in individual delta C-13 TDFs was negatively but significantly related to sea urchin consumption. This pattern may relate to the lipid-rich diet consumed by most sea otters in this population and suggests that it may not be appropriate to lipid-extract prey samples when using the isotopic composition of keratinaceous tissues to examine diet in consumers that frequently consume lipid-rich foods, such as many marine mammals and seabirds. We suggest that inherent variation in TDFs should be included in isotopically based estimates of trophic level, food chain length, and mixing models used to quantify dietary inputs in wild populations; this practice will further define the capabilities and limitations of isotopic approaches in ecological studies.

AB Plant growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are highly variable, ranging from mutualism in a wide range of plants, to antagonism in some non-mycorrhizal plant species and plants characteristic of disturbed environments. Many agricultural weeds are non mycorrhizal or originate from ruderal environments where AMF are rare or absent. This led us to hypothesize that AMF may suppress weed growth, a mycorrhizal attribute which has hardly been considered. We investigated the impact of AMF and AMF diversity (three versus one AMF taxon) on weed growth in experimental microcosms where a crop (sunflower) was grown together with six widespread weed species. The presence of AMF reduced total weed biomass with 47% in microcosms where weeds were grown together with sunflower and with 25% in microcosms where weeds were grown alone. The biomass of two out of six weed species was significantly reduced by AMF (-66% & -59%) while the biomass of the four remaining weed species was only slightly reduced (-20% to -37%). Sunflower productivity was not influenced by AMF or AMF diversity. However, sunflower benefitted from AMF via enhanced phosphorus nutrition. The results indicate that the stimulation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in agro-ecosystems may suppress some aggressive weeds.

TI Predicting and mapping malaria under climate change scenarios: the
   potential redistribution of malaria vectors in Africa
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Review
ID ECOLOGY; MOSQUITOS; DYNAMICS
AB Background: Malaria is rampant in Africa and causes untold mortality and morbidity. Vector-borne diseases are climate sensitive and this has raised considerable concern over the implications of climate change on future disease risk. The problem of malaria vectors (Anopheles mosquitoes) shifting from their traditional locations to invade new zones is an important concern. The vision of this study was to exploit the sets of information previously generated by entomologists, e. g. on geographical range of vectors and malaria distribution, to build models that will enable prediction and mapping the potential redistribution of Anopheles mosquitoes in Africa.
   Methods: The development of the modelling tool was carried out through calibration of CLIMEX parameters. The model helped estimate the potential geographical distribution and seasonal abundance of the species in relation to climatic factors. These included temperature, rainfall and relative humidity, which characterized the living environment for Anopheles mosquitoes. The same parameters were used in determining the ecoclimatic index (EI). The EI values were exported to a GIS package for special analysis and proper mapping of the potential future distribution of Anopheles gambiae and Anophles arabiensis within the African continent under three climate change scenarios.
   Results: These results have shown that shifts in these species boundaries southward and eastward of Africa may occur rather than jumps into quite different climatic environments. In the absence of adequate control, these predictions are crucial in understanding the possible future geographical range of the vectors and the disease, which could facilitate planning for various adaptation options.
   Conclusion: Thus, the outputs from this study will be helpful at various levels of decision making, for example, in setting up of an early warning and sustainable strategies for climate change and climate change adaptation for malaria vectors control programmes in Africa.

AB P>1. In most cases, the most important determinant of wetland vegetation is the water regime. Although water regime is usually described and managed at the scale of whole wetlands, the patterning of vegetation is likely to be determined by water regimes that are experienced at much finer spatial scales. In this study, we assess the significance of internal heterogeneity in water regimes and the role that this heterogeneity plays in vegetation patterning.
   2. The effects of water regime on wetland plant species richness and vegetation structure were studied at Dowd Morass, a 1500 ha, Ramsar-listed wetland in south-eastern Australia that is topographically heterogeneous. Data on plant variables and water depth were collected along 45 (50 m) transects throughout the wetland and related to water regimes assigned individually for each transect. Wetland plants were assigned to plant functional groups (PFG) that describe the response of plants to the presence or absence of water at different life stages.
   3. The classification of water depth data indicated four distinct water regimes in the wetland that were differentiated primarily by the duration of the dry period. Representatives of all PFGs co-existed over small spatial scales where topographical variation was present, and the richness and cover of understorey species declined as transects became more deeply and permanently flooded. Some PFGs (e.g. amphibious fluctuation tolerator-low growing and amphibious fluctuation responder-morphologically plastic) were eliminated by extended periods of flooding, which increased the cover but not richness of submerged plants. Species richness and foliage projective cover declined as water regimes shifted from shallow and frequently exposed conditions to regimes typified by deeper and longer inundation. Cover of the structurally dominant woody species was compromised by deeply flooded conditions but vegetative regeneration occurred despite high water levels.
   4. Internal topographical variation generates mosaics of water regimes at fine spatial scales that allow plant species with different water regime requirements to co-exist over small distances. Deep water and an absence of dry periods result in decreased cover of plants and an overall loss of species richness in the understorey. Water regimes are described that promote regeneration and cover of structurally dominant taxa and increased species richness in the understorey. The study demonstrates a strong association between vegetation and the diverse water regimes that exist within a single wetland, a pattern that will be useful for modelling the effects of modified water regimes on wetland vegetation.

AB 1. Plant demographers using matrix tools have paid special attention to vital rates of reproduction, growth and survival. The demographic implications of plants regressing in size, or shrinking, have been overlooked. Shrinkage has either been ignored during demographic censuses or lumped with other demographic processes such as stasis or growth under the assumption that they have similar demographic effects.
   2. We carried out a comparative prospective analysis using classical vital rate elasticities in size-based projection matrices of 80 herbaceous perennial species. We analysed the correlations of the elasticities of each demographic vital rate with the demographic life-history traits (life span, population growth rate, etc.).
   3. We also conducted a comparative loop analysis to understand the effects of shrinkage on demographic parameters linked to size plasticity. We classified loops into 'recruitment' (growth that contributes to reproduction), 'size plasticity' (where individuals fluctuate in size) and 'size rigidity' (no change in size class), and used them as the basis to explain ecological characteristics of the species.
   4. Our results with classical vital rates demonstrate that considering shrinkage as a separate vital rate increases our understanding of factors that contribute to demographic equilibrium (e.g. minimized departure from population growth rate at equilibrium) and buffering (e.g. higher speed of recovery after disturbance), and to reproductive strategies (e.g. mean age of parents of offspring).
   5. The loop analysis results support the findings with vital rate analyses and also reveal new patterns: high growth rates are not exclusively dominated by high elasticities of recruitment, but also by size-plastic loops, and long-lived species experience a marginal increase in the demographic importance of size plasticity.
   6. Synthesis. This study illustrates the necessity for exploring individual demographic vital rates, as opposed to grouping them, to advance our understanding of how different biological processes affect population dynamics. Shrinkage is demographically important because it aids in demographic buffering, increases survival and is related to maintenance-reproduction trade-offs. However, shrinkage cannot be fully explored only with traditional elasticity approaches; because shrinkage for some species is a fundamental plastic trait, its importance is more appropriately captured with loop analyses.

AB Global warming, increasing CO2 concentration, and environmental disturbances affect grassland communities throughout the world. Here, we report on variations in the C3/C4 pattern of Inner Mongolian grassland derived from soil and vegetation. Soil samples from 149 sites covering an area of approximately 250 000 km2 within Inner Mongolia, People's Republic of China were analyzed for the isotopic composition (delta 13C) of soil organic carbon (SOC). The contrast in delta 13C between C3 and C4 plants allowed for calculation of the C3/C4 ratio from delta 13C of SOC with a two-member mixing model, which accounted for influences of aridity and altitude on delta 13C of the C3 end-member and for changes in delta 13C of atmospheric CO2. Maps were created geostatistically, and showed a substantially lower C4 abundance in soil than in recent vegetation (-10%). The difference between soil and vegetation varied regionally and was most pronounced within an E-W belt along 44 degrees N and in a mountainous area, suggesting a spread of C4 plants toward northern latitudes (about 1 degrees) and higher altitudes. The areas of high C4 abundance for present vegetation and SOC were well delineated by the isotherms of crossover temperature based on the climatic conditions of the respective time periods. Our study indicates that change in the patterns of C3/C4 composition in the Inner Mongolia grassland was mainly triggered by increasing temperature, which overrode the antagonistic effect of rising CO2 concentrations.

AB We conducted in situ diver surveys describing the spatial structure of reef fish assemblages at Kingman Reef, an unexploited and remote atoll in the central North Pacific. Structural patterns reflect natural ecological processes that are not influenced by fishing or other anthropogenic factors. The most striking feature of this assemblage is an inverted biomass pyramid dominated by apex predators, primarily sharks and large snappers, across all depth and habitat strata examined. This pattern is most pronounced at greater depths (20 m) on the fore reef. Apex predators dominated to lesser extents in back-reef, patch-reef, and shallow fore-reef habitats. Prey assemblage size spectra showed fewer large prey and greater numbers of prey from small size classes at locations with greater piscivore biomass. Other patterns of prey abundance generally conformed to those previously observed at more commonly encountered, human-altered reefs (e. g. highest herbivore abundance on back reefs and shallower depths on the fore reefs; greater planktivore prevalence deeper on the fore reef). The latter patterns, however, inadvertently miss the less obvious differences in assemblage dynamics that result from alterations in the size structures of prey fish populations where apex predators have been heavily exploited or extirpated. The present study of a fully intact coral reef suggests that (1) piscivores are common across all habitats and depths, (2) the presence of predators does not lead to appreciable reductions in the biomass of other guilds, and (3) predators alter the size structure and therefore the potential productivity and energy flow of the ecosystem.

AB Tree species influence on the soil mineralization process can regulate overall nutrient cycling in a forest ecosystem, which may occur through their effects on substrate quality, soil physicochemical properties and soil microbial community. We investigated tree species effects on soil enzyme activities in a tropical montane forest on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo. Specifically, we analyzed C-and P-degrading enzyme activities, as well as the relationships among the enzyme activities, soil physicochemical properties, substrate quality (C, N, and P concentrations), and microbial composition in the top 5 cm soils beneath conifers (Dacrycarpus imbricatus and Dacrydium gracilis) and broadleaves (Lithocarpus clementianus, Palaquium rioence, and Tristaniopsis clementis). Activities of acid phosphatase and beta-D-glucosidase were significantly different among the tree species. Soil moisture, total C and N content and microbial lipid abundance (a proxy for microbial composition) could influence the enzyme activities although the relative contributions of microbial composition to the enzyme activities might be smaller. A higher acid phosphatase activity beneath Dacrydium than those beneath the other tree species can compensate for a lower concentration of Pin available fractions beneath Dacrydium. This localized mineralization activity could subsequently influence soil nutrient availability in this forest. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB P>Continuous stem radius changes (DR) include growth and water-related processes on the individual tree level. DR is assumed to provide carbon turnover information complementary to net ecosystem productivity (NEP) which integrates fluxes over the entire forest ecosystem. Here, we investigated the unexpectedly close relationship between NEP and DR and asked for causalities.
   NEP (positive values indicate carbon sink) measured by eddy covariance over 11 yr was analysed at three time scales alongside automated point dendrometer DR data from a Swiss subalpine Norway spruce forest.
   On annual and monthly scales, the remarkably close relationship between NEP and DR was positive, whereas on a half-hourly scale the relationship was negative. Gross primary production (GPP) had a similar explanatory power at shorter time scales, but was significantly less correlated with DR on an annual scale.
   The causal explanation for the NEP-DR relationship is still fragmentary; however, it is partially attributable to the following: radial stem growth with a strong effect on monthly and annual increases in NEP and DR; frost-induced bark tissue dehydration with a parallel decrease in both measures on a monthly scale; and transpiration-induced DR shrinkage which is negatively correlated with assimilation and thus with NEP on a half-hourly scale.

AB Despite extensive paleoecological analyses of spatial and temporal turnover in species composition, the fidelity with which time-averaged death assemblages capture variation in species composition and diversity partitioning of living communities remains unexplored. Do death assemblages vary in composition between sites to a lesser degree than do living assemblages, as Would be predicted from time-averaging? And is the higher number of species observed in death relative to living assemblages reduced with increasing spatial scale? We quantify the preservation of spatial and temporal variation in species composition using I I regional data sets based on samples of living molluscan communities and their co-occurring time-averaged death assemblages. (1) Compositional dissimilarities among living assemblages (LA) within data sets are significantly positively rank-correlated to dissimilarities among Counterpart pairs of death assemblages (DA), demonstrating that pairwise dissimilarity within a study area has a good preservation potential in the fossil record. Dissimilarity indices that downplay the abundance of dominant species return the highest live-dead agreement of variation in species composition. (2) The average variation in species composition (average dissimilarity) is consistently smaller in DAs than in LAs (9 of 11 data sets). This damping of variation might arise from DAs generally having a larger sample size, but the reduction by similar to 10-20%, mostly persists even in size-standardized analyses (4 to 7 of 11 data sets, depending on metric). Beta diversity expressed by the number of compositionally distinct communities is also significantly reduced in death assemblages in size-standardized analyses (by similar to 25%,). This damping of variation and reduction in beta diversity is in accord with the loss of temporal resolution expected from time-averaging, without invoking taphonomic bias (from differential preservation or postmortem transportation) or sample-size effects. The loss of temporal resolution should directly reduce temporal variation, and assuming time-for-space substitution owing to random walk within one habitat and/or temporal habitat shifting, it also decreases spatial variation in species composition. (3) DAs are more diverse than LAs at the alpha scale, but the difference is reduced at gamma scales because partitioning of alpha and beta components differs significantly between LAs and DAs. This indicates that the effects of time-averaging are reduced with increasing spatial scale. Thus, overall, time-averaged molluscan DAs do capture variation among samples of the living assemblage, but they tend to damp the magnitude of variation, making them a conservative means of inferring change over time or variation among regions in species composition and diversity, Rates of temporal and spatial species turnover documented in the fossil record are thus expected to be depressed relative to the turnover rates that are predicted by models of community dynamics, which assume higher temporal resolution. Finally, the capture by DAs of underlying variation in the LA implies little variation in the net preservation potential of death assemblages across environments, despite the different taphonomic pathways suggested by taphofacies studies.

AB Repeated sea-level fluctuations during and prior to the Pleistocene had a dramatic effect on the distribution of land and connection among islands between the Asian and Australian continents. These cycles of connection and isolation have long been recognized as an important factor determining the distribution and organization of biodiversity in the Philippines. However, surprisingly few studies have tested for predicted patterns of genetic diversity derived from a Pleistocene sea-level model of geography. Here, we examine evidence for fit to such a model in a widely distributed lineage of shrews (Crocidura). The topology of relationships among Crocidura from the Philippines is concordant with a Pleistocene sea-level model, but (1) AMOVAs reveal that genetic diversity is explained at least as well by modern islands as by Pleistocene islands; (2) Mantel tests reveal a significant influence of isolation by distance; and (3) the degree of genetic divergence between some populations connected by dry land during the last glacial maximum reveals isolation that almost certainly predates the most recent glacial activity. We further employ multiple strategies for inferring time-calibrated phylogenies, but these result in widely varying time estimates for the invasion of SE Asian islands by shrews. Overall, our results suggest Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations have been an important, but not dominant factor shaping shrew diversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Long-term net ecosystem CO2 exchange measurements were conducted on a nutrient-rich fen in northern Finland using the eddy covariance method. During the three measurement years (2006-2008), the mean daytime CO2 flux in July was -0.40 Mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1), while in mid-winter (January-March) the mean efflux was 0.008 Mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Annual balances of -12, -123 and -216 g CO2 m(-2) a(-1) were observed in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. It is suggested that the low uptake in 2006 was related to the warm and dry conditions during the growing season and the consequent reduction in vegetation activity. When compared with two other fens in Finland, there was a clear correspondence between the nutrient status, mean pH value, maximum LAI and the mid-summer CO2 uptake. A similar pattern was not seen in the annual CO2 balance, which correlates more with the growing season length.

AB Traits that permit successful invasions have often seemed idiosyncratic, and the key biological traits identified vary widely among species. This fundamentally limits our ability to determine the invasion potential of a species. However, ultimately, successful invaders must have positive growth rates that longer term result in higher biomass accumulation than competing established species. In many terrestrial ecosystems nitrogen limits plant growth, and is a key factor determining productivity and the outcome of competition among species. Plant nitrogen use may provide a powerful framework to evaluate the invasive potential of a species in nitrogen-limiting ecosystems. Six mechanisms influence plant nitrogen use or acquisition: photosynthetic tissue allocation, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, nitrogen fixation, nitrogen-leaching losses, gross nitrogen mineralization, and plant nitrogen residence time. Here we show that among these alternatives, the key mechanism allowing invasion for Pinus strobus into nitrogen limited grasslands was its higher nitrogen residence time. This higher nitrogen residence time created a positive feedback that redistributed nitrogen from the soil into the plant. This positive feedback allowed P. strobus to accumulate twice as much nitrogen in its tissues and four times as much nitrogen to photosynthetic tissues, as compared with other plant species. In turn, this larger leaf nitrogen pool increased total plant carbon gain of P. strobus two- to sevenfold as compared with other plant species. Thus our data illustrate that plant species can change internal ecosystem nitrogen cycling feedbacks and this mechanism can allow them to gain a competitive advantage over other plant species.

AB Heritable variation in traits can have wide-ranging impacts on species interactions, but the effects that ongoing evolution has on the temporal ecological dynamics of communities are not well understood. Here, we identify three conditions that, if experimentally satisfied, support the hypothesis that evolution by natural selection can drive ecological changes in communities. These conditions are: (i) a focal population exhibits genetic variation in a trait(s), (ii) there is measurable directional selection on the trait(s), and (iii) the trait(s) under selection affects variation in a community variable(s). When these conditions are met, we expect evolution by natural selection to cause ecological changes in the community. We tested these conditions in a field experiment examining the interactions between a native plant (Oenothera biennis) and its associated arthropod community (more than 90 spp.). Oenothera biennis exhibited genetic variation in several plant traits and there was directional selection on plant biomass, life-history strategy (annual versus biennial reproduction) and herbivore resistance. Genetically based variation in biomass and life-history strategy consistently affected the abundance of common arthropod species, total arthropod abundance and arthropod species richness. Using two modelling approaches, we show that evolution by natural selection in large O. biennis populations is predicted to cause changes in the abundance of individual arthropod species, increases in the total abundance of arthropods and a decline in the number of arthropod species. In small O. biennis populations, genetic drift is predicted to swamp out the effects of selection, making the evolution of plant populations unpredictable. In short, evolution by natural selection can play an important role in affecting the dynamics of communities, but these effects depend on several ecological factors. The framework presented here is general and can be applied to other systems to examine the community-level effects of ongoing evolution.

AB 1. This paper is a synthesis of a special issue on groundwater biodiversity with a focus on obligate subterranean species, the stygobionts. The series of papers constitutes a great leap forward in assessing and understanding biodiversity patterns because of the use of large quantitative data sets obtained over a broad geographic scale. They also represent a conceptual shift, away from a purely taxonomic and phylogenetic focus to the analysis of whole groundwater assemblages.
   2. The general patterns emerging for groundwater fauna are: very high levels of endemism, low local diversity relative to regional diversity, a limited number of lineages, occurrence of many relicts, and truncated food webs with very few predators.
   3. beta-Diversity is at least as important as alpha-diversity in determining total richness at different scales (aquifer, basin and region) and overall taxa richness increases across spatial scales.
   4. Advances in understanding groundwater biodiversity patterns further include identification of several important factors related to geology and hydrology that determine the composition of European stygobiotic assemblages.
   5. Important challenges for future research include improving sampling strategies, filling gaps in sampling coverage, intensifying research on theoretical and statistical models, and including functional and genetic diversity components in biodiversity assessments.
   6. Strategies are proposed for protecting groundwater biodiversity and an argument is made to integrate biodiversity in groundwater management. Applying principles such as complementarity and flexibility for groundwater biodiversity conservation is a major step toward delineating a reserve network that maximise species representation at the European scale.

AB Deep-seafloor communities, especially those from the ice-covered Arctic, are subject to severe food limitation as the amount of particulate organic matter (POM) from the surface is attenuated with increasing depth. Here, we use naturally occurring stable isotope tracers (delta N-15) to broaden our rudimentary knowledge of food web structure and the response of benthic organisms to decreasing food supplies along the bathymetric transect (similar to 1300-5600m water depth) of the deep-sea observatory HAUSGARTEN. Encompassing five trophic levels, the HAUSGARTEN food web is among the longest indicating continuous recycling of organic material typical of food-limited deep-sea ecosystems. The delta N-15 signatures ranged from 3.0 parts per thousand for Foraminifera to 21.4 parts per thousand ( +/- 0.4) for starfish (Poraniomorpha tumida). The majority of organisms occupied the second and third trophic level. Demersal fish fed at the third trophic level, consistent with results from stomach contents analysis. There were significant differences in the delta N-15 signatures of different functional groups with highest delta N-15 values in predators/ scavengers (13.2 +/- 0.29 parts per thousand) followed by suspension feeders (11.2 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) and deposit feeders (10.2 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand). Depth( = increasing food limitation) affected functional groups in different ways. While the isotopic signatures of predators/scavengers did not change, those of suspension feeders increased with depth, and the reverse was found for deposit feeders. In contrast to the results of other studies, the delta N-15 signatures in POM samples obtained below 800 m did not vary significantly with depth indicating that changes in delta N-15 values are unlikely to be responsible for the depth-related delta N-15 signature changes observed for benthic consumers. However, the delta N-15 signatures of sediments decreased with increasing depth, which also explains the decrease found for deposit feeders. Suspension feeders may rely increasingly on particles trickling down the HAUSGARTEN slope and carrying higher delta N-15 signatures than the decreasing POM supplies, which elevates the delta N-15 value of their tissues. Our results imply that a depth-stratified approach should be taken to avoid a misinterpretation of data obtained at different depths. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relative plasticity hypothesis predicts that alternative tactics are associated with changes in steroid hormone levels. In species with alternative male reproductive tactics, the highest androgen levels have usually been reported in dominant males. However, in sociable species, dominant males show amicable behaviors to gain access to females, which might conflict with high testosterone levels. We compared testosterone, corticosterone, and resting metabolic rate in male striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) following a conditional strategy with three different reproductive tactics: (i) philopatric group-living males, (ii) solitary-living roamers, (iii) dominant but sociable group-living territorial breeders. Philopatrics had the lowest testosterone but highest corticosterone levels, suggesting that they make the best of a bad job. Dominant territorial breeders had lower testosterone levels than roamers, which have a lower competitive status. Roamers had the highest testosterone levels, which might promote risky behavior, such as invading territories defended by territorial males. Roamers also had lower resting metabolic rates than either type of group-living males. Our results suggest that dominant males' testosterone levels reflect a trade-off between low testosterone amicable behavior and high testosterone dominance

AB Background: Akirins are nuclear proteins that form part of an innate immune response pathway conserved in Drosophila and mice. This studies aim was to characterise the evolution of akirin gene structure and protein function in the eukaryotes.
   Results: akirin genes are present throughout the metazoa and arose before the separation of animal, plant and fungi lineages. Using comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, coupled with comparisons of conserved synteny and genomic organisation, we show that the intron-exon structure of metazoan akirin genes was established prior to the bilateria and that a single proto-orthologue duplicated in the vertebrates, before the gnathostome-agnathan separation, producing akirin1 and akirin2. Phylogenetic analyses of seven vertebrate gene families with members in chromosomal proximity to both akirin1 and akirin2 were compatible with a common duplication event affecting the genomic neighbourhood of the akirin proto-orthologue. A further duplication of akirins occurred in the teleost lineage and was followed by lineage-specific patterns of paralogue loss. Remarkably, akirins have been independently characterised by five research groups under different aliases and a comparison of the available literature revealed diverse functions, generally in regulating gene expression. For example, akirin was characterised in arthropods as subolesin, an important growth factor and in Drosophila as bhringi, which has an essential myogenic role. In vertebrates, akirin1 was named mighty in mice and was shown to regulate myogenesis, whereas akirin2 was characterised as FB11 in rats and promoted carcinogenesis, acting as a transcriptional repressor when bound to a 14-3-3 protein. Both vertebrate Akirins have evolved under comparably strict constraints of purifying selection, although a likelihood ratio test predicted that functional divergence has occurred between paralogues. Bayesian and maximum likelihood tests identified amino-acid positions where the rate of evolution had shifted significantly between paralogues. Interestingly, the highest scoring position was within a conserved, validated binding-site for 14-3-3 proteins.
   Conclusion: This work offers an evolutionary framework to facilitate future studies of eukaryotic akirins and provides insight into their multifaceted and conserved biochemical functions.

AB Fish assemblages were assessed by visual census in sublittoral rocky reefs at the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (TMPA; Mediterranean Sea) and compared among locations characterised by different protection levels: no-take/no-access zones, 2 types of partial protected areas (PPAs, where professional and recreational fishing are regulated in different ways) and locations outside the TMPA. Fish assemblage structures evaluated on abundance data did not differ among different protection levels, while no-take/no-access zones clearly differed from the rest when data were expressed as biomass. Biomass of many target species was higher in no-take/no-access zones mostly due to greater fish size rather than density. For some fish (e.g. the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus), however, both greater density and larger size contributed to the greater biomass in no-take/no-access zones. No differences were found between the 2 types of PPAs, and between PPAs and the locations outside the TMPA, in terms of assemblage structures, and in density, size and biomass of target species. These results suggest the need to (1) improve management in PPAs or re-think their role, and (2) quantitatively assess pressure of both professional and recreational fishing operating within and adjacent to MPAs. This will allow MPAs to set up proper regulations (e.g. limiting professional or recreational fishermen, number and type of gears), and achieve the best balance between ecological targets and reduction of conflicts among different categories of marine resource users.

AB 1. Partially migratory species provide opportunities to understand which ecological factors cause some animals to migrate when others remain resident year round. Partial migration in birds has been explained by the dominance, arrival-time, and body-size hypotheses.
   2. Testing these hypotheses has proven difficult due to the similarities of the predictions they make in temperate-breeding long-distance migrants. In tropical altitudinal migrants, however, these hypotheses make different predictions regarding the sex, age, and condition of migrants and residents.
   3. Among white-ruffed manakins in Costa Rica, young birds were not more likely to migrate (as predicted by the dominance hypothesis), nor were females more likely to migrate (as predicted by the arrival-time hypothesis). All condition-related variables interacted with sex, together explaining much of the variation in migratory behaviour.
   4. I re-articulate the body-size hypothesis in the context of tropical altitudinal bird migration, focusing explicitly on how limited foraging opportunities and differences in individual condition affect fasting ability during torrential rains. Despite ample food, the smallest birds or those stressed by parasites or moult may risk starvation at breeding elevations due to a reduction in foraging time. These results highlight how intrinsic and extrinsic factors may interact to produce observed patterns of within- and among-species variation in migratory behaviour.

AB In this study we compared ground beetles (Carabidae) from a range of different forest fragments along an urbanization gradient in Brussels, Belgium. We address the following questions: (i) How does the degree of urbanization in the surrounding habitat affect forest beetles, and does it interact with the effects of patch size and distance to forest edge? (ii) Do these factors have a different effect at the level of individual species, habitat affinity groups or total community? During 2002 we sampled 13 forest plots in 10 forest patches, ranging in size from 5.27 to 4383 ha. The beetles were captured using transects of pitfall traps from the edge to a distance of 100 m into each woodland and identified to species level. Effects of urbanization, forest size and forest edge were evaluated on total species number, abundance and habitat affinity groups and ten abundant, widespread model carabid species. Overall, the effects of urbanization, forest size and edge effects slightly influenced total species richness and abundance but appeared to have a major effect on ground beetle assemblages through species specific responses. More urbanized sites had significantly fewer forest specialists and more generalist species. Large forest fragments were favoured by forest specialist species while generalist species and species frequently associated with forest (forest generalists) dominated the smaller forests. Forest edges mainly harboured generalist species while forest specialist species were more frequent into the forests if the forest patches were large enough, otherwise they disappeared due to the destruction or impoverishment of their habitat. Our results show the importance of differentiating between habitat affinity, especially habitat generalists versus specialists, the latter having a higher value in nature conservation, and merely the quantity of species represented in human-dominated areas.

AB Glycosyltransferases (GTs; EC 2.4. x. y) constitute a large group of enzymes that form glycosidic bonds through transfer of sugars from activated donor molecules to acceptor molecules. GTs are critical to the biosynthesis of plant cell walls, among other diverse functions. Based on the Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy) database and sequence similarity searches, we have identified 609 potential GT genes (loci) corresponding to 769 transcripts (gene models) in rice (Oryza sativa), the reference monocotyledonous species. Using domain composition and sequence similarity, these rice GTs were classified into 40 CAZy families plus an additional unknown class. We found that two Pfam domains of unknown function, PF04577 and PF04646, are associated with GT families GT61 and GT31, respectively. To facilitate functional analysis of this important and large gene family, we created a phylogenomic Rice GT Database (http://ricephylogenomics. ucdavis. edu/cellwalls/gt/). Through the database, several classes of functional genomic data, including mutant lines and gene expression data, can be displayed for each rice GT in the context of a phylogenetic tree, allowing for comparative analysis both within and between GT families. Comprehensive digital expression analysis of public gene expression data revealed that most (similar to 80%) rice GTs are expressed. Based on analysis with Inparanoid, we identified 282 'rice-diverged' GTs that lack orthologs in sequenced dicots (Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus tricocarpa, Medicago truncatula, and Ricinus communis). Combining these analyses, we identified 33 rice-diverged GT genes (45 gene models) that are highly expressed in above-ground, vegetative tissues. From the literature and this analysis, 21 of these loci are excellent targets for functional examination toward understanding and manipulating grass cell wall qualities. Study of the remainder may reveal aspects of hormone and protein metabolism that are critical for rice biology. This list of 33 genes and the Rice GT Database will facilitate the study of GTs and cell wall synthesis in rice and other plants.

AB Scale pervades interdisciplinary research on human-environment systems that exhibit hallmarks of complexity such as path dependence, nonlinearity, and surprise. Although scale concepts are woven through the data, methodology, and theory of human-environment research, the question remains: does scale exist? More broadly, can a single definition of scale suffice for human-environment systems? The meaning and use of scale is contested across the social, natural, and information sciences. Given that the study of human-environment systems spans many of these disciplines, specific research problems inherit a broad range of conflicting scale concepts. This paper proposes an epistemological scale continuum that arrays scale perspectives from the realist contention that there are natural scales independent of observers through to the constructionist view that scale is subjective and socially mediated. As seen in biocomplexity and human-environment research more broadly, this scale continuum establishes that scale is not a single measure or object of study, nor is any single definition of scale sufficient for human-environment systems. Viewpoints and tensions among scale epistemologies also suggest several general principles for using scale effectively in human-environment research. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Question: Do coexisting plant life forms differ in overall phenology, leaf traits and patterns of leaf litterfall?
   Location: Patagonian Monte, Chubut Province, Argentina. Methods: We assessed phenology, traits of green and senesced leaves and the pattern of leaf litterfall in 12 species of coexisting life forms ( perennial grasses, deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs).
   Results: We did not identify differences in phenology, leaf traits and patterns of leaf litterfall among life forms but these attributes contrasted among species. Independent of the life form, the maintenance of green leaves or vegetative growth during the dry season was mostly associated with leaves with high leaf mass per area (LMA) and high concentration of secondary compounds. Low LMA species produced low litterfall mass with low concentration of secondary compounds, and high N concentration. High LMA species produced the largest mass of leaf litterfall. Accordingly, species were distributed along two main dimensions of ecological variation, the dimension secondary compounds in leaves - length and timing of the vegetative growth period (SC - VGP) and the dimension leaf mass per area - leaf litterfall mass (LMA - LLM).
   Conclusions: Phenology, leaf traits and leaf litterfall varied among species and overlapped among life forms. The two dimensions of ecological variation among species (SC - VGP, LMA - LLM) represent distinct combinations of plant traits or strategies related to resource acquisition and drought tolerance which are reflected in the patterns of leaf litterfall.

Stocking small populations with individuals from other populations may enrich genetic variation and alleviate inbreeding, but such artificial gene flow is not commonly used in conservation owing to potential outbreeding depression. We addressed the role of long-term population size, genetic distance between populations and test environment for the performance of two generations of offspring from between-population crosses of the locally rare plant Ranunculus reptans L. Interpopulation outbreeding positively affected an aggregate measure of fitness, and the fitness superiority of interpopulation hybrids was maintained in the second offspring (F2) generation. Small populations benefited more strongly from interpopulation outbreeding. Genetic distance between crossed populations in neutral markers or quantitative characters was not important. These results were consistent under near-natural competition-free and competitive conditions. We conclude that the benefits of interpopulation outbreeding are likely to outweigh potential drawbacks, especially for populations that suffer from inbreeding.

AB The Joint UKL and Environment Simulator (JULES) (which is based on Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme MOSES), the land surface scheme of the Hadley Centre General Circulation Models (GCM) has been improved to contain an explicit description of light interception for different canopy levels, which consequently leads to a multilayer approach to scaling from leaf to canopy level photosynthesis. We test the improved JULES model at a site in the Amazonian rainforest by comparing against measurements of vertical profiles of radiation through the canopy, eddy covariance measurements of carbon and energy fluxes, and also measurements of carbon isotopic fractionation from top canopy leaves.
   Overall, the new light interception formulation improves modelled photosynthetic carbon uptake compared to the standard big leaf approach used in the original JULES formulation. Additional model improvement was not significant when incorporating more realistic vertical variation of photosynthetic capacity. Even with the improved representation of radiation interception, JULES simulations of net carbon uptake underestimate eddy covariance measurements by 14%. This discrepancy can be removed by either increasing the photosynthetic capacity throughout the canopy or by explicitly including light inhibition of leaf respiration. Along with published evidence of such inhibition of leaf respiration, our study suggests this effect should be considered for inclusion in other GCMs.

AB Sudden oak death is an emerging forest disease caused by the pathogen Phytophthora ramorum that is invading the west coast of the United States and semi-natural areas in Europe. This disease causes lethal stem infections in oaks (Quercus spp.) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), as well as non-lethal foliar infections in a range of other species.
   We investigated two questions to evaluate the effect of landscape structure on the spread of P. ramorum: (i) does the spatial pattern of forested habitat predict P. ramorum disease severity, and is this relationship scale-dependent; and (ii) what influence does spatial pattern have on the optimal microclimate conditions for P. ramorum reproduction?
   We mapped the spatial distribution of suitable forest habitat for P. ramorum and established 86 randomly located field plots within a 20-km(2) region of northern California. For each plot, we quantified P. ramorum disease severity and measured the abundance of woody species. Disease severity in each plot was examined in relation to the surrounding landscape structure measured for nested landscapes of increasing scale.
   P. ramorum disease severity was greatest in plots surrounded by a high proportion of contiguous forest, after accounting for plot-level variables of host abundance, elevation, canopy cover and microclimate. The explanatory power of the model increased with increasing scale up to 200 m, but was not significant at scales less than 50 m.
   High disease severity was associated with lower temperatures in the field than the laboratory-determined optimal range for pathogen reproduction. Variation in microclimate conditions was explained by elevation, not the pattern of host vegetation, indicating that spatially varying disease severity was not a function of microclimate-related edge effects on pathogen growth and survival.
   Both landscape-scale configuration and local composition of host habitat are related to the severity of this destructive forest disease. Increased disease severity within contiguous woodlands may have a considerable impact on the composition of such woodlands, with cascading effects on the population dynamics of both host and pathogen.

AB The 12 presently recognized taxa forming the Macaca silenus group represent the most diverse lineage within the genus Macaca. The present study was set up to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of the extant members of the M. silenus group and to explain their geographical distribution patterns seen today. A combined approach involving the analysis of one paternal (TSPY) and two maternal (cyt b and 12S-16S rRNA) molecular markers enabled us to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within this lineage. Our Y chromosomal marker is not informative enough to allow detailed conclusion. Based on our mitochondrial data, however, M. pagensis, endemic to the three southern Mentawai islands (Sipora, North- and South Pagai), split off early (2.4-2.6 mya) and represents a sister clade to the macaques from the northern Mentawai island of Siberut and from those of the Southeast Asian mainland, which diverged in a radiation-like splitting event about 1.5-1.7 mya. By combining our new results with available data on behavioural as well as climate and sea level changes in Southeast Asia during the Plio- and Pleistocene, we have developed two scenarios for the evolutionary history of this primate group, which may help explain the current geographical distribution of its members.

AB We examined the determinants of zooplankton and phytoplankton metacommunity structure across 25 boreal wetland ponds. Our objective was to determine whether plankton metacommunities exhibit spatial structuring, thus suggesting neutrality, or are merely structured by local environmental features, suggesting that they are under niche-based control. According to Redundancy Analysis (RDA), zooplankton community structure was primarily controlled by concentration of major ions and geographical location of the pond, while phytoplankton community structure was primarily controlled by major ion concentration, nitrogen concentration, and geographical location. According to variance partitioning in RDA, zooplankton community structure was attributed more to pure spatial position of the pond (16.7% of variance) than to pure environmental factors (4.7% of variance). For phytoplankton, community composition was controlled by both spatial and environmental factors, although the effect of pure spatial position (11.1% of variance) on phytoplankton community structure was somewhat weaker than for zooplankton. For zooplankton, community similarity was negatively (P < 0.01) related to both geographical and environmental distance. For phytoplankton, community similarity was negatively (P < 0.05) related only to geographical distance. Finally, cluster analyses showed that zooplankton and phytoplankton communities formed highly dissimilar groupings, thus implying low community concordance. Our results suggest that both zooplankton and phytoplankton comply with both neutral and niche-based models. Our results further imply that even across small spatial scales and even for small organisms such as plankton, communities might be strongly spatially structured. The finding that spatial configuration was even more important than local environmental factors in controlling zooplankton community composition suggests that zooplankton may be dispersal-limited within relatively small spatial scales or that zooplankton metacommunities might be related to mass effects.

AB The scale of population structuring in cod Gadus morhua from the west of Scotland (ICES stock area VIa) and northern North Sea was investigated using a combination of non-genetic methods. Site fidelity of spawning aggregations was examined using historic tag-recapture experiments and individual geolocation estimates from data storage tagged fish. The extent of movements from spawning areas indicated by these two tagging approaches was broadly similar. Between 67 and 97% of adult cod remained within 100 km of spawning areas throughout the year, suggesting resident spawning groups. A small proportion of cod, however, did appear to stray between spawning areas. A comparison of the elemental signature of the otoliths of 0 year-group and the 0 year-group component from the same year-class at age 2 years indicated that most adults originate from local nursery areas. Moreover, there did not appear to be detectable exchange between spawning areas > 200 km apart, such as the Clyde and Minch or Shetland and the Inner Hebrides. As such, population processes may operate at a smaller spatial scale than the stock level. with spawning aggregations functioning as local Populations within a metapopulation. The relevance of this scale of dynamics is discussed in relation to recently imposed closed areas in the region. (c) 2006 Crown copyright.

AB Well-studied model systems present ideal opportunities to understand the relative roles of contemporary selection versus historical processes in determining population differentiation and speciation. Although guppy populations in Trinidad have been a model for studies of evolutionary ecology and sexual selection for more than 50 years, this work has been conducted with little understanding of the phylogenetic history of this species. We used variation in nuclear (X-src) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences to examine the phylogeographic history of Poecilia reticulata Peters (the guppy) across its entire natural range, and to test whether patterns of morphological divergence are a consequence of parallel evolution. Phylogenetic, nested clade, population genetic, and demographic analyses were conducted to investigate patterns of genetic structure at several temporal scales and are discussed in relation to vicariant events, such as tectonic activity and glacial cycles, shaping northeast South American river drainages. The mtDNA phylogeny defined five major lineages, each associated with one or more river drainages, and analysis of molecular variance also detected geographic structuring among these river drainages in an evolutionarily conserved nuclear (X-src) locus. Nested clade and other demographic analyses suggest that the eastern Venezuela/ western Trinidad region is likely the center of origin of P. reticulata. Mantel tests show that the divergence of morphological characters, known to differentiate on a local scale in response to natural and sexual selection pressures, is not associated with mtDNA genetic distance; however, TreeScan analysis identified several significant associations of these characters with the haplotype tree. Parallel upstream/downstream patterns of morphological adaptation in response to selection pressures reported in P. reticulata within Trinidad rivers appears to persist across the natural range. Our results together with previous studies suggest that, although morphological variation in P. reticulata is primarily attributed to selection, phylogeographic history may also play a role.

AB Avian corticosterone (CORT) concentrations vary seasonally for many species, but most studies examined species from extreme environments or from only a few times of the year. It is unclear how general a phenomenon this is. We examined both baseline and stress-induced CORT from house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in two habitats-Massachusetts, similar to their ancestral habitat; and New Mexico, a semi-arid desert where the house sparrow only thrives as an obligate human commensal. We captured both males and females during four times of the year-Spring (when the male cloacal protuberance indicated birds were in breeding condition), Fall, Winter, and in the late summer when birds were undergoing a prebasic molt. Birds were heaviest and had the longest wing chord lengths in the Fall at both sites and Massachusetts birds were approximately 10% heavier than New Mexico birds. House sparrows also showed a seasonal variation in the amount of fat stores, but the seasonal pattern differed. Massachusetts birds were fatter overall and showed the most fat during Fall and Winter, whereas New Mexico birds showed the most fat in the Spring. Both baseline and stress-induced total CORT did not differ between sexes or sites, with the exceptions of baseline CORT in the Fall and stress-induced CORT in the Spring being elevated in Massachusetts males. There was a distinct seasonal pattern at both sites, however, with total CORT being highest in the Spring and Winter and lowest during Fall and molt. This seasonal pattern was mirrored in corticosterone binding globulin (CBG) capacities, and when free CORT was estimated, the seasonal pattern disappeared. Stress-induced free CORT, however, was higher in Massachusetts males and females during the Fall and Winter, suggesting a potential differential response to stress associated with commensalism.

AB Bird fauna of the Madrid province (Central Spain) was analyzed according to urban development in a landscape mosaic of 700 km(2). Bird distribution and abundance was studied in urban versus several rural habitats and along a gradient of urban typologies. By means of tree regression analyses we identified the most important habitat structure variables affecting bird species richness and density in urban environments. Bird communities in urban environments were globally less diverse and had higher densities than any natural habitat of the study region. The number of urban-avoider species (n = 37) was greater than the number of species favoured by urban habitats (n = 8). Current housing developments of extense crowded terraced-houses, with shortage of gardens, supported the least diverse and dense bird populations. Nevertheless, differences in bird species abundance between urban and natural habitats mitigated in many species when considering the older gardened developments. The plots with the highest species richness (average of 14.5 spp./0.8 ha) were those with 15-28% of building cover, more than 43 medium-sized trees/ha (10-30 cm dbh), and 13-54 small trees/ha (less than 10 cm dbh). Subsequently, future land-use planning should stress the exclusion of urban developments from the most valuable habitats, such as open wooded valley areas devoted to cattle-grazing (mainly ash-groves), and the negative effect of dense, low-gardened housing developments.

AB Previous studies in tropical rain forests suggest that most small mammal species reach their highest densities in disturbed habitats; however, only a few sites have been examined. Consequently, habitat and resource use for many species is poorly understood. This is especially true in the Amazon Basin, where no studies of microhabitat associations of small mammals have been undertaken. We studied relationships with habitat variables and resource abundances for 5 species of marsupials and 9 species of rodents at a site in southeastern Amazonia. Small mammals were sampled with traps placed both on the ground and in the understory. Eight habitat variables were measured to quantify habitat structure. Measures of insect biomass were collected by the use of sticky traps, and fruit abundance was quantified. Patterns of habitat use were examined using logistic regression, multiple regression, and ordinations. Many species showed increased abundances with habitat features indicative of edge-affected or disturbed habitats, showing negative relationships with understory openness, understory woody-stem density, tree density, and tree size; and positive relationships with number of vines per tree, mean log size, number of logs, and volume of downed wood. We obtained support for the hypothesis that the cause of this pattern is increased resource abundances in these areas, because both insect biomass and number of fruiting trees showed similar relationships. However, for many species, measures of resource abundance were not important once habitat features were entered into the models, indicating that the relationship to resources is an indirect one.

AB Knowledge of the insect communities inhabiting different types of dead wood, and their responses to variation in its availability, is important in assessing the potential ecological impacts of changes in the quality and quantity of coarse woody debris (CWD) that may result from forest management activities. We collected all Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera emerging from four decay classes of pine (Pinus strobus, P resinosa, P. banksiana) logs collected from 22 sites within Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada, in order to analyze variation in community composition and trophic structure as a function of log decay class, and to determine whether the abundance of wood-inhabiting insects in the logs was correlated with the amount of downed CWD in the surrounding area. Multivariate analyses revealed that community composition varied continuously across the four decay classes, and that our system of decay classes explained decomposition-related variation in insect communities relatively well compared to individual characteristics of the logs. Of 27 families that were classified as "common" (present in > 25% of the logs from at least one decay class), 19 were found to vary significantly in rank-abundance across decay classes, with nearly all of these favouring logs that were either in an early (class 1) or late (classes III-IV) stage of decomposition. These associations also reflected functional differences in trophic guild structure: xylophages and predators tended to be most abundant in fresh logs, whereas saprophages, fungivores, predators, and parasitoids tended to be most abundant in more highly decayed logs. When the community was considered as a whole, insect abundance generally did not appear to correlate with the volume of downed CWD in the surrounding 20 or 79 ha area, either within or across decay classes. When trophic guilds were considered separately though, we found that the average rank-abundance of fungivores was correlated with the surrounding volume of downed CWD. We conclude that wood-inhabiting insect biodiversity, and its associated ecological functions, may best be maintained through forest management practices that do not reduce overall amounts of CWD, and that ensure it is available in both early and late stages of decomposition.

AB Species coexistence and local-scale species richness are limited by the availability of seeds and microsites for germination and establishment. We conducted a seed addition experiment in seminatural grassland at three sites in southern Switzerland and repeated the experiment in two successive years to evaluate various circumstances under which seed limitation and establishment Success affect community functioning. A collection of 144000 seeds of 22 meadow species including grasses and forbs of local provenance was gathered, and seeds were individually sown in a density that resembled natural seed rain. The three communities were seed limited. Three years after sowing, single species varied in emergence (0-50%), survival (0-69%), and establishment rates (0-27%). One annual and 13 perennial species reached reproductive stage. Low establishment at one site and reduced growth at another site indicated stronger microsite limitation compared to the third site. Recruitment was influenced by differences in abiotic environmental conditions between sites (water availability, soil minerals) and by within-site differences in biotic interaction (corn petition). At the least water-limited site, sowing resulted in an increase in phytomass due to establishment of short-lived perennials in the second and third years after sowing. This increase persisted over the following two years due to establishment of longer-lived perennials. After sowing in a wetter year with higher phytomass, however, productivity did not increase, because higher intensity of competition,in an early phase of establishment resulted in less vigorous plants later on. Due to the generally favorable weather conditions during this study, sowing year had a small effect on numbers of established individuals over all species. Recruitment limitation can thus constrain local-scale species richness and productivity, either by a lack of seeds or by reduced seedling growth, likely due to competition from the established vegetation.

AB To improve our understanding of lake landscape position, we compared four metrics based on different aspects of lake surface hydrologic connections: (1) "lake hydrology," which is a general measure of lake surface hydrologic position, (2) "lake order," which measures connections to streams by stream order, (3) " lake network number," which measures connections to other lakes, and (4) "lake network complexity," which measures the complexity of connections to other lakes (in a chain or branched). We sampled 71 lakes in northern Michigan, U.S.A. and measured lake landscape position and landscape characteristics around each lake (e.g., land use/cover and geology) to answer two questions: (1) which metric of landscape position explains the most variation in lake water chemistry/clarity? and (2) what landscape and physical features are also related to landscape position? All four landscape position metrics explained significant variation in some water chemistry/clarity variables. However, lake order, the metric based on stream order, consistently explained the most variation, ranging from 22% (dissolved organic carbon) to 53% (conductivity and calcium), with lake hydrology, the metric based on both streams and lakes, explaining similar amounts of variation to lake order, but less overall. Landscape position was also significantly related to both lake morphometry and the proportion of wetland types in buffer areas, which may help explain why landscape position is related to lake water chemistry and clarity variables.

AB Plant volatiles mediate host finding in insect herbivores and lead to host fidelity and habitat-specific mating, generating premating reproductive isolation and facilitating sympatric divergence. The apple fruit moth, Argyresthia conjugella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Argyresthiidae), is a particularly suitable species to study the cues and behavioural mechanisms leading to colonization of a new host: it recurrently oviposits on the non-host plant, apple Malus domestica Borkh. (Rosaceae), where the larvae cannot complete their development. The larval host of the apple fruit moth (Lepidoptera, Argyresthiidae), is rowan Sorbus aucuparia L. (Rosaceae). Fruit setting in rowan, however, fluctuates strongly over large areas in Scandinavia. Every 2-4 years, when too few rowanberries are available for egg laying in forests, apple fruit moth females oviposit instead on apple in nearby orchards, but not on other fruits, such as pear or plum. This poses the question of which cues mediate attraction to rowan and apple, and how apple fruit moth discriminates rowan from apple. Chemical analysis and antennal recordings showed that 11 out of 15 rowan volatiles eliciting an antennal response in A. conjugella females co-occur in rowan and apple headspace, in a different proportion. In the field, A. conjugella was attracted to several of these plant volatiles, especially to 2-phenyl ethanol, methyl salicylate, and decanal. Addition of anethole to 2-phenyl ethanol had a strong synergistic effect, the 1 : 1 blend is a powerful attractant for A. conjugella males and females. These results confirm that volatiles common to both plants may account for a host switch in A. conjugella from rowan to apple. Some of the most attractive compounds, including 2-phenyl ethanol, anethole, and decanal, which have been found in several apple cultivars, were not present in the headspace of the apple cultivar, Aroma, which is also susceptible to attack by A. conjugella. This supports the idea that the odour signal from apple is suboptimal for attraction of A. conjugella, but is nonetheless sufficient for attraction, during times when rowan is not available for egg laying.

AB Hypotheses on the spatial and temporal distribution of sessile assemblages in submerged marine caves have rarely been tested. Classically, the distribution of cave benthos has been related mainly to the physical gradients along the exterior-interior axis. Using a multifactorial sampling design, we examined the distribution of species assemblages within 3 different caves in Southern Italy. Non-destructive sampling was repeated at 4 different times over a period of 11 mo. Results showed an overall pattern of change in the structure of the assemblages along the exterior-interior axis of the 3 caves (i.e. among sectors). Significant differences in species assemblages, however, were also observed within sectors (i.e. among areas), and changes in assemblages varied inconsistently with time and among caves. This result suggests a high complexity of the processes determining spatio-temporal distribution patterns in marine caves, which are context- and scale-dependent. Results also showed the uniqueness of these assemblages, which has important implications for their conservation and management.

AB The 1997-98 El Nino was one of the strongest on record and resulted in widespread losses of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (Agardh) along the west coast of North America. Drawing on a rich history of studies that have shown abnormally large waves and warm nutrient-poor water associated with El Ninos to negatively impact giant kelp populations at some locations in southern and Baja California, we examined (1) how these impacts scale up when considered across the species' geographic range in the NE Pacific Ocean and (2) if these impacts are generalizable over broad spatial scales. Working at 56 sites in 14 study locations over a 3 yr period (1997 to 2000), we examined how giant kelp populations were impacted by and recovered following the 1997-98 El Niho over a similar to 1500 km span along the west coast of North America. Our results indicate that while nearly all giant kelp disappeared from the southern one-third of the species' range along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and heavy losses occurred throughout the central one-third of the species' range in southern California, USA, only minor impacts were observed throughout the northern one-third of the species' range in central California. Further, although highly variable among regions, these impacts were similar and generalizable among locations within each region. Our results also suggest that, as has been observed in local-scale studies, this large-scale variability in giant kelp mortality was driven by large-scale patterns in ocean temperature (nutrient concentration) and wave intensity. Recovery following El Niho, in contrast, was variable at multiple spatial scales and although not directly tested here, presumably influenced by numerous factors such as proximity to upwelling areas, competition with other algae, grazing, and propagule availability. Further, variability in the rates of recovery among locations resulted in a generally slow recovery of giant kelp throughout most of Baja California, and residual large-scale impacts of the El Niho were still evident 2 yr after the El Niho ended. As global climate change may lead to increases in the frequency and intensity of El Ninos, our findings have broad implications for the ways in which ecosystems might be expected to respond to them and provide a measure by which their impacts to giant kelp ecosystems may be compared among events.

AB The extent to which migratory birds that breed in the Arctic and winter in southern biomes rely on residual body stores for reproduction is unresolved. The short arctic summer and the limited availability of food early in the season constrain the time available for successful reproduction. Birds that are able to bring sufficient endogenous reserves to the breeding ground to meet, at least partially, the demands of egg-laying can initiate clutch production soon after arrival, thereby shortening the length of the breeding season and improving the chances of reproductive success. The amount of reserves available will be influenced by body size, the increased energetic and predation costs associated with carrying large stores, distances between staging sites and the location of the breeding grounds within the Arctic. Birds need not fly directly to the breeding grounds from the established temperate staging sites. Extensive feeding by migrants may occur in the Arctic, even within a few kilometres of the breeding sites as the birds track the retreating snowline. Irrespective of their size, birds are thus able to store some resources necessary for egg laying at local or regional scales. It is thus important to make a distinction between local capital and distant capital breeding. The extent to which a bird is characterized as a distant capital, local capital, or an income breeder not only varies between species, but also between individuals and seasons.

AB We report the presence of 3 exotic invertebrate species inhabiting offshore oil and gas platforms on the Pacific offshore continental shelf (POCS) of central and southern California, USA. These exotic species occur in high cover or density and may negatively affect populations of native species on the platforms. Conspicuous exotic species (the bryozoan Watersipora ?subtorquata and the anemone Diadumene sp.) were detected on 2 of 7 platforms surveyed. An inconspicuous exotic species (the amphipod Caprella mutica) was detected on 2 of 2 platforms surveyed for such smaller species. In addition to serving as a potential source of exotic species to natural reef habitats, the presence of exotic species on oil platforms may influence the degree to which these structures provide the ecological services of natural reefs. The presence of exotic species on platforms also has consequences for various platform decommissioning options in California and elsewhere (there are an estimated 7000 offshore platforms/installations worldwide), including the removal and transport of platforms for use as artificial reefs, if removals are conducted without regard for the potential transport/dispersal of these species. Further knowledge of the identity of exotic species on oil platforms, their potential for dispersal and interaction with native species, and whether these species can also occur on artificial reefs, will improve our understanding of the effects that artificial structures in general have on the ecological functioning of coastal ecosystems.

AB The phylogeography of five flowering plant species (Cakile maritima, Eryngium maritimum, Salsola kali, Halimione portulacoides, Crithmum maritimum) widespread along the European coasts was investigated across their entire European range using AFLP evidence. Both similarities and dissimilarities were found. All species contain a distinct Black Sea/Aegean Sea cluster, and all except E. maritimum contain a distinct Adriatic Sea cluster or group of genetically very similar clusters. All species except Cr maritimum contain a distinct Atlantic Ocean/North Sea/Baltic Sea cluster clearly separate from the Mediterranean material. In Ca. maritima a distinct Baltic Sea subcluster was found. In the western Mediterranean, two species groups can be recognized. Whereas in S. kali and E. maritimum material from this area falls into only one cluster or a group of genetically very similar clusters, it falls into two clusters or groups of clusters of either more Atlantic or more central Mediterranean similarity in Ca. maritima, H. portulacoides and Cr. maritimum. Similarities and dissimilarities in patterns found are discussed in terms of a combination of historical and extant abiotic and biotic factors. Thus, the distribution range of all species in the eastern Mediterranean area was not affected by Quaternary temperature changes, resulting in phylogeographic congruency here. The existence of distinct Black Sea/Aegean Sea and Adriatic Sea clusters or groups of clusters is the result of sea currents isolating these regions from each other. In the western Mediterranean basin the more cold-sensitive species (H. portulacoides, Cr: maritimum) but not the less cold-sensitive species (S. kali, E. maritimum) had to retreat from northern coasts. Re-colonization of these areas from two different directions is implied by their phylogeographic pattern. The existence of a distinct Gibraltar gap is explained in terms of extant sea currents. Comparison of phylogeographic patterns found with those observed in either marine or terrestrial organisms leads to the conclusion that marine dispersal is of overriding importance in these coastal plants.

AB One of the most studied life-history trade-offs is that resulting from the cost of reproduction: a trade-off arises when reproduction diverts limited resources from other life-history traits. We examine the cost of reproduction in male, and the effect of male mating Status on female Callosobruchus maculatus seed beetles. Cost of reproduction for male C. maculatus was manifested as reduced longevity. There was also a positive relationship between male body size and male longevity. Females mated to males that had already copulated twice did not live as long as females mated to males that had copulated once or not at all. The third Copulation of males also lasted longer than the two previous ones. We conclude that even though the cost of reproduction for males has been studied much less than that in females, there is growing evidence that male reproductive effort is more complex than has traditionally been thought.

AB The evolution of the realized climatic niche in the genus Arabidopsis was studied using an almost complete phylogenetic tree based on DNA sequences of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers. The realized climatic niche (climate space) was determined by the intersections of the distribution ranges of the taxa with climate data and is presented in temperature/precipitation diagrams. A positive correlation exists between the climate spaces of the taxa and their range sizes. The diagrams revealed a core climate; that is, a climate space in which all taxa co-exist. This core climate is almost identical to the most parsimonious reconstruction of the genus' ancestral climate space and may be considered an ancestral state of these characters. Mapping the evolutionary changes occurring in the realized climatic space on the phylogenetic tree from the core climate proved to be the most parsimonious procedure. The character complex is homoplastic; that is, many parallel evolutionary events have occurred in the subclades. With the exception of A. thaliana, which is sister to the other species of the genus and occupies a very large climate space, the late-diverged taxa of the other subclades experienced great evolutionary changes whereas the realized climate space of the taxa that diverged earlier resembles the core climate. The latter also show some parallel contractions in the climate space. It is hypothesized that the diversification of Arabidopsis may have started from small to midsized ranges in a temperate climate.

AB Although the rate that species accumulate with area has long been regarded as an important component of fine-scale community structure and several studies have examined this rate in meta-analyses, few if any studies have systematically examined fine-scale species-area relationships using a consistent survey protocol over a large region. We examined fine-scale species-area relationships using the extensive database of the Carolina Vegetation Survey (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, USA), including 1472 plots wherein vascular plant richness was recorded for each of six subplot sizes regularly spaced on a log(10) scale, from 0.01 to 1000 m(2). Contrary to prevailing theory, our data closely and consistently fit an Arrhenius (power law) species-area model, echoing broader-scale patterns. Species accumulation rate (Z) values fell within a narrow range (95% between 0.2 and 0.5) despite a 30-fold range in 1000-m(2) richness. When we added regional- and global-scale richness estimates to our results, a Preston-type triphasic curve emerged. We suggest that (1) fine-scale species-area relationships are remarkably consistent and (2) full-scale species-area curves reveal scale dependencies in diversity data that are not accounted for by current species-area theory.

AB ADP-glucose pyrophoshorylase (ADP-Glc PPase) catalyzes the first and limiting step in starch biosynthesis. In plants, the enzyme is composed of two types of subunits ( small and large) and is allosterically regulated by 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphate. The pattern of expression and sugar regulation of the six Arabidopsis thaliana ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes ( two small subunits, ApS1 and ApS2; and four large subunits, ApL1-ApL4) has been studied. Based on mRNA expression, ApS1 is the main small subunit or catalytic isoform responsible for ADP-Glc PPase activity in all tissues of the plant. Large subunits play a regulatory role, and the data presented define a clear functional distinction among them. ApL1 is the main large subunit in source tissues, whereas ApL3 and, to a lesser extent, ApL4 are the main isoforms present in sink tissues. Thus, in source tissues, ADP-Glc PPase would be finely regulated by the 3-phosphoglycerate/phosphate ratio, whereas in sink tissues, the enzyme would be dependent on the availability of substrates for starch synthesis. Sugar regulation of ADP-Glc PPase genes is restricted to ApL3 and ApL4 in leaves. Sugar induction of ApL3 and ApL4 transcription in leaves allows the establishment of heterotetramers less sensitive to the allosteric effectors, resembling the situation in sink tissues. The results presented on the expression pattern and sugar regulation allow us to propose a gene evolution model for the Arabidopsis ADP-Glc PPase gene family.

AB Several theoretical studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for coalescent stochasticity in phylogeographical studies, however, there are few empirical examples that do so in the context of explicit hypothesis testing. Here, we provide an example from the Idaho giant salamander (Dicamptodon aterrimus) using 118 mtDNA sequences, nearly 2 kb in length. This species is endemic to mesic forests in northern and central Idaho, and several a priori hypotheses have been erected based both on palaeoclimatic grounds and from phylogeographical studies of codistributed amphibians. Phylogenetic analysis of the D. aterrimus data suggests an expansion from a single refugium south of the Salmon River, whereas the inference from nested clade analysis is one of expansion from a single refugium in the Clearwater drainage. Explicit testing of these hypotheses, using geographically structured coalescent simulations to erect null distributions, indicates we can reject expansion from the Clearwater drainage (p(CLW) = 0.089), but not expansion from the South Fork of the Salmon drainage (p(SAL) = 0.329). Furthermore, data from codistributed amphibians suggest that there may have been two refugia, and an AMOVA shows that most of the molecular variance partitioned between the Clearwater and the Salmon drainages (54.40%; P < 0.001) and within drainages (43.61%; P < 0.001). As a result, we also tested three a priori hypotheses which predicted that both the Clearwater and Salmon drainages functioned as refugia during the late Pleistocene; we could reject (P-CORD = 0.019) divergence dates during the Cordilleran glacial maxima [c. 20 000 years before present (ybp)], during the Sangamon interglacial (c. 35 000 ybp; p(SANG) = 0.032), as well as pre-Pleistocene divergence (c. 1.7 Ma; p(pP) < 0.001). Mismatch distributions and Tajima's D within the individual drainages provide further support to recent population expansion. This work demonstrates coalescent stochasticity is an important phenomenon to consider in testing phylogeographical hypotheses, and suggests that analytical methods which fail to sufficiently quantify this uncertainty can lead to false confidence in the conclusions drawn from these methods.

AB Many introduced species have negative impacts on native species, but some develop positive interactions with both native species and other invaders. Facilitation between invaders may lead to an overall acceleration in invasion success and impacts. Mechanisms of facilitation include habitat alteration, or ecosystem engineering, and trophic interactions. In marine systems, only a handful of positive effects have been reported for invading species. In an unusual NE Pacific marine assemblage dominated by 5 conspicuous invaders and 2 native species, we identified positive effects of the most abundant invader, the Asian hornsnail Batillaria attramentaria, on all other species. B. attramentaria reached densities > 1400 m(-2), providing an average of 600 cm of hard substrate per m(2) on this mudflat, Its shells were used as habitat almost exclusively by the introduced Atlantic slipper shell Crepidula convexa, the introduced Asian anemone Diadumene lineata, and 2 native hermit crabs Pagurus hirsutiusculus and P. granosimanus. In addition, manipulative experiments showed that the abundance of the mudsnail Nassarius fraterculus and percentage cover of the eelgrass Zostera japonica, both introduced from the NW Pacific, increased significantly in the presence of B. attramentaria. The most likely mechanisms for these facilitations are indirect grazing effects and bioturbation, respectively. Since the precise arrival dates of all these invaders are unknown, the role of B. attramentaria's positive interactions in their initial invasion success is unknown, Nevertheless, by providing habitat for 2 non-native epibionts and 2 native species, and by facilitating 2 other invaders, the non-native B. attramentaria enhances the level of invasion by all 6 species.

AB The paper presents a method that addresses the problem of site-selection for habitat creation involving spatial processes on the landscape scale. It interprets landscape ecological principles, with focus on population dynamics, to specific information required to support a particular decision at each stage of the process. The approach focuses on deciduous woodland with the redstart Phoenicurous phoenicurous as an umbrella species for woodland birds and is illustrated within the fragmented landscape of the east midlands area of England. The method requires the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to estimate the connectivity of habitat patches. Each patch is assigned a "cost" value that represents the cost of dispersal over a friction surface. The sites are ranked accordingly and, in combination with the spatial context and size, are prioritised in terms of their potential for forming cores for habitat creation. Habitat patches with low cost values, a large area of surrounding habitat and small size were identified as potential sites for expansion in order to satisfy the minimum requirements of the species. The approach is generic, applicable to any species, and despite its limitations it can be a useful aid in conservation planning. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While it now appears likely that sympatric speciation is possible, its generality remains contentious. If it really is rare, then most natural populations must not fit the assumptions of sympatric speciation theory. A better understanding of these assumptions may help identify when sympatric speciation is or is not likely. This paper investigates two such assumptions: that genetic variation for stringent assortative mating is not limiting and that females are not penalized for mating assortatively. Simulations demonstrate that the speed of sympatric speciation is very sensitive to the population's capacity for stringent assortative mating and is potentially extremely slow. The rapid divergence often thought to be a hallmark of sympatric speciation may only occur in a restricted area of parameter space.

AB We tested the hypothesis that the tropical shrub Clidemia hirta appears more shade tolerant and is more abundant in its introduced than native range because of genetic differences in resource acquisition, allocation, and phenotypic plasticity between native and introduced genotypes. We examined growth, biomass allocation, and photosynthetic parameters of C. hirta grown in a greenhouse from seed collected from four populations in part of its native range (Costa Rica) and four populations in part of its introduced range (Hawaiian Islands). Six-month-old seedlings were placed in high (10.3-13.9 mol m(-2) day(-1)) or low (1.4-4.5 mol m(-2) day(-1)) light treatments and grown for an additional 6 months. Our study provided little evidence that Hawaiian genotypes of C. hirta differed genetically from Costa Rican genotypes in ways that would contribute to differences in habitat distribution or abundance. Some of the genetic differences that were apparent, such as greater allocation to stems and leaf area relative to whole plant biomass in Costa Rican genotypes and greater allocation to roots in Hawaiian genotypes, were contrary to predictions that genotypes from the introduced range would allocate more biomass to growth and less to storage than those from the native range. Hawaiian and Costa Rican genotypes displayed no significant differences in relative growth rates, maximal photosynthetic rates, or specific leaf areas in either light treatment. In the high light environment, however, Hawaiian genotypes allocated more biomass to reproductive parts than Costa Rican genotypes. Phenotypic plasticity for only 1 of 12 morphological and photosynthetic variables was greater for Hawaiian than Costa Rican genotypes. We conclude that genetic shifts in resource use, resource allocation, or plasticity do not contribute to differences in habitat distribution and abundance between the native and introduced ranges of C. hirta.

AB The assumption that trade-offs exist is fundamental in evolutionary theory. Levins (Am. Nat. 96 (1962) 361-372) introduced a widely adopted graphical method for analyzing evolution towards an optimal combination of two quantitative traits, which are traded off. His approach explicitly excluded the possibility of density- and frequency-dependent selection. Here we extend Levins method towards models, which include these selection regimes and where therefore fitness landscapes change with population state. We employ the same kind of curves Levins used: trade-off curves and fitness contours. However, fitness contours are not fixed but a function of the resident traits and we only consider those that divide the trait space into potentially successful mutants and mutants which are not able to invade ('invasion boundaries'). The developed approach allows to make a priori predictions about evolutionary endpoints and about their bifurcations. This is illustrated by applying the approach to several examples from the recent literature. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO ECOGRAPHY

ID XYLEM CAVITATION; SEED DISPERSAL; DYNAMICS; PATTERN
AB Spatial patterns are important to many ecological processes, and scale is a critical component of both patterns and processes. I examined the pattern and scale of the spatial distribution of infection of host plants by the desert mistletoe, Phoradendron californicum, in a landscape that spans several square kilometers. I also studied the relationship between mistletoe infection and seed dispersal. I found elevated seed rain in areas with a high prevalence of mistletoes and I found that a greater proportion of trees receive seeds than are infected, suggesting that mistletoes will be aggregated in space. Using nested analysis of variance and variograms, I found that mistletoe infections were distributed in hierarchical patches. Mistletoes were aggregated within trees and mistletoe prevalence was correlated at scales of <1500 m, and at scales >4000 m. Patterns at the largest scales were correlated with elevation: sites at higher elevations showed reduced mistletoe infection compared to those at lower elevations. I propose that at small scales, mistletoe distributions are primarily the result of aggregation of seed-dispersing birds, and that the elevational effect could reflect the recent colonization of higher elevations by the mistletoes' mesquite hosts or the limits of the mistletoes' physiological tolerance to freezing-induced cavitation.

AB A three-step protocol described elsewhere is used to obtain a map of butterfly species density in Portugal on a 50x50 km grid. First, all available faunistic information was compiled and analysed to explore the historic patterns of butterfly sampling in Portugal, and to determine which grid cells are sufficiently prospected to produce reliable estimates of species richness. Then, we relate the estimated species richness scores from these areas to a set of environmental and spatial variables by means of General Linear Models, obtaining a function to extrapolate of species density scores to the rest of Portugal. Finally, the model is validated, results explored and outliers identified and deleted. Any spatial autocorrelation remaining in the residuals is examined. Lastly, model parameters are recalculated in absence of deleted outliers, and the resulting function is used to predict species richness scores throughout mainland Portugal. A highly-predictive function based on some variables previously related to butterfly composition at macro-scale, such as number of sunny days per year, temperature or environmental heterogeneity, was obtained. However, in Portugal those variables are highly spatially structured along a steep latitudinal gradient, leading to difficulty in ascertaining if the latitudinal gradient detected by our analysis is due to macroecological or historic effects. Information on European and Iberian butterfly assemblages and causal processes are discussed in the light of the patterns observed. Then, previous information obtained on Portuguese scarabs is added to identify conservation areas, biogeographically important for both insect groups. Finally, the main drawbacks and advantages of this approach to mapping biodiversity for conservation are discussed briefly.

AB Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were used to study depth variation in terrestrial particulate organic matter (POM) sedimentation off the mouth of the Rhone River delta, and its use by the main benthic invertebrates (polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms) and flatfishes (Arnoglossus laterna, Buglossidium luteum and Solea solea). Coastal water POM and surface sediment exhibited low delta(13)C values, denoting dominance of terrestrial material in their carbon pools (25 to 80% and >50%, respectively), but the importance of river input differed as a function of depth. Terrestrial organic matter contribution to the total POM was greatest at 30-50 m (72 to 99%), and least at 70-100 in depth (25 to 77%). Most of the invertebrate groups studied (delta(13)C = -24.5 to -17.5parts per thousand; delta(15)N = 4.3 to 9.7parts per thousand) mainly relied on marine primary production irrespective of depth. However, deposit-feeding polychaetes mainly exploited terrestrial POM, and carnivorous and suspension-feeding polychaetes, bivalves, brachyurans and shrimps (Caridea) showed a partial uptake of terrestrial POM, depending on its availability. Incorporation of terrestrial POM by flatfishes (delta(13)C = -22.4 to -16.8parts per thousand; delta(15)N = 9.7 to 11.2parts per thousand.) was species- and depth-dependent. It was related not only to the fishes' diets but also to the trophic adaptability of their prey. S. solea, the main consumer of deposit-feeding polychaetes, showed the lowest VC irrespective of depth, but flatfish exploitation of terrestrial POM peaked at 30-50 m, where both polychaete consumption by fishes and terrestrial POM use by the benthos were maximal. Unlike most estuarine systems, terrestrial inputs in deltaic areas can therefore peak at intermediate depths, where some of the marine macrobenthos, including flatfishes, efficiently exploit them. These results allow better assessment of the role of river input to marine coastal zones in increasing fish abundance, and will therefore be of major interest for demersal fisheries management off deltaic areas.

AB Invasive plants are often more vigorous in novel habitats than in their native ranges. Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) is a major invader of habitats in the southern United States. Long-term common garden experiments in Texas and Hawaii (USA) with S. sebiferant genotypes from its native range (Asia) and from areas in North America where it is invasive suggest that post-introduction evolutionary changes may contribute to its invasiveness in Texas. In Texas, where there was uniformly low herbivory, fast-growing, poorly defended invasive North American genotypes outperformed slower growing, better defended native Asian genotypes in common garden plots. In Hawaii, in contrast, an Asian herbivore, Adoretus sinicus (Chinese rose beetle) is abundant, and S. sebiferum is not invasive. In Hawaiian common garden plots, A. sinicus caused greater damage to North American genotypes, and Asian genotypes were competitively superior. Our results suggest that exotic plants freed from herbivory can evolve greater competitive ability, allowing them to become much more abundant than in their native ranges. This did not seem to occur, though, if herbivores from the native range were abundant.

The chances for redundant gene sequences to evolve new functions are small compared with the probability that the copies become disabled by deleterious mutations. Functional divergence after gene duplication can result in two alternative evolutionary fates: one copy acquires a novel function (neofunctionalization), or each copy adopts part of the tasks of their parental gene (subfunctionalization). The relative prevalence of each outcome is unknown. Similarly unknown is the relative importance of positive selection versus random fixation of neutral mutations. Aldehyde oxidase (Ao) and xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh) genes encode two complex members of the xanthine oxidase family of molybdo-flavoenzymes that carry different functions. Ao is known to have originated from a duplicate of an Xdh gene in eukaryotes, before the origin of multicellularity. We show that (i) Ao evolved independently twice from two different Xdh paralogs, the second time in the chordates, before the diversification of vertebrates; (h) after each duplication, the Ao duplicate underwent a period of rapid evolution during which identical sites across the two molecules, involving the flavin adenine dinucleotide and substrate-binding pockets, were subjected to intense positive Darwinian selection; and (iii) the second Ao gene likely endured two periods of redundancy, initially as a duplicate of Xdh and later as a functional equivalent of the old Ao, which is currently absent from the vertebrate genome. Caution is appropriate in structural genomics when using sequence similarity for assigning protein function.

AB Insertions and deletions (indels) in chloroplast noncoding regions are common genetic markers to estimate population structure and gene flow, although relatively little is known about indel evolution among recently diverged lineages such as within plant families. Because indel events tend to occur nonrandomly along DNA sequences, recurrent mutations may generate homoplasy for indel haplotypes. This is a potential problem for population studies, because indel haplotypes may be shared among populations after recurrent mutation as well as gene flow. Furthermore, indel haplotypes may differ in fitness and therefore be subject to natural selection detectable as rate heterogeneity among lineages. Such selection could contribute to the spatial patterning of cpDNA haplotypes, greatly complicating the interpretation of cpDNA population structure. This study. examined both nucleotide and indel cpDNA variation and divergence at six noncoding regions (psbB-psbH, atpB-rbcL, trnL-trnH, rpl20-5'rpsl2, trnS-trnG, and trnH-psbA) in 16 individuals from eight species in the Lecythidaceae and a Sapotaceae outgroup. We described patterns of cpDNA changes, assessed the level of indel homoplasy, and tested for rate heterogeneity among lineages and regions. Although regression analysis of branch lengths suggested some degree of indel homoplasy among the most divergent lineages, there was little evidence for indel homoplasy within the Lecythidaceae. Likelihood ratio tests applied to the entire phylogenetic tree revealed a consistent pattern rejecting a molecular clock. Tajima's 1D and 2D tests revealed two taxa with consistent rate heterogeneity, one showing relatively more and one relatively fewer changes than other taxa. In general, nucleotide changes showed more evidence of rate heterogeneity than did indel changes. The rate of evolution was highly variable among the six cpDNA regions examined, with the trnS-trnG and trnH-psbA regions showing as much as 10% and 15% divergence within the Lecythidaceae. Deviations from rate homogeneity in the two taxa were constant across cpDNA regions, consistent with lineage-specific rates of evolution rather than cpDNA region-specific natural selection. There is no evidence that indels are more likely than nucleotide changes to experience homoplasy within the Lecythidaceae. These results support a neutral interpretation of cpDNA indel and nucleotide variation in population studies within species such as Corythophora alta.

AB Historical and modern migrations and dispersal of most marine organisms (intertidal, benthic, meiofaunal, planktonic, nektonic, or neustonic) are classically interpreted in terms of their natural dispersal potential. Exceptions are introduced species, largely recognized since the 19th century, known to have been transported by human activities. However, humans were transporting species along coastlines and across oceans for millennia and centuries prior to the advent of the first biological surveys. Thus, the presumptive natural distributions of many species may be questioned. Reviewed here are some basic concepts about invasions of non-native species. Human activities move species isolated in time and space from other oceans or continents, and thus human-mediated transport does not simply speed up natural dispersal processes. Both past and modern-day invasions are often overlooked, leading to an underestimation of the scale of invasion diversity and impact. Because vectors, donor regions, and recipient regions change over time, invasions will continue along long-standing but un-managed corridors. The impact of most invasions has never been studied and, therefore, it is not possible to conclude that most invasions have no impact, nor is it generally possible to say that invasions have become 'integrated' into a community or ecosystem in ecological time. Finally, invasions in the ocean are not limited to harbours and ports, but are found in a wide variety of marine habitats, ranging from the open ocean continental shelf to exposed rocky shores. The existence of human-mediated vectors has created extraordinary challenges to our understanding and interpretation of the ecology, biogeography, evolutionary biology, and conservation biology of marine communities.

AB 1 Early in growth, plant populations subjected to heterogeneous conditions can achieve significantly higher yields than populations grown in homogeneous conditions that provide the same amount of nutrients. We hypothesized that this yield enhancement would be ephemeral, and that yields of populations grown under different patterns of nutrient supply will converge as time passes. We also predicted that plant size frequency distributions will continue to differ between populations in heterogeneous and homogeneous conditions, that spatial patterns of mortality will differ, and that greater mortality will occur in populations under heterogeneous conditions. An experiment was carried out on Cardamine hirsuta to test these hypotheses.
   2 The experiment was harvested after 60 days, when flowering had begun in all populations. At this time, populations grown with the same nutrient supply but different patterns of supply did not differ in yield. Populations grown at higher nutrient levels had greater yields but suffered more mortality.
   3 In heterogeneous conditions, plants in nutrient-rich locations were larger than plants in nutrient-poor locations, and larger than plants in identical positions in populations growing under homogeneous conditions. Plants in nutrient-rich patches in heterogeneous treatments suffered more mortality than plants in nutrient-poor patches. Contrary to prediction, total mortality at all levels of nutrient supply was significantly higher in populations in homogeneous conditions.
   4 Coefficient of variation in shoot sizes was higher in populations at higher nutrient levels, but unaffected by pattern of nutrient supply. CV of root mass per unit of substrate was greater under heterogeneous than homogeneous conditions.
   5 Frequency distributions of shoot size, and root mass per unit of substrate, were strikingly different between populations grown under different patterns of nutrient supply. The differences are interpreted as showing that under homogeneous conditions all parts of the habitat are heavily exploited, giving rise to uniformly high levels of interplant competition. In contrast, nutrient-poor patches in the heterogeneous treatments contain low root masses. Plants in these patches remain small, but have a high probability of survival. We propose that these differences in intensity of habitat occupation, and presumably in competition, explain the lower mortality in populations growing under heterogeneous conditions.

AB The broadening of fisheries management to include ecosystem-related objectives raises a potentially confusing range of possible issues for consideration in management decisions, in reporting and in assessing management performance. However, there are methods available and approaches to addressing the issues that are practical, accessible to stakeholder participation and scientifically assessable. Three broad and interrelated elements are described that allow ecosystem objectives to be practically and operationally incorporated into marine fisheries management systems.
   Reporting and assessment of the whole management system against sustainability objectives
   Three major points are developed and emphasized:
   1. Indicators and reference points - and consequently performance measures - must relate explicitly to the high-level objectives of management.
   2. The structure and focus of reports on sustainability must be derived transparently from the high-level objectives. A methodology for this is described that can be used in meetings with stakeholders to elucidate the issues, indicators and reference points, management response and the justification for decisions. It can include risk-based methods to help identify the relative importance of different issues.
   3. Performance assessment must be of the management system as a whole, rather than solely on the merits of particular parts in isolation. An established methodology (management strategy evaluation) is described that can be used to test quantitatively the likely performance of different management strategies in achieving ecosystem objectives. A management strategy in this context is a combination of monitoring, use of the monitoring data for assessment against reference points, identification of appropriate management measures and implementation of these measures. This methodology can be used to test any aspect of the strategy in the 'common currency'of the management objectives, and to identify the circumstances in which particular strategies are likely to perform well or fail. It has already been used in fisheries in relation to target species, important by-catch species, predator-prey dependencies and seabed habitats.
   Indicators, reference points and performance measures for fisheries ecosystem objectives
   There are many options available, and some recent summaries are identified. A set of target and limit reference points for fisheries ecosystem objectives are provided. These are based broadly on experience to date, and could be practically implemented in the short term. It is not claimed that these reference points are necessary or adequate to achieve sustainability for fisheries and marine ecosystems. Rather, they represent a practical and emerging 'best practice' means of operationally accommodating ecosystem-related objectives in fisheries management.
   Use of marine protected areas to achieve ecosystem objectives in fisheries management
   Fisheries have long used some forms of spatial management, such as closure of nursery areas to protect juvenile fish, but more recently there has been a focus on use of marine protected areas (MPAs) to achieve fishery objectives for the target species and for the ecosystem more generally.
   MPAs hold promise as a rational and practical way of managing ocean resources to achieve fishery ecosystem objectives, although this promise should not be overstated. MPAs are best seen as part of a collection of management tools and measures, with a combination of on-reserve and off-reserve measures being used together to achieve sustainable fisheries and marine ecosystems. Several new technological developments are making their design and management more practical. These recent developments are reviewed.

AB Resource allocation within individuals may often be hierarchical, and this may have important effects on genetic correlations and on trait evolution. For example, organisms may divide energy between reproduction and somatic growth and then subdivide reproductive resources. Genetic variation in allocation to pathways early in such hierarchies (e. g., reproduction) can cause positive genetic correlations between traits that trade off (e. g., offspring size and number) because some individuals invest more resources in reproduction than others. We used quantitative-genetic models to explore the evolutionary implications of allocation hierarchies. Our results showed that when variation in allocation early in the hierarchy exceeds subsequent variation in allocation, genetic covariances and initial responses to selection do not reflect trade-offs occurring at later levels in the hierarchy. This general pattern was evident for many starting allocations and optima and for whether traits contributed multiplicatively or additively to fitness. Finally, artificial selection on a single trait revealed masked trade-offs when variation in early allocation was comparable to subsequent variation in allocation. This result confirms artificial selection as a powerful, but not foolproof, method of detecting trade-offs. Thus, allocation hierarchies can profoundly affect life-history evolution by causing traits to evolve in the opposite direction to that predicted by trade-offs.

AB Multivariate analyses are used widely for determining patterns of assemblage structure, inferring species-environment relationships and assessing human impacts on ecosystems. The estimation of ecological patterns often depends on sampling effort, so the degree to which sampling effort affects the outcome of multivariate analyses is a concern. We examined the effect of sampling effort on site and group separation, which was measured using a mean similarity method. Two similarity measures, the Jaccard Coefficient and Bray-Curtis Index were investigated with 1 benthic macroinvertebrate and 2 fish data sets. Site separation was significantly improved with increased sampling effort because the similarity between replicate samples of a site increased more rapidly than between sites. Similarly, the faster increase in similarity between sites of the same group than between sites of different groups caused clearer separation between groups. The strength of site and group separation completely stabilized only when the mean similarity between replicates reached 1. These results are applicable to commonly used multivariate techniques such as cluster analysis and ordination because these multivariate techniques start with a similarity matrix. Completely stable outcomes of multivariate analyses are not feasible. Instead, we suggest 2 criteria for estimating the stability of multivariate analyses of assemblage data: 1) mean within-site similarity across all sites compared, indicating sample representativeness, and 2) the SD of within-site similarity across sites, measuring sample comparability.

AB Diet-tissue isotopic fractionation of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isocop" in short- and longer-term diet integrators of diet (i.e. blood serum and red cells), that involve non-invasive sampling techniques was examined using three species of phocid seals (harbor seals, gray seals, and harp seals) fed a known diet. Variability in diet-tissue fractionation values within and between species was also scrutinized to determine the legitimacy of using values obtained from one species to explore trophic positions and diets of other related species. All captive seals raised on a constant diet had tissues enriched in C-13 and N-15 relative to their diet. Diet-tissue isotopic fractionation values were generally consistent among conspecifics and among phocid species for a given tissue. Trophic isotopic enrichment in C-13 was significantly higher in red blood cells (+1.5 parts per thousand than in blood serum (+0.8parts per thousand), whereas the reverse was observed fur nitrogen isotopes (+1.7parts per thousand in red cells vs. +3.1parts per thousand in serum). However, C-13-depleted lipids were not extracted from blood tissues in this study. This results in a downward bias in the diet-tissue fractionation factors for carbon for both red cells and blood serum, particularly the latter because of their significantly higher lipid contents ((x) over bar +/- SD = 4.6 +/- 2.3%; n = 20; red blood cells 3.8 +/- 0.9parts per thousand; n = 50, muscle 7.7 +/- 2.0; n = 21) in marine mammals.

AB Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) is a nonindigenous invasive species characterized by prolific growth and abundance in marshy and riparian habitats across North America. Given its invasive success. we hypothesized this species may require less energy and/or use energy more efficiently for biomass construction than co-occurring noninvasive plant species. We measured leaf construction cost (CC), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), and leaf organic nitrogen and carbon content of L salicaria and the five most abundant cooccurring species, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Erigeron philadelphicus, Asclepias syriaca, Spiraea latifolia, and Solidago graminifolia, along dammed ponds in the Black Rock Forest, Cornwall, New York, USA. Lythrum salicaria. which was highly abundant (2.52 individuals/m(2)), exhibited significantly lower area-based leaf CC (44.47 +/- 4.24 g glucose/m(2) leaf) than relatively less abundant species, suggesting energetics may influence its invasive success. Conversely, least abundant Solidago graminifolia (0.67 individuals/m(2)) exhibited the significantly highest leaf CC per unit leaf area (141.87 +/- 39.21 g glucose/m(2) leaf). Overall, a negative correlation between species abundance and area-based leaf CC (r(2) = 0.73) indicated low energy requirements and/or high energy efficiency may influence relative abundance in the plant species studied. As it correlates with species abundance in this study, CC may be a useful tool for evaluating invasive potential.

AB We investigated the long-term effects of shifting cultivation on soil phosphorus pools to understand the effects of repeated intense disturbance on nutrient cycling in rain forests and to assess the sustainability of a widespread tropical agricultural system. We studied 24 sites that formed a gradient of cultivation history near a village in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, where long-fallow shifting cultivation has been practiced for at least 200 yr. The sites, including primary forest, had undergone 0-10 prior cycles (each similar to 20 yr) of cultivation and forest regrowth. The number of swidden-fallow cycles experienced at a given site was determined through interviews. Using sequential chemical extraction of surface soils, we inferred changes in the distribution and availability of soil phosphorus during 200 yr of shifting cultivation. We examined the relative importance of fire vs. secondary forest biota in mediating the changes observed by heating soils in the laboratory to simulate the conditions of a slash fire and assessing data on root presence by depth.
   Over the first four cycles (similar to 80 yr), total phosphorus in the top 30 cm of soil increased by a mean of 73 kg(.)ha(-1)-cycle(-1) (3.7 kg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1)), much of it in the organic NaOH-extractable and the inorganic, concentrated HCl-extractable, fractions. Accounting for differences in original site fertility, total P did not change significantly over 2-10 cycles (similar to 200 yr), but the distribution shifted from both available and highly recalcitrant inorganic forms to available organic and occluded inorganic forms. NaOH-P-i decreased from 28% to 13%, and residual P decreased from 30% to 10% of total P. In contrast, NaOH-P-o increased from 13% to 26%, and cHCI-P-i increased from 15% to 40%.
   The significant increase in soil organic phosphorus in combination with greater concentrations of fine roots deep in the soil profile suggest that deep-rooting fallow vegetation, rather than fire, is responsible for increasing, and maintaining, total phosphorus. The magnitude of changes induced by the fire are not great enough to account for the increases observed over several cycles, especially considering coincidental losses. Despite losses of nonoccluded P-i, we believe the availability of phosphorus may have been enhanced over 200 yr due to an increase in the stable organic phosphorus fraction. Long-fallow shifting cultivation, as practiced in West Kalimantan, can continue to support rural populations for some time.

AB Environmental factors influencing the occurrence of single species and multi species groups of carabids in alluvial forest at the River Elbe were determined with habitat suitability models. Two representative species for different ecotypes present in the investigated community, Agonum livens and Pterostichus oblongopunctatus, were defined by means of a discriminant analysis. The two species differed greatly in their microhabitat distribution. Agonum livens was chosen as target species for a multi species group of wetland species that inhabited the fringes of temporary waters in the forest. In contrast, P. oblongopunctatus should represent species of deciduous forests. Using stepwise multiple logistic regression statistically significant habitat suitability models were estimated, reliably predicting the species' occurrence. A subsequent evaluation by cross-validations and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated a high discriminatory power. A transfer of the model onto different data sets in time was applied to validate the model. Alternatively, a multi species habitat model, taking into account weighted occurrence data of the wetland species group, was estimated. In order to show that the chosen target species truly holds an umbrella effect upon the represented multi species group, we used ROC curves to indicate the transferability of the target species' habitat model for the multi species group and vice versa.

AB We estimated the need for nature reserves to maintain forest biodiversity in Sweden. Using habitat-loss thresholds for long-term survival of resident vertebrate "umbrella" species, and differences in forest disturbance regimes, we estimated the long-term protection in four biogeographic regions. No reserve need was assumed for forest environments that can be emulated by normal management. The estimates of the long-term need of reserves ranged from 9% (northern Sweden) to 16% southernmost Sweden) and was divided into: (1) existing protected forests (1.6-0.6%): (2) estimated benefits for biodiversity of special forest management (0.7-0%): (3) existing unprotected forests with high conservation value (3.5-1.9%). The remaining areas required to satisfy the long-term reserve goal were cultural landscape habitats (0-2.2%), as well as land for habitat restoration and re-creation (3-11%). Our analysis suggests that it is urgent to maintain all remnants of natural forests and cultural landscape habitats, but that forest protection alone is insufficient to maintain forest biodiversity.

AB To study zebra finch allocation of energy to day and night at two different workloads, we assessed the daily energy turnover from: (1) metabolizable energy of the food, and (2) doubly-labeled water. In both experiments we imposed two levels of activity on captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), by applying different computer-controlled workload schedules. A low workload required 20 hops, and a high workload 40 hops to obtain 10 s access to food. In experiment 1, we further measured nocturnal energy expenditure by overnight oxygen consumption. From experiment 2 we derived an estimate of the costs of hopping activity, from inter-individual association of daily amount of hopping and daily energy expenditure. Surprisingly, the daily energy budget was, on average, reduced slightly when birds were subjected to a high workload. Since hopping activity was 50% higher during the high workload than during the low workload, the birds apparently compensated, even over-compensated, for the increased energetic demands of activity. Nocturnal energy expenditure was indeed reduced for the high workload, which was largely due to a reduction in resting metabolic rate. Economizing on energy was more than could have been accomplished by a reduction in mass alone, and we discuss the occurrence and potential mechanisms of physiological compensation. The amount of energy saved during the night did account for part of the total amount of energy saved. We surmise that the strategy of energetic compensation observed during the night was extended into the inactive hours of the day.

AB To examine the existence and behavior of a seedling bank, seedlings of sugar maple were censused for 24 years in a mixed-hardwood forest in central New York State. Each year we measured the heights of all sugar maple seedlings (individually-marked) in permanent plots. The population of seedlings persisted through time, with little net upward growth, in the shade. This seedling bank was maintained both by recruitment of new seedlings and by low annual mortality, with some sugar maple seedlings surviving > 30 years at < 1 m height. In an experimental canopy gap, long-suppressed sugar maple seedlings responded with substantial height growth. Thus, sugar maple exhibited the three defining characteristics for a seedling bank: a narrow range of heights in the shade, persistence in the shade, and retention of the capacity to grow rapidly upward once light availability increased.

AB 1. Our aim was to quantify the effects of a warmer winter climate on the egg mortality (and, consequently, the risk of an outbreak) of Epirrita autumnata, a serious defoliator of mountain birch.
   2, The egg survival of E. autumnata was studied in northernmost Finland from 1993 to 1996, when minimum temperatures were also recorded. Utilizing a digital elevation map with a GIS (Geographical Information System), models were developed for egg survival and minimum temperature, taking into account altitude, local topography and temperatures at a meteorological station-in the study area.
   3. Areas of high egg mortality of E. autumnata can be modelled in the GIS with reasonable accuracy by the model describing areal distribution of minimum winter temperatures, taking account of the fact that the critical limit for egg survival of E. autumnata in midwinter is about -35.5 degrees C. The approach can be applied in short-term forecasting of outbreak areas when previous year population densities and minimum winter temperatures at meteorological stations are known.
   4. In our study area, from 1961 to 1991 more than one-third of the years were egg-killing winters in the mixed birch-pine forests zone, and 15% of years in the birch forest zone. In order for an outbreak to take place, at least three consecutive seasons with a high population growth rate are needed; in the mixed birch-pine forests the possibilities of an E. autumnata outbreak during the period 1961-91 were very rare, while in the birch forest zone outbreak possibilities were also noticeably restricted by winter minimum temperatures.
   5, If winter warming takes place according to the scenarios presented, by the middle of the next century the birch-growing areas in our study area protected by low temperatures from outbreaks of E. autumnata will be only one-third as great as those of today, and by the end of the next century only one-tenth of those of today.
   6. The models and methods described in this paper can be applied to other ecological processes. The modelling strategies and techniques described here serve as intermediate tools for linking large scale climate models (general circulation models, GCMs) and ecological processes happening at a smaller scale.

AB Models of tree-soil-crop interactions in agroforestry should maintain a balance between dynamic processes and spatial patterns of interactions for common resources. We give an outline and discuss major assumptions underlying the WaNuLCAS model of water, nitrogen and light interactions in agroforestry systems. The model was developed to deal with a wide range of agroforestry systems: hedgerow intercropping on flat or sloping land, fallow-crop mosaics or isolated trees in parklands, with minimum parameter adjustments. Examples are presented for simulation runs of hedgerow intercropping systems at different hedgerow spacings and pruning regimes, a test of the safety-net function of deep tree roots, lateral interactions in crop-fallow mosaics and a first exploration for parkland systems with a circular geometry.

AB Intake rates of snow buntings feeding on artificial seed patches were measured at different bird densities, for each of two different seed densities. Interference occurred in the low seed-density treatment, with intake rates declining at high bird densities. However, interference was not found in the high seed-density treatment. The finding that the strength of interference may depend on resource density contradicts the hypothesis that the functional response is ratio-dependent (Arditi and Akcakaya 1990). The formulation for interference from Hassell and Varley (1969), and the models of Beddington (1975), Ruxton et al. (1992) and Holmgren (1995), also assume that the strength of interference is independent of resource density. The development of behaviour-based models that consider the relation between the intensity of interference, resource density and individual state may provide a more accurate description of the process of interference.

LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS
AB We discuss the question of how to quantify and analyse dynamics and patterns in spatially extended ecologies and introduce several new tools and ideas which use space-time dynamical structure. To illustrate our ideas, we introduce an artificial ecology model of a resource-predator-prey community which is interesting in its own right both ecologically and mathematically. This is a generalized probabilistic cellular automata. The model is stochastic and spatially non-homogeneous, We show hers to identify a spatial scale intermediate between the noise dominated microscale and the infinite size limit at which non-trivial determinism is maximized. This is the scale at which to measure the system's dynamics. At this stale the population dynamics are essentially deterministic, low-dimensional and chaotic. This allows us to characterize the complex spatial patterns by a low-dimensional vector. This mapping from spatial patterns to low dimensional vectors provides effective and faithful data compression and is a powerful technique for synthesizing ecological information. It facilitates new analytical techniques. As an application we consider how to distinguish structural change within an ecosystem from natural dynamics. Such change is detected by using our parameterization to construct recurrence plots. Other applications such as the reconstruction of the dynamics of invisible species are discussed elsewhere.

In this paper, estimates of soil nutrient availability and the inverse of litterfall nutrient concentrations (as an index of plant nutrient use) were compared, using data from 36 sites throughout the humid tropics, to determine if relationships exist between commonly used indices of nutrient cycling for plants and soils. Measures of both extractable and total soil P were significantly and positively correlated with the ratio of litterfall mass/P, particularly for montane tropical forests. Extractable soil P was also significantly correlated with litterfall mass for lowland humid tropical forests, explaining 58% of the variability in litterfall mass. A weak, albeit significant correlation was found between exchangeable soil Ca and litterfall mass/Ca, even though soil extraction techniques vary greatly. No significant relationship was found for total soil N, the most commonly measured soil N pool, and the inverse of litterfall N concentrations. The results suggest that our indices of soil P are related to litterfall processes, but that other measures, particularly total soil N, may not be as relevant to nutrient cycling by the vegetation.

AB The COVID-19 health disaster has had a dramatic impact on the global hospitality industry, affecting millions of people. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of job insecurity on hotel employees' anxiety and depression, and whether these psychological strains could influence employees' self-rated task performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also examine the moderating role of hotel employees' resilience in this context.
   The hypotheses were examined by collecting data from 353 hotel employees currently working in the Canary Islands (Spain). The results highlight the significant effects of job insecurity on employees' anxiety and depression levels. However, hotel employees' task performance was not affected by their job insecurity or by their anxiety and depression. In addition, employees' resilience has a moderating effect as it reduces the negative influence of job insecurity on depression. Finally, the discussion section sets out various theoretical and practical implications of the findings.

AB Synthesizing trait observations and knowledge across the Tree of Life remains a grand challenge for biodiversity science. Species traits are widely used in ecological and evolutionary science, and new data and methods have proliferated rapidly. Yet accessing and integrating disparate data sources remains a considerable challenge, slowing progress toward a global synthesis to integrate trait data across organisms. Trait science needs a vision for achieving global integration across all organisms. Here, we outline how the adoption of key Open Science principles-open data, open source and open methods-is transforming trait science, increasing transparency, democratizing access and accelerating global synthesis. To enhance widespread adoption of these principles, we introduce the Open Traits Network (OTN), a global, decentralized community welcoming all researchers and institutions pursuing the collaborative goal of standardizing and integrating trait data across organisms. We demonstrate how adherence to Open Science principles is key to the OTN community and outline five activities that can accelerate the synthesis of trait data across the Tree of Life, thereby facilitating rapid advances to address scientific inquiries and environmental issues. Lessons learned along the path to a global synthesis of trait data will provide a framework for addressing similarly complex data science and informatics challenges.
   A decentralized community is introduced that aims to standardize and integrate species trait data across organismal groups, based on principles of Open Science.

AB Arthropod predators and parasitoids attack crop pests, providing a valuable ecosystem service. The amount of noncrop habitat surrounding crop fields influences pest suppression, but synthesis of new studies suggests that the spatial configuration of crops and other habitats is similarly important. Natural enemies are often more abundant in fine-grained agricultural landscapes comprising smaller patches and can increase or decrease with the connectivity of crop fields to other habitats. Partitioning organisms by traits has emerged as a promising way to predict the strength and direction of these effects. Furthermore, our ability to predict configurational effects will depend on understanding the potential for indirect effects among trophic levels and the relationship between arthropod dispersal capability and the spatial scale of underlying landscape structure.

AB Community assembly of crop-associated fungi is thought to be strongly influenced by deterministic selection exerted by the plant host, rather than stochastic processes. Here we use a simple, sorghum system with abundant sampling to show that stochastic forces (drift or stochastic dispersal) act on fungal community assembly in leaves and roots early in host development and when sorghum is drought stressed, conditions when mycobiomes are small. Unexpectedly, we find no signal for stochasticity when drought stress is relieved, likely due to renewed selection by the host. In our experimental system, the host compartment exerts the strongest effects on mycobiome assembly, followed by the timing of plant development and lastly by plant genotype. Using a dissimilarity-overlap approach, we find a universality in the forces of community assembly of the mycobiomes of the different sorghum compartments and in functional guilds of fungi.

AB Assessing the impacts of land use/cover change (LUCC) on the aeolian process is crucial for improving regional ecosystem services and sustainable development. The objective of the study were to 1) examine the spatiotemporal patterns of the soil wind erosion modulus (SWEM) in China from 1990 to 2015, and 2) reveal the contributions of LUCC to SWEM dynamics. The annual SWEM derived by the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) was analyzed at regional and sub-regional scales using statistical analysis. The impacts of various LUCCs on SWEM were further assessed in each county. The results showed that the regions that experienced severe wind erosion (SWEM > 50 t/(ha.a)) accounted for 8.91% of all of China. The average SWEM generally decreased by half from 1990 to 2015. Large SWEM differences were found among various land use/cover types. The SWEM from desert was two times or higher than that from sparse grass, cropland, and woodland; moreover, that of dense grass was the lowest in arid/semiarid areas. The conversion of grassland/woodland to cropland and desert expansion during 1990-2000 induced a net increase in total soil wind erosion of approximately 1205 x 10(4)t. With the implementation of ecological projects starting in the early 2000s, woodland/grassland was reconverted from cropland, and the eco-restoration of sparse grass and desert induced a net decrease in wind erosion of 278 x 10(4)t. All these indicated that anthropogenic activities in ecological projects had positive impacts in terms of reducing aeolian erosion intensity. We suggest that ecorestoration should be protected and consolidated in the future. Adaptive management is required to control wind erosion and improve ecosystem services and human wellbeing for people in China. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Automated fault detection is an important part of a quality control system. It has the potential to increase the overall quality of monitored products and processes. The fault detection of automotive instrument cluster systems in computer-based manufacturing assembly lines is currently limited to simple boundary checking. The analysis of more complex nonlinear signals is performed manually by trained operators, whose knowledge is used to supervise quality checking and manual detection of faults. We present a novel approach for automated Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) based on deep learning. The approach was tested on data generated by computer-based manufacturing systems equipped with local and remote sensing devices. The results show that the approach models the different spatial/temporal patterns found in the data. The approach can successfully diagnose and locate multiple classes of faults under real-time working conditions. The proposed method is shown to outperform other established FDI methods.

AB Shearwaters and petrels (hereafter petrels) are highly adapted seabirds that occur across all the world's oceans. Petrels are a threatened seabird group comprising 124 species. They have bet-hedging life histories typified by extended chick rearing periods, low fecundity, high adult survival, strong philopatry, monogamy and long-term mate fidelity and are thus vulnerable to change. Anthropogenic alterations on land and at sea have led to a poor conservation status of many petrels with 52 (42%) threatened species based on IUCN criteria and 65 (52%) suffering population declines. Some species are well-studied, even being used as bioindicators of ocean health, yet for others there are major knowledge gaps regarding their breeding grounds, migratory areas or other key aspects of their biology and ecology. We assembled 38 petrel conservation researchers to summarize information regarding the most important threats according to the IUCN Red List of threatened species to identify knowledge gaps that must be filled to improve conservation and management of petrels. We highlight research advances on the main threats for petrels (invasive species at breeding grounds, bycatch, overfishing, light pollution, climate change, and pollution). We propose an ambitious goal to reverse at least some of these six main threats, through active efforts such as restoring island habitats (e.g., invasive species removal, control and prevention), improving policies and regulations at global and regional levels, and engaging local communities in conservation efforts.

AB There is a growing recognition that adaptation to climate change requires an understanding of social processes that unfold across extended temporal trajectories. Yet, despite a move to reconceptualise adaptation as 'pathways of change and response' with a deeper temporal dimension, the past generally remains poorly integrated into adaptation studies. This is related to a disavowal of environmental determinism within the academic field of history, which has caused the past to be addressed from other disciplinary perspectives within climate change literature, leading to accusations of over-simplification and neo-determinism. Conversely, whilst a relatively small amount of research within the subdiscipline of historical climatology has engaged with theories from mainstream adaptation to understand societies in the past, there has been little influence in the other direction.
   Building on a comprehensive review and critique of existing approaches to historical climate-society research, we argue for three important areas where historians should engage with climate change adaptation. The first area we call particularizing adaptation; this is the development of long-term empirical studies that uncover societal relations to climate in a particular place - including climate's cultural - dimensions which can provide a baseline and contextualisation for climate change adaptation options. The second, institutional path dependency and memory, argues for a focus on the evolution of formal institutions with a responsibility for adaptation, to understand how historical events and decisions inform and constrain practices today. Our third argument is for an appreciation of the history of ideas and concepts that underpin climate change adaptation. We call for a second-order observation observation of the observers - within climate change research, to ensure that adaptation does not perpetuate historically-grown power structures.

AB 1. Understanding the mechanisms that drive beta diversity (i.e. beta-diversity), an important aspect of regional biodiversity, remains a priority for ecological research. beta-diversity and its components can provide insights into the processes generating regional biodiversity patterns. We tested whether environmental filtering or dispersal related processes predominated along the stream watercourse by analysing the responses of taxonomic and functional diatom beta-diversity to environmental and spatial factors.
   2. We examined the variation in total beta-diversity and its components (turnover and nestedness) in benthic diatom species and ecological guilds (motile, planktonic, low-and high profile) with respect to watercourse position (up-, mid-and downstream) in 2,182 sites throughout France. We tested the effects of pure environmental and pure spatial factors on beta-diversity with partial Mantel tests. Environmental factors included eight physicochemical variables, while geographical distances between sites were used as spatial factors. We also correlated a and c-diversity, and the degree of nestedness (NODF metric) with environmental variables.
   3. Total beta-diversity and its turnover component displayed higher values upstream than mid-and downstream. The nestedness component exhibited low values, even when NODF values increased from up-to downstream. Pure environmental factors were highly significant for explaining total beta-diversity and turnover regardless of watercourse position, but pure spatial factors were mostly significant mid-and downstream, with geographical distance being positively correlated with beta-diversity. Across sites, nutrient enrichment decreased turnover but increased the degree of nestedness. Motile and low profile diatoms comprised the most abundant guilds, but their beta-diversity patterns varied in an opposite way. The lowest guild beta-diversity was observed upstream for low profile species, and downstream for motile species.
   4. In conclusion, environmental filtering seemed to play a major role in structuring metacommunities irrespective of site watercourse position. Filtering promoted strong turnover patterns, especially in disconnected upstream sites. The greater role of spatial factors mid-and downstream was consistent with mass effects rather than neutral processes because these sites had lower total beta-diversity than upstream sites. Motile species were most strongly affected by mass effects processes, whereas low profile species were primarily influenced by environmental conditions. Collectively, these findings suggest that partitioning of total beta-diversity into its components and the use of diatom ecological guilds provide a useful framework for assessing the mechanisms underlying metacommunity patterns along the stream watercourse.

AB Marine ecosystems evolve under many interconnected and area-specific pressures. To fulfil society's intensifying and diversifying needs while ensuring ecologically sustainable development, more effective marine spatial planning and broader-scope management of marine resources is necessary. Integrated ecological-economic fisheries models (IEEFMs) of marine systems are needed to evaluate impacts and sustainability of potential management actions and understand, and anticipate ecological, economic and social dynamics at a range of scales from local to national and regional. To make these models most effective, it is important to determine how model characteristics and methods of communicating results influence the model implementation, the nature of the advice that can be provided and the impact on decisions taken by managers. This article presents a global review and comparative evaluation of 35 IEEFMs applied to marine fisheries and marine ecosystem resources to identify the characteristics that determine their usefulness, effectiveness and implementation. The focus is on fully integrated models that allow for feedbacks between ecological and human processes although not all the models reviewed achieve that. Modellers must invest more time to make models user friendly and to participate in management fora where models and model results can be explained and discussed. Such involvement is beneficial to all parties, leading to improvement of mo-dels and more effective implementation of advice, but demands substantial resources which must be built into the governance process. It takes time to develop effective processes for using IEEFMs requiring a long-term commitment to integrating multidisciplinary modelling advice into management decision-making.

AB Rainfall reductions influence ecosystem processes through impacts on the microbial community. However, the response of soil microbial community and their interactions with ecosystem processes remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize the response of soil total microbial biomass and community composition to experimental rainfall reductions and the implications for soil carbon dynamics. The results showed that rainfall reductions significantly decreased soil total microbial biomass and bacterial abundance, but no significant effects on fungal abundance were observed. While, within bacterial and fungal groups, rainfall reductions only significantly influenced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi, but did not affect Gram-positive bacteria (GP), Gram-negative bacteria (GN), Actinomycetes, Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and other sequenced bacterial phyla. These contrasting responses suggested that rainfall reductions had major effects on total microbial biomass but minor effects on community compositions. Further analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of total microbial biomass responses were mainly explained by the size of rainfall reductions rather than the duration. Particularly, higher decreases in total microbial biomass were observed in sites where more rainfall was excluded. Reductions in total microbial biomass were larger in forests with higher aridity index (AI) than in grass/shrublands with lower AI, and stronger reductions in microbial biomass were observed at higher mean annual precipitation (MAP)/sites with higher AI. Moreover, both soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil respiration (SR) significantly declined under reduced rainfall experiments arid had positive relationships with changes in total microbial biomass, especially in humid lands (AI >= 0.65). The microbial responses to aridity levels indicated that soil carbon in humid lands may be highly susceptible to future drought scenarios. This meta-analysis highlighted the importance of considering the size of rainfall reductions and aridity levels when modeling and projecting soil carbon dynamics.

TI Scientific research on animal biodiversity is systematically biased
   towards vertebrates and temperate regions
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SURROGATES; FLAGSHIPS; UMBRELLAS; TAXA
AB Over the last 25 years, research on biodiversity has expanded dramatically, fuelled by increasing threats to the natural world. However, the number of published studies is heavily weighted towards certain taxa, perhaps influencing conservation awareness of and funding for less-popular groups. Few studies have systematically quantified these biases, although information on this topic is important for informing future research and conservation priorities. We investigated: i) which animal taxa are being studied; ii) if any taxonomic biases are the same in temperate and tropical regions; iii) whether the taxon studied is named in the title of papers on biodiversity, perhaps reflecting a perception of what biodiversity is; iv) the geographical distribution of biodiversity research, compared with the distribution of biodiversity and threatened species; and v) the geographical distribution of authors' countries of origin. To do this, we used the search engine Web of Science to systematically sample a subset of the published literature with 'biodiversity' in the title. In total 526 research papers were screened-5% of all papers in Web of Science with biodiversity in the title. For each paper, details on taxonomic group, title phrasing, number of citations, study location, and author locations were recorded. Compared to the proportions of described species, we identified a considerable taxonomic weighting towards vertebrates and an under-representation of invertebrates (particularly arachnids and insects) in the published literature. This discrepancy is more pronounced in highly cited papers, and in tropical regions, with only 43% of biodiversity research in the tropics including invertebrates. Furthermore, while papers on vertebrate taxa typically did not specify the taxonomic group in the title, the converse was true for invertebrate papers. Biodiversity research is also biased geographically: studies are more frequently carried out in developed countries with larger economies, and for a given level of species or threatened species, tropical countries were understudied relative to temperate countries. Finally, biodiversity research is disproportionately authored by researchers from wealthier countries, with studies less likely to be carried out by scientists in lower-GDP nations. Our results highlight the need for a more systematic and directed evaluation of biodiversity studies, perhaps informing more targeted research towards those areas and taxa most depauperate in research. Only by doing so can we ensure that biodiversity research yields results that are relevant and applicable to all regions and that the information necessary for the conservation of threatened species is available to conservation practitioners.

AB The increasing availability of large genomic data sets as well as the advent of Bayesian phylogenetics facilitates the investigation of phylogenetic incongruence, which can result in the impossibility of representing phylogenetic relationships using a single tree. While sometimes considered as a nuisance, phylogenetic incongruence can also reflect meaningful biological processes as well as relevant statistical uncertainty, both of which can yield valuable insights in evolutionary studies. We introduce a new tool for investigating phylogenetic incongruence through the exploration of phylogenetic tree landscapes. Our approach, implemented in the R package treespace, combines tree metrics and multivariate analysis to provide low-dimensional representations of the topological variability in a set of trees, which can be used for identifying clusters of similar trees and group-specific consensus phylogenies. treespace also provides a user-friendly web interface for interactive data analysis and is integrated alongside existing standards for phylogenetics. It fills a gap in the current phylogenetics toolbox in R and will facilitate the investigation of phylogenetic results.

AB Ambiguous empirical support for landscapes of fear' in natural systems may stem from failure to consider dynamic temporal changes in predation risk. The lunar cycle dramatically alters night-time visibility, with low luminosity increasing hunting success of African lions. We used camera-trap data from Serengeti National Park to examine nocturnal anti-predator behaviours of four herbivore species. Interactions between predictable fluctuations in night-time luminosity and the underlying risk-resource landscape shaped herbivore distribution, herding propensity and the incidence of relaxed' behaviours. Buffalo responded least to temporal risk cues and minimised risk primarily through spatial redistribution. Gazelle and zebra made decisions based on current light levels and lunar phase, and wildebeest responded to lunar phase alone. These three species avoided areas where likelihood of encountering lions was high and changed their behaviours in risky areas to minimise predation threat. These patterns support the hypothesis that fear landscapes vary heterogeneously in both space and time.

AB Background: Inaccurate estimates of phylogenetic signal may mislead interpretations of many ecological and evolutionary processes, and hence understanding where potential sources of uncertainty may lay has become a priority for comparative studies. Importantly, the sensitivity of phylogenetic signal indices and their associated statistical tests to incompletely resolved phylogenies and suboptimal branch-length information has been only partially investigated.
   Methods: Here, we use simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees to assess whether incompletely resolved phylogenies (polytomic chronograms) and phylogenies with suboptimal branch-length information (pseudochronograms) could produce directional biases in significance tests ( p-values) associated with Blomberg et al.'s K and Pagel's lambda (lambda) statistics, two of the most widely used indices to measure and test phylogenetic signal. Specifically, we conducted pairwise comparisons between the p-values resulted from the use of "true" chronograms and their degraded counterparts (i. e. polytomic chronograms and pseudo-chronograms), and computed the frequency with which the null hypothesis of no phylogenetic signal was accepted using "true" chronograms but rejected when using their degraded counterparts ( type I bias) and vice versa ( type II bias).
   Results: We found that the use of polytomic chronograms in combination with Blomberg et al.'s K resulted in both, clearly inflated estimates of phylogenetic signal and moderate levels of type I and II biases. More importantly, pseudo-chronograms led to high rates of type I biases. In contrast, Pagel's. was strongly robust to either incompletely resolved phylogenies and suboptimal branch-length information.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that pseudo-chronograms can lead to strong overestimation of phylogenetic signal when using Blomberg et al.'s K ( i. e. high rates of type I biases), while polytomies may be a minor concern given other sources of uncertainty. In contrast, Pagel's lambda seems strongly robust to either incompletely resolved phylogenies and suboptimal branch-length information. Hence, Pagel's lambda may be a more appropriate alternative over Blomberg et al.'s K to measure and test phylogenetic signal in most ecologically relevant traits when phylogenetic information is incomplete.

AB Outdoor recreation is increasing in intensity and space. Areas previously inaccessible are now being visited by ever-growing numbers of people, which increases human-wildlife encounters across habitats. This has raised concern among researchers and conservationists as, even in non-aggressive encounters, animals often perceive humans as predators and mount physiological and behavioural responses that can have negative consequences. However, despite all the research in recent decades, not many general patterns have emerged, especially at the level of populations, and many studies have yielded seemingly contradictory or inconclusive results. We argue that this is partly due to incomplete knowledge of the number and complexity of factors that may modulate the responses of animals. Thus, we aim to provide a conceptual approach intended to highlight the reasons that make it difficult to detect general patterns. We present a comprehensive compilation of factors modulating animal responses to humans at increasing levels (from sensory detection and immediate behavioural and physiological reactions, to changes in fitness and population trends), which may help understanding the uncertainty in the patterns. We observed that there are many modulating factors, which can be categorized as reflecting characteristics of the recreational activity itself (e.g. intensity of human presence), of the animals concerned (e.g. age or antipredatory strategy), and of the spatio-temporal context (e.g. habitat or timing of the encounter). Some factors appear to have non-linear and complex effects, which, if not considered, may lead to erroneous conclusions. Finally, we conclude that the difficulty in finding general patterns will be amplified at higher levels (i.e. at the level of populations), since as we proceed from one level to the next, the number of potential modulating factors accumulates, adding noise and obscuring direct associations between recreation and wildlife. More comprehensive knowledge about which (and how) factors affect animal responses across levels will certainly improve future research design and interpretation, and thus, our understanding of human recreational impacts on wildlife.

AB Understanding how anthropogenic landscape alteration affects populations of ecologically-and economically-important insect pollinators has never been more pressing. In this context, the assessment of landscape quality typically relies on spatial distribution studies, but, whether habitat-restoration techniques actually improve the health of targeted pollinator populations remains obscure. This gap could be filled by a comprehensive understanding of how gradients of landscape quality influence pollinator physiology. We therefore used this approach for honey bees (Apis mellifera) to test whether landscape patterns can shape bee health. We focused on the pre-wintering period since abnormally high winter colony losses have often been observed. By exposing colonies to different landscapes, enriched in melliferous catch crops and surrounded by semi-natural habitats, we found that bee physiology (i.e. fat body mass and level of vitellogenin) was significantly improved by the presence of flowering catch crops. Catch crop presence was associated with a significant increase in pollen diet diversity. The influence of semi-natural habitats on bee health was even stronger. Vitellogenin level was in turn significantly linked to higher overwintering survival. Therefore, our experimental study, combining landscape ecology and bee physiology, offers an exciting proof-of-concept for directly identifying stressful or suitable landscapes and promoting efficient pollinator conservation.

AB The rates of anthropogenic climate change substantially exceed those at which forest ecosystems - dominated by immobile, long-lived organisms - are able to adapt. The resulting maladaptation of forests has potentially detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, as many forest-dwelling species are highly dependent on the prevailing tree species, a delayed response of the latter to a changing climate can contribute to an extinction debt and mask climate-induced biodiversity loss. However, climate change will likely also intensify forest disturbances. Here, we tested the hypothesis that disturbances foster the reorganization of ecosystems and catalyze the adaptation of forest composition to climate change. Our specific objectives were (i) to quantify the rate of autonomous forest adaptation to climate change, (ii) examine the role of disturbance in the adaptation process, and (iii) investigate spatial differences in climate-induced species turnover in an unmanaged mountain forest landscape (Kalkalpen National Park, Austria). Simulations with a process-based forest landscape model were performed for 36 unique combinations of climate and disturbance scenarios over 1000 years. We found that climate change strongly favored European beech and oak species (currently prevailing in mid-to low-elevation areas), with novel species associations emerging on the landscape. Yet, it took between 357 and 706 years before the landscape attained a dynamic equilibrium with the climate system. Disturbances generally catalyzed adaptation and decreased the time needed to attain equilibrium by up to 211 years. However, while increasing disturbance frequency and severity accelerated adaptation, increasing disturbance size had the opposite effect. Spatial analyses suggest that particularly the lowest and highest elevation areas will be hotspots of future species change. We conclude that the growing maladaptation of forests to climate and the long lead times of autonomous adaptation need to be considered more explicitly in the ongoing efforts to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem services provisioning.

AB The Loess Plateau (LP) is one of the most fragile eco-regions in China, and is characterized by severe soil erosion and water shortage. The fragile environment poses a threat to ecological safety and sustainable development on the LP and neighboring areas. The ecosystem on the LP has undergone great changes in recent decades owing to dramatic climate change, ecological rehabilitation, and tremendous human pressure. This study was focused on quantifying and assessing the multiple ecosystem services from 2000 to 2012, based on actual observation records and widely used biophysical models. These included Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWSQ), Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), and rainfall storage method. Furthermore, in this study, the roles of climate variability and an ecological restoration program on vegetation activity and ecosystem services were investigated, as well as the synergies between multiple ecosystem services. The slight increase in both precipitation and temperature during 2000-2012, in conjunction with ecological rehabilitation, induced a trend of increasing in vegetation cover and productivity. During 2000-2012, the overall soil retention function was slightly enhanced while the amount of hydrological regulation decreased. The biomass production (vegetation carbon sequestration) and food production increased sharply. The increasing precipitation intensified water erosion by enhancing rainfall erosivity, whereas the reduction in wind speed lessened wind erosion and thereby reduced the frequency and duration of sandstorm events. Vegetation restoration supported by climate variability and resulting from ecological projects also played positive roles in soil retention enhancement. The spatial correlation analyses indicated synergies between multiple regulating ecosystem services. There was also a synergy between food production and carbon sequestration in vegetation. The performance of ecological rehabilitation and changes in ecosystem services on the LP exemplified the need for ecological conservation to take climate variability into account, and to facilitate synergies involving multiple ecosystem services, to maximize human well-being and preserve natural ecosystems.

AB Mapping disease transmission risk is crucial in public and animal health for evidence based decision-making. Ecology and epidemiology are highly related disciplines that may contribute to improvements in mapping disease, which can be used to answer health related questions. Ecological niche modeling is increasingly used for understanding the biogeography of diseases in plants, animals, and humans. However, epidemiological applications of niche modeling approaches for disease mapping can fail to generate robust study designs, producing incomplete or incorrect inferences. This manuscript is an overview of the history and conceptual bases behind ecological niche modeling, specifically as applied to epidemiology and public health; it does not pretend to be an exhaustive and detailed description of ecological niche modeling literature and methods. Instead, this review includes selected state-of-the-science approaches and tools, providing a short guide to designing studies incorporating information on the type and quality of the input data (i.e., occurrences and environmental variables), identification and justification of the extent of the study area, and encourages users to explore and test diverse algorithms for more informed conclusions. We provide a friendly introduction to the field of disease biogeography presenting an updated guide for researchers looking to use ecological niche modeling for disease mapping. We anticipate that ecological niche modeling will soon be a critical tool for epidemiologists aiming to map disease transmission risk, forecast disease distribution under climate change scenarios, and identify landscape factors triggering outbreaks.

AB Background: As increasingly fragmented and isolated populations of threatened species become subjected to climate change, invasive species and other stressors, there is an urgent need to consider adaptive potential when making conservation decisions rather than focussing on past processes. In many cases, populations identified as unique and currently managed separately suffer increased risk of extinction through demographic and genetic processes. Other populations currently not at risk are likely to be on a trajectory where declines in population size and fitness soon appear inevitable.
   Results: Using datasets from natural Australian mammal populations, we show that drift processes are likely to be driving uniqueness in populations of many threatened species as a result of small population size and fragmentation. Conserving and managing such remnant populations separately will therefore often decrease their adaptive potential and increase species extinction risk.
   Conclusions: These results highlight the need for a paradigm shift in conservation biology practise; strategies need to focus on the preservation of genetic diversity at the species level, rather than population, subspecies or evolutionary significant unit. The introduction of new genetic variants into populations through in situ translocation needs to be considered more broadly in conservation programs as a way of decreasing extinction risk by increasing neutral genetic diversity which may increase the adaptive potential of populations if adaptive variation is also increased.

AB Foodborne illnesses associated with pathogenic bacteria are a global public health and economic challenge. The diversity of microorganisms (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) that exists within the food and meat industries complicates efforts to understand pathogen ecology. Further, little is known about the interaction of pathogens within the microbiome throughout the meat production chain. Here, a metagenomic approach and shotgun sequencing technology were used as tools to detect pathogenic bacteria in environmental samples collected from the same groups of cattle at different longitudinal processing steps of the beef production chain: cattle entry to feedlot, exit from feedlot, cattle transport trucks, abattoir holding pens, and the end of the fabrication system. The log read counts classified as pathogens per million reads for Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium spp. (C. botulinum and C. perfringens), and Campylobacter spp. (C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. fetus) decreased over subsequential processing steps. Furthermore, the normalized read counts for S. enterica, E. coli, and C. botulinum were greater in the final product than at the feedlots, indicating that the proportion of these bacteria increased (the effect on absolute numbers was unknown) within the remaining microbiome. From an ecological perspective, data indicated that shotgun metagenomics can be used to evaluate not only the microbiome but also shifts in pathogen populations during beef production. Nonetheless, there were several challenges in this analysis approach, one of the main ones being the identification of the specific pathogen from which the sequence reads originated, which makes this approach impractical for use in pathogen identification for regulatory and confirmation purposes.

Documentation of the links between climate variability, ecosystem change and predator dynamics is absent for most top predators. Identifying species that may be useful indicators and elucidating these mechanistic links provides insight into current ecological dynamics and may inform predictions of future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examine humpback whale response to environmental variability through stable isotope analysis of diet over a dynamic 20-year period (1993-2012) in the California Current System (CCS). Humpback whale diets captured two major shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions in the CCS. Isotopic signatures reflect a diet dominated by krill during periods characterized by positive phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), cool sea surface temperature (SST), strong upwelling and high krill biomass. In contrast, humpback whale diets are dominated by schooling fish when the NPGO is negative, SST is warmer, seasonal upwelling is delayed and anchovy and sardine populations display increased biomass and range expansion. These findings demonstrate that humpback whales trophically respond to ecosystem shifts, and as a result, their foraging behavior is a synoptic indicator of oceanographic and ecological conditions across the CCS. Multi-decadal examination of these sentinel species thus provides insight into biological consequences of interannual climate fluctuations, fundamental to advancing ecosystem predictions related to global climate change.

AB Adaptive radiation is the rapid and extensive ecological diversification of an organismal lineage to generate both phenotypic disparity (divergence) and similarity (convergence). Demonstrating particularly clear evidence of the power of natural selection, adaptive radiations serve as outstanding systems for studying the mechanisms of evolution. We review how the first wave of genomic investigation across major archetypal adaptive radiations has started to shed light on the molecular basis of adaptive diversification. Notably, these efforts have not yet identified consistent features of genomic architecture that promote diversification. However, access to a pool of ancient adaptive variation via genetic exchange emerges as an important driver of adaptive radiation. We conclude by highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive radiations, including the discovery of 'adaptation genes' based on genome scans using replicate convergent populations.

AB Reciprocal interaction between plant and soil (plant-soil feedback, PSF) can determine plant community structure. Understanding which traits control interspecific variation of PSF strength is crucial for plant ecology. Studies have highlighted either plant-mediated nutrient cycling (litter-mediated PSF) or plant-microbe interaction (microbial-mediated PSF) as important PSF mechanisms, each attributing PSF variation to different traits. However, this separation neglects the complex indirect interactions between the two mechanisms. We developed a model coupling litter- and microbial-mediated PSFs to identify the relative importance of traits in controlling PSF strength, and its dependency on the composition of root-associated microbes (i.e. pathogens and/or mycorrhizal fungi). Results showed that although plant carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio and microbial nutrient acquisition traits were consistently important, the importance of litter decomposability varied. Litter decomposability was not a major PSF determinant when pathogens are present. However, its importance increased with the relative abundance of mycorrhizal fungi as nutrient released from the mycorrhizal-enhanced litter production to the nutrient-depleted soils result in synergistic increase of soil nutrient and mycorrhizal abundance. Data compiled from empirical studies also supported our predictions. We propose that the importance of litter decomposability depends on the composition of root-associated microbes. Our results provide new perspectives in plant invasion and trait-based ecology.

AB An important question in ecology is how mechanistic processes occurring among individuals drive large-scale patterns of community formation and change. Here we show that in two species of bluebirds, cycles of replacement of one by the other emerge as an indirect consequence of maternal influence on offspring behavior in response to local resource availability. Sampling across broad temporal and spatial scales, we found that western bluebirds, the more competitive species, bias the birth order of offspring by sex in a way that influences offspring aggression and dispersal, setting the stage for rapid increases in population density that ultimately result in the replacement of their sister species. Our results provide insight into how predictable community dynamics can occur despite the contingency of local behavioral interactions.

AB Marine predators will often perform diel and seasonal movements associated with specific habitats. In tropical areas, mesophotic coral reefs may be an important habitat type for many predators, but their use of these areas has rarely been investigated. We used results of acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analyses to investigate the diel and seasonal movements of Galapagos sharks Carcharhinus galapagensis and giant trevally Caranx ignobilis captured from a mesophotic reef (depth: 50 to 70 m) at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. All predators associated with mesophotic reefs performed horizontal and vertical movements over seasonal and diel time frames. Galapagos sharks performed reverse diel vertical movements, diving deeper during the night than during the day, while giant trevally displayed a mix, with some individuals performing regular diel movements (deep during the day, shallow at night) and others performing reverse vertical diel movements. Trevally used very shallow water during the summer spawning periods. The isotopic compositions of predators suggest they primarily forage in shallow reefs, although approximately 35% of resources came from mesophotic reefs. Similar to their variability in vertical movement strategies, giant trevally occupied a wide range of trophic positions, potentially due to individual specialization in diet and high levels of intra- specific competition. Mesophotic reefs may provide some prey to upper level predators but also serve as a refuge habitat. The frequent movements between habitats suggest that marine predators may function as significant transporters of nutrients, particularly from shallow to mesophotic reefs.

AB DNA cytosine methylation is a widespread epigenetic mechanism in eukaryotes, and plant genomes commonly are densely methylated. Genomic methylation can be associated with functional consequences such as mutational events, genomic instability or altered gene expression, but little is known on interspecific variation in global cytosine methylation in plants. In this paper, we compare global cytosine methylation estimates obtained by HPLC and use a phylogenetically-informed analytical approach to test for significance of evolutionary signatures of this trait across 54 angiosperm species in 25 families. We evaluate whether interspecific variation in global cytosine methylation is statistically related to phylogenetic distance and also whether it is evolutionarily correlated with genome size (C-value). Global cytosine methylation varied widely between species, ranging between 5.3% (Arabidopsis) and 39.2% (Narcissus). Differences between species were related to their evolutionary trajectories, as denoted by the strong phylogenetic signal underlying interspecific variation. Global cytosine methylation and genome size were evolutionarily correlated, as revealed by the significant relationship between the corresponding phylogenetically independent contrasts. On average, a ten-fold increase in genome size entailed an increase of about 10% in global cytosine methylation. Results show that global cytosine methylation is an evolving trait in angiosperms whose evolutionary trajectory is significantly linked to changes in genome size, and suggest that the evolutionary implications of epigenetic mechanisms are likely to vary between plant lineages.

AB Direct gradient analyses in spatial genetics provide unique opportunities to describe the inherent complexity of genetic variation in wildlife species and are the object of many methodological developments. However, multicollinearity among explanatory variables is a systemic issue in multivariate regression analyses and is likely to cause serious difficulties in properly interpreting results of direct gradient analyses, with the risk of erroneous conclusions, misdirected research and inefficient or counterproductive conservation measures. Using simulated data sets along with linear and logistic regressions on distance matrices, we illustrate how commonality analysis (CA), a detailed variance-partitioning procedure that was recently introduced in the field of ecology, can be used to deal with nonindependence among spatial predictors. By decomposing model fit indices into unique and common (or shared) variance components, CA allows identifying the location and magnitude of multicollinearity, revealing spurious correlations and thus thoroughly improving the interpretation of multivariate regressions. Despite a few inherent limitations, especially in the case of resistance model optimization, this review highlights the great potential of CA to account for complex multicollinearity patterns in spatial genetics and identifies future applications and lines of research. We strongly urge spatial geneticists to systematically investigate commonalities when performing direct gradient analyses.

AB Both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and root hairs play important roles in plant uptake of water and mineral nutrients. To reveal the relative importance of mycorrhiza and root hairs in plant water relations, a bald root barley (brb) mutant and its wild type (wt) were grown with or without inoculation of the AM fungus Rhizophagus intraradices under well-watered or drought conditions, and plant physiological traits relevant to drought stress resistance were recorded. The experimental results indicated that the AM fungus could almost compensate for the absence of root hairs under drought-stressed conditions. Moreover, phosphorus (P) concentration, leaf water potential, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency were significantly increased by R. intraradices but not by root hairs, except for shoot P concentration and photosynthetic rate under the drought condition. Root hairs even significantly decreased root P concentration under drought stresses. These results confirm that AM fungi can enhance plant drought tolerance by improvement of P uptake and plant water relations, which subsequently promote plant photosynthetic performance and growth, while root hairs presumably contribute to the improvement of plant growth and photosynthetic capacity through an increase in shoot P concentration.

AB Nitrogen (N) deposition significantly affects the soil carbon (C) cycle process of forests. However, the influence of different types of N on it still remained unclear. In this work, ammonium nitrate was selected as an inorganic N (IN) source, while urea and glycine were chosen as organic N (ON) sources. Different ratios of IN to ON (1:4, 2:3, 3:2, 4:1, and 5:0) were mixed with equal total amounts and then used to fertilize temperate forest soils for 2years. Results showed that IN deposition inhibited soil C cycle processes, such as soil respiration, soil organic C decomposition, and enzymatic activities, and induced the accumulation of recalcitrant organic C. By contrast, ON deposition promoted these processes. Addition of ON also resulted in accelerated transformation of recalcitrant compounds into labile compounds and increased CO2 efflux. Meanwhile, greater ON deposition may convert C sequestration in forest soils into C source. These results indicated the importance of the IN to ON ratio in controlling the soil C cycle, which can consequently change the ecological effect of N deposition.

AB Soil bacteria typically coexist with close relatives generating widespread phylogenetic clustering. This has been ascribed to the abiotic filtering of organisms with shared ecological tolerances. Recent theoretical developments suggest that competition can also explain the phylogenetic similarity of coexisting organisms by excluding large low-competitive clades. We propose that combining the environmental patterns of traits associated with abiotic stress tolerances or competitive abilities with phylogeny and abundance data, can help discern between abiotic and biotic mechanisms underlying the coexistence of phylogenetically related bacteria. We applied this framework in a model system composed of interspersed habitats of highly contrasted productivity and comparatively dominated by biotic and abiotic processes, i.e. the plant patch-gap mosaic typical of drylands. We examined the distribution of 15 traits and 3290 bacterial taxa in 28 plots. Communities showed a marked functional response to the environment. Conserved traits related to environmental stress tolerance (e. g. desiccation, formation of resistant structures) were differentially selected in either habitat, while competition related traits (e. g. organic C consumption, formation of nutrient-scavenging structures) prevailed under high resource availability. Phylogenetic clustering was stronger in habitats dominated by biotic filtering, suggesting that competitive exclusion of large clades might underlie the ecological similarity of co-occurring soil bacteria.

AB Climate change may directly induce shifts in stand-level dynamics by altering the regeneration, growth and mortality of tree species, and indirectly by modifying interspecific competition. While some experimental and simulation studies have shown that these effects can be compensated by lower browsing pressure, it is not clear how species composition and stand basal area may respond in the short and long term, and to which extent.
   We investigated the response of forests to isolated and combined changes of climatic conditions and ungulate browsing intensity in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), a strictly protected forest reserve. To this aim, we firstly characterized the browsing variability within the BFNP and among each tree species. Based on this, we implemented new equations in the forest gap model ForClim v3.0 and simulated the short- and long-term development of different forest types according to pertinent scenarios of browsing intensity.
   The model predicted a large dieback of the dominant Picea abies and Abies alba due to the increase in summer drought and winter temperatures; these species were progressively replaced by Fagus sylvatica. While climate change may have a positive impact on tree diversity in the short term (similar to 100 years), long-term simulations (>1000 years) revealed reduced tree diversity and stand basal area compared to those predicted under current climate. While species composition was strongly dependent on browsing intensity under current climate through the changes in seedling selectivity by ungulates and in light regimes, the trajectory of vegetation development under climate change was not significantly altered by browsing. Even for highly palatable species such as A. alba, an eradication of ungulates could not compensate the decline of drought-intolerant species.
   We conclude that forest management tools to reduce ungulates population may be helpful to promote species diversity in P. abies dominated forest. However they may not be sufficient to compensate for the reduction in basal area and diversity that is induced by climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Terrestrial biosphere models are designed to synthesize our current understanding of how ecosystems function, test competing hypotheses of ecosystem function against observations, and predict responses to novel conditions such as those expected under climate change. Reducing uncertainties in such models can improve both basic scientific understanding and our predictive capacity, but rarely are ecosystem models employed in the design of field campaigns. We provide a synthesis of carbon cycle uncertainty analyses conducted using the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer ecoinformatics workflow with the Ecosystem Demography model v2. This work is a synthesis of multiple projects, using Bayesian data assimilation techniques to incorporate field data and trait databases across temperate forests, grasslands, agriculture, short rotation forestry, boreal forests, and tundra. We report on a number of data needs that span a wide array of diverse biomes, such as the need for better constraint on growth respiration, mortality, stomatal conductance, and water uptake. We also identify data needs that are biome specific, such as photosynthetic quantum efficiency at high latitudes. We recommend that future data collection efforts balance the bias of past measurements toward aboveground processes in temperate biomes with the sensitivities of different processes as represented by ecosystem models.

AB Soil carbon (C) saturation behavior predicts that soil C storage efficiency observed under field conditions decreases as a soil approaches C saturation. This may be due to a decline in soil organic matter (SOM) stability as the result of changes in the type, strength or turnover time of organo-mineral interactions with increasing organic C input. The goal of this study was to test whether the stability of organic matter bound to soil minerals decreases as organo-mineral complexes approach C saturation with increasing C loading. A series of batch sorption experiments with natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) and soil mineral components was conducted to obtain organo-mineral complexes with a range of organic C loadings. The relative stability of C in these organo-mineral complexes was subsequently assessed using evolved CO2 gas analysis during thermal analyses and laboratory incubations. Results indicated that differences in dissolved organic C before and after sorption overestimated the amount of sorbed C when compared to differences in solid-phase C concentrations. Values of C/N, delta C-13, and delta N-15 of the organo-mineral complexes were significantly smaller or more negative than initial soil samples or the stock DOM solution, consistent with the concept of molecular fractionation by sorption to minerals and suggesting that the composition of the organic matter in the organo-mineral complexes may have changed as the amount of sorbed organic matter increased. Observations that organic C loadings at maximum sorption did not substantially exceed 1 mg C m(-2) and linear rather than asymptotic relations between sorbed C and initial DOM concentrations suggest that organo-mineral complexes may not have reached C saturation under the conditions in the batch sorption experiments of this study. The temperature at which half of the CO2 evolved during thermal analysis (i.e., CO2-T-50) increased with increasing C loading, suggesting the sorbed C required greater energy input for combustion. Results of the laboratory incubations to determine relative biological stability of sorbed C were not consistent with the initial hypothesis. The size of potentially mineralizable C pool relative to the total sorbed C decreased with increasing C loading, even though this pool was being degraded more rapidly. Overall, the results did not support the hypothesis that SOM stability decreases with increasing C loading. In spite of generating a wide range of C loadings substantially greater than previous studies, the conditions of the DOM sorption experiments conducted in this study appeared unable to generate organo-mineral complexes exhibiting C saturation behavior. We speculate that measurable decreases in SOM stability may occur only once the threshold of C saturation is reached. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mountain ecosystems are particularly susceptible to climate change. Characterizing intraspecific variation of alpine plants along elevational gradients is crucial for estimating their vulnerability to predicted changes. Environmental conditions vary with elevation, which might influence plastic responses and affect selection pressures that lead to local adaptation. Thus, local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity among low and high elevation plant populations in response to climate, soil and other factors associated with elevational gradients might underlie different responses of these populations to climate warming. Using a transplant experiment along an elevational gradient, we investigated reproductive phenology, growth and reproduction of the nutrient-poor grassland species Ranunculus bulbosus, Trifolium montanum and Briza media. Seeds were collected from low and high elevation source populations across the Swiss Alps and grown in nine common gardens at three different elevations with two different soil depths. Despite genetic differentiation in some traits, the results revealed no indication of local adaptation to the elevation of population origin. Reproductive phenology was advanced at lower elevation in low and high elevation populations of all three species. Growth and reproduction of T. montanum and B. media were hardly affected by garden elevation and soil depth. In R. bulbosus, however, growth decreased and reproductive investment increased at higher elevation. Furthermore, soil depth influenced growth and reproduction of low elevation R. bulbosus populations. We found no evidence for local adaptation to elevation of origin and hardly any differences in the responses of low and high elevation populations. However, the consistent advanced reproductive phenology observed in all three species shows that they have the potential to plastically respond to environmental variation. We conclude that populations might not be forced to migrate to higher elevations as a consequence of climate warming, as plasticity will buffer the detrimental effects of climate change in the three investigated nutrient-poor grassland species.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CONSERVATION; SCIENCE
AB The concept of ecosystem services is increasingly used as a support for natural resource management decisions. While the science for assessing ecosystem services is improving, appropriate methods to address uncertainties in a quantitative manner are missing. Ignoring parameter uncertainties, modeling uncertainties and uncertainties related to human-environment interactions can modify decisions and lead to overlooking important management possibilities. In this contribution, we present a new approach for mapping the uncertainties in the assessment of multiple ecosystem services. The spatially explicit risk approach links Bayesian networks to a Geographic Information System for forecasting the value of a bundle of ecosystem services and quantifies the uncertainties related to the outcomes in a spatially explicit manner. We demonstrate that mapping uncertainties in ecosystem services assessments provides key information for decision-makers seeking critical areas in the delivery of ecosystem services in a case study in the Swiss Alps. The results suggest that not only the total value of the bundle of ecosystem services is highly dependent on uncertainties, but the spatial pattern of the ecosystem services values changes substantially when considering uncertainties. This is particularly important for the long-term management of mountain forest ecosystems, which have long rotation stands and are highly sensitive to pressing climate and socio-economic changes.

AB Determinants of plant establishment and invasion are a key issue in ecology and evolution. Although establishment success varies substantially among species, the importance of species traits and extrinsic factors as determinants of establishment in existing communities has remained difficult to prove in observational studies because they can be confounded and mask each other. Therefore, we conducted a large multispecies field experiment to disentangle the relative importance of extrinsic factors vs. species characteristics for the establishment success of plants in grasslands. We introduced 48 alien and 45 native plant species at different seed numbers into multiple grassland sites with or without experimental soil disturbance and related their establishment success to species traits assessed in five independent multispecies greenhouse experiments. High propagule pressure and high seed mass were the most important factors increasing establishment success in the very beginning of the experiment. However, after 3 y, propagule pressure became less important, and species traits related to biotic interactions (including herbivore resistance and responses to shading and competition) became the most important drivers of success or failure. The relative importance of different traits was environment-dependent and changed over time. Our approach of combining a multispecies introduction experiment in the field with trait data from independent multispecies experiments in the greenhouse allowed us to detect the relative importance of species traits for early establishment and provided evidence that species traits-fine-tuned by environmental factors-determine success or failure of alien and native plants in temperate grasslands.

AB Biodiversity has been described as the diversity of life on earth within species, among species, and among ecosystems. The rate of biodiversity loss due to human activity in the last 50 years has been more rapid than at any other time in human history, and many of the drivers of biodiversity loss are increasing, including habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species, climate change, and pollution, including pollution from reactive nitrogen (Nr). Of these stressors, climate change and Nr from anthropogenic activities are causing some of the most rapid changes. Climate change is causing warming trends that result in poleward and elevational range shifts of flora and fauna, and changes in phenology, particularly the earlier onset of spring events and migration, and lengthening of the growing season. Nitrogen (N) enrichment can enhance plant growth, but has been shown to favor, fast-growing, sometimes invasive, species over native species adapted to low N conditions. Although there have been only a few controlled studies on climate change and N interactions, inferences can be drawn from various field observations. For example, in arid ecosystems of southern California, elevated N deposition and changing precipitation patterns have promoted the conversion of native shrub communities to communities dominated by annual non-native grasses. Both empirical studies and modeling indicate that N and climate change can interact to drive losses in biodiversity greater than those caused by either stressor alone. Reducing inputs of anthropogenic Nr may be an effective mitigation strategy for protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; LAND-USE; VALUATION; FRAMEWORK; FOREST; LIMITS
AB In spite of an increasing interest in environmental economic accounting, there is still very limited experience with the integration of ecosystem services and ecosystem capital in national accounts. This paper identifies four key methodological challenges in developing ecosystem accounts: the definition of ecosystem services in the context of accounting, their allocation to institutional sectors; the treatment of degradation and rehabilitation, and valuing ecosystem services consistent with SNA principles. We analyze the different perspectives taken on these challenges and present a number of proposals to deal with the challenges in developing ecosystem accounts. These proposals comprise several novel aspects, including (i) presenting an accounting approach that recognizes that most ecosystems are strongly influenced by people and that ecosystem services depend on natural processes as well as human ecosystem management; and, (ii) recording ecosystem services as either contributions of a private land owner or as generated by a sector 'Ecosystems' depending on the type of ecosystem service. We also present a consistent approach for recording degradation, and for applying monetary valuation approaches in the context of accounting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Variation in the diet-tissue fractionation of stable nitrogen isotopes (Delta 15N) is a major source of uncertainty in mixing model outputs and the calculation of trophic level in food web studies in aquatic systems. Using delta N-15 and delta C-13 of algae and consumers collected from a broad range of streams and rivers in Australia and New Guinea, we calculated Delta 15N using a gradient approach, and compared these estimates with those from the literature. Riverine invertebrates and fishes from this region have Delta 15N diet-tissue fractionation at the low end of the range of values reported for literature summaries, but different trophic groups had different Delta 15N estimates. Source-consumer regressions based on delta C-13 had lower slope estimates and lower R-2 values compared with those based on delta N-15. This implies that although consumers on average obtain a portion of their organic carbon from higher plants, they derive most of their organic nitrogen from N-rich algae. Use of appropriate Delta 15N for riverine consumers will lead to more satisfactory results with isotope mixing models, and the uncertainty associated with Delta 15N estimates can be incorporated in the latest iterations of these models that are probabilistic rather than deterministic.

AB Emerging evidence suggests that male lions are not dependent on female's hunting skills but are in fact successful hunters. But difficulty locating kills and objectively characterizing landscapes has complicated the comparison of male and female lion hunting strategies. We used airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) measurements of vegetation structure in Kruger National Park, combined with global positioning system (GPS) telemetry data on lion, Panthera leo, kills to quantify lines-of-sight where lion kills occurred compared with areas where lions rested, while controlling for time of day. We found significant differences in use of vegetation structure by male and female lions during hunts. While male lions killed in landscapes with much shorter lines-of-sight (16.2 m) than those in which they rested, there were no significant differences for female lions. These results were consistent across sizes of prey species. The influence of vegetation structure in shaping predator-prey interactions is often hypothesized, but quantitative evidence has been scarce. Although our sample sizes were limited, our results provide a mechanism, ambush hunting versus social hunting in the open, to explain why hunting success of male lions might equal that of females. This study serves as a case study for more complete studies with larger samples sizes and illustrates how LiDAR and GPS telemetry can be used to provide new insight into lion hunting behaviour.

AB Although urban areas are often considered to have uniformly negative effects on biodiversity, cities are most accurately characterized as heterogeneous mosaics of buildings, streets, parks, and gardens that include both good' and bad' areas for wildlife. However, to date, few studies have evaluated how human impacts vary in direction and magnitude across a heterogeneous urban landscape. In this study, we assessed the distribution of floral resources and flower-visiting insects across a variety of land uses in New York City. We visited both green spaces (e.g. parks, cemeteries) and heavily developed neighborhood blocks (e.g. with high or low density residential zoning) and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of median income, vegetation, and development intensity on floral resources and insects in both settings. Abundance and taxonomic richness of flower-visiting insects was significantly greater in green spaces than neighborhood blocks. The SEM results indicated that heavily-developed neighborhoods generally had fewer flower-visiting insects consistent with reductions in floral resources. However, some low-density residential neighborhoods maintained high levels of floral resources and flower-visiting insects. We found that the effects of surrounding vegetation on floral resources, and thus indirect effects on insects, varied considerably between green spaces and neighborhood blocks. Along neighborhood blocks, vegetation consisted of a mosaic of open gardens and sparsely distributed trees and had a positive indirect effect on flower-visiting insects. In contrast, vegetation in urban green spaces was associated with increased canopy cover and thus had a negative indirect effect on flower-visiting insects through reductions in floral resources. In both neighborhood blocks and green spaces, vegetation had a positive direct effect on flower-visiting insects independent of the influence of vegetation on floral resources. Our results demonstrate how inter-related components of an urban ecosystem can vary with respect to one another across a heterogeneous urban landscape, suggesting that it is inappropriate to generalize about urban systems as a whole without first addressing differences among component land use types.

AB Tropical mountains contain some of the world's richest animal communities as a result of high turnover of species along elevational gradients. We describe an approach to study the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in establishing elevational ranges, and to improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on these communities. As a framework we use Hutchinson's concept of the fundamental niche (determined by the match between the physical environment and the organism's physiological and biophysical characteristics) and realized niche (the subset of the fundamental niche determined by biotic interactions). Using tropical birds as an example, we propose a method for estimating fundamental niches and discuss five biotic interactions that we expect to influence distributions of tropical montane animals: predation, competition, parasites and pathogens, mutualisms, and habitat associations. The effects of biotic factors on elevational ranges have been studied to some extent, but there is little information on physiological responses of tropical montane animals. It will be necessary to understand all of these ecological constraints in concert to predict current and future elevational ranges and potential threats to montane species. Given the importance of tropical mountains as global biodiversity hotspots, we argue that this area of research requires urgent attention.

AB The political breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991 provides a rare case of drastic changes in social and economic conditions, and as such a great opportunity to investigate the impacts of socioeconomic changes on the rates and patterns of forest harvest and regrowth. Our goal was to characterize forest-cover changes in the temperate zone of European Russia between 1985 and 2010 in 5-year increments using a stratified random sample of 12 Landsat footprints. We used Support Vector. Machines and post-classification comparison to monitor forest area, disturbance and reforestation. Where image availability was sub-optimal, we tested whether winter images help to improve classification accuracy. Our approach yielded accurate mono-temporal maps (on average > 95% overall accuracy), and change maps (on average 93.5%). The additional use of winter imagery improved classification accuracy by about 2%. Our results suggest that Russia's temperate forests underwent substantial changes during the observed period. Overall, forested areas increased by 4.5%, but the changes in forested area varied over time: a decline in forest area between 1990 and 1995 (- 1%) was followed by an increase in overall forest area in recent years (+ 1.4%, 2005-2010), possibly caused in part by forest regrowth on abandoned farmlands. Disturbances varied greatly among administrative regions, suggesting that differences in socioeconomic conditions strongly influence disturbance rates. While portions of Russia's temperate forests experienced high disturbance rates, overall forest area is expanding. Our use of a stratified random sample of Landsat footprints, and of summer and winter images, allowed us to characterize forest dynamics across a large region over a long time period, emphasizing the value of winter imagery in the free Landsat archives, especially for study areas where data availability is limited.

AB Phylogenetic ecology has identified patterns of diversity in communities that may find explanation in trophic interactions, and yet there have been few attempts to directly relate such patterns among trophic levels. Density-dependent processes involving pests and pathogens, for example, have been invoked to account for plant community phylogenetic patterns, but relatively little is known about how plant relatedness might affect community structure at other trophic levels. We examined the degree to which the abundance of herbivores in a rain forest community is explained by the phylogeny and functional traits of host plants. We destructively sampled all stems >= 5 cm diameter in two 1-ha plots of New Guinea primary and secondary lowland forest to test predicted relationships between herbivore abundance and plant resources. We analyzed per-tree caterpillar and leaf miner abundance, total leaf biomass (kg), percentage of immature foliage, specific leaf area (cm(2)/g), leaf nitrogen content (percentage of dry mass), and presence of exudates in the context of a plant community phylogeny estimated from DNA barcodes.
   Apart from nitrogen content and exudates, neither plant resources nor herbivore abundance showed evidence of phylogenetic signal in our community sample. The plant traits we measured could account for only 30% and 16% of variation in caterpillar and leaf miner abundance, respectively, among individual trees. Leaf biomass was a stronger predictor of herbivore abundance than either resource quality (leaf nitrogen content) or palatability (percentage of immature foliage, specific leaf area). The primary importance of resource quantity was also observed at the plant species level in analyses of species means and phylogenetic generalized least-squares regression. Plant relatedness did not account for much variation in herbivore abundance, but significant effects of exudates and leaf nitrogen content on caterpillar abundance illustrate how conserved traits at one trophic level may influence community-wide patterns at another.

AB Spatial and temporal patterns of soil water are major determinants of net primary production and plant functional composition in arid and semiarid ecosystems which cover approximately 30% of global land area. The ecohydrological niche defines the components of species' niche that are described by the relationship between ecohydrological conditions and species occurrence. We modelled the ecohydrological niche of different sagebrush ecosystems types, which are widespread in the semiarid western United States, and identified characteristics, which, if altered, will potentially lead to changes in their geographic distribution. We ran a daily soil water simulation model, SOILWAT, to simulate the water balance in space and time for sites from across the geographic range of sagebrush ecosystems. Additionally, to evaluate the relative importance of weather type, soil texture, soil depth, vegetation biomass, and phenology, we performed a sensitivity analysis using output from SOILWAT. Our results demonstrated that soil water dynamics in sagebrush ecosystems are characterized by spring recharge followed by a dry period (timing dependent on ecosystem type), where top soil layers dry earlier and more completely than the bottom layers. Most response variables were strongly influenced by weather type, followed by phenology of biomass, and soil depth. Reducing the availability of deep soil water during summer dry periods by increasing evaporative demand or reducing spring recharge will potentially lead to shifts in the range of sagebrush ecosystems. Characterizing the ecohydrological niche will be essential for improving our understanding of how semiarid ecosystems will be affected by future climate and biological invasions. Published in 2011.

AB The large number of green space lawns in cities means that they shelter a high proportion of wild urban species, but the roles of landscape and management on the level of biodiversity in these spaces are little understood. We performed floristic inventories in 100 lawns in the southeast corner of Paris, France and linked their floristic diversity and composition to: (1) the characteristics of urbanization given by the Land Use Pattern and the distance from the centre of Paris, (2) local factors including luminosity and size of the lawn and (3) the type of management, including pesticide and fertilizer use, animal and public access, and mowing frequency. A total of 79 species were identified, of which 9% were naturalized. Distribution of the species was largely conditioned by the management methods applied to the green spaces: specific management strategies were associated with specific community traits and composition. As expected, the highest species richness and/or rarity were found in lawns submitted to private management, low use of pesticides and limited public access. But surprisingly high diversity was also sometimes found in small public lawns. The results establish relationships between human practices and characteristics of plant communities. We use them to make several recommendations on how best to optimize management of lawns with a view to conserving urban biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID AIR TEMPERATURES; RIVER; SENSITIVITY
AB We develop a stream temperature model within the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) that reflects the combined influence of meteorological (air temperature) and hydrological conditions (streamflow, snowmelt, groundwater, surface runoff, and lateral soil flow) on water temperature within a watershed. SWAT currently uses a linear air-stream temperature relationship to determine stream temperature, without consideration of watershed hydrology. As SWAT uses stream temperature to model various in-stream biological and water quality processes, an improvement of the stream temperature model will result in improved accuracy in modeling these processes. The new stream temperature model is tested on seven coastal and mountainous streams throughout the western United States for which high quality flow and water temperature data were available. The new routine does not require input data beyond that already supplied to the model, can be calibrated with a limited number of calibration parameters, and achieves improved representation of observed daily stream temperature. For the watersheds modeled, the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient and mean error (ME) for the new stream temperature model averaged 0.81 and -0.69 degrees C, respectively, for the calibration period and 0.82 and -0.63 degrees C for the validation period. The original SWAT stream temperature model averaged a NS of -0.27 and ME of 3.21 degrees C for the calibration period and a NS of -0.26 and ME of 3.02 degrees C for the validation period. Sensitivity analyses suggest that the new stream temperature model calibration parameters are physically reasonable and the model is better able to capture stream temperature changes resulting from changes in hydroclimatological conditions.

AB Predicting the future trajectories of ecological systems is increasingly important as the magnitude of anthropogenic perturbation of the earth systems grows. We distinguish between two types of predictability: the intrinsic or theoretical predictability of a system and the realized predictability that is achieved using available models and parameterizations. We contend that there are strong limits on the intrinsic predictability of ecological systems that arise from inherent characteristics of biological systems. While the realized predictability of ecological systems can be limited by process and parameter misspecification or uncertainty, we argue that the intrinsic predictability of ecological systems is widely and strongly limited by computational irreducibility. When realized predictability is low relative to intrinsic predictability, prediction can be improved through improved model structure or specification of parameters. Computational irreducibility, however, asserts that future states of the system cannot be derived except through computation of all of the intervening states, imposing a strong limit on the intrinsic or theoretical predictability. We argue that ecological systems are likely to be computationally irreducible because of the difficulty of pre-stating the relevant features of ecological niches, the complexity of ecological systems and because the biosphere can enable its own novel system states or adjacent possible. We argue that computational irreducibility is likely to be pervasive and to impose strong limits on the potential for prediction in ecology.

AB The present investigation accounts for the influence of intra-specific competition among predators in the original Beddington-DeAngelis predator-prey model. We offer a detailed mathematical analysis of the model to describe some of the significant results that may be expected to arise from the interplay of deterministic and stochastic biological phenomena and processes. In particular, stability (local and global) and bifurcation (Saddle-node, Transcritical, Hopf-Andronov, Bogdanov-Takens) analysis of this model are conducted. Corresponding results from previous well known predator-prey models are compared with the current findings. Nevertheless, we also allow this model in stochastic environment with the influences of both, uncorrelated "white" noise and correlated "coloured" noise. This showing that competition among the predator population is beneficial for a number of predator-prey models by keeping them stable around its positive interior equilibrium (i.e. when both populations co-exist), under environmental stochasticity. Comparisons of these findings with the results of some earlier related investigations allow the general conclusion that predator intra-species competition benefits the predator-prey system under both deterministic and stochastic environments. Finally, an extended discussion of the ecological implications of the analytical and numerical results concludes the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Jansen, M., Bloch, R., Schulze, A. & Pfenninger, M. (2011). Integrative inventory of Bolivia's lowland anurans reveals hidden diversity. -Zoologica Scripta, 40, 567-583.
   We conducted an integrative species inventory and re-evaluated the taxonomic status of anuran populations from lowland Bolivia that we putatively ordered to 59 a priori species. The analyses of own and published data of mtDNA (16S), bioacoustics, and adult and tadpole morphology, however, revealed a total number of 69 divergent lineages. With the data at hand, the taxonomic assignment of only 27 from 69 lineages (39.1%) to nominal species was supported, the assignment of nine lineages (14.5% of 69) was attributed to incertae sedis, and another 33 divergent lineages (47.8%) could not yet be assigned to any species. Of those lineages, 16 were confirmed as divergent to other species by at least two of the following lines of evidence: high genetic divergence, strong differences in advertisement calls, morphology or ecology. These 'confirmed genealogical lineages' are suggested to belong to good species following standards of divergence of the group under study, many of them probably being candidates for formal descriptions. Another 17 lineages were considered as 'unconfirmed genealogical lineages' showing significant difference to all other described species only in one line of evidence. Within 6 of our 69 revealed lineages, we detected deep conspecific lineages. Some species in this study showed remarkable intraspecific call variation not congruent with genetic divergence. Our results suggest that many Bolivian anuran species that are assigned to supposedly 'widespread' South American species apparently belong to previously unrecognized lineages with supposedly smaller distribution areas. Our data on a regional scale urge for an integrative taxonomic review of these and other widespread lowland Neotropical anuran species, as many of them may actually represent species complexes. However, a complete inventory of Neotropical amphibians apparently is a far more complex challenge than previously thought, and only cooperative, supraregional and cross-country approaches will reveal the actual amphibian diversity in the Neotropics. We postulate that Bolivia's lowlands can be assessed as a region joining distinct regional faunal diversity and thus deserve reinforced conservation and research efforts to fulfil its unique situation as climatic and biogeographic transition zone.

ID EXERGY; NEED
AB A generic input-state-output scheme has been used to represent ecosystem dynamics. Systemic approaches to ecosystems use functions that are based either on inputs, state or outputs of the system. Some examples of approaches that use a combination of functions have been recently proposed. For example the use of eco-exergy to emergy flow can be seen as a mixed input-state approach; more recently, to connect the state to the output of the ecosystem, the relation of eco-exergy and ecosystems services has been proposed. This paper studies the link between the useful output of an ecosystems and its input through the relation between ecosystem services and emergy flow, in a kind of grey/black box scheme (i.e., without considering the state and the structure of the ecosystem). No direct connection between the two concepts can be determined, but identifying and quantifying the emergy flows feeding an ecosystem and the services to humans coming from them facilitate the sustainable conservation of Nature and its functions. Furthermore, this input-output relation can be established in general by calculating the ratio of the value of the ecosystem services to the emergy flow that supports the system. In particular, the ratio of the world ecosystem services to the emergy flow supporting the entire biosphere has been calculated showing that, at least at the global level, Nature is more efficacious in producing "money" (in form of ecosystem services) than economic systems (e.g., national economies and their GDP).

AB Human impacts through habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species and climate change are increasing the number of species threatened with extinction. Decreases in population size simultaneously lead to reductions in genetic diversity, ultimately reducing the ability of populations to adapt to a changing environment. In this way, loss of genetic polymorphism is linked with extinction risk. Recent advances in sequencing technologies mean that obtaining measures of genetic diversity at functionally important genes is within reach for conservation programs. A key region of the genome that should be targeted for population genetic studies is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). MHC genes, found in all jawed vertebrates, are the most polymorphic genes in vertebrate genomes. They play key roles in immune function via immune-recognition and -surveillance and host-parasite interaction. Therefore, measuring levels of polymorphism at these genes can provide indirect measures of the immunological fitness of populations. The MHC has also been linked with mate-choice and pregnancy outcomes and has application for improving mating success in captive breeding programs. The recent discovery that genetic diversity at MHC genes may protect against the spread of contagious cancers provides an added impetus for managing and protecting MHC diversity in wild populations. Here we review the field and focus on the successful applications of MHC-typing for conservation management. We emphasize the importance of using MHC markers when planning and executing wildlife rescue and conservation programs but stress that this should not be done to the detriment of genome-wide diversity.

AB The reorganization of major river drainages in the Sino-Himalayan region of Southwest China was caused primarily by river separation and capture events following the most recent uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (<= 3.4 Ma). Terminalia franchetii is a shrub or small tree species endemic to the river valleys of this region. Based on a range-wide sampling comprising 28 populations and 258 individuals, we investigated the relationship between the modern phylogeographic structure of T. franchetii and geological changes in drainage patterns, using chloroplast DNA sequences (trnL-F, petL-psbE). T. franchetii was found to harbor high haplotype diversity (h(T) = 0.784) but low average within-population diversity (h(S) = 0.124). Mismatch distribution and neutrality tests provided no evidence of recent demographic population growth. Two (out of five) population groups identified exhibited a disjunctive distribution of dominant haplotypes between northern and southern valleys, corresponding to the geography of past drainage systems. We conclude that the modern disjunctive distribution of T. franchetii, and associated patterns of cpDNA haplotype variation, result from vicariance caused by several historical river separation and capture events. Overall, our inferred timings of these events (mostly mid-to-late Pleistocene) agree with previous time estimates of drainage re-arrangements in the Sino-Himalayan region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is an important crop for bioenergy feedstock development. Switchgrass has two main ecotypes: the lowland ecotype being exclusively tetraploid (2n = 4x = 36) and the upland ecotype being mainly tetraploid and octaploid (2n = 8x = 72). Because there is a significant difference in ploidy, morphology, growth pattern, and zone of adaptation between and within the upland and lowland ecotypes, it is important to discriminate switchgrass plants belonging to different genetic pools. We used 55 simple sequence repeats (SSR) loci and six chloroplast sequences to identify patterns of variation between and within 18 switchgrass cultivars representing seven lowland and 11 upland cultivars from different geographic regions and of varying ploidy levels. We report consistent discrimination of switchgrass cultivars into ecotype membership and demonstrate unambiguous molecular differentiation among switchgrass ploidy levels using genetic markers. Also, SSR and chloroplast markers identified genetic pools related to the geographic origin of the 18 cultivars with respect to ecotype, ploidy, and geographical, and cultivar sources. SSR loci were highly informative for cultivar fingerprinting and to classify plants of unknown origin. This classification system is the first step toward developing switchgrass complementary gene pools that can be expected to provide a significant heterotic increase in biomass yield.

TI The formation of species pools: historical habitat abundance affects

   species diversity; species pools

AB Aim
   Explanations of biogeographic diversity patterns have emphasized the role of large-scale processes that determine species pools, whereas explanations of local patterns have not. We address the hypothesis that local diversity patterns are also primarily dependent on the size of the available species pools, which are expected to be large when the particular habitat type has been evolutionary more abundant, or in unproductive habitats due to shorter generation time and hence higher diversification rates.
   Location
   The Canary Islands.
   Methods
   We determined the geographic distribution and habitat requirements of all native vascular plant species in the Canary Islands. Species pools for each habitat type on particular islands were further split into two categories according to origin: either originating due to local diversification or due to natural immigration. The dependence of historical diversification and diversification rate on habitat type, area, age, altitude and distance to the mainland was tested with general linear mixed models weighed according to the Akaike information criterion.
   Results
   The largest portion of the local variation in plant species diversity was attributed to the historic (pre-human) habitat area, although island age was also important. The diversification rate was higher in unproductive habitats of coastal scrub and summit vegetation.
   Main conclusion
   Our study supports the species pool hypothesis, demonstrating that natural local patterns of species diversity in different habitats mirror the abundance of those particular habitats in evolutionary history. It also supports the community-level birth rate hypothesis, claiming that stressful conditions result in higher diversification rates. We conclude that much of the observed local variation in plant diversity can be attributed to the differing sizes of species pools evolved under particular habitat conditions, and that historic parameters are far more important determinants of local diversity than suggested by ecological theory.

AB P>Ecological niche construction, the process whereby an organism improves its environment to enhance its growth and persistence, is an important missing element of niche theory. Niche theory has mainly focused on niche-deteriorating processes, such as resource consumption, predation and competition, which have negative effects on population growth. Here, we integrate niche construction explicitly into modern niche theory. We use a graphical approach to analyse how a species' niche-improving impacts interplay with niche-deteriorating impacts to modify its response to the environment. In a model of two consumers that compete for one limiting resource and one predator, we show how niche construction modifies the traditional niche-deteriorating impacts of its agent or of competing species, and hence the potential for species coexistence. By altering the balance between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects, niche construction can either generate net interspecific facilitation or strengthen interspecific competition. The adaptive benefit derived from niche construction also strongly affects the realized niche of a niche-constructing species.

AB Aims
   Twentieth-century climate, the spatial pattern of tree establishment and positive feedback influence upper tree line ecotones. Here, I investigate how these factors interact to gain a more holistic understanding of how broad-scale abiotic and local-scale site conditions regulate tree establishment within upper tree line ecotones.
   Location
   A latitudinal gradient (c. 35-45 degrees N) in the US Rocky Mountains. Study sites (n = 22) were located in the Bighorn (BH), Medicine Bow (MB), Front Range (FR) and Sangre de Cristo (SDC) mountain ranges.
   Methods
   Dendroecological techniques were used to reconstruct tree establishment dates that were compared with 20th-century climate data using correlation and regime shift analyses. Spatial patterns of tree establishment were analysed by Ripley's K and used to determine local-scale interactions capable of ameliorating broad-scale climate inputs through positive feedback.
   Results
   Significant correlations (P < 0.01) between tree establishment and climate were confined to the FR, where a positive correlation was found with summer (June-August) and cool season (November-April) temperature range (T-max - T-min). These trees were almost exclusively situated in a random spatial pattern. Similar patterns exist in the BH, yet their establishment was contingent on the availability of local shelter in the lee of boulders. Trees in the MB and SDC were primarily clustered in space and had no significant correlations with climate. Considerable lag times exist between regime shift changes in climate towards more favourable growing conditions and corresponding shifts in tree establishment in all mountain ranges except the FR, where synchronous shifts occurred in the early 1950s.
   Main conclusions
   These results suggest that the influence of broad-scale climate on upper tree line dynamics is contingent on the local-scale spatial patterns of tree establishment and related influences of positive feedback. This research has important implications for understanding how vegetation communities will respond to global climate change.

AB While some of the future impacts of global environmental change such as some aspects of climate change can be projected and prepared for in advance, other effects are likely to surface as surprises - that is situations in which the behaviour in a system, or across systems, differs qualitatively from expectations. Here we analyse a set of institutional and political leadership challenges posed by 'cascading' ecological crises: abrupt ecological changes that propagate into societal crises that move through systems and spatial scales. We illustrate their underlying social and ecological drivers, and a range of institutional and political leadership challenges, which have been insufficiently elaborated by either crisis management researchers or institutional scholars. We conclude that even though these sorts of crises have parallels to other contingencies, there are a number of major differences resulting from the combination of a lack of early warnings, abrupt ecological change, and the mismatch between decision-making capabilities and the cross-scale dynamics of social-ecological change.

AB Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus aggregate to feed in a regional upwelling system during November-May between the Great Australian Bight (GAB) and Bass Strait. We analysed sightings from aerial surveys over 6 upwelling seasons (2001-02 to 2006-07) to assess within-season patterns of blue whale habitat selection, distribution, and relative abundance. Habitat variables were modelled using a general linear model (GLM) that ranked sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface chlorophyll (SSC) of equal importance, followed by depth, distance to shore, SSC gradient, distance to shelf break, and SST gradient. Further discrimination by hierarchical partitioning indicated that SST accounted for 84.4% of variation in blue whale presence explained by the model, and that probability of sightings increased with increasing SST. The large study area was resolved into 3 zones showing diversity of habitat from the shallow narrow shelf and associated surface upwelling of the central zone, to the relatively deep upper slope waters, broad shelf and variable upwelling of the western zone, and the intermediate features of the eastern zone. Density kernel estimation showed a trend in distribution from the west during November-December, spreading south-eastward along the shelf throughout the central and eastern zones during January-April, with the central zone most consistently utilised. Encounter rates in central and eastern zones peaked in February, coinciding with peak upwelling intensity and primary productivity. Blue whales avoided inshore upwelling centres, selecting SST similar to 1 degrees C cooler than remotely sensed ambient SST. Whales selected significantly higher SSC in the central and eastern zones than the western zone, where relative abundance was extremely variable. Most animals departed from the feeding ground by late April.

AB Identifying microevolutionary processes acting in populations of marine species with larval dispersal is a challenging but crucial task because of its conservation implications. In this context, recent improvements in the study of spatial genetic structure (SGS) are particularly promising because they allow accurate insights into the demographic and evolutionary processes at stake. Using an exhaustive sampling and a combination of image processing and population genetics, we highlighted significant SGS between colonies of Corallium rubrum over an area of half a square metre, which sheds light on a number of aspects of its population biology. Based on this SGS, we found the mean dispersal range within sites to be between 22.6 and 32.1 cm, suggesting that the surveyed area approximately corresponded to a breeding unit. We then conducted a kinship analysis, which revealed a complex half-sib family structure and allowed us to quantify the level of self-recruitment and to characterize aspects of the mating system of this species. Furthermore, significant temporal variations in allele frequencies were observed, suggesting low genetic drift. These results have important conservation implications for the red coral and further our understanding of the microevolutionary processes acting within populations of sessile marine species with a larval phase.

AB Climate change represents a major challenge to the maintenance of global biodiversity. To date, the direction and magnitude of net changes in the global distribution of plant diversity remain elusive. We use the empirical multi-variate relationships between contemporary water-energy dynamics and other non-climatic predictor variables to model the regional capacity for plant species richness (CSR) and its projected future changes. We find that across all analysed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenarios, relative changes in CSR increase with increased projected temperature rise. Between now and 2100, global average CSR is projected to remain similar to today (+0.3%) under the optimistic B1/+1.8 degrees C scenario, but to decrease significantly (-9.4%) under the 'business as usual' A1FI/+4.0 degrees C scenario. Across all modelled scenarios, the magnitude and direction of CSR change are geographically highly non-uniform. While in most temperate and arctic regions, a CSR increase is expected, the projections indicate a strong decline in most tropical and subtropical regions. Countries least responsible for past and present greenhouse gas emissions are likely to incur disproportionately large future losses in CSR, whereas industrialized countries have projected moderate increases. Independent of direction, we infer that all changes in regional CSR will probably induce on-site species turnover and thereby be a threat to native floras.

AB Ecomorphological patterns of the fish assemblage from the upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil, were described and evaluated according to trophic (guilds), spatial (habitats) and phylogenetic (taxonomic distances) structures. The samples were obtained through the Long Term Research Project (LTER-CNPq/UEM/NUPELIA) in August and October 2001. Thirty-five species were analyzed from thirty-one morphological variables. Strong significant correlations (Mantel test) between morphology and trophic guilds and between morphology and taxonomy were found, while morphology and habitat revealed a weak correlation. However, the partial Mantel test showed that the correlations between morphology and trophic guilds persist even when the effect of taxonomy is discounted. The ecomorphological pattern shown by the Principal Component Analysis separated species according to locomotion structures used in feeding. At one extreme there are the piscivores and insectivores that exploit lentic habitats and have compressed bodies and well developed anal fins, while at the other there are detritivores and invertivores that exploit lotic and semi-lotic habitats and have depressed bodies and well developed pectoral, pelvic and caudal fins. Canonical Discriminant Analysis using ecomorphological variables successfully predicted 94.5% of the trophic guild ecomorphotypes, but only 57.1% of the habitat ecomorphotypes. These data indicate that the fish assemblage of the upper Parana River floodplain is structured ecomorphologically mainly according to trophic structure rather than habitat.

AB The specific growth rate (SGR) of a cohort of 2000 tagged juvenile European sea bass was measured in a common tank, during two sequential cycles comprising three-weeks feed deprivation followed by three-weeks ad libitum re-feeding. After correction for initial size at age as fork length, there was a direct correlation between negative SGR (rate of mass loss) during feed deprivation and positive SGR (rate of compensatory growth) during re-feeding (Spearman rank correlation R=0.388, P=0.000002). Following a period of rearing under standard culture conditions, individuals representing 'high growth' phenotypes (GP) and 'high tolerance of feed deprivation' phenotypes (DP) were selected from either end of the SGR spectrum. Static and swimming respirometry could not demonstrate lower routine or standard metabolic rate in DP to account for greater tolerance of feed deprivation. Increased rates of compensatory growth in GP were not linked to greater maximum metabolic rate, aerobic metabolic scope or maximum cardiac performance than DP. When fed a standard ration, however, GP completed the specific dynamic action (SDA) response significantly faster than DP. Therefore, higher growth rate in GP was linked to greater capacity to process food. There was no difference in SDA coefficient, an indicator of energetic efficiency. The results indicate that individual variation in growth rate in sea bass reflects, in part, a trade-off against tolerance of food deprivation. The two phenotypes represented the opposing ends of a spectrum. The GP aims to exploit available resources and grow as rapidly as possible but at a cost of physiological and/or behavioural attributes, which lead to increased energy dissipation when food is not available. An opposing strategy, exemplified by DP, is less 'boom and bust', with a lower physiological capacity to exploit resources but which is less costly to sustain during periods of food deprivation.

AB Habitat fragmentation may strongly reduce individuals' dispersal among resource patches and hence influence population distribution and persistence. We studied the impact of landscape heterogeneity on the dispersal of the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), an endangered social lemur species living in a restricted and highly fragmented landscape. We combined spatial analysis and population genetics methods to describe population units and identify the environmental factors which best predict the rates and patterns of genetic differentiation within and between populations. We used non-invasive methods to genotype 230 individuals at 13 microsatellites in all the main forest fragments of its entire distribution area. Our analyses suggest that the Manankolana River and geographical distance are the primary structuring factors, while a national road crossing the region does not seem to impede gene flow. Altogether, our results are in agreement with a limited influence of forest habitat connectivity on gene flow patterns (except for North of the species' range), suggesting that dispersal is still possible today among most forest patches for this species. Within forest patches, we find that dispersal is mainly among neighbouring social groups, hence confirming previous behavioural observations.

AB Little attention has been paid to the role of soil organic matter (OM) in the formation of pedogenic carbonate in desert soils. The relationships among soil OM, soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA), and soil CaCO(3) in a plant community dominated by Artemisia ordosica, located on the eastern boundary of Tengger Desert in the Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, China, were studied to understand whether OM was directly involved in the formation of pedogenic carbonate. The results showed that DHA and CaCO(3) positively correlated with OM content, and DHA, OM, and CaCO(3) were correlated with each other in their spatial distribution, indicating that abundant OM content contributed to the formation of CaCO(3). Therefore, the formation of pedogenic CaCO(3) was a biotic process in the plant community dominated by A. ordosica.

AB Perceived risk of predation is considered to influence individual prey vigilance, but little is known about the extent to which the context (e. g. distance to cover, group size) and the immediate presence of predators determine individual prey vigilance. We combined behavioural data on individual vigilance of herbivores at waterholes with fine-scale spatiotemporal data from 27 African lions, Panthera leo, fitted with GPS radiocollars to test whether individual prey vigilance increases when predators are in the vicinity and whether this relationship is influenced by group size and presence of other herbivores. The study was conducted on giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, and plains zebra, Equus quagga, in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, between mid-September and mid-November 2008. Kudu was the only species to adjust its vigilance level significantly in the presence of lions, arguably owing to its higher contribution to lion diet in Hwange. Kudu devoted a significantly higher proportion of time to vigilance when lions were in the vicinity. Furthermore, the proportion of time spent on individual vigilance decreased as group size increased during the approach and drinking phases, particularly when lions were in the vicinity. Finally, the presence of other herbivores at the waterhole enabled kudu to spend less time vigilant while drinking. These adjustments involved changes in the length of vigilance bouts, but not in their frequency. Our study suggests that the interplay between the context (group size, presence of other prey) and the immediate presence of predators determines the level of vigilance in prey.

AB The Northern Great Plains grasslands respond differently under various climatic conditions; however, there have been no detailed studies investigating the interannual variability in carbon exchange across the entire Northern Great Plains grassland ecosystem. We developed a piecewise regression model to integrate flux tower data with remotely sensed data and mapped the 8-d and 500-m net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for the years from 2000 to 2006. We studied the interannual variability of NEE, characterized the interannual NEE difference in climatically different years, and identified the drought impact on NEE. The results showed that NEE was highly variable in space and time across the 7 yr. Specifically, NEE was consistently low (-35 to 32 g C . m(-2).yr(-1)) with an average annual NEE of -2 +/- 24 g C . m(-2).yr(-1) and a cumulative flux of -15 g C . m(-2). The Northern Great Plains grassland was a weak source for carbon during 2000-2006 because of frequent droughts, which strongly affected the carbon balance, especially in the Western High Plains and Northwestern Great Plains. Comparison of the NEE map with a drought monitor map confirmed a substantial correlation between drought and carbon dynamics. If drought severity or frequency increases in the future, the Northern Great Plains grasslands may become an even greater carbon source.

DE Nestedness; Ecological complex network; Frequency matrix;

AB We propose a new nestedness estimator that takes into account the weight of the interactions, that is, it runs over frequency matrices. A nestedness measurement is calculated through the average distance from each matrix cell containing a link to the cell with the lowest marginal totals, in the packed matrix, using a weighted Manhattan distance. The significance of this nestedness measure is tested against a null model that constraints matrix fill to observed values and retains the distribution of number of events.
   This is the first methodological approach that allows for the characterization of weighted nestedness. We have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) running in Matlab to compute all these parameters. The software is also available as a script for R-package and in C++ version.

AB Behavioural interactions between ecosystem engineers may strongly influence community structure. We tested whether an invasive ecosystem engineer, the alga Caulerpa taxifolia, indirectly facilitated community diversity by modifying the behaviour of a native ecosystem engineer, the clam Anadara trapezia, in southeastern Australia. In this study, clams in Caulerpa-invaded sediments partially unburied themselves, extending >30% of their shell surface above the sediment, providing rare, hard substrata for colonization. Consequently, clams in Caulerpa had significantly higher diversity and abundance of epibiota compared with clams in unvegetated sediments. To isolate the role of clam burial depth from direct habitat influences or differential predation by habitat, we manipulated clam burial depth, predator exposure and habitat (Caulerpa or unvegetated) in an orthogonal experiment. Burial depth overwhelmingly influenced epibiont species richness and abundance, resulting in a behaviourally mediated facilitation cascade. That Caulerpa controls epibiont communities by altering Anadara burial depths illustrates that even subtle behavioural responses of one ecosystem engineer to another can drive extensive community-wide facilitation.

AB Pelagic seabirds obtain food from oceans where the availability of their prey changes rapidly both seasonally and spatially. Here, we investigated changes in the trophic habits of the critically endangered Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus) through the breeding season and tested for dietary differences between sexes and age classes. We analysed delta N-15 and delta C-13 values in blood of adults during the pre-incubation, incubation and chick-rearing periods and of their chicks. Using a two-isotope mixing model, we estimated dietary contributions based on isotope values from potential prey species which included small pelagic species available naturally and demersal fish species available only from trawling discards. Balearic shearwaters showed clear isotopic and dietary variation through the breeding season. During pre-incubation, breeding adults appeared to exploit demersal fish, whereas during the incubation and chick-rearing period, they fed mainly on pelagic anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) and pilchards (Sardina pilchardus). Similarly, chicks were fed mainly with anchovies, a resource with a high energetic value. This variation in the dietary habits of adult shearwaters during the breeding season was probably related to both natural and fishery-induced seasonal changes in the availability of potential prey species within their main feeding grounds. However, changes in the nutritional requirements of the shearwaters could also play an important role. Indeed, diet differed between sexes during pre-incubation: females fed less on trawling discards and more on small pelagic fish than males. This sexual segregation in diet could be the consequence of higher nutritional requirements of females during this period. Our study reveals the differential importance of both trawling discards and small pelagic fish species for a pelagic seabird depending on the breeding period and illustrates the importance of considering the entire breeding season when making inferences about the importance of specific prey in seabird dietary studies.

AB We present a short synthesis of the Pleistocene distribution dynamics and phylogeographic recolonization hypotheses for two temperate European mammal species, the red deer (Cervus elaphus) and the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), for which high-resolution patterns of fossil evidence and genetic data sets are available. Such data are critical to an understanding of the role of hypothesized glacial refugia. Both species show a similar pattern: a relatively wide distribution in the southern part of Central Europe 60,000-25,000 years ago, and a strong restriction to areas in southern Europe for nearly 10,000 years during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the early Late Glacial (25,000-14,700 years ago). With the beginning of Greenland Interstadial 1 (B circle divide lling/Aller circle divide d warming, c. 14,700-11,600 years ago) a sudden range expansion into Central Europe is visible, but the colonization of most of Central Europe, including the northern European Lowlands, only began in the early Holocene. In a European context, regions where the species were distributed during the LGM and early Late Glacial are most relevant as potential origins of recolonization processes, because during these c. 10,000 years distribution ranges were smaller than at any other time in the Late Quaternary. As far as the present distribution of temperate species and their genetic lineages is concerned, so-called 'cryptic refugia' are important only if the species are actually confirmed there during the LGM, as otherwise they could not possibly have contributed to the recolonization that eventually resulted in the present distribution ranges.

AB Urban Expansion Model (UEM) was adapted to simulate urbanization which implements Geospatial Information Systems (GIS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Remote Sensing (RS). Two satellite imageries with specific time interval, socio-economic and environmental variables have been employed in order to simulate urban expansion. Socio-economic and environmental variables were used as inputs while construction and non- construction areas were used as outputs to train the neural network. Calibration of proposed model was performed with area under the ROC Curve (AROC) and Kappa Statistic (KS) which are non-shape performance metric. A real-life case study of Tehran Metropolitan Area (TMA) is presented to demonstrate the process. This paper presents a version of the UEM which parameterized for TMA and explores how factors such as road, building area, service centre, green space, elevation, aspect and slope can influence urbanization. Having urban expansion model with specific time interval and assuming the existence of the same rate of urbanization, new construction areas of region can be predicted. The overall accuracy of the model to predict new construction areas was 80% and 78% with AROC and KS, respectively.

AB P>1. I present an evolutionary ecology interpretation of vegetative dormancy in mature herbaceous perennials. This kind of vegetative dormancy has been noted for at least 40 years, but has only recently become a topic of study.
   2. Vegetative dormancy may be considered in a life-history context. Both vegetative dormancy and mortality typically decrease with increasing size. Vegetative dormancy's relationship to reproduction is more complex, because some species increase flowering and fruiting after dormancy while others do the opposite.
   3. If vegetative dormancy is adaptive, then it is most likely a bet-hedging trait. Dormancy-prone plants are often long-lived, and in such organisms, bet-hedging traits should counter the effects of environmental stochasticity on adult survival. This adaptive context may vary by life span, because in shorter-lived plants, fitness is most sensitive to changes in reproduction rather than survival.
   4. Vegetative dormancy could evolve if the costs of sprouting ever outweigh the benefits. The benefits of sprouting include: (i) photosynthesis and (ii) the opportunity to flower and reproduce. The costs include: (i) greater chance of herbivory, (ii) greater need for limiting nutrients, and (iii) greater maintenance costs. The many losses of photosynthesis among plants suggest that these benefits may not always outweigh the costs.
   5. Vegetative dormancy may be an evolutionary step towards the loss of photosynthesis. Many non-photosynthetic plants acquire carbon from their mycorrhizal fungi. Many autotrophic, dormancy-prone plants also acquire some carbon from their mycorrhizal fungi. Further, non-photosynthetic plants often become dormant to an even greater extent than autotrophic, dormancy-prone plants.
   6.Synthesis Vegetative dormancy often occurs in clades with non-photosynthetic, myco-heterotrophic plants, with implications for the evolution of traits involved in carbon nutrition. The links between vegetative dormancy, other life-history traits, mycorrhizas and the loss of photosynthesis should provide exciting directions for further research in plant evolutionary ecology. Particularly needed is an assessment of the physiology of vegetative dormancy, including whether the mycorrhiza is a carbon source in all dormancy-prone plant species. Equally important is a better understanding of the genetic relationships among photosynthesis, myco-heterotrophy and dormancy.

AB Dust deposition to mountain snow cover, which has increased since the late 19th century, accelerates the rate of snowmelt by increasing the solar radiation absorbed by the snowpack. Snowmelt occurs earlier, but is decoupled from seasonal warming. Climate warming advances the timing of snowmelt and early season phenological events (e. g., the onset of greening and flowering); however, earlier snowmelt without warmer temperatures may have a different effect on phenology. Here, we report the results of a set of snowmelt manipulations in which radiation-absorbing fabric and the addition and removal of dust from the surface of the snowpack advanced or delayed snowmelt in the alpine tundra. These changes in the timing of snowmelt were superimposed on a system where the timing of snowmelt varies with topography and has been affected by increased dust loading. At the community level, phenology exhibited a threshold response to the timing of snowmelt. Greening and flowering were delayed before seasonal warming, after which there was a linear relationship between the date of snowmelt and the timing of phenological events. Consequently, the effects of earlier snowmelt on phenology differed in relation to topography, which resulted in increasing synchronicity in phenology across the alpine landscape with increasingly earlier snowmelt. The consequences of earlier snowmelt from increased dust deposition differ from climate warming and include delayed phenology, leading to synchronized growth and flowering across the landscape and the opportunity for altered species interactions, landscape-scale gene flow via pollination, and nutrient cycling.

AB The grouping behaviour of fish is a widespread phenomenon of high biological significance but little is known as to how consistent individual behavioural differences may affect group joining preferences. When given the option to join either a shy or a bold shoal of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, both shy and bold individuals showed a strong preference for associating with bold fish. Personality type interacted with individual hunger levels to affect the extent of association, suggesting important strategy variation by focal fish in a competitive foraging environment. Furthermore, shoals modified their behaviour in relation to the focal individual. Individual behavioural differences were shown to have a complex role in influencing association preferences as well as driving previously unrecognized behavioural modifications in foraging groups.

AB The mechanisms shaping patterns of biodiversity along spatial gradients remain poorly known and controversial. Hypotheses have emphasized the importance of both environmental and spatial factors. Much of the uncertainty about the relative role of these processes can be attributed to the limited number of comparative studies that evaluate multiple potential mechanisms. This study examines the relative importance of six variables: temperature, precipitation, productivity, habitat heterogeneity, area, and the mid-domain effect on patterns of species richness for non-volant small mammals along four neighboring mountain ranges in central Utah. Along each of these elevational gradients, a hump-shaped relationship of richness with elevation is evident. This study evaluates whether the processes shaping this common pattern are also common to all gradients. Model selection indicates that no one factor or set of factors best explains patterns of species richness across all gradients, and drivers of diversity may vary seasonally. These findings suggest that commonality in the pattern of species richness, even among elevational gradients with a similar biogeographic history and fauna, cannot be attributed to a simple universal explanation.

AB 1. Recently, ecologists have shown interest in examining antioxidant protection in wild animals; carotenoids in particular have received attention as antioxidants that play an important role in mediating health, life-history trade-offs and sexual selection. However, we know almost nothing about the relationships among levels of different antioxidants in wild animals or whether variation in antioxidants can be viewed as a single coherent system.
   2. Here we use a data set of 903 individuals from 99 bird species to examine covariation among concentrations of three types of antioxidants ( uric acid, vitamin E and four carotenoids), and their relationship to a summary measure, Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), both inter- and intraspecifically in 30 species.
   3. Three axes were necessary to adequately describe variation in nine antioxidant measures, and these axes corresponded to the basic categories of antioxidant measured: uric acid, vitamin E and carotenoids. There was substantial heterogeneity in the correlations across species.
   4. TEAC covaried strongly with uric acid levels, both interspecifically and in 23 of the 30 species. Concentrations of different carotenoids covaried both inter- and intraspecifically, but there was also substantial variance explained by each carotenoid independent of the others. Vitamin E concentration did not robustly correlate with any other antioxidant parameters.
   5. Overall, we show that although antioxidants tend to covary with those of similar type, these correlations demonstrate evolutionary lability and/or ecological heterogeneity. Even the most general associations are absent in some species, suggesting that conceptualization of a single antioxidant system is oversimplified and that ecological studies attempting to examine antioxidant function should use multiple measures.

AB Quaternary climatic oscillations greatly influenced the present-day population genetic structure of animals and plants. For species with high dispersal and reproductive potential, phylogeographic patterns resulting from historical processes can be cryptic, overshadowed by contemporary processes. Here we report a study of the phylogeography of Odocoileus hemionus, a large, vagile ungulate common throughout western North America. We examined sequence variation of mitochondrial DNA (control region and cytochrome b) within and among 70 natural populations across the entire range of the species. Among the 1766 individual animals surveyed, we recovered 496 haplotypes. Although fine-scale phylogenetic structure was weakly resolved using phylogenetic methods, network analysis clearly revealed the presence of 12 distinct haplogroups. The spatial distribution of haplogroups showed a strong genetic discontinuity between the two morphological types of O. hemionus, mule deer and black-tailed deer, east and west of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. Within the mule deer lineage, we identified several haplogroups that expanded before or during the Last Glacial Maximum, suggesting that mule deer persisted in multiple refugia south of the ice sheets. Patterns of genetic diversity within the black-tailed deer lineage suggest a single refugium along the Pacific Northwest coast, and refute the hypothesis that black-tailed deer persisted in one or more northern refugia. Our data suggest that black-tailed deer recolonized areas in accordance with the pattern of glacial retreat, with initial recolonization northward along a coastal route and secondary recolonization inland.

AB Human settlements have a strong influence on bird communities. To explore the size effect of the urbanized area in avian community structure, we examined changes in species richness, composition and abundance along urban-rural gradients of different extensions. We measured land-cover variables and surveyed birds along nine urban-rural gradients in the Pampean region of Argentina. In towns over 7000 inh, increasing constructed area was negatively related to species richness. In towns over 13 000 inh, the abundance of native species decreased towards the urban core whereas total abundance increased, decreased or remained constant depending on town characteristics. In villages (< 2000 inh), small (2000-14000 inh) and large towns (> 60000 inh), there was a constant representation of the rural community composition along gradients. In towns of intermediate sizes (> 14000-60 000 inh), species composition was more similar to that from the rural zone as this zone was approached. Similarity between both urban-core and peripheral points and the rural zone decreased with increasing gradient extension. It appears to be a size threshold for community sensitivity to urbanization below which the impact on community attributes is insignificant; increasing urbanization above the threshold level had pronounced effects on bird assemblages. Research approaches separating responses of native and exotic species to urbanization enhance our understanding to favor native birds and quality of urban bird communities. The size of the urbanized area is a key factor in policies designed to improve ecosystem health and human interactions with nature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Galician sympatric ecotypes of Littorina saxatilis have been proposed as a model system for studying parallel ecological speciation. Such a model system makes a clear prediction: candidate loci (for divergent adaptation) should present a higher level of geographical differentiation than noncandidate (neutral) loci. We used 2356 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and four microsatellite loci to identify candidate loci for ecological adaptation using the F-ST outlier method. Three per cent of the studied AFLP loci were identified as candidate loci associated with adaptation, after multitest adjustments, thus contributing to ecotype differentiation (candidate loci were not detected within ecotypes). Candidate and noncandidate loci were analysed separately at four different F-ST partitions: differences between ecotypes (overall and local), differences between localities and micro-geographical differences within ecotypes. The magnitude of F-ST differed between candidate and noncandidate loci for all partitions except in the case of microgeographical differentiation within ecotypes, and the microsatellites (putatively neutral) showed an identical pattern to noncandidate loci. Thus, variation in candidate loci is determined partially independent by divergent natural selection (in addition to stochastic forces) at each locality, while noncandidate loci are exclusively driven by stochastic forces. These results support the evolutionary history described for these particular populations, considered to be a clear example of incomplete sympatric ecological speciation.

AB Knowledge of the persistence of regular larch budmoth outbreaks is limited in space and time. Although dendrochronological methods have been used to reconstruct insect outbreaks, their presence may be obscured by climatic influences.
   More than 5000 tree-ring series from 70 larch host and 73 spruce nonhost sites within the European Alps and Tatra Mountains were compiled. Site-specific assessment of growth-climate responses and the application of six larch budmoth detection methods considering host, nonhost and instrumental time-series revealed spatiotemporal patterns of insect defoliation across the Alpine arc.
   Annual maps of reconstructed defoliation showed historical persistence of cyclic outbreaks at the site level, recurring c. every 8-9 yr. Larch budmoth outbreaks occurred independently of rising temperatures from the Little Ice Age until recent warmth. Although no collapse in outbreak periodicity was recorded at the local scale, synchronized Alpine-wide defoliation has ceased during recent decades.
   Our study demonstrates the persistence of recurring insect outbreaks during AD 1700-2000 and emphasizes that a widely distributed tree-ring network and novel analysis methods can contribute towards an understanding of the changes in outbreak amplitude, synchrony and climate dependence.

AB A goal of seabird ecology is to relate the physiology, population dynamics, distribution and behaviour of seabirds with their biotic and abiotic environments. One of the most challenging aspects is to understand how seabirds interact with their environment when direct observations are not always possible or practical. In the present paper, we reviewed 218 published studies that examined associations between seabird distribution, behaviour and their environment, in order to assess current trends, weaknesses and the future directions of research. Based on the number of publications, it is evident that the field is growing rapidly and that methods for evaluating seabird distribution are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and are changing from Eulerian (grid-like) to Lagrangian (particle-like) data types. This has been accompanied by a reduction in the spatial and temporal scale of observation, where, in most cases, no behavioural information is inferred from Lagrangian data; instead they are often used as if they were Eulerian data. In parallel, environmental remote sensing is becoming more common; however, we did not record significant changes in the statistical approaches used to describe seabird distributions and used to link them with oceanographic variables. In particular, despite the spatially explicit nature of the data, spatial statistics have rarely been used. The vast majority of studies used environmental variables that described water masses (descriptive approach), whereas a few studies determined oceanographic features that enhance prey availability to seabirds (process-based approach). Future studies could enhance their ecological interpretation of seabird-environment interactions by making greater use of ad hoc statistical approaches that facilitate appropriate pattern detection (e.g. area-restricted searching pattern for birds, mesoscale patterns for environment). Furthermore, appropriate hypothesis testing and modelling that accounts for the spatially explicit, multiscale and multivariate nature of the interaction between seabirds and their habitats is recommended. Although quantitative methods currently exist (but are rarely used), further application could greatly improve our understanding of the processes linking seabird distribution to their environment.

AB Repeated exposure and flooding of the Sunda and Sahul shelves during Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations is thought to have contributed to the isolation and diversification of sea-basin populations within the Coral Triangle. This hypothesis has been tested in numerous phylogeographical studies, recovering an assortment of genetic patterns that the authors have generally attributed to differences in larval dispersal capability or adult habitat specificity. This study compares phylogeographical patterns from mitochondrial COI sequences among two co-distributed seastars that differ in their adult habitat and dispersal ability, and two seastar ectosymbionts that differ in their degree of host specificity. Of these, only the seastar Linckia laevigata displayed a classical pattern of Indian-Pacific divergence, but with only moderate genetic structure (Phi(CT) = 0.067). In contrast, the seastar Protoreaster nodosus exhibited strong structure (Phi(CT) = 0.23) between Teluk Cenderawasih and the remainder of Indonesia, a pattern of regional structure that was echoed in L. laevigata (Phi(CT) = 0.03) as well as its obligate gastropod parasite Thyca crystallina (Phi(CT) = 0.04). The generalist commensal shrimp, Periclimenes soror showed little genetic structuring across the Coral Triangle. Despite species-specific phylogeographical patterns, all four species showed departures from neutrality that are consistent with massive range expansions onto the continental shelves as the sea levels rose, and that date within the Pleistocene epoch. Our results suggest that habitat differences may affect the manner in which species responded to Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, shaping contemporary patterns of genetic structure and diversity.

AB Although genetic approaches to questions in fisheries management have been very useful in the past, they have encountered consistent hurdles despite the development of new marker systems. However, recent technological advances in molecular genetics will help to overcome many of these hurdles and are likely to revolutionize fish and fisheries biology. DNA-sequencing costs have been decreasing exponentially, and recent breakthroughs have led to rapid increase in throughput that allows sequencing the entire expressed genome of a non-model organism with standard project budgets. Increase in screening throughput and number of available markers, reduction in costs and improved insights into gene function and control of gene expression will allow applications that were impossible until recently. Here, we briefly recount the recent history of fisheries genetics, provide an outlook on near-term and long-term developments in genetic technology and consider their applications and implications for fisheries science and education.

   HUMAN EXCLUSION; NORTH-ATLANTIC; SOUTH-AFRICA; BODY-SIZE; SEA; EVOLUTION
AB In this paper I argue that there is a growing body of evidence supporting an increasingly central position of coastal environments in human evolution and dispersals, rather than as merely peripheral habitats. Eustatic fluctuations during glacial cycles have meant that most prehistoric coastlines are now underwater, and lack of evidence to date of a close relationship between people and the coast can be most plausibly ascribed to the limited studies so far on submerged sites. Coastal environments provide high diversity in food resources, consisting of multiple ecotones in close proximity, which reduces the need to forage widely. One of the richest and most easily exploited coastal resources by human populations living on the coast are molluscs from marine rocky intertidal communities, which recent evidence has highlighted as important as far back as the Middle Palaeolithic. However, the density of these resources is limited by a number of factors, and this varies geographically. One of the main large-scale factors limiting rocky intertidal mollusc densities is tidal amplitude, beyond which smaller-scale local factors such as exposure to wave action and shore aspect, further affect species distributions. The area around the Strait of Gibraltar is used as a case Study of an area, which is affected by large variations in tidal amplitudes thus allowing for quantitative comparisons between taxonomically and climatically similar regions. Shorelines along the Mediterranean coast, with reduced tidal amplitudes, exhibit compressed zonations and harbour fewer macro-mollusc individuals, with the reverse being the case along the Atlantic coast, which has significantly larger tides. Data from Middle and Upper Palaeolithic sites along the Strait are used to establish harvested species and present-day data are used to model the potential distributions and associated variables such as calorific returns of key food species. An optimal foraging model is used to explore the effects of differential levels of resource availability along these coastlines. Results suggest that the nature and variability of the coastline has a direct influence on the tempo and mode of subsistence strategy followed and whether certain strategies can be adopted at all. The possible implications of these biogeographical distributions for foraging economics, dispersals and social structures in Homo are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To better delineate the relative contribution of shelf and slope production to the northern California Current (NCC) pelagic community, we examined the cross-shelf distribution of delta C-13 in 19 species of nekton, three species of Cancer decapod larvae, five gelatinous zooplankton, two dominant euphausiid species (Thysanoessa spinifera and Euphausia pacifica), calanoid copepods (Acartia sp. and Pseudocalanus sp.), and particulate organic matter (POM). Results showed C-13 enrichment from nearshore shelf sites relative to offshore slope sites at all trophic levels. For POM, a significant trend in delta C-13 with log chlorophyll a (Chl a) was observed, with high Chl a values associated with shelf primary production. Copepods, gelatinous zooplankton, and nekton showed a significant linear decrease in delta C-13 with distance offshore. Nekton and gelatinous zooplankton associated with very nearshore shelf waters (< 10 km distance offshore) had the highest delta C-13 values, whereas those off the slope (> 20 km offshore) were more depleted in C-13. A comparison of results from nonparametric analysis of the pelagic community data to environmental variables also showed variables associated with the shelf and oceanic waters, with distance offshore, sea surface temperature (10 m in depth), and bottom depth being significant. Because pelagic systems are highly dynamic in space and time, our study indicated that delta C-13 could be used as an indicator of relative nearshore and offshore production across multiple trophic levels, even in active upwelling ecosystems such as the NCC.

AB Predictive species distribution models have become increasingly common in conservation management. Among them, envelope-based approaches like the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) are particularly advantageous, as they require only presence data. Based on the assumption that the absolute frequency of species presence is a direct indicator of habitat suitability (HS), habitat suitability indices (HSI) are computed. However, this assumption may be misleading when the scarcity of optimal habitat forces most of the individuals to live in suboptimal conditions. This often happens when the environmental conditions in the study area represent only a marginal part of the species fundamental niche.
   In this study we propose three new HS algorithms for ENFA models, which address such 'edge of niche' situations. The first algorithm (area-adjusted median, M-a) takes the availability of environmental conditions in the study area into account, the second (median + extremum, M-e) addresses situations where the species' optimum is at or beyond the extremum of the investigated environmental gradient, and the third (area-adjusted median + extremum, M-ae) combines both approaches. These algorithms were applied to two populations of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), situated in different positions relative to the environmental gradient represented in the respective study area, and compared with the classical median algorithm (M). We evaluated the models using cross-validation and a comparison with an expert model based on external data.
   In both study areas, the HS maps obtained with the three new algorithms differed visibly from those calculated with the median algorithm. Cross-validation and comparison with external data showed that the new algorithms always provided better models, with the extremum-based algorithms (M-e and M-ae) performing best. We conclude that the new algorithms can extend the applicability of ENFA-models to a broader range of conservation relevant species by improving HS calculations for skewed species-habitat relationships in marginal habitats.

AB Adaptive evolution within species and community assembly involving multiple species are both affected by dispersal and spatiotemporal environmental variation and may thus interact with each other. We examined this interaction in a simple three-patch metacommunity and found that these two processes produce very different associations between species composition and local environment. In most conditions, we find a pattern we call "species sorting," wherein local adaptation by resident species cannot prevent invasions by other preadapted species as environmental conditions change (strong association between local environmental conditions and local community composition). When dispersal rates are very low relative to the other two rates, local adaptation by resident species predominates, leading to strong priority effects that prevent successful colonization by other species that would have been well adapted, a pattern we call " local monopolization." When dispersal and evolutionary rates are both very high, we find that an evolving species outcompetes other species in all patches, a pattern we call " global monopolization." When environmental oscillations are very frequent, local monopolization predominates. Our findings indicate that there can be strong modification of community assembly by local adaptive processes and that these depend strongly on the relative rates of evolution, dispersal, and environmental change.

AB Foliar respiration is a major component of ecosystem respiration, yet extrapolations are often uncertain in tropical forests because of indirect estimates of leaf area index (LAI). A portable tower was used to directly measure LAI and night-time foliar respiration from 52 vertical transects throughout an old-growth tropical rain forest in Costa Rica. In this study, we (1) explored the effects of structural, functional and environmental variables on foliar respiration; (2) extrapolated foliar respiration to the ecosystem; and (3) estimated ecosystem respiration. Foliar respiration temperature response was constant within plant functional group, and foliar morphology drove much of the within-canopy variability in respiration and foliar nutrients. Foliar respiration per unit ground area was 3.5 +/- 0.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and ecosystem respiration was 9.4 +/- 0.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) [soil = 41%; foliage = 37%; woody = 14%; coarse woody debris (CWD) = 7%]. When modelled with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) year temperatures, foliar respiration was 9% greater than when modelled with temperatures from a normal year, which is in the range of carbon sink versus source behaviour for this forest. Our ecosystem respiration estimate from component fluxes was 33% greater than night-time net ecosystem exchange for the same forest, suggesting that studies reporting a large carbon sink for tropical rain forests based solely on eddy flux measurements may be in error.

AB 1. An important target for conservation planning is the minimum amount of habitat needed in a landscape to ensure the persistence of a species. Appropriate targets can be determined by identifying thresholds in the amount of habitat, below which persistence, abundance or occupancy declines rapidly. Although some studies have identified habitat thresholds, we currently have little understanding of the extent to which thresholds vary spatially. This is important for establishing whether we can apply the same planning targets across broad geographical regions.
   2. We quantified habitat-occupancy relationships for the koala Phascolarctos cinereus (Goldfuss) in three study regions that span much of its geographical range. Standard and piecewise (broken-stick/segmented) logistic regression were used to model linear and threshold habitat-occupancy relationships. We then used an information-theoretic approach to test: (1) whether habitat-occupancy relationships were described better by threshold or linear models and (2) where threshold models were better, whether, and to what extent, threshold points varied among study regions.
   3. There was substantially greater support for the threshold than the linear models across a range of habitat qualities and landscape extents. The threshold models generally predicted a rapid decline in occupancy below the threshold points.
   4. Estimated threshold points varied, sometimes substantially, among study regions. This may relate to cross-regional differences in habitat quality, demographic rates, and land-use patterns. The role of habitat fragmentation is unclear.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Variation in threshold points among study regions suggests that we should be wary of using thresholds derived in one region for setting conservation planning targets in another. Rather, we should aim to set specific targets for individual locations (and species), while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in these targets. This has implications for our ability to make general conservation prescriptions for widely distributed species. Future research should aim to develop generic models capable of predicting threshold responses across different landscapes and life-history characteristics.

AB Stream temperature was monitored at five mainstem locations and one tributary location on the Girnock Burn, a 31-km(2) tributary catchment of the Aberdeenshire Dee in north-east Scotland. Stream temperature was recorded at 15-min resolution between April 2003 and March 2006 to investigate the influence of semi-natural riparian woodland on the spatial and temporal variability of stream temperature and the influence that this had on the performance of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Two upstream sites were located in open moorland locations, while three downstream sites were located in areas of mixed deciduous/coniferous woodland areas at progressive distances of 0.75, 1.5 and 2.0 kin from the upstream edge of continuous riparian tree cover. The effects of riparian woodland on stream temperature varied through the year, increasing during the spring to a maximum in summer, before decreasing once again in autumn. Maximum, mean and diel temperature amplitude were lower and minimum temperatures higher at woodland sites when compared to those located in open moorland. Although significant differences in fish performance were detected between sites, the influence of temperature variability was unclear due to confounding factors, some of which could not be measured during the study. It is recommended that future studies should combine advances in field-based temperature monitoring with those in hydroclimatology to develop realistic process-based models that can be used for stream temperature prediction. Further advances are needed in understanding the relationship between naturally variable thermal regime and fish performance in order that ecological predictions can be usefully made from field and modelled temperature data.

AB Large urban parks can support a diverse bird community. However, the effects of variability among habitats and of park management on bird assemblages are poorly understood. We studied bird communities within the Yarkon Park, Tel Aviv, the largest urban park in Israel. We examined species richness, abundance and community composition across 20 locations that differ in levels of park management to identify habitat variables responsible for variation in bird richness and composition. Of 91 recorded bird species, 13 were aliens (14%), 4 were urban exploiters (4%), 54 were urban adapters (60%) and 20 were migrants (22%). Management had a significant effect on native bird richness and bird community structure varied among areas with different management regimes. Species richness of all the above species' groups was lowest in intensively managed areas. Areas with intermediate levels of management had higher or equal richness compared to unmanaged areas. The majority of urban exploiters were found at all locations within the park reaching their highest abundances in intensively managed areas. Species richness of alien birds did not vary across levels of management. Bird species richness was negatively associated with lawn cover and with distance from nearest water source and was positively associated with the number of woody plant species. We suggest that urban parks should be designed such that the heterogeneity of native vegetation is preserved, if we aim to maintain native bird species diversity and minimize urban exploiter and alien species. When lightly managed or unmanaged, urban parks can retain large remnants of sub-natural habitats and can serve as important contributors to the conservation of native biodiversity within a large urban metropolis.

AB Dynamic climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene had profound effects on the distributions of species across North America. Although the role of historical climate change on speciation remains controversial, the impact on genetic variation within species has been well documented. We examined mtDNA sequences from the cytochrome b gene (1117 bp) and a portion of the NADH-4 gene (659 bp) for 286 individuals of Diadophis punctatus to infer phylogeographic patterns and population structure and to examine historical demographic patterns in both glaciated and unglaciated regions of North America. We inferred 14 lineages that replace each other geographically across the United States. Several of these lineages appear to be confined to specific habitats (floodplains, grasslands, montane environments) and traverse previously identified genetic barriers for terrestrial vertebrates including the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers, the Appalachian Mountains, and the western continental divide. We also observed overlapping ranges between some haplotype groups and several instances of secondary contact associated with ecological transition zones in eastern South Carolina, southern Oklahoma and central California. Within the US, diversification began during the late Miocene and continued into the mid-Pleistocene, suggesting these lineages pre-dated the last glacial maximum. Coalescent and non-coalescent demographic analyses indicate that independent lineages currently occupying previously glaciated or unsuitable areas in eastern, central and western US underwent post-glacial population expansion likely from southern refugia during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene. Conversely, southern lineages display patterns consistent with long-term population stability. Such long-term persistence of genetic structure may be due to the competitive effects between lineages or ecosystem stability in more southern latitudes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An increasing awareness of the effects that the spatial scale of source maps may have on landscape analyses has lately prompted much research on this topic. Nevertheless, previous studies have just focused on describing the variations of different landscape metrics with scale, while the scale impact on the actual decision-making and landscape planning derived from connectivity analyses has not yet been tackled. We examined the influence of varying minimum mapping unit (MMU) and spatial extent on the prioritization of patches by their importance for the conservation of overall landscape connectivity, according to 10 different metrics as management support tools. We analyzed the forest patches distribution in three study zones within Spain with diverse spatial configuration from CORINE land cover data. Our results showed that the probability of connectivity, the area-weighted flux and the integral index of connectivity are the most robust metrics in terms of patches prioritization, while the results provided by the number of components, graph diameter and class coincidence probability are strongly scale-dependent. We found that scale sensitivity of the overall landscape metric value is not related to scale sensitivity in terms of patches prioritization. We provide guidelines for an appropriate selection of connectivity metrics and scale of analysis for landscape conservation planning and related applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Most plant diversity-function studies have been conducted in terrestrial ecosystems and have focused on plant productivity and nutrient uptake/retention, with a notable lack of attention paid to belowground processes (e. g., root dynamics, decomposition, trace gas fluxes). Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we assessed how the richness of emergent macrophyte functional groups influences aboveground and belowground plant growth and microbial-mediated functions related to carbon and nitrogen cycling, with an emphasis on methane (CH4) efflux and potential denitrification rates. We found that an increase in the richness of wetland plant functional groups enhanced belowground plant biomass, altered rooting patterns, and decreased methane efflux, while having no effect on aboveground plant production or denitrification potential. We hypothesize that the greater root production and increased rooting depth in the highest diversity treatments enhanced CH4 oxidation to a relatively greater degree than methane production, leading to an overall decrease in CH4 efflux across our plant functional group richness gradient.

AB In this study, we conducted eddy covariance (EC) measurements of water vapor exchange over a typical steppe in a semi-arid area of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, China. Measurement sites were located within a 25-year-old enclosure with a relatively low leaf area index (similar to 1. 5 m(2) m(-2)) and dominated by Leymus chinensis. Energy balance closure was (H + LE) = 17.09 + 0.69 x (Rn - G) (W/m(2); r(2) = 0.95, n = 6596). Precipitation during the two growing seasons of the study period was similar to the long-term average. The peak evapotranspiration in 2004 was 4 mm d(-1), and 3.5 mm d(-1) in 2003. The maximum latent heat flux was higher than the sensible heat flux, and the sensible heat flux dominated the energy budget at midday during the entire growing season in 2003; latent heat flux was the main consumption component for net radiation during the 2004 growing season. During periods of frozen soil in 2003 and 2004, the sensible heat flux was the primary consumption component for net radiation. The soil heat flux component was similar in 2003 and 2004. The decoupling coefficient (between 0.5 and 0.1) indicates that evapotranspiration was strongly controlled by saturation water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in this grassland. The results of this research suggest that energy exchange and evapotranspiration were controlled by the phenology of the vegetation and soil water content. In addition, the amount and frequency of rainfall significantly affect energy exchange and evapotranspiration upon the Inner Mongolia plateau. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Aim A major endeavour of community ecology is documenting non-random patterns in the composition and body size of coexisting species, and inferring the processes, or assembly rules, that may have given rise to the observed patterns. Such assembly rules include species sorting resulting from interspecific competition, aggregation at patchily distributed resources, and co-evolutionary dynamics. However, for any given taxon, relatively little is known about how these patterns and processes change through time and vary with habitat type, disturbance history, and spatial scale. Here, we tested for non-random patterns of species co-occurrence and body size in assemblages of ground-foraging ants and asked whether those patterns varied with habitat type, disturbance history, and spatial scale.
   Location Burned and unburned forests and fens in the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon and northern California, USA.
   Methods We describe ground-foraging ant assemblages sampled over two years in two discrete habitat types, namely Darlingtonia fens and upland forests. Half of these sites had been subject to a large-scale, discrete disturbance - a major fire - in the year prior to our first sample. We used null model analyses to compare observed species co-occurrence patterns and body-size distributions in these assemblages with randomly generated assemblages unstructured by competition both within (i.e. at a local spatial scale) and among (i.e. at a regional scale) sites.
   Results At local spatial scales, species co-occurrence patterns and body-size ratios did not differ from randomness. At regional scales, co-occurrence patterns were random or aggregated, and there was evidence for constant body-size ratios of forest ants. Although these patterns varied between habitats and years, they did not differ between burned and unburned sites.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that the operation of assembly rules depends on spatial scale and habitat type, but that it was not affected by disturbance history from fire.

AB Ecological service forest (ESF) is established to maintain ecological processes and protect the environment. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of these forests to regional carbon storage and explore their carbon sequestration potential after ecosystem restoration. We sampled 149 stands from 6 to 41 years old, covering 101,800 km(2), in Zhejiang Province, in China's eastern subtropical zone. The samples included four types of ESF: evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, pine (Pinus massoniana) forest, and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forest. The mean values of biomass in evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, pine forest, and Chinese fir forest were 89.19, 70.06, 51.25, and 54.15 t ha(-1) respectively. The NPP for the four types of ESF ranged from 4.41 to 8.35 t ha(-1) year(-1). Carbon densities for the four types of ESF were lower than the mean values (36-57.07 t C ha(-1)) for China because the ESFs are relatively young in Zhejiang Province. Overall, biomass, litter production, NPP, and carbon density were all significantly lower in pine forest and Chinese fir forest than in evergreen broad-leaved forest, whereas the values for the coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest were intermediate. These results suggest that the evergreen broad-leaved forest has great potential for offsetting CO, emissions, and that promoting succession from coniferous forests to evergreen broad-leaved forest can enhance carbon sinks in the forests of subtropical China. The next 50 years (as these forests mature) will represent an important period to enhance the carbon sink in Zhejiang Province. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lizard genus Liolaemus is endemic to temperate South America and includes 190 species. Liolaemus bibronii has a large geographic distribution and inhabits a great diversity of habitats, including the Monte, Steppe, and high Andean grassland environments. Liolaemus gracilis has a similar body size and shape to L. bibronii; the two are parapatrically distributed, and L. gracilis is also widely distributed. Here we use the mtDNA cytb sequence data of these two species to investigate lizard phylogeographic patterns in southern South Artierica. L. bibronii is paraphyletic with respect to L. gracilis, Lioloemus ramirezae, Liolaemus robertmertensi and Liolaemus saxatilis; it is composed of many genetically different allopatric haploclades, some of which are reciprocally monophyletic. We also found evidence for introgression between L. bibronii and L. gracilis in the same area that introgression was hypothesized in the Liolaemus dariwinii complex. We discuss the distribution of the major haploclades with inferences of their population histories, the concordance of these clades' distributions and histories with other lizard complexes studied with the same markers and methods, and taxonomic implications of these results.

AB Forest integrity has been proposed as one conservation endpoint that integrates desirable characteristics such as natural biodiversity, stand structure and continuity. Although its defining criteria are still under discussion, any surrogates must effectively represent or predict their status, and be easier to measure than the criteria themselves. Bryophytes have been proposed as such surrogates, because they are important components of forest integrity, and considerable research indicates that some groups are sensitive to the changes associated with specific forest management regimes. The objectives of this paper are (1) to review the issues in determining indicators of forest integrity, including desirable qualities in such indicators, (2) to review the state of knowledge concerning bryophytes as components of forest integrity (i.e. their responses to forest management practices), and (3) to assess bryophytes as potential indicators of forest integrity, in terms of both qualities desirable in indicators and our understanding of bryophyte response patterns. Although bryophytes possess some characteristics that suggest potential indicator value, many challenges prevent their reliable application. I highlight key areas in which research is required to identify operational bryophyte indicators of forest integrity. Along with a standardized protocol to select and calibrate such indicators, we urgently require strategic research to compile data on undisturbed reference forests on which to base selection of endpoints; species-specific ecological tolerances, with consideration of complex interactions; mechanisms of response to disturbance, with consideration of temporal aspects; population viability thresholds; and recruitment effects on community assembly.

AB In this paper, we have considered a prey-predator-type fishery model with Beddington-DeAngelis functional response and selective harvesting of predator species. We have established that when the time delay is zero, the interior equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable provided it is locally asymptotically stable. It is also shown that the time delay can cause a stable equilibrium to become unstable and even a switching of stabilities. Lastly, some numerical simulations are carried out. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Urbanization is dramatically changing nutrient and organic matter regimes in streams, yet the community and ecosystem implications often remain obscure. We assessed the consequences of sewage- derived particulate organic matter ( SDPOM) for invertebrate community structure and function in a headwater stream. Using stable isotope analyses, we found assimilation of organic SDPOM to double community secondary production, and stoichiometric analyses revealed SDPOM enriched in phosphorus ( P) to foster putatively fast-growing, P-rich consumers in the subsidized reach. This altered consumer - resource stoichiometry impacted both community structure and nutrient fluxes through the invertebrate community. Community structure shifted toward significantly reduced diversity and evenness in the subsidized reach and consequently toward shorter food chains. Our integration of ecological stoichiometry with stable isotope analyses and food web ecology expands the previous focus of traditional ecotoxicology and ecophysiology to an ecosystem-level appreciation of pollutant ecology.

AB Freshwater crayfish species in the subgenus Aviticambarus (Cambaridae: Cambarus) are restricted to caves along the Cumberland Plateau, the Sequatchie Valley, and the Highland Rim which extend along the Tennessee River in southcentral Tennessee and northern Alabama. Historically, three stygobitic species, Cambarus jonesi, Cambarus hamulatus, and Cambarusveitchorum,comprise this subgenus. We examine species' boundaries and phylogeographic structure of this imperiled Southern Appalachian assemblage to shed light oil patterns of cave colonization. We also provide estimates of genetic diversity for conservation status assessment. Using geologic evidence, phylogeographic analyses, and sequence data from five gene regions (two nuclear: Historic H3 and GAPDH and three mitochondrial: 12S, 16S, and CO1 totaling almost 2700 base pairs), we identify two well-supported cryptic species in addition to the three currently recognized taxa. Four of these taxa exhibit low levels of genetic variation both currently and historically, which may indicate local extirpation events associated with geological and river basin changes. Our results also support other recent findings that pre-Pleistocene paleodrainages may best explain the current patterns of aquatic faunal biodiversity in the Southern Appalachians.

AB 1. Geostatistical models based on Euclidean distance fail to represent the spatial configuration, connectivity, and directionality of sites in a stream network and may not be ecologically relevant for many chemical, physical and biological studies of freshwater streams. Functional distance measures, such as symmetric and asymmetric hydrologic distance, more accurately represent the transfer of organisms, material and energy through stream networks. However, calculating the hydrologic distances for a large study area remains challenging and substituting hydrologic distance for Euclidean distance may violate geostatistical modelling assumptions.
   2. We provide a review of geostatistical modelling assumptions and discuss the statistical and ecological consequences of substituting hydrologic distance measures for Euclidean distance. We also describe a new family of autocovariance models that we developed for stream networks, which are based on hydrologic distance measures.
   3. We describe the geographical information system (GIS) methodology used to generate spatial data necessary for geostatistical modelling in stream networks. We also provide an example that illustrates the methodology used to create a valid covariance matrix based on asymmetric hydrologic distance and weighted by discharge volume, which can be incorporated into common geostatistical models.
   4. The methodology and tools described supply ecologically meaningful and statistically valid geostatistical models for stream networks. They also provide stream ecologists with the opportunity to develop their own functional measures of distance and connectivity, which will improve geostatistical models developed for stream networks in the future.
   5. The GIS tools presented here are being made available in order to facilitate the application of valid geostatistical modelling in freshwater ecology.

AB The magnitude and seasonal dynamics of evapotranspiration (ET) for a steppe in central Mongolia was estimated over a full year period (from 25 March 2003 to 24 March 2004, 366 days) using the eddy covariance (EC) technique. The steppe, typical of central Mongotia, is dominated by temperate C-3 plants and experiences moderate grazing. The environmental constrains over ET for the steppe were evaluated by examining the responses of ET to biotic (leaf area index) and abiotic (atmospheric evaporative demand and soil moisture condition) factors. Seasonal variations in ET followed closely the variation in leaf area index. Change in soil moisture was the most important environmental factor controlling the dynamics of ET in this grassland ecosystem, indicated by the strong susceptibility of ET and the Priestley-Taylor parameter (alpha, calculated as the ratio of the measured ET to the equilibrium ET) to soil water content. The alpha also showed a distinct seasonal variability, but its value on average was tower than 0.5 during most of the measurement period, suggesting that the steppe was limited in water supply. The maximum daily ET rate was 2.8 mm d(-1). Cumulative ET during the study period estimated directly by the EC method was 163 mm, which was 66% of the precipitation received at the site during the same time period (248 mm).

AB Several mechanisms for self-enhancing feedback instabilities in marine ecosystems are identified and briefly elaborated. It appears that adverse phases of operation may be abruptly triggered by explosive breakouts in abundance of one or more previously suppressed populations. Moreover, an evident capacity of marine organisms to accomplish extensive geographic habitat expansions may expand and perpetuate a breakout event. This set of conceptual elements provides a framework for interpretation of a sequence of events that has occurred in the Northern Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem (off south-western Africa). This history can illustrate how multiple feedback loops might interact with one another in unanticipated and quite malignant ways, leading not only to collapse of customary resource stocks but also to degradation of the ecosystem to such an extent that disruption of customary goods and services may go beyond fisheries alone to adversely affect other major global ecosystem concerns (e.g. proliferations of jellyfish and other slimy, stingy, toxic and/or noxious organisms, perhaps even climate change itself, etc.). The wisdom of management interventions designed to interrupt an adverse mode of feedback operation is pondered. Research pathways are proposed that may lead to improved insights needed: (i) to avoid potential 'triggers' that might set adverse phases of feedback loop operation into motion; and (ii) to diagnose and properly evaluate plausible actions to reverse adverse phases of feedback operation that might already have been set in motion. These pathways include the drawing of inferences from available 'quasi-experiments' produced either by short-term climatic variation or inadvertently in the course of biased exploitation practices, and inter-regional applications of the comparative method of science.

AB We studied frog biodiversity along an elevational gradient in the Hengduan Mountains, China. Endemic and non-endemic elevational diversity patterns were examined individually. Competing hypotheses were also tested for these patterns. Species richness of total frogs, endemics and non-endemics peaked at mid-elevations. The peak in endemic species richness was at higher elevations than the maxima of total species richness. Endemic species richness followed the mid-domain model predictions, and showed a nonlinear relationship with temperature. Water and energy were the most important variables in explaining elevational patterns of non-endemic species richness. A suite of interacting climatic and geometric factors best explained total species richness patterns along the elevational gradient. We suggest that the mid-domain effect was an important factor to explain elevational richness patterns, especially in regions with high endemism.

AB We use a combination of microsatellite marker analysis and mate-choice behavior experiments to assess patterns of reproductive isolation of the tungara frog Physalaemus pustulosus along a 550-km transect of 25 populations in Costa Rica and Panama. Earlier studies using allozymes and mitochondrial DNA defined two genetic groups of tdngara frogs, one ranging from Mexico to northern Costa Rica (northern group), the second ranging from Panama to northern South America (southern group). Our more fine-scale survey also shows that the northern and southern tungara frogs are genetically different and geographically separated by a gap in the distribution in central Pacific Costa Rica. Genetic differences among populations are highly correlated with geographic distances. Temporal call parameters differed among populations as well as between genetic groups. Differences in calls were explained better by geographic distance than by genetic distance. Phonotaxis experiments showed that females preferred calls of males from their own populations over calls of males from other populations in about two-thirds to three-fourths of the contrasts tested. In mating experiments, females and males from the same group and females from the north with males from the south produced nests and tadpoles. In contrast, females from the south did not produce nests or tadpoles with males from the north. Thus, northern and southern tungara frogs have diverged both genetically and bioacoustically. There is evidence for some prezygotic isolation due to differences in mate recognition and fertilization success, but such isolation is hardly complete. Our results support the general observation that significant differences in sexual signals are often not correlated with strong genetic differentiation.

AB Death feigning is fairly common in a number of taxa, but the adaptive significance of this behaviour is still unclear and has seldom been tested. To date, all proposed hypotheses have assumed that prey manage to escape predation by sending a death-mimicking signal, although death-feigning postures are markedly different from those of dead animals. Moreover, the efficacy of this technique may largely depend on the foraging mode of the predator; death feigning seldom works with sit-and-wait predators that make the decision to attack and consume prey within a very brief time. We examined whether death feigning in the pygmy grasshopper Criotettix japonicus Haan was an inducible defence behaviour against the frog Rana nigromaculata, a sit-and-wait, gape-limited predator. The characteristic posture assumed by the grasshopper during death feigning enlarges its functional body size by stretching each of three body parts (pronotum, hind legs and lateral spines) in three different directions, thereby making it difficult for the predator to swallow the prey. Our result is the first consistent explanation for why death-mimicking animals do not always mimic the posture of dead animals.

AB Marine invertebrates with high larval dispersal capacity typically exhibit low degrees of population differentiation, which reflects both contemporary and historical processes. We sampled 346 individuals from seven populations of the lined shore crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes Randall, along the northeastern Pacific Coast and Korea during summer 2003. DNA sequence analysis of 613 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene showed that overall gene diversity (h) was high (0.92 +/- 0.01), whereas overall nucleotide diversity (pi) was low (0.009 +/- 0.005). A total of 154 mtDNA haplotypes were identified; however, 114 were present in only one individual. Analysis of molecular variance revealed significant genetic structuring at Point Conception, CA, USA, that is likely due to the oceanographic circulation patterns, which result in asymmetrical migration of haplotypes. However, genetic variation among eastern Pacific populations was generally low, probably because of high contemporary gene flow and recent common ancestry of haplotypes. Mismatch analysis and nested clade analysis suggested that the population history of this region is characterized by two contiguous northwards range expansions, which are congruent with Late Pleistocene glacial cycles. Highly significant genetic differentiation was detected between eastern Pacific populations and Korea, indicating transpacific gene flow is restricted. Time of divergence between the two transpacific lineages was estimated between 0.8 and 1.2 Myrs ago. The small, recently founded population of P. crassipes at Bamfield, BC, Canada, did not appear to have undergone a founder effect.

AB Speciation involves the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations. One potentially important mechanism is the evolution of pre- or postzygotic isolation between populations as a by-product of adaptation to different environments. In this paper, we tested for assortative mating between allopatric stickleback populations adapted to different ecological niches. Our experimental design controlled for interpopulation interactions and non-adaptive explanations for assortative mating. We found that prezygotic isolation was surprisingly strong: when given a choice, the majority of matings occurred between individuals from similar environments. Our results indicate that the by-product mechanism is a potent source of reproductive isolation, and likely contributed to the origin of sympatric species of sticklebacks.

AB Researchers will be able to use stable isotope analysis to study community structure in an efficient way, without a need for extensive calibrations, if isotopic enrichment values are consistent, or if variation in enrichment values can be predicted. In this study, we generated an experimental data set of delta(15)N and delta(13)C enrichment means for 22 terrestrial herbivorous arthropods feeding on 18 different host plants. Mean enrichments observed across a single trophic transfer (plants to herbivores) were -0.53 +/- 0.26% for delta(13)C (range: -3.47% to 1.89%) and 1.88 +/- 0.37% for delta(15)N (range: -0.20% to 6.59%). The mean delta(13)C enrichment was significantly lower than that reported in recent literature surveys, whereas the mean delta(15)N enrichment was not significantly different. The experimental data set provided no support for recent hypotheses advanced to explain variation in enrichment values, including the proposed roles for consumer feeding mode, development type, and diet C:N ratio. A larger data set, formed by combining our experimental data with data from the literature, did suggest possible roles for feeding mode, nitrogen recycling, herbivore life stage, and host plant type. Our results indicate that species enrichment values are variable even in this relatively narrow defined group of organisms and that our ability to predict enrichment values of terrestrial herbivorous arthropods based on physiological, ecological, or taxonomic traits is low. The primary implications are that (1) mean enrichment may have to be measured empirically for each trophic link of interest, rather than relying on estimates from a broad survey of animal taxa and (2) the advantage of using stable isotope analysis to probe animal communities that are recalcitrant to other modes of study will be somewhat diminished as a consequence.

AB Question: Do species from communities with different flooding dynamics differ in seed buoyancy? Is there a trade-off between seed buoyancy and seed longevity?
   Methods: Seeds of 55 freshwater wetland species were collected and related to communities along the hydrological gradient, ranging from constantly flooded reed beds, through tall herb fens and rich fens, to rarely flooded wet meadows. Species were experimentally tested for seed buoyancy over 2 10 days in standing water and moving water. Seed longevity for each species was calculated.
   Results: Community occurrence along the hydrologic gradient was mirrored by seed buoyancy. Seed buoyancy was highest for species of almost permanently inundated reed beds and lowest for species of rarely inundated wet meadows. The seed buoyancy characteristics of species of reed beds were best adapted to hydrological dynamic conditions mimicked by the treatment moving water and were the most independent of the flow rate of the water. A high percentage of the species used had a transient seed bank. Together with high buoyancy in many species, this suggests a trade-off between dispersal capacity and seed persistence.
   Conclusions: In freshwater wetlands with rather stable water levels, many species lack a persistent seed bank and depend on dispersal for colonization of new habitats. Seed buoyancy enhances aquatic seed dispersal, and can be of great importance in both vegetation dynamics and restoration. In wetlands that are inundated for a long period during the year and with a water level above soil surface, higher seed buoyancy enhances the possibility for hydrochory.

AB Aims Despite the biodiversity values of the freshwater floodplains of northern Australia being widely recognized, there has not been a concomitant investment in developing the extent of knowledge of the basic functions and ecological processes that underpin the ecological character of these habitats. This review addresses the extent of our knowledge on the plant ecology of these wetlands and covers: the relationships between the climate and the hydrological regime on the floodplain; the vegetation patterns, succession and adaptation; and primary production.
   Scope Information is available on the seasonal, but less regularly on the inter-annual, dynamics of the macrophytic vegetation and its evident inter-relationship with the extent, depth and duration of inundation by seasonal flooding. The available scientifically collected information on plant distribution and relationship with the water regime could be complemented by more attention to traditional knowledge. The productivity of the vegetation is high-the dominant wetland grass species have an annual dry weight production of 0.5-2.1 kg m(-2) and the surrounding riparian (Melaleuca) trees contribute litterfall of 0.7-1.5 kg (dry weight) m(-2) year(-1), similar to 70 % due to leaf-fall. The availability of dissolved oxygen in the water is known to vary diurnally and seasonally, at least in some habitats. The importance of seasonal differences in the availability of dissolved oxygen for the growth of micro- and macrophytic vegetation has not been investigated. The seasonal distribution and growth of plant species on a few floodplains have been investigated, and maps at scales of 1 : 10 000 to 1 : 100 000 are available for these. However, only on a few occasions have longer term analyses been conducted and long-term changes in the vegetation measured and assessed. Species lists and categorization of growth strategies and forms are available and provide a basis for further ecological investigation.
   Conclusions Despite the large investment in managing the many pressures that have degraded the ecological character of these highly valued wetlands, the fundamental ecological processes that underpin the biodiversity values have not received the same level of attention. Further information on plant growth and the environmental factors that drive seasonal and annual changes in vegetation distribution and productivity is required to assist managers in attending to changes due to increasing invasive species and changes in fire regimes.

AB Modem society depends on complex agro-ecological and trading systems to provide food for urban residents, yet there are few tools available to assess whether these systems are vulnerable to future disturbances. We propose a preliminary framework to assess the vulnerability of food systems to future shocks based on landscape ecology's 'Panarchy Framework'. According to Panarchy, ecosystem vulnerability is determined by three generic characteristics: (1) the wealth available in the system, (2) how connected the system is, and (3) how much diversity exists in the system. In this framework, wealthy, non-diverse, tightly connected systems are highly vulnerable. The wealth of food systems can be measured using the approach pioneered by development economists to assess how poverty affects food security. Diversity can be measured using the tools investors use to measure the diversity of investment portfolios to assess financial risk. The connectivity of a system can be evaluated with the tools chemists use to assess the pathways chemicals use to flow through the environment. This approach can lead to better tools for creating policy designed to reduce vulnerability, and can help urban or regional planners identify where food systems are vulnerable to shocks and disturbances that may occur in the future.

AB The present study reports the first population genetic analysis of Arapaima gigas, an important but critically over-exploited fish species of the Amazon basin. We sequenced two discontinuous mitochondrial DNA regions of 1204 base-pairs (bp) (NADH1 segment) and 1143 bp (ATPase segment) from 139 individuals of A. gigas representing eight localities spanning the Amazon basin from Iquitos, Peru to Macap, Brazil. We discovered 34 haplotypes separated by 44 segregating sites. The two most common haplotypes are shared among all populations and isolation-by-distance appears to be the most important population dynamic, although there is no significant association between geographical distance and genetic differentiation. Observed patterns of differentiation appear to be attributable largely to anthropogenic factors associated with over-exploitation. Greatest haplotypic diversity exists upstream of Manaus and in areas away from large centres of population. The female variance and inbreeding effective population sizes are approximately 150000 individuals and localities in the Amazon basin are connected by gene flow. Naturally low levels of population differentiation and relatively high between-population connectivity is encouraging for the conservation and management of A. gigas. If strategically placed biological reserves were created throughout the Amazon basin to act as sources of emigrants within a source-sink metapopulation model, we believe locally depleted populations can be re-populated and maintained by individuals immigrating from these reserves.

AB 1. Improving our understanding of dietary differences among omnivorous, benthic crustacea can help to define the scope of their trophic influence in benthic food webs. In this study, we examined the trophic ecology of two non-native decapod crustaceans, the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) (CMC) and the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) (RSC), in the San Francisco Bay ecosystem to describe their food web impacts and explore whether these species are functionally equivalent in their impacts on aquatic benthic communities.
   2. We used multiple methods to maximise resolution of the diet of these species, including N and C stable isotope analysis of field data, controlled feeding experiments to estimate isotopic fractionation, mesocosm experiments, and gut content analysis (GCA).
   3. In experimental enclosures, both CMC and RSC caused significant declines in terrestrially derived plant detritus (P < 0.01) and algae (P < 0.02) relative to controls, and declines in densities of the caddisfly Gumaga nigricula by > 50% relative to controls.
   4. Plant material dominated gut contents of both species, but several sediment-dwelling invertebrate taxa were also found. GCA and mesocosm results indicate that CMC feed predominantly on surface-dwelling invertebrates, suggesting that trophic impacts of this species could include a shift in invertebrate community composition towards sediment-dwelling taxa.
   5. Stable isotope analysis supported a stronger relationship between CMC and both algae and algal-associated invertebrates than with allochthonous plant materials, while RSC was more closely aligned with terrestrially derived detritus.
   6. The trophic ecology and life histories of these two invasive species translate into important differences in potential impacts on aquatic food webs. Our results suggest that the CMC differs from the RSC in exerting new pressures on autochthonous food sources and shallow-dwelling invertebrates. The crab's wide-ranging foraging techniques, use of intertidal habitat, and migration out of freshwater at sexual maturity increases the distribution of the impacts of this important invasive species.

AB We examined light as a niche partitioning factor between the late-successional European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and the mid-successional downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.), two dominant species in the sub-Mediterranean area of southern France. For these species we estimated sapling growth models (in radius and in height) as a function of light availability. Beech had a higher growth in low light and a higher asymptotic growth rate than oak. We estimated species-specific growth-mortality functions. Beech showed a higher tolerance to slow growth than oak. By linking light-growth functions and growth-mortality functions, we found that beech had a lower mortality at low light than oak. Beech saplings had a higher probability of survival than oak at low and at high light levels. Beech exhibited the highest plasticity of morphological traits (i.e., biomass allocation, leaf morphology, and architectural traits) as a function of light. Since beech has higher growth and survival than oak at variable light regimes, we conclude that niche partitioning for light cannot explain the coexistence of these two species. We propose that disturbance and water stress should be explicitly taken into account to understand niche partitioning and succession in the sub-Mediterranean area.

AB Eukaryotic genes are on average more complex than prokaryotic genes in terms of expression regulation, protein length, and protein-domain structure [1-5]. Eukaryotes are also known to have a higher rate of gene duplication than prokaryotes do [6, 7]. Because gene duplication is the primary source of new genes [8, 9], the average gene complexity in a genome may have been increased by gene duplication if complex genes are preferentially duplicated. Here, we test this "gene complexity and gene duplicability" hypothesis with yeast genomic data. We show that, on average, duplicate genes from either whole-genome or individual-gene duplication have longer protein sequences, more functional domains, and more cis-regulatory motifs than singleton genes. This phenomenon is not a by-product of previously known mechanisms, such as protein function [10-13], evolutionary rate [14, 15], dosage [11], and dosage balance [16], that influence gene duplicability. Rather, it appears to have resulted from the sub-neo-functionalization process in duplicate-gene evolution [17]. Under this process, complex genes are more likely to be retained after duplication because they are prone to subfunctionalization, and gene complexity is regained via subsequent neofunctionalization. Thus, gene duplication increases both gene number and gene complexity, two important factors in the origin of genomic and organismal complexity.
