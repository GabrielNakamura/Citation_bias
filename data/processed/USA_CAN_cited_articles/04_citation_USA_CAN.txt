AB Stable carbon isotope signatures (delta C-13) are increasingly being used to determine the foraging habitats of consumers in the Southern Ocean. An underlying assumption is that a latitudinal gradient in VC values at the base of the food chain should also be reflected in organisms at higher trophic levels. Our main objective was to test that assumption by using penguin chicks (7 taxa) as predator models, because the feeding habits of provisioning adult penguins are well known during the chick-rearing period. As expected, a strong negative correlation was found between latitude and delta C-13 values of whole blood of penguin chicks. delta C-13 values ranged from -24.8 +/- 0.5%. in Adelie penguins living in Antarctica (67 degrees S), to -19.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand in northern rockhopper penguins living in the subtropics (38 S). Unlike VC values, stable nitrogen isotope signatures (delta N-15) were not related to latitude but instead were strongly affected by penguins' diet, with fish-eaters having higher delta N-15 values than crustacean eaters. 613C values also reflect more local spatial foraging segregation of penguins at a subantarctic archipelago (Kerguelen Islands), where they varied from -22.3 +/- 0.2%. for king penguins feeding in oceanic waters to -15.9 +/- 0.3%. for gentoo penguins foraging in an enclosed bay. Blood delta C-13 values moreover allowed differentiation of 2 sub-populations of gentoo penguins foraging in 2 different environments at Kerguelen. The method has 2 limitations related to the lack of longitudinal variations and to overlapping delta C-13 values due to different isotopic gradients (latitudinal and inshore/offshore) in the marine environment. The study nevertheless shows that the delta C-13 values of marine predators are efficient indicators of the foraging habitats at various spatial scales, both in terms of latitude in oceanic waters, and in terms of inshore/offshore gradients in waters surrounding subantarctic islands.

AB Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is widespread and variable among animals. According to the differential equilibrium model, SSD in a given species is expected to result if opposing selection forces equilibrate differently in both sexes. Here I review the factors that affect the evolution of SSD specifically as they relate to behavior. Taking the approach that SSD results as an epiphenomenon from separate but related selection on male and female body size, the advantages and disadvantages of large size in terms of the standard components of individual fitness (mating success, fecundity, viability, growth, foraging success) are discussed to help guiding future research on the subject. This includes a discussion of intra-SSDs. The main conclusions are: (1) Evidence for disadvantages of large body size is still sparse and requires more research. In contrast, evidence for sexual or fecundity selection favoring large body size is overwhelming, so these mechanisms do no longer require special attention, but need to be documented nonetheless to acquire a complete picture. (2) Some hypotheses suggesting that small size is favored are not well investigated at all, because they apply only to some species or restricted situations, may be difficult to study, or have simply been disregarded. Evidence for these cryptic hypotheses is best revealed using experiments under multiple environmental (food, temperature, etc.) stresses with particularly well-suited model species. (3) The evolution of SSD ultimately depends on processes generating variation within as well as between the sexes, so studies should always investigate and report effects on both sexes separately, in addition to size-dependent effects within each sex; within sexes the key issue is whether small individuals under, over- or perfectly compensate their general fitness disadvantage. (4) Tests of several hypotheses should be integrated in case studies of well-suited model species to investigate selection on body size comprehensively. For example, all episodes of sexual selection (mate search, competition, pre- and post-copulatory choice) should be addressed in conjunction. Investigations of size-selective and sex-dependent predation should take the viewpoint of the prey rather than the predator to permit integration of effects throughout prey ontogeny generated by various predators with differing preferences. Comparative studies should also test multiple alternative hypotheses at the same time to permit stronger inference. (5) Experimental behavioral studies of sexual and natural selection should provide selection differentials using the available standard methods. This would allow integration with phenomenological studies of selection and facilitate subsequent meta-analyses, which are very valuable in evaluating general patterns. (6) Comparative phylogenetic studies identifying patterns and phenomenological and experimental studies of model species that investigate particular mechanisms should be integrated, so that macro-evolutionary patterns can be linked to micro-evolutionary processes, which is the central paradigm of evolutionary ecology. (7) A major problem is the general difficulty of separating causes generating a particular body size and SSD over evolutionary time and its consequences for behavior and ecology today, i.e. today's researchers cannot completely avoid this 'ghost of SSD evolution past'.

AB Species are defined using a variety of different operational techniques. Mile discussion of the various methodologies has previously been restricted mostly to taxonomists, the demarcation of species is also crucial for conservation biology. Unfortunately, different methods of diagnosing species can arrive at different entities. Most prominently, it is widely thought that use of a phylogenetic species concept may lead to recognition of afar greater number of much less inclusive units. As a result, studies of the same group of organisms can produce not only different species identities but also different species range and number of individuals. To assess the impact of different definitions on conservation issues, we collected instances from the literature where a group of organisms was categorized both under phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic concepts. Our results show a marked difference, with surveys based on a phylogenetic species concept showing more species (48%) and an associated decrease in population size and range. We discuss the serious consequences of this trend for conservation, including an apparent change in the number of endangered species, potential political fallout, and the difficulty of deciding what should be conserved.

AB Traditional expectations for how widely and how often freshwater invertebrates disperse differ from empirical data. Freshwater invertebrates have been characterized as frequent, widespread dispersers, particularly those that are transported passively. Our review finds that this characterization may describe the potential for dispersal in some taxa, but it is not an accurate generalization for actual dispersal rates. High variance among habitats and taxonomic groups is a consistent theme. Advances in population genetics may help resolve these issues, but underlying assumptions should be carefully tested. Further, even unbiased estimates of gene flow may not equate with individual movement, because not all dispersers survive and reproduce. Some freshwater invertebrates may exist in classic Levins metapopulations. However, other species fit into a broader metapopulation definition, where temporal dispersal via diapause is functionally equivalent to spatial dispersal. In the latter case, local extinctions and rescue effects may be rare or absent. Finally, limited dispersal rates in many taxa suggest that theories of freshwater community assembly and structure can be made more robust by integrating dispersal and local processes as joint, contingent regulators. Recent research on freshwater invertebrate dispersal has substantially advanced our basic and applied understanding of freshwaters, as well as evolutionary ecology in general.

DT Article
DE ALPHA-DIVERSITY; BETA-DIVERSITY; SPECIES TURNOVER; DISPERSAL; CLIMATE
ID SPECIES RICHNESS; PATTERNS
AB 1.  We measured beta diversity, or turnover in species composition, in each of 15 taxa (including plants, vertebrates and invertebrates), along two common transects:  N-S and W-E arrays of 50 x 50 km squares across Britain.  Comparing taxa, we asked whether high beta diversity is associated with poor powers of dispersal.  Within taxa, we asked whether turnover increases consistently with geographic distance.
   2.  Beta diversity on this scale was found to be low in all groups.  Total (transect) species richness increased by only 3-13% per 50 x 50 km square, relative to the average value of local (within-square) richness; or by 0.6-6% per square, relative to the maximum value of local richness.  Among taxa, beta diversity showed no tendency to be higher in poorer dispersers.
   3.  In nearly all taxa, beta diversity as defined by Whittaker (1960) increased linearly with distance on the N-S transect.  However, this was shown to be largely the effect of gradients in alpha (local, within-square) diversity.  Moreover, distance is highly correlated with environmental (climatic) dissimilarity, providing an alternative explanation for distance effects.
   4.  We conclude that in the British biota, turnover at this scale is more the product of range and habitat restriction than of dispersal limitation; and that turnover is a relatively minor component of regional diversity, because of the predominance of strong gradients in alpha diversity.

AB How ecosystem productivity and species richness are interrelated is one of the most debated subjects in the history of ecology(1). Decades of intensive study have yet to discern the actual mechanisms behind observed global patterns(2,3). Here, by integrating the predictions from multiple theories into a single model and using data from 1,126 grassland plots spanning five continents, we detect the clear signals of numerous underlying mechanisms linking productivity and richness. We find that an integrative model has substantially higher explanatory power than traditional bivariate analyses. In addition, the specific results unveil several surprising findings that conflict with classical models(4-7). These include the isolation of a strong and consistent enhancement of productivity by richness, an effect in striking contrast with superficial data patterns. Also revealed is a consistent importance of competition across the full range of productivity values, in direct conflict with some (but not all) proposed models. The promotion of local richness by macroecological gradients in climatic favourability, generally seen as a competing hypothesis(8), is also found to be important in our analysis. The results demonstrate that an integrative modelling approach leads to a major advance in our ability to discern the underlying processes operating in ecological systems.

AB Although at the genetic level cancer is caused by diverse mutations, epigenetic modifications are characteristic of all cancers, from apparently normal precursor tissue to advanced metastatic disease, and these epigenetic modifications drive tumour cell heterogeneity. We propose a unifying model of cancer in which epigenetic dysregulation allows rapid selection for tumour cell survival at the expense of the host. Mechanisms involve both genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications that disrupt the function of genes that regulate the epigenome itself. Several exciting recent discoveries also point to a genome-scale disruption of the epigenome that involves large blocks of DNA hypomethylation, mutations of epigenetic modifier genes and alterations of heterochromatin in cancer ( including large organized chromatin lysine modifications (LOCKs) and lamin-associated domains (LADs)), all of which increase epigenetic and gene expression plasticity. Our model suggests a new approach to cancer diagnosis and therapy that focuses on epigenetic dysregulation and has great potential for risk detection and chemoprevention.

AB The concept of the sediment delivery problem was introduced into the literature in 1983 by Des Walling. This concept describes how only a fraction of sediment eroded within a catchment will reach the basin outlet and be represented as sediment yield, and that sediment storage mechanisms operating within a catchment explain this discrepancy. Since this paper was published, geomorphologists have been examining in great detail the fate of sediment eroded from the landsurface, and the pathways and timeframes of sediment transport and storage in catchments. However, to fully understand the internal dynamics of sediment flux requires a fresh look at the sediment delivery problem. A framework is required that can incorporate the various processes involved in sediment movement from source areas through a basin to its outlet, and can take account of the spatial distribution of, and timeframes over which, these processes operate. This paper presents a conceptual framework for analysis of catchment (dis)connectivity that incorporates both spatial and temporal variability in the operation of the sediment cascade. This approach examines where blockages occur to disrupt these longitudinal, lateral and vertical linkages in catchments. Depending on the position of blockages (termed buffers, barriers and blankets), and their sediment residence time, various parts of a catchment may be actively contributing sediment to the sediment cascade and be switched on, or inactive and switched off. This paper discusses how such a framework can be used to model response times to disturbance and explain the manifestation of geomorphic change in catchments. The paper then highlights challenges geomorphologists face in applying such a framework to understand the internal dynamics of the catchment sediment cascades, and forecast how environmental change might affect the operation of sediment fluxes into the future.

AB Metarhizium anisopliae, the type species of the anamorph entomopathogenic genus Metarhizium, is currently composed of four varieties, including the type variety, and had been demonstrated to be closely related to M. taii, M. pingshaense and M. guizhouense. In this study we evaluate phylogenetic relationships within the M. anisopliae complex, identify monophyletic lineages and clarify the species taxonomy. To this end we have employed a multigene phylogenetic approach using near-complete sequences from nuclear encoded EF-1 alpha, RPB1, RPB2 and beta-tubulin gene regions and evaluated the morphology of these taxa, including ex-type isolates whenever possible. The phylogenetic and in some cases morphological evidence supports the monophyly of nine terminal taxa in the M. anisopliae complex that we recognize as species. We propose to recognize at species rank M. anisopliae, M. guizhouense, M. pingshaense, M. acridum stat. nov., M. lepidiotae stat. nov. and M. majus stat. nov. In addition we describe the new species M. globosum and M. robertsii, resurrect the name M. brunneum and show that M. taii is a later synonym of M. guizhouense.

AB Since Darwin, intergroup hostilities have figured prominently in explanations of the evolution of human social behavior. Yet whether ancestral humans were largely "peaceful" or "warlike" remains controversial. I ask a more precise question: If more cooperative groups were more likely to prevail in conflicts with other groups, was the level of intergroup violence sufficient to influence the evolution of human social behavior? Using a model of the evolutionary impact of between-group competition and a new data set that combines archaeological evidence on causes of death during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene with ethnographic and historical reports on hunter-gatherer populations, I find that the estimated level of mortality in intergroup conflicts would have had substantial effects, allowing the proliferation of group-beneficial behaviors that were quite costly to the individual altruist.

AB Nutrition influences most aspects of animal ecology: juvenile growth rates and adult mass gain, body condition, probability of pregnancy, over-winter survival, timing of parturition, and neonatal birth mass and survival. We provide an overview among ungulates of the extent of these influences resulting from interactions among bioenergetics, foraging, and nutritional demands.
   Body condition of an animal is the integrator of nutritional intake and demands, affecting both survival and reproduction. The deposition and mobilization of body fat and body protein vary with physiological requirements and environmental conditions as species use dietary income and body stores to integrate the profits of summer and the demands of winter. Results from our simulation model and uncertainty analysis of the influence of body mass and changes in body composition of Rangifer over winter indicate that percent body fat rather than body mass in early winter is most important in determining whether animals die, live without reproducing, or live and reproduce. Animal responses are also sensitive to rates of change in body protein. Depending on timing of calving and maternal reserves, seasonal habitats vary in their nutritional value for the production of offspring.
   For free-ranging animals, life is a balance among numerous ecological factors, including nutritional requirements, nutritional resources to meet those demands, and intra- and inter-specific interactions. Predation effects on population demography may mask nutritional limitations of habitat. We suggest that over the long term of life histories, ungulates use seasonal strategies that minimize the maximum detriment, and that the basis for most strategies is nutritional.

AB The extensive development of surface and subsurface drainage systems to facilitate agricultural production throughout North America has significantly altered the hydrology of landscapes compared to historical conditions. Drainage has transformed nutrient and hydrologic dynamics, structure, function, quantity, and configuration of stream and wetland ecosystems. In many agricultural regions, more than 80% of some catchment basins may be drained by surface ditches and subsurface drain pipes (tiles). Natural channels have been straightened and deepened for surface drainage ditches with significant effects on channel morphology, instream habitats for aquatic organisms, floodplain and riparian connectivity, sediment dynamics, and nutrient cycling. The connection of formerly isolated wetland basins to extensive networks of surface drainage and the construction of main channel ditches through millions of acres of formerly low-lying marsh or wet prairie, where no defined channel may have previously existed, have resulted in large-scale conversion of aquatic habitat types, from wetland mosaics to linear systems. Reduced surface storage, increased conveyance, and increased effective drainage area have altered the dynamics of and generally increased flows in larger streams and rivers. Cumulatively, these changes in hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and sediment dynamics have had profound implications for aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity.

AB Agriculture is a specialized form of symbiosis that is known to have evolved in only four animal groups: humans, bark beetles, termites, and ants. Here, we reconstruct the major evolutionary transitions that produced the five distinct agricultural systems of the fungus-growing ants, the most well studied of the nonhuman agriculturalists. We do so with reference to the first fossil-calibrated, multiple-gene, molecular phylogeny that incorporates the full range of taxonomic diversity within the fungus-growing ant tribe Attini. Our analyses indicate that the original form of ant agriculture, the cultivation of a diverse subset of fungal species in the tribe Leucocoprineae, evolved approximate to 50 million years ago in the Neotropics, coincident with the early Eocene climatic optimum. During the past 30 million years, three known ant agricultural systems, each involving a phylogenetically distinct set of derived fungal cultivars, have separately arisen from the original agricultural system. One of these derived systems subsequently gave rise to the fifth known system of agriculture, in which a single fungal species is cultivated by leaf-cutter ants. Leaf-cutter ants evolved remarkably recently (approximate to 8-12 million years. ago) to become the dominant herbivores of the New World tropics. Our analyses identify relict, extant attine ant species that occupy phylogenetic positions that are transitional between the agricultural systems. Intensive study of those species holds particular promise for clarifying the sequential accretion of ecological and behavioral characters that produced each of the major ant agricultural systems.

AB There is a growing appreciation that chromosome inversions affect rates of adaptation, speciation, and the evolution of sex chromosomes. Comparative genomic studies have identified many new paracentric inversion polymorphisms. Population models suggest that inversions can spread by reducing recombination between alleles that independently increase fitness, without epistasis or coadaptation. Areas of linkage disequilibrium extend across large inversions but may he interspersed by areas with little disequilibrium. Genes located within inversions are associated with a variety, of traits including those involved in climatic adaptation. Inversion polymorphisms may contribute to speciation by generating underdominance owing to inviable gametes, but in alternative view gaining support is that inversions facilitate speciation by reducing recombination, protecting genomic regions from introgression. Likewise, inversions may facilitate the evolution of sex chromosomes by reducing recombination between sex determining alleles and alleles with sex-specific effects. However, few genes within inversions responsible for fitness effects or speciation have been identified.

AB The North Water Polynya is an area of high biological activity that supports large numbers of higher trophic-level organisms such as seabirds and marine mammals. An overall objective of the Upper Trophic-Level Group of the International North Water Polynya Study (NOW) was to evaluate carbon and contaminant flux through these high trophic-level (TL) consumers. Crucial to an evaluation of the role of such consumers, however, was the establishment of primary trophic linkages within the North Water food web. We used delta(15)N values of food web components from particulate organic matter (POM) through polar bears (Ursus maritimus) to create a trophic-level model based on the assumptions that Calanus hyperboreus occupies TL 2.0 and there is a 2.4parts per thousand. trophic enrichment in N-15 between birds and their diets, and a 3.8parts per thousand trophic enrichment for all other components. This model placed the planktivorous dovekie (Alle alle) at TL 3.3, ringed seal (Phoca hispida). at TL 4.5, and polar bear at TL 5.5. The copepods C hyperboreus, Chiridius glacialis and Euchaeta glacialis formed a trophic continuum (TL 2.0-3.0) from primary herbivore through omnivore to primary carnivore. Invertebrates were generally sorted according to planktonic, benthic and epibenthic feeding groups. Seabirds formed three trophic groups, with dovekie occupying the lowest, black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), thick-billed murre (Uria aalge), and ivory gull (Pagophilia eburnea) intermediate (TL 3.9-4.0), and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) the highest (TL 4.6) trophic positions. Among marine mammals, walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) occupied the lowest (TL 3.2) and bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), ringed seal, beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), and narwhal (Monodon monoceros) intermediate positions (TL 4.1-4.6). In addition to arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), we suggest that lower trophic-level prey, in particular the amphipod Themisto libellula, contribute fundamentally in transferring energy and carbon flux to higher trophic-level seabirds and marine mammals. We measured PCB 153 among selected organisms to investigate the behavior of bioaccumulating contaminants within the food web. Our isotopic model confirmed the trophic magnification of PCB 153 in this high-Arctic food web due to a strong correlation between contaminant concentration and organism delta(15)N values, demonstrating the utility of combining isotopic and contaminant approaches to food-web studies. Stable-carbon isotope analysis confirmed an enrichment in C-13 between POM and ice algae (-22.3 vs. -17.7parts per thousand). Benthic organisms were generally enriched in 13C compared to pelagic species. We discuss individual species isotopic data and the general utility of our stable isotope model for defining carbon flux and contaminant flow through the North Water food web.

AB We have determined complete gene sequences encoding the largest subunit of the RNA polymerase II (RBP1) from two Microsporidia, Vairimorpha necatrix and Nosema locustae. Phylogenetic analyses of these and other RPB1 sequences strongly support the notion that Microsporidia are not early-diverging eukaryotes but instead are specifically related to Fungi. Our reexamination of elongation factors EF-1 alpha and EF-2 sequence data that had previously been taken as support for an early (Archezoan) divergence of these amitochondriate protists show such support to be weak and likely caused by artifacts in phylogenetic analyses. These EF data sets are, in fact, not inconsistent with a Microsporidia + Fungi relationship. In addition, we show that none of these proteins strongly support a deep divergence of Parabasalia and Metamonada, the other amitochondriate protist groups currently thought to compose early branches. Thus, the phylogenetic placement among eukaryotes for these protist taxa is in need of further critical examination.

ID MACROINVERTEBRATES
AB We analyzed relationships between watershed land use and habitat quality, and between watershed land use and biotic integrity for 134 sites on 103 streams located throughout Wisconsin. Habitat quality and index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores were significantly positively correlated with the amount of forested land and negatively correlated with the amount of agricultural land in the entire watershed and in a 100-m-wide buffer along the stream. Correlations were generally stronger for the entire watershed than for the buffer. Relationships between forested land and habitat and biotic integrity were linear, although there were several outlying sites with lower-than-expected IBI scores. Relationships with agricultural land use were more complex, with an obvious decline in habitat quality and IBI scores apparent only when agricultural land use exceeded 50%. Even when agricultural land use exceeded 80%, some sites maintained relatively good habitat quality and biotic integrity. These ''good'' sites tended to have relatively high gradients and rocky substrates, and had not been channelized. High urban land use was strongly associated with poor biotic integrity and was weakly but significantly associated with poor habitat quality. There appeared to be a threshold. value of urbanization between 10% and 20% beyond which IBI scores were consistently very low. Overall, watershed land uses had strong effects on habitat quality and biotic integrity in Wisconsin streams.

AB The importance of phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, fresh and salt marsh,emergent plants, and terrestrial organic matter to the estuarine food web of Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, USA, was evaluated using the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Three distinct regions of the estuary were examined: the oligohaline upper estuary with high freshwater inputs and fringing fresh marsh, the middle estuary with extensive salt marsh, and the lower estuary with a greater proportion of open bay and a direct connection to open ocean. In each region, sources of organic matter for pelagic and benthic aquatic consumers were compared with the range of organic matter sources available in the entire estuary. Consumers in all regions relied most heavily on locally produced organic matter. In the upper estuary, most consumers had delta(13)C values of -29 to -21 parts per thousand and delta(34)S values of about 8 parts per thousand, which indicated dependence on a mixture of fresh marsh emergent vegetation and phytoplankton from the oligohaline region. In the middle and lower estuary, consumers had delta(13)C values of -23 to -15 parts per thousand and delta(34)S values of 5 to 15 parts per thousand resembling a mixture of Spartina spp., benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton. Terrestrial organic matter was of minimal importance in the upper estuary and was not evident in the food webs of the middle and lower estuary. The isotopic values of pelagic consumers reflected a greater dependence on phytoplankton than those of benthic consumers, which were closer to fresh or salt marsh emergent vegetation and benthic microalgae. Several of the patterns revealed by examination of organic matter sources far the food web of the Plum Island Sound estuary have implications for our general understanding of estuarine food webs. First, while there is substantial spatial heterogeneity in organic matter sources within a single estuary, consumers tend to utilize sources of organic matter produced in the same region of the estuary in which they reside. Second, consumer dependence on terrestrially derived riverine organic matter is minimal, even in the relatively small region of the estuary where its availability is the highest. Third, benthic and pelagic organisms rely on different mixes of organic matter sources.

AB Correlational selection favors combinations of traits and is a key element of many models of phenotypic and genetic evolution. Multiple regression techniques for measuring selection allow for the direct estimation of correlational selection gradients, yet few studies in natural populations have investigated this process. Color patterns and antipredator behaviors of snakes are thought to function interactively in predator escape and therefore may be subject to correlational selection. To investigate this hypothesis, I studied the survivorship of juvenile garter snakes, Thamnophis ordinoides, as a function of a suite of escape behaviors and color pattern. The only natural selection detected favored opposite combinations of stripedness of the color pattern and the tendency to perform during escape evasive behaviors called reversals. This selection presumably results from optical illusions created by moving patterns and their effects on visually foraging predators. Analysis of the bivariate selection surface shows that pure correlational selection can be thought of as a series of linear selection functions on one trait whose slopes depend on the value of the second trait. Alternatively, viewing the selection surface along its major axes reveals stabilizing and disruptive components of correlational selection. It is further shown that correlational selection alone can promote genetic variance and covariance within a generation. This phenomenon may be partially responsible for the extreme variation in color pattern and the genetic covariance between color pattern and behavior observed in natural populations of T. ordinoides.

AB Voluminous parallel sequencing datasets, especially metagenomic experiments, require distributed computing for de novo assembly and taxonomic profiling. Ray Meta is a massively distributed metagenome assembler that is coupled with Ray Communities, which profiles microbiomes based on uniquely-colored k-mers. It can accurately assemble and profile a three billion read metagenomic experiment representing 1,000 bacterial genomes of uneven proportions in 15 hours with 1,024 processor cores, using only 1.5 GB per core. The software will facilitate the processing of large and complex datasets, and will help in generating biological insights for specific environments. Ray Meta is open source and available at http://denovoassembler.sf.net.

AB Decadal-scale observations of marine reserves suggest that indirect effects on taxa that occur through cascading trophic interactions take longer to develop than direct effects on target species. Combining and analyzing a unique set of long-term time series of ecologic data in and out of fisheries closures from disparate regions, we found that the time to initial detection of direct effects on target species (+/-SE) was 5.13 +/- 1.9 years, whereas initial detection of indirect effects on other taxa, which were often trait mediated, took significantly longer (13.1 +/- 2.0 years). Most target species showed initial direct effects, but their trajectories over time were highly variable. Many target species continued to increase, some leveled off, and others decreased. Decreases were due to natural fluctuations, fishing impacts from outside reserves, or indirect effects from target species at higher trophic levels. The average duration of stable periods for direct effects was 6.2 +/- 1.2 years, even in studies of more than 15 years. For indirect effects, stable periods averaged 9.1 +/- 1.6 years, although this was not significantly different from direct effects. Populations of directly targeted species were more stable in reserves than in fished areas, suggesting increased ecologic resilience. This is an important benefit of marine reserves with respect to their function as a tool for conservation and restoration.

AB In the face of environmental change, species can evolve new physiological tolerances to cope with altered climatic conditions or move spatially to maintain existing physiological associations with particular climates that define each species' climatic niche. When environmental change occurs over short temporal and large spatial scales, vagile species are expected to move geographically by tracking their climatic niches through time. Here, we test for evidence of niche tracking in bird species of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, focusing on 53 species resurveyed nearly a century apart at 82 sites on four elevational transects. Changes in climate and bird distributions resulted in focal species shifting their average climatological range over time. By comparing the directions of these shifts relative to the centroids of species' range-wide climatic niches, we found that 48 species (90.6%) tracked their climatic niche. Analysis of niche sensitivity on an independent set of occurrence data significantly predicted the temperature and precipitation gradients tracked by species. Furthermore, in 50 species (94.3%), site-specific occupancy models showed that the position of each site relative to the climatic niche centroid explained colonization and extinction probabilities better than a null model with constant probabilities. Combined, our results indicate that the factors limiting a bird species' range in the Sierra Nevada in the early 20th century also tended to drive changes in distribution over time, suggesting that climatic models derived from niche theory might be used successfully to forecast where and how to conserve species in the face of climate change.

AB Climate warming is expected to have particularly strong effects on tundra and boreal ecosystems, yet relatively few studies have examined soil responses to temperature change in these systems. We used closed-top greenhouses to examine the response of soil respiration, nutrient availability, microbial abundance, and active fungal communities to soil warming in an Alaskan boreal forest dominated by mature black spruce. This treatment raised soil temperature by 0.5 degrees C and also resulted in a 22% decline in soil water content. We hypothesized that microbial abundance and activity would increase with the greenhouse treatment. Instead, we found that bacterial and fungal abundance declined by over 50%, and there was a trend toward lower activity of the chitin-degrading enzyme N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. Soil respiration also declined by up to 50%, but only late in the growing season. These changes were accompanied by significant shifts in the community structure of active fungi, with decreased relative abundance of a dominant Thelephoroid fungus and increased relative abundance of Ascomycetes and Zygomycetes in response to warming. In line with our hypothesis, we found that warming marginally increased soil ammonium and nitrate availability as well as the overall diversity of active fungi. Our results indicate that rising temperatures in northern-latitude ecosystems may not always cause a positive feedback to the soil carbon cycle, particularly in boreal forests with drier soils. Models of carbon cycle-climate feedbacks could increase their predictive power by incorporating heterogeneity in soil properties and microbial communities across the boreal zone.

AB A goal of phylogeography is to relate patterns of genetic differentiation to potential historical geographic isolating events. Quaternary glaciations, particularly the one culminating in the Last Glacial Maximum similar to 21 ka (thousands of years ago), greatly affected the distributions and population sizes of temperate marine species as their ranges retreated southward to escape ice sheets. Traditional genetic models of glacial refugia and routes of recolonization include these predictions: low genetic diversity in formerly glaciated areas, with a small number of alleles/haplotypes dominating disproportionately large areas, and high diversity including "private'' alleles in glacial refugia. In the Northern Hemisphere, low diversity in the north and high diversity in the south are expected. This simple model does not account for the possibility of populations surviving in relatively small northern periglacial refugia. If these periglacial populations experienced extreme bottlenecks, they could have the low genetic diversity expected in recolonized areas with no refugia, but should have more endemic diversity (private alleles) than recently recolonized areas. This review examines evidence of putative glacial refugia for eight benthic marine taxa in the temperate North Atlantic. All data sets were reanalyzed to allow direct comparisons between geographic patterns of genetic diversity and distribution of particular clades and haplotypes including private alleles. We contend that for marine organisms the genetic signatures of northern periglacial and southern refugia can be distinguished from one another. There is evidence for several periglacial refugia in northern latitudes, giving credence to recent climatic reconstructions with less extensive glaciation.

AB Genetic stochasticity due to small population size contributes to population extinction, especially when population fragmentation disrupts gene flow. Estimates of effective population size (N-e) can therefore be informative about population persistence, but there is a need for an assessment of their consistency and informative relevance. Here we review the body of empirical estimates of N-e for wild populations obtained with the temporal genetic method and published since Frankham's (1995) review. Theoretical considerations have identified important sources of bias for this analytical approach, and we use empirical data to investigate the extent of these biases. We find that particularly model selection and sampling require more attention in future studies.
   We report a median unbiased N-e estimate of 260 (among 83 studies) and find that this median estimate tends to be smaller for populations of conservation concern, which may therefore be more sensitive to genetic stochasticity. Furthermore, we report a median N-e/N ratio of 0.14, and find that this ratio may actually be higher for small populations, suggesting changes in biological interactions at low population abundances. We confirm the role of gene flow in countering genetic stochasticity by finding that N-e correlates strongest with neutral genetic metrics when populations can be considered isolated. This underlines the importance of gene flow for the estimation of N-e, and of population connectivity for conservation in general. Reductions in contemporary gene flow due to ongoing habitat fragmentation will likely increase the prevalence of genetic stochasticity, which should therefore remain a focal point in the conservation of biodiversity.

AB 1. Species distribution models (habitat models) relate the occurrence or abundance of a species to environmental and/or geographical predictors that then allow predictions to be mapped across an entire region. These models are used in a range of policy settings such as managing greenhouse gases, biosecurity threats and conservation planning. Prediction errors are almost ubiquitous in habitat models. An understanding of the source, magnitude and pattern of these errors is essential if the models are to be used transparently in decision making.
   2. This study considered the sources of errors in habitat models. It divided them into two main classes, error resulting from data deficiencies and error introduced by the specification of the model. Common and important data errors included missing covariates, and samples of species' occurrences that were small, biased or lack absences. These affected the types of models that could be developed and the probable errors that would occur. Almost all models had missing covariates, and this introduced significant spatial correlation in the errors of the analysis.
   3. A challenging aspect of modelling is that species' distributions are affected by processes operating in both environmental and geographical space. We differentiated between global (aspatial) and local (spatial) errors, and discussed how they arise and what can be done to alleviate their effects.
   4. Synthesis and applications. This study brings together statistical and ecological thinking to consider the appropriate techniques for habitat modelling. Ecological theory suggests models capable of defining optima, while allowing for interactions between variables. Statistical considerations, including impacts of data errors, suggest models that deal with multimodality and discontinuity in response surfaces. Models are typically simple approximations of the true probability surface. We suggest the use of flexible regression techniques, and explain what makes such methods superior for ecological modelling. The most robust modelling approaches are likely to be those in which care is taken to match the model with knowledge of ecology, and in which each is allowed to inform the other.

AB Ecosystem engineering-the physical modification of habitats by organisms-has been proposed as an important mechanism for maintaining high species richness at the landscape scale by increasing habitat heterogeneity. Dams built by beaver (Castor canadensis) dramatically alter riparian landscapes throughout much of North America. In the central Adirondacks, New York, USA, ecosystem engineering by beaver leads to the formation of extensive wetland habitat capable of supporting herbaceous plant species not found elsewhere in the riparian zone. We show that by increasing habitat heterogeneity, beaver increase the number of species of herbaceous plants in the riparian zone by over 33% at a scale that encompasses both beaver-modified patches and patches with no history of beaver occupation. We suggest that ecosystem engineers will increase species richness at the landscape scale whenever there are species present in a landscape that are restricted to engineered habitats during at least some stages of their life cycle.

AB Synthesis of results from several Arctic and boreal research programmes provides evidence for the strong role of high-latitude ecosystems in the climate system. Average surface air temperature has increased 0.3 degreesC per decade during the twentieth century in the western North American Arctic and boreal forest zones. Precipitation has also increased, but changes in soil moisture are uncertain. Disturbance rates have increased in the boreal forest; for example, there has been a doubling of the area burned in North America in the past 20 years. The disturbance regime in tundra may not have changed. Tundra has a 3-6-fold higher winter albedo than boreal forest, but summer albedo and energy partitioning differ more strongly among ecosystems within either tundra or boreal forest than between these two biomes. This indicates a need to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics within, as well as between, biomes. If regional surface warming were to continue, changes in albedo and energy absorption would likely act as a positive feedback to regional warming due to earlier melting of snow and, over the long term, the northward movement of treeline. Surface drying and a change in dominance from mosses to vascular plants would also enhance sensible heat flux and regional warming in tundra. In the boreal forest of western North America, deciduous forests have twice the albedo of conifer forests in both winter and summer, 50-80% higher evapotranspiration, and therefore only 30-50% of the sensible heat flux of conifers in summer. Therefore, a warming-induced increase in fire frequency that increased the proportion of deciduous forests in the landscape, would act as a negative feedback to regional warming.
   Changes in thermokarst and the aerial extent of wetlands, lakes, and ponds would alter high-latitude methane flux. There is currently a wide discrepancy among estimates of the size and direction of CO2 flux between high-latitude ecosystems and the atmosphere. These discrepancies relate more strongly to the approach and assumptions for extrapolation than to inconsistencies in the underlying data. Inverse modelling from atmospheric CO2 concentrations suggests that high latitudes are neutral or net sinks for atmospheric CO2, whereas field measurements suggest that high latitudes are neutral or a net CO2 source. Both approaches rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify. The most parsimonious explanation of the available data is that drying in tundra and disturbance in boreal forest enhance CO2 efflux. Nevertheless, many areas of both tundra and boreal forests remain net sinks due to regional variation in climate and local variation in topographically determined soil moisture. Improved understanding of the role of high-latitude ecosystems in the climate system requires a concerted research effort that focuses on geographical variation in the processes controlling land-atmosphere exchange, species composition, and ecosystem structure. Future studies must be conducted over a long enough time-period to detect and quantify ecosystem feedbacks.

TI A sexually selected character displacement in flycatchers reinforces

AB Theory suggests that natural selection against the production of unfit hybrids may reinforce barriers to gene flow, eventually leading to reproductive isolation of differentiated populations(1-4). This mode of speciation may be achieved by female choice selecting for a divergence in male secondary sexual traits that facilitates species recognition. Although intuitively appealing, conclusive evidence for such reinforcement is generally lacking(5-8), and serious doubts have been raised about its validity(9-11). We have tested key predictions of the reinforcement hypothesis on the European, black-and-white, Ficedula flycatchers, using molecular techniques, field observations and mate choice experiments. In populations where two species coexist, we show that female choice selects for a divergence in male plumage colour and that the resulting character displacement reduces the frequency of hybridization.

AB Most speciation events probably occur gradually, without complete and immediate reproductive isolation, but the full extent of gene flow between diverging species has rarely been characterized on a genome-wide scale. Documenting the extent and timing of admixture between diverging species can clarify the role of geographic isolation in speciation. Here we use new methodology to quantify admixture at different stages of divergence in Heliconius butterflies, based on whole-genome sequences of 31 individuals. Comparisons between sympatric and allopatric populations of H. melpomene, H. cydno, and H. timareta revealed a genome-wide trend of increased shared variation in sympatry, indicative of pervasive interspecific gene flow. Up to 40% of 100-kb genomic windows clustered by geography rather than by species, demonstrating that a very substantial fraction of the genome has been shared between sympatric species. Analyses of genetic variation shared over different time intervals suggested that admixture between these species has continued since early in speciation. Alleles shared between species during recent time intervals displayed higher levels of linkage disequilibrium than those shared over longer time intervals, suggesting that this admixture took place at multiple points during divergence and is probably ongoing. The signal of admixture was significantly reduced around loci controlling divergent wing patterns, as well as throughout the Z chromosome, consistent with strong selection for Mullerian mimicry and with known Z-linked hybrid incompatibility. Overall these results show that species divergence can occur in the face of persistent and genome-wide admixture over long periods of time.

   TRANSPORT; PATHWAY
AB Autophagosome formation is a complex process that begins with the nucleation of a pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) that expands into a phagophore or isolation membrane, the precursor of the autophagosome. A key event in the formation of the phagophore is the production of PtdIns3P by the phosphatidylinsitol kinase Vps34. In yeast the two closely related proteins, Atg18 and Atg21, are the only known effectors of PtdIns3P that act in the autophagy pathway. The recruitment of Atg18 or Atg21 to the PAS is an essential step in the formation of the phagophore. Our bioinformatic analysis of the Atg18 and Atg21 orthologues in all eukaryotes shows that WIPI1 and WIPI2 are both mammalian orthologues of Atg18. We show that WIPI2 is a mammalian effector of PtdIns3P and is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cell lines. WIPI2 is recruited to early autophagosomal structures along with Atg16L and ULK1 and is required for the formation of LC3-positive autophagosomes. Furthermore, when WIPI2 is depleted, we observe a remarkable accumulation of omegasomes, ER-localized PtdIns3P-containing structures labeled by DFCP1 (double FYVE domain-containing protein 1), which are thought to act as platforms for autophagosome formation. In view of our data we propose a role for WIPI2 in the progression of omegasomes into autophagosomes.

AB We examine the evolving concept of what constitutes a non-native (or alien) freshwater fish. In an attempt to distinguish between biogeographical and socio-political perspectives, we review the patterns in the introduction and dispersal of non-native fishes in Europe and North America, and especially the recent expansion of Ponto-Caspian gobies in Europe. We assess patterns in the development of national policy and legislation in response to the perceived threat of non-native fish introductions to native species and ecosystems. We review, and provide a glossary of, the terms and definitions associated with non-native species. Finally, we discuss perspectives as regards the future treatment of naturalized species.

AB This paper integrates recent efforts to map the distribution of biomes for the late Quaternary with the detailed evidence that plant species have responded individualistically to climate change at millennial timescales. Using a fossil-pollen data set of over 700 sites, we review late-Quaternary vegetation history in northern and eastern North America across levels of ecological organization from individual taxa to biomes, and apply the insights gained from this review to critically examine the biome maps generated from the pollen data. Higher-order features of the vegetation (e.g., plant associations, physiognomy) emerge from individualistic responses of plant taxa to climate change, and different representations of vegetation history reveal different aspects of vegetation dynamics. Vegetation distribution and composition were relatively stable during full-glacial times (2100017 000 yr BP) [calendar years] and during the mid- to late Holocene (7000-500 yr BP), but changed rapidly during the late-glacial period and early Holocene (16000-.8000 yr BP) and after 500 yr BP Shifts in plant taxon distributions were characterized by individualistic changes in population abundances and ranges and included large east-west shifts in distribution in addition to the northward redistribution of most taxa. Modern associations such as Fagus-Tsuga and Picea-Alnus-Betula date to the early Holocene, whereas other associations common to the late-glacial period (e.g., Picea-Cyperaceae-Fraxinus-Ostrya/ Carpinus). no longer exist. Biomes are dynamic entities that have changed in distribution, composition; and structure over time. The late-Pleistocene suite of biomes is distinct from those that grew during the Holocene. The pollen-based biome reconstructions are able to capture the major features of late-Quaternary vegetation but downplay the magnitude and variety of vegetational responses to climate change by (1) limiting, apparent land-cover change to ecotones, (2) masking internal variations in biome composition, and (3) obscuring the range shifts and changes in abundance among individual taxa. The compositional and structural differences between full-glacial and recent biomes of the same type are. similar to or greater than the spatial heterogeneity in the composition and structure of present-day biomes. This spatial and temporal heterogeneity allows biome maps to accommodate individualistic behavior among species but masks climatically important variations in taxonomic composition as well as structural differences between modern biomes and their ancient counterparts.

AB How animals change their movement patterns in relation to the environment is a central topic in a wide area of ecology, including foraging ecology, habitat selection, and spatial population ecology. To understand the underlying behavioral mechanisms involved, there is a need for methods to measure changes in movement patterns along a pathway through the landscape. We used simulated pathways and satellite tracking of a long-ranging seabird to explore the properties of first-passage time as a measure of search effort along a path. The first-passage time is defined as the time required for an animal to cross a circle with a given radius. It is a measure of how much time an animal uses within a given area. First-passage time is scale dependent, and a plot of variance in first-passage time vs. spatial scale reveals the spatial scale at which the animal concentrates its search effort. By averaging the first-passage time on a geographical grid, it is possible to relate first-passage time to environmental variables and the search pattern of other individuals.

AB At present, 50% (w/w) carbon is widely promulgated as a generic value for wood; however, the literature yields few data and indicates that very little research has actually been done. C contents in heartwood of forty-one softwood and hardwood species were determined. C in kiln-dried hardwood species ranged from 46.27% to 49.97% (w/w), in conifers from 47.21% to 55.2%. The higher C in conifers agrees with their higher lignin content (similar to 30%, versus similar to 20% for hardwoods). Wood-meal samples drilled from discrete early wood and late wood zones of seven of the forty-one species were also investigated. C contents of early woods were invariably higher than those in corresponding late woods, again in agreement with early wood having higher lignin content. Further investigation was made into freshly harvested wood of some species to determine how much volatile C is present, comparing oven-dried wood meal with wood meal dried at ambient temperature over a desiccant. C contents of oven-dried woods were significantly lower, indicating that all past data on C content in oven- or kiln-dried woods may be inaccurate in relation to the true C content of forests. We conclude that C content varies substantially among species as well as within individual trees. Clearly, a 50% generic value is an oversimplification of limited application in relation to global warming and the concept of "carbon credits". (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Population declines of many avian species are often attributed to increased rates of nest predation in fragmented landscapes, yet mechanisms underlying these effects have rarely been examined. We reviewed the literature to determine the extent to which hypotheses about nest predators and fragmentation have been invoked and compared this to the number of direct tests of predators with respect to habitat edge, Patch size, or landscape type. We also conducted a meta-analysis of tested predator effects to evaluate whether predator responses-numerical, functional, or species richness-to fragmentation depend on spatial scale (edge, Patch, or landscape), landscape type, geographic region, or predator taxa. We found 120 papers containing hypotheses about nest Predators and fragmentation, but only 31 with hypothesis; tests.;. Most tests were of a single predator species or guild, whereas most cited hypotheses generalized across broader taxonomic groups. Results of predator tests were variable, but some general patterns were evident. Predator effects, including increased abundance, activity, or species richness in edges, small patches, or certain landscapes, were more prevalent (1) in tests conducted at the landscape scale than at the local scale, (2) in agricultural landscapes than in predominantly forested landscapes, (3) in certain biogeographic regions, and (4) for avian predators than for mammalian predators. Local-scale (edge and patch) effects were most common when the land surrounding patches was agricultural and when tests were conducted within agricultural landscapes. The response of nest predators to fragmentation is complex, taxon-specific, and context-dependent. Conservation efforts for declining avian species may therefore need to be customized according to the nest-predator species primarily responsible for local nest mortality and the nature of the landscape mosaic.

AB Increasingly, biological reserves throughout the world are threatened by cumulative alterations in hydrologic connectivity within the greater landscape. Hydrologic connectivity is used here in an ecological sense to refer to water-mediated transfer of matter, energy, and/or organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Obvious human influences that alter this property include dams, associated flow regulation, groundwater extraction, and water diversion, all of which can result in a cascade of events in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Even disturbances well outside the boundaries of reserves can have profound effects on the biological integrity of these "protected" areas. Factors such as nutrient and toxic pollution and the spread of normative species are perpetuated by hydrologic connectivity, and their effects can be exacerbated by changes in this property. Hydrological alterations are now affecting reserves through increasingly broad feedback loops, ranging from overdrawn aquifers to atmospheric deposition and global climate change. Such alterations are often beyond the direct control of managers because they lie outside reserve boundaries, and data on hydrologic connection between reserves and surrounding landscapes are scant. The subject of water has also been typically excluded from the literature pertaining to both theoretical and practical aspects of reserve size, isolation, and design. This results, in part, from early management strategies developed when the landscape matrix outside of reserves was not excessively fragmented, and when awareness of hydrologic connectivity was in its infancy.
   The location of a given reserve within a watershed, relative to regional aquifers and wind and precipitation patterns, can play a key role in its response to human disturbance transmitted through the hydrologic cycle. To illustrate this point, I discuss reserves of varying sizes from diverse regions throughout the world. Reserves located in middle and lower watersheds often suffer direct hydrologic alterations that cause severe habitat modification and exacerbate the effects of pollution. In contrast, reserves in upper watersheds may have intact physical habitat and contain important source populations of some native biota, yet hydrologic disturbances in lower watersheds may cause extirpation of migratory species, cascading trophic effects, and genetic isolation. Worldwide, <7% of land area is either strictly or partially protected, and many reserves are in danger of becoming population "sinks" for wildlife if we do not develop a more predictive understanding of how they are affected by hydrologic alterations that originate outside of their boundaries.

AB Wild boar are now present on all continents except Antarctica and can greatly affect community structure and ecosystem function. Their destructive feeding habits, primarily rooting disturbance, can reduce plant cover, diversity, and regeneration. Furthermore, predation and habitat destruction by boar can greatly affect animal communities. Effects of wild boar on fungi and aquatic communities are scarcely studied, and soil properties and processes seem more resistant to disturbance. Wild boar also affect humans' economy as they cause crop damage and transmit diseases to livestock and wildlife. In this review, we found that most of the published literature examines boar effects in their introduced range and little is available from the native distribution. Because most of the research describes direct effects of wild boar on plant communities and predation on some animal communities, less is known about indirect effects on ecosystem function. Finally, predictive research and information on ecosystem recovery after wild boar removal are scarce. We identified research gaps and urge the need to lower wild boar densities. Identifying commonalities among wild boar impacts on native ecosystems across its introduced range will help in the design of management strategies.

TI Components of tree resilience: effects of successive low-growth episodes

   RESISTANCE; FIRE; BIODIVERSITY; CLIMATE; DISTURBANCE; STABILITY
AB Recent world-wide episodes of tree dieback have been attributed to increasing temperatures and associated drought. Because these events are likely to become more common, improved knowledge of their cumulative effects on resilience and the ability to recover pre-disturbance conditions is important for forest management. Here we propose several indices to examine components of individual tree resilience based on tree ring growth: resistance (inverse of growth reduction during the episode), recovery (growth increase relative to the minimum growth during the episode), resilience (capacity to reach pre-episode growth levels) and relative resilience (resilience weighted by the damage incurred during the episode).
   Based on tree ring analyses, we analyzed historical patterns of tree resilience to successive drought-induced low growth periods in ponderosa pine trees growing in unmanaged, remote forests of the Rocky Mountains. Low-growth periods registered in tree rings were related to anomalies in the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and were attributed to drought. Independently of the impact of a specific event, subsequent growth after a single low-growth episode was related to the growth prior to the event. Growth performance differed with tree age: young trees were overall more resistant to low-growth periods, but older trees recovered better from more recent events. Regardless of tree age, recently burned sites exhibited lower post-episode growth and lower resistance and resilience than unburned ones. We found mixed evidence for the cumulative effect of past low-growth episodes: overall, greater impacts of a prior event and greater cumulative effects of past low-growth periods caused a decrease in resistance. However, we did not find a progressive decrease in resilience over time in old trees. Our results highlight the value of using a combination of estimators to evaluate the different components of resilience. Specifically, while tree responses to disturbance depend on past disturbance episodes, the response is context-specific and depends on the impact the capacity to recover after disturbance. This suggests that recent increases in forest mortality under current climate trends could relate to thresholds on specific components of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience itself) rather than to an overall loss of resilience over time. Identifying such thresholds and their underlying mechanisms is a promising area of research with important implications for forest management.

AB Ecological approaches to community assembly have emphasized the interplay between neutral processes, niche-based environmental filtering and niche-based species sorting in an interactive milieu. Recently, progress has been made in terms of aligning our vocabulary with conceptual advances, assessing how trait-based community functional parameters differ from neutral expectation and assessing how traits vary along environmental gradients. Experiments have confirmed the influence of these processes on assembly and have addressed the role of dispersal in shaping local assemblages. Community phylogenetics has forged common ground between ecologists and biogeographers, but it is not a proxy for trait-based approaches. Community assembly theory is in need of a comparative synthesis that addresses how the relative importance of niche and neutral processes varies among taxa, along environmental gradients, and across scales. Towards that goal, we suggest a set of traits that probably confer increasing community neutrality and regionality and review the influences of stress, disturbance and scale on the importance of niche assembly. We advocate increasing the complexity of experiments in order to assess the relative importance of multiple processes. As an example, we provide evidence that dispersal, niche processes and trait interdependencies have about equal influence on trait-based assembly in an experimental grassland.

AB We maintained a factorial nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) addition experiment for 11 years in a humid lowland forest growing on a relatively fertile soil in Panama to evaluate potential nutrient limitation of tree growth rates, fine-litter production, and fine-root biomass. We replicated the eight factorial treatments four times using 32 plots of 40x40 m each. The addition of K was associated with significant decreases in stand-level fine-root biomass and, in a companion study of seedlings, decreases in allocation to roots and increases in height growth rates. The addition of K and N together was associated with significant increases in growth rates of saplings and poles (1-10 cm in diameter at breast height) and a further marginally significant decrease in stand-level fine-root biomass. The addition of P was associated with a marginally significant (P = 0.058) increase in fine-litter production that was consistent across all litter fractions. Our experiment provides evidence that N, P, and K all limit forest plants growing on a relatively fertile soil in the lowland tropics, with the strongest evidence for limitation by K among seedlings, saplings, and poles.

AB Among the myriad complications involved in the current food crisis, the relationship between agriculture and the rest of nature is one of the most important yet remains only incompletely analyzed. Particularly in tropical areas, agriculture is frequently seen as the antithesis of the natural world, where the problem is framed as one of minimizing land devoted to agriculture so as to devote more to conservation of biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In particular, the "forest transition model" projects an overly optimistic vision of a future where increased agricultural intensification (to produce more per hectare) and/or increased rural-to-urban migration (to reduce the rural population that cuts forest for agriculture) suggests a near future of much tropical aforestation and higher agricultural production. Reviewing recent developments in ecological theory (showing the importance of migration between fragments and local extinction rates) coupled with empirical evidence, we argue that there is little to suggest that the forest transition model is useful for tropical areas, at least under current sociopolitical structures. A model that incorporates the agricultural matrix as an integral component of conservation programs is proposed. Furthermore, we suggest that this model will be most successful within a framework of small-scale agroecological production.

AB We examined genetic diversity and population structure in the American landmass using 678 autosomal microsatellite markers genotyped in 422 individuals representing 24 Native American populations sampled from North, Central, and South America. These data were analyzed jointly with similar data available in 54 other indigenous populations worldwide, including an additional five Native American groups. The Native American populations have lower genetic diversity and greater differentiation than populations from other continental regions. We observe gradients both of decreasing genetic diversity as a function of geographic distance from the Bering Strait and of decreasing genetic similarity to Siberians-signals of the southward dispersal of human populations from the northwestern tip of the Americas. We also observe evidence of: ( 1) a higher level of diversity and lower level of population structure in western South America compared to eastern South America, ( 2) a relative lack of differentiation between Mesoamerican and Andean populations, ( 3) a scenario in which coastal routes were easier for migrating peoples to traverse in comparison with inland routes, and ( 4) a partial agreement on a local scale between genetic similarity and the linguistic classification of populations. These findings offer new insights into the process of population dispersal and differentiation during the peopling of the Americas.

AB The quantitative simulation of gross primary production (GPP) at various spatial and temporal scales has been a major challenge in quantifying the global carbon cycle. We developed a light use efficiency (LUE) daily GPP model from eddy covariance (EC) measurements. The model, called EC-LUE, is driven by only four variables: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature, and the Bowen ratio of sensible to latent heat flux (used to calculate moisture stress). The EC-LUE model relies on two assumptions: First, that the fraction of absorbed PAR (MAR) is a linear function of NDVI; Second, that the realized light use efficiency, calculated from a biome-independent invariant potential LUE, is controlled by air temperature or soil moisture, whichever is most limiting. The EC-LUE model was calibrated and validated using 24,349 daily GPP estimates derived from 28 eddy covariance flux towers from the AmeriFlux and EuroFlux networks, covering a variety of forests, grasslands and savannas. The model explained 85% and 77% of the observed variations of daily GPP for all the calibration and validation sites, respectively. A comparison with GPP calculated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) indicated that the EC-LUE model predicted GPP that better matched tower data across these sites. The realized LUE was predominantly controlled by moisture conditions throughout the growing season, and controlled by temperature only at the beginning and end of the growing season. The EC-LUE model is an alternative approach that makes it possible to map daily GPP over large areas because (1) the potential LUE is invariant across various land cover types and (2) all driving forces of the model can be derived from remote sensing data or existing climate observation networks.

AB The movement of individuals defines a spatial neighborhood that can help determine marine management strategies. Here, I briefly review four fields of marine biology that each differentially illuminate the scale of marine neighborhoods: effects of marine reserves, tagging studies, microchemistry, and population genetics. These suggest adult neighborhood sizes for many demersal fish and invertebrates as small as kilometers and up to 10 to 100 km. Larval dispersal may be shorter than previously suspected: neighborhood sizes of 10 to 100 km for invertebrates and 50 to 200 km for fish are common in current compilations.
   How can small reserves protect such species? One conceptual framework is to set reserve size based on adult neighborhood sizes of highly fished species and determine spacing of a reserve network based on larval neighborhoods. The multispecies nature of fisheries demands that network designs accommodate different life histories and take into account the way local human communities use marine resources.

AB The elevational gradient of species richness is often claimed to mirror the latitudinal gradient and has traditionally been explained by assuming a decrease in productivity with elevation and more recently by Rapoport's rule. The influence of area on the pattern has rarely been considered. Analyses of all South American tropical land birds (more than one-fourth of the extant bird species on Earth) are used to examine four species richness/elevation models: null model, Rapoport's rule, and monotonic or hump-shaped productivity/species richness relationships. To quantify the area effect, species-area curves were created for seven elevational zones. Not accounting for area, species richness declined monotonically with elevation, but area accounted for 67%-91% of the variation in species richness per zone. When area was factored out, a hump-shaped pattern emerged, with more species in the 500-1,000-m (P < .005) and 1,000-1,500-m zones (P < .10) than in the 0-500-m zone. Rapoport's rule and the monotonic productivity/species richness relationship were thus not supported. Instead, elevational turnover rates and numbers of shared species between zones suggested that the hump-shaped pattern reflects geometric constraints (as predicted by the null model) imposed by the narrow span of the gradient, and it is suggested that midelevational zones may represent sink habitats.

AB Biochar is widely recognized as an efficient tool for carbon sequestration and soil fertility. The understanding of its chemical and physical properties, which are strongly related to the type of the initial material used and pyrolysis conditions, is crucial to identify the most suitable application of biochar in soil. A selection of organic wastes with different characteristics (e.g., rice husk (RH), rice straw (RS), wood chips of apple tree (Malus pumila) (AB), and oak tree (Quercus serrata) (OB)) were pyrolyzed at different temperatures (400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 degrees C) in order to optimize the physicochemical properties of biochar as a soil amendment. Low-temperature pyrolysis produced high biochar yields; in contrast, high-temperature pyrolysis led to biochars with a high C content, large surface area, and high adsorption characteristics. Biochar obtained at 600 degrees C leads to a high recalcitrant character, whereas that obtained at 400 degrees C retains volatile and easily labile compounds. The biochar obtained from rice materials (RH and RS) showed a high yield and unique chemical properties because of the incorporation of silica elements into its chemical structure. The biochar obtained from wood materials (AB and OB) showed high carbon content and a high absorption character.

AB Biochar is increasingly being recognized by scientists and policy makers for its potential role in carbon sequestration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, waste mitigation, and as a soil amendment. The published reviews on biochar application to soil have so far focused mainly on the agronomic benefits, and have paid little attention to the potential unintended effects. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a balanced perspective on the agronomic and environmental impacts of biochar amendment to soil. The chapter highlights the physical and chemical characteristics of biochar, which can impact on the sorption, hence efficacy and biodegradation, of pesticides. As a consequence, weed control in biochar-amended soils may prove more difficult as preemergent herbicides may be less effective. Since biochars are often prepared from a variety of feedstocks (including waste materials), the potential introduction of contaminants needs to be considered before land application. Metal contaminants, in particular, have been shown to impact on plant growth, and soil microbial and faunal communities. Biochar has also been shown to influence a range of soil chemical properties, and rapid changes to nutrient availability, pH, and electrical conductivity need to be carefully considered to avoid unintended consequences for productivity. This chapter highlights some key areas of research which need to be completed to ensure a safe and sustainable use of biochar. In particular, understanding characteristics of biochars to avoid ecotoxicological impacts, understanding the effects of biochar on nutrient and contaminant behavior and transport, the effects of aging and the influence of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions on key properties are some of the areas that require attention.

AB Classic local stability theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist despite empiricists' abundant documentation of such complexity in nature. This contradiction has puzzled biologists for decades. While some have explored how stability may be achieved in small modules of a few interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically persist remain scarce and inadequately understood. Here, we help fill this void by combining structural models of complex food webs with nonlinear bioenergetic models of population dynamics parameterized by biological rates that are allometrically scaled to populations' average body masses. Increasing predator-prey body mass ratios increase population persistence up to a saturation level that is reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical predator-prey body mass ratios from a global data base. Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become neutral or positive relationships at these empirical ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator-prey body mass ratios found in nature may be key to enabling persistence of populations in complex food webs and stabilizing the diversity of natural ecosystems.

AB Species-area relationships (SAR) are fundamental in the understanding of biodiversity patterns and of critical importance for predicting species extinction risk worldwide. Despite the enormous attention given to SAR in the form of many individual analyses, little attempt has been made to synthesize these studies. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 794 SAR, comprising a wide span of organisms, habitats and locations. We identified factors reflecting both pattern-based and dynamic approaches to SAR and tested whether these factors leave significant imprints on the slope and strength of SAR. Our analysis revealed that SAR are significantly affected by variables characterizing the sampling scheme, the spatial scale, and the types of organisms or habitats involved. We found that steeper SAR are generated at lower latitudes and by larger organisms. SAR varied significantly between nested and independent sampling schemes and between major ecosystem types, but not generally between the terrestrial and the aquatic realm. Both the fit and the slope of the SAR were scale-dependent. We conclude that factors dynamically regulating species richness at different spatial scales strongly affect the shape of SAR. We highlight important consequences of this systematic variation in SAR for ecological theory, conservation management and extinction risk predictions.

AB Across large parts of the world, wildlife has to coexist with human activity in highly modified and fragmented landscapes. Combining concepts from population viability analysis and spatial reserve design, this study develops efficient quantitative methods for identifying conservation core areas at large, even national or continental scales. The proposed methods emphasize long-term population persistence, are applicable to both fragmented and natural landscape structures, and produce a hierarchical zonation of regional conservation priority. The methods are applied to both observational data for threatened butterflies at the scale of Britain and modelled probability of occurrence surfaces for indicator species in part of Australia. In both cases, priority landscapes important for conservation management are identified.

AB 1. Drought is a natural disturbance of aquatic ecosystems and can be a major factor in structuring aquatic communities. For individuals, populations and communities to persist in disturbed environments, they must have refuge from disturbance or disturbance must be minimal. Refugia convey spatial and temporal resistance or resilience in the face of disturbance, but the role of refugia in aquatic systems remains poorly understood.
   2. We review available literature on aquatic refugia for fishes in order to synthesise current knowledge and provide suggestions for needed research. Our objectives were to clarify definitions of disturbance and refugia in the context of drought in aquatic systems, review how refuge habitats influence fish community structure, and consider the potential impact of refugia on fish population and community dynamics during drought.
   3. Droughts cause a decrease in surface area/volume and an increase in extremes of physical and chemical water quality parameters. These conditions are linked with biotic interactions that structure the community of fishes residing in low-flow or dry season refugia by increasing mortality rates, decreasing birth rates and/or increasing migration rates. Many aquatic organisms seek refuge from disturbance and/or have adaptations (e.g. physiological tolerance) that provide refuge.
   4. Drought in aquatic systems leads to shifts in refugia spacing and connectance at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Refuge size, disturbance intensity, and mobility of organisms is predicted to play a large role in population persistence. We expect that refuge habitats will experience net immigration during drying and net emigration after rewetting, with the opposite occurring in surrounding habitat patches. Population dynamics of fishes using refugia during drought are best modelled by modified source-sink dynamics, but dynamics are likely to change with spatial scale.

AB Early work on loud calling in mammals emphasized the importance of dynamic characteristics such as calling rate as cues to fitness and fighting ability. In contrast, little is known of the potential for fine-scaled acoustic cues to provide receivers with direct information on fitness. Fundamental frequency has typically been considered a good potential indicator of body size in the literature, but resonance frequencies (formants), which should be constrained by the length of the vocal tract, have received less attention. We conducted a detailed acoustic analysis on an extensive database of roars from red deer stags, Cervus elaphus, in a free-ranging population to investigate which variables provided honest information on age, body weight and reproductive success. Although fundamental frequency was higher in young stags than in adults, it did not decrease with body weight within adults and source cues (i.e. those generated by the larynx) in general did not provide clear information on fitness-related characteristics. In contrast, minimum formant frequencies, reached during the part of the roar when the mobile larynx is most fully retracted towards the sternum, decreased with body weight and age and were strongly negatively correlated with our index of reproductive success. Such production-related acoustic cues to body size and fitness, rendered honest by an anatomical constraint limiting the downward movement of the larynx, provide receivers with accurate information that could be used to assess rivals and choose mates.

AB Tests for incongruence as an indicator of among-data partition conflict have played an important role in conditional data combination. When such tests reveal significant incongruence, this has been interpreted as a rationale for not combining data into a single phylogenetic analysis. In this study of lorisiform phylogeny, we use the incongruence length difference (ILD) test to assess conflict among three independent data sets. A large morphological data set and two unlinked molecular data sets-the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the nuclear interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (exon 1)-are analyzed with various optimality criteria and weighting mechanisms to determine the phylogenetic relationships among slow lorises (Primates, Loridae). When analyzed separately, the morphological data show impressive statistical support for a monophyletic Loridae. Both molecular data sets resolve the Loridae as paraphyletic, though with different branching orders depending on the optimality criterion or character weighting used. When the three data partitions are analyzed in various combinations, an inverse relationship between congruence and phylogenetic accuracy is observed. Nearly all combined analyses that recover monophyly indicate strong data partition incongruence ( P = 0.00005 in the most extreme case), whereas all analyses that recover paraphyly indicate lack of significant incongruence. Numerous lines of evidence verify that monophyly is the accurate phylogenetic result. Therefore, this study contributes to a growing body of information affirming that measures of incongruence should not be used as indicators of data set combinability.

AB Individual plant species that modify ecosystem properties have traditionally been thought to be uncommon in natural systems. I hypothesize that many invasive nonindigenous species do alter these properties at several scales. The non-indigenous plant species in Florida considered the most invasive by the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council are examined for this capability through review of the available literature. Out of 31 species total, 12-20 (39-64%) potentially alter the ecosystem properties of geomorphology, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and disturbance. When population-level properties that indicate superior competitive ability of the invading species are examined, 13-24 (42-77%) of the species are included, with the majority of species showing traits capable of modifying natural systems at both ecosystem and community/population scales. This review suggests that ecosystem alteration may be relatively common among invasive non-indigenous species. However, much of the current information is anecdotal. Empirical studies directly examining the effects of species on ecosystem and smaller-scale processes are necessary, and highly invasive species may be particularly appropriate for such research. Further, as non-indigenous species homogenize the global flora, they may also homogenize the local flora by increasing the representation of ruderal species. Where ecosystem processes have been altered, site restoration likely will require both control of the invader(s) and recovery of processes.

AB Forests exhibit a mosaic of different spectral environments that arise from forest geometry and weather. If visual signals are used in mate choice, then forest geometry and weather will affect reproductive behavior because the appearance of a visual signal depends on the joint effects of ambient light and the animal's reflectance spectra. We investigated three lekking birds at Nourages field station, French Guiana: Rupicola rupicola, Corapipo gutturalis, and Lepidothrix serena. Conspicuousness is a function of ambient light spectra during displays and the reflectance spectra of color pattern elements of the birds and their visual backgrounds. Each species places its lek and performs its lek displays in only one or two of the available light environments, and some may specialize in the more extreme spectra even within each light environment. The color patterns and behavior of each species maximize its visual contrast during its display and reduce it off the lek or on the lek but not displaying. Each species does this with a different combination of colors and light environments. If this phenomenon is general, then it has important implications for the evolution of color patterns and display behavior.

AB Organismal performance abilities occupy a central position in phenotypic evolution; they are determined by suites of interacting lower-level traits (e.g., morphology and physiology) and they are a primary focus of natural selection. The mechanisms by which higher levels of organismal performance are achieved during evolution are therefore fundamentally important for understanding correlated evolution in general and coadaptation in particular. Here we address correlated evolution of morphological, physiological, and behavioral characteristics that influence interspecific variation in sprint speed in a clade of lacertid lizards. Phylogenetic analyses using independent contrasts indicate that the evolution of high maximum sprinting abilities (measured on a photocell-timed racetrack) has occurred via the evolution of (1) longer hind limbs relative to body size, and (2) a higher physiologically optimum temperature for sprinting. For ectotherms, which experience variable body temperatures while active, sprinting abilities in nature depend on both maximum capacities and relative performance levels (i.e., percent of maximum) that can be attained. With respect to temperature effects, relative performance levels are determined by the interaction between thermal physiology and thermoregulatory behavior. Among the 13 species or subspecies of lizards in the present study, differences in the optimal temperature for sprinting (body temperature at which lizards run fastest) closely matched interspecific variation in median preferred body temperature (measured in a laboratory photothermal gradient), indicating correlated evolution of thermal physiology and thermal preferences. Variability of the preferred body temperatures maintained by each species is, across species, negatively correlated with the thermal-performance breadth (range of body temperatures over which lizards can run relatively fast). This pattern leads to interspecific differences in the levels of relative sprint speed that lizards are predicted to attain while active at their preferred temperatures. The highest levels of predicted relative performance are achieved by species that combine a narrow, precise distribution of preferred temperatures with the ability to sprint at near-maximum speeds over a wide range of body temperatures. The observed among-species differences in predicted relative speed were positively correlated with the interspecific variation in maximum sprinting capacities. Thus, species that attain the highest maximum speeds are (1) also able to run at near-maximum levels over a wide range of temperatures and (2) also maintain body temperatures within a narrow zone near the optimal temperature for sprinting. The observed pattern of correlated evolution therefore has involved traits at distinct levels of biological organization, that is, morphology, physiology, and behavior; and tradeoffs are not evident. We hypothesize that this particular trait combination has evolved in response to coadaptational selection pressures. We also discuss our results in the context of possible evolutionary responses to global climatic change.

AB An evolutionary framework for viewing the formation, the stability, the organizational structure, and the social dynamics of biological families is developed, This framework is based upon three conceptual pillars: ecological constraints theory, inclusive fitness theory, and reproductive skew theory, I offer a set of 15 predictions pertaining to living within family groups, The logic of each is discussed, and empirical evidence from family-living vertebrates is summarized, I argue that knowledge of four basic parameters, (i) genetic relatedness, (ii) social dominance, (iii) the benefits of group living, and (iv) the probable success of independent reproduction, can explain many aspects of family life in birds and mammals,I suggest that this evolutionary perspective will provide insights into understanding human family systems as well.

AB The shy-bold continuum is recognized as a fundamental axis of behavioral variation in humans, but 3 major issues have not been addressed. First, the taxonomic distribution of shyness and boldness is unknown. Second, the ecological consequences of shyness and boldness have not been studied in natural populations. Third, no one has tried to predict and test patterns of shyness and boldness that might result from natural selection. We show that a shy-bold continuum, which influences diet, predator risk, and parasite fauna, exists in juvenile pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). Individual differences are relatively stable in nature but seem to disappear when the fish are held in social and ecological isolation in the laboratory. Thus, phenotypic stability may not reflect innate tendencies to be shy or bold but rather environmental conditions that maintain differences between phenotypically plastic individuals.

AB The R package pcadapt performs genome scans to detect genes under selection based on population genomic data. It assumes that candidate markers are outliers with respect to how they are related to population structure. Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not require grouping individuals into populations. Since its first release, pcadapt has evolved in terms of both statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other computer programs for genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK, sNMF). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40% of false discoveries. We also find that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.

AB Humans are transforming the biosphere in unprecedented ways, raising the important question of how these impacts are changing biodiversity. Here we argue that our understanding of biodiversity trends in the Anthropocene, and our ability to protect the natural world, is impeded by a failure to consider different types of biodiversity measured at different spatial scales. We propose that ecologists should recognize and assess 15 distinct categories of biodiversity trend. We summarize what is known about each of these 15 categories, identify major gaps in our current knowledge, and recommend the next steps required for better understanding of trends in biodiversity.

AB One of the oldest challenges in ecology is to understand the processes that underpin the composition of communities. Historically, an obvious way in which to describe community compositions has been diversity in terms of the number and abundances of species. However, the failure to reject contradictory models has led to communities now being characterized by trait and phylogenetic diversities. Our objective here is to demonstrate how species, trait and phylogenetic diversity can be combined together from large to local spatial scales to reveal the historical, deterministic and stochastic processes that impact the compositions of local communities. Research in this area has recently been advanced by the development of mathematical measures that incorporate trait dissimilarities and phylogenetic relatedness between species. However, measures of trait diversity have been developed independently of phylogenetic measures and conversely most of the phylogenetic diversity measures have been developed independently of trait diversity measures. This has led to semantic confusions particularly when classical ecological and evolutionary approaches are integrated so closely together. Consequently, we propose a unified semantic framework and demonstrate the importance of the links among species, phylogenetic and trait diversity indices. Furthermore, species, trait and phylogenetic diversity indices differ in the ways they can be used across different spatial scales. The connections between large-scale, regional and local processes allow the consideration of historical factors in addition to local ecological deterministic or stochastic processes. Phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used in large-scale analyses to determine how historical and/or environmental factors affect both the formation of species assemblages and patterns in species richness across latitude or elevation gradients. Both phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used at different spatial scales to identify the relative impacts of ecological deterministic processes such as environmental filtering and limiting similarity from alternative processes such as random speciation and extinction, random dispersal and ecological drift. Measures of phylogenetic diversity combine phenotypic and genetic diversity and have the potential to reveal both the ecological and historical factors that impact local communities. Consequently, we demonstrate that, when used in a comparative way, species, trait and phylogenetic structures have the potential to reveal essential details that might act simultaneously in the assembly of species communities. We highlight potential directions for future research. These might include how variation in trait and phylogenetic diversity alters with spatial distances, the role of trait and phylogenetic diversity in global-scale gradients, the connections between traits and phylogeny, the importance of trait rarity and independent evolutionary history in community assembly, the loss of trait and phylogenetic diversity due to human impacts, and the mathematical developments of biodiversity indices including within-species variations.

AB 1. We review theoretical and empirical studies to identify instances where evolutionary processes significantly affect the dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems.
   2. Early theoretical work on eco-evolutionary dynamics was concerned with the effect of (co)evolution on the stability of two-species predator-prey systems and the occurrence of character displacement in simple competitive systems. Today's theoretical ecologists are extending this work to study the eco-evolutionary dynamics of multispecies communities and the functioning and evolutionary emergence of ecosystems.
   3. In terms of methodology, eco-evolutionary modelling has diversified from simple, locus-based population genetic models to encompass models of clonal selection, quantitative trait dynamics and adaptive dynamics.
   4. The few empirical studies on community dynamics that explicitly considered evolutionary processes support the view that evolutionary and ecological dynamics often occur on similar time-scales, and that they co-determine the dynamical behaviour of ecological communities.

AB Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are broadly interested in how the interactions among organisms influence their abundance, distribution, phenotypes, and genotypic composition. Recently, we have seen a growing appreciation of how multispecies interactions can act synergistically or antagonistically to alter the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of interactions in ways that differ fundamentally from outcomes predicted by pairwise interactions. Here, we review the evidence for criteria identified to detect community-based, diffuse coevolution. These criteria include (a) the presence of genetic correlations between traits involved in multiple interactions, (b) interactions with one species that alter the likelihood or intensity of interactions with other species, and (c) nonadditive combined effects of multiple interactors. In addition, we review the evidence that multispecies interactions have demographic consequences for populations, as well as evolutionary consequences. Finally, we explore the experimental and analytical techniques, and their limitations, used in the study of multispecies interactions. Throughout, we discuss areas in particular need of future research.

AB Natural complexity can best be explored using spatial analysis tools based on concepts of landscape as process continuums that can be partially decomposed into objects or patches. We introduce a five-step methodology based on multi-scale segmentation and object relationship modelling. Hierarchical patch dynamics (HPD) is adopted as the theoretical framework to address issues of heterogeneity, scale, connectivity and quasi-equilibriums in landscapes. Remote sensing has emerged as the most useful data source for characterizing land use/land cover but a vast majority of applications rely on basic image processing concepts developed in the 1970s: one spatial scale, per-pixel classification of a multi-scale spectral feature space. We argue that this methodology does not make sufficient use of spatial concepts of neighbourhood, proximity or homogeneity. In contrast, the authors demonstrate in this article the utility of the HPD framework as a theoretical basis for landscape analysis in two different projects using alternative image processing methodologies, which try to overcome the 'pixel-centred' view.
   The first project focuses on habitat mapping using a high dimension multi-scale GIS database. Focal patches are derived through aggregating automatically generated landscape segments using sub-patch information including dominant tree crown densities and species. The second project uses fractal-based segmentation to produce multiple candidate segmented agricultural scenes, and then develops a decision framework to choose the combination of segmentation levels best suited to identifying shrub encroachment. The challenge and flexibility of the multi-scale segmentation/object relationship modelling approach lies in the defining of the semantic rules which relate the lower level landscape units or holons to higher levels of organization. We seek to embrace the challenges of scale and hierarchy in landscapes and have tested two different ways to decompose complex natural environments into focal units utilising topological relations to model between the smallest units of differentiation and the focal level. We believe the use of a HPD theoretical framework will help development of better tools for characterizing the patterns and processes, acting through a range of scales, which make up landscapes.

AB This article considers a demographic model where a population varies in size either linearly or exponentially. The genealogical history of microsatellite data sampled from this population can be described using coalescent theory. A method is presented whereby the posterior probability distribution of the genealogical and demographic parameters can be estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. The likelihood surface for the demographic parameters is complicated and its general features are described. The method is then applied to published microsatellite data from two populations. Data from the northern hairy-nosed wombat show strong evidence of decline. Data from European humans show weak evidence of expansion.

AB Variability in population growth rate is thought to have negative consequences for organism fitness. Theory for matrix population models predicts that variance in population growth rate should be the sum of the variance in each matrix entry times the squared sensitivity term for that matrix entry. I analyzed the stage-specific demography of 30 field populations from 17 published studies for pattern between the variance of a demographic term and its contribution to population growth. There were no instances in which a matrix entry both was highly variable and had a large effect on population growth rate; instead, correlations between estimates of temporal variance in a term and contribution to population growth (sensitivity or elasticity) were overwhelmingly negative. In addition, survivorship or growth sensitivities or elasticities always exceeded those of fecundity, implying that the former two terms always contributed more to population growth rate. These results suggest that variable life history stages tend to contribute relatively little to population growth rates because natural selection may alter life histories to minimize stages with both high sensitivity and high variation.

DT Article

AB Wetlands were found to be important sources of methyl mercury to the boreal forest ecosystem.  Yields of methyl mercury were about 26-79 times higher from wetland portions of catchments (1.84-5.55 mg.ha-1.yr-1) than from purely upland areas (0.07 mg.ha-1.yr-1). Mass-balance estimates using methyl mercury inputs in wet deposition and outputs in runoff water indicated that purely upland catchments and lakes were sites of methyl mercury retention or demethylation, while catchments with wetland areas were sites of net methyl mercury production. These observations may explain the high concentrations of mercury in fish taken from lakes that are high in colour because they receive water from wetlands. There was no relationship between the concentration of total mercury and the concentration of methyl mercury in runoff water. Total mercury yields were low from a wetland-dominated catchment, higher from a combination upland/riparian wetland catchment, and highest from a purely upland catchment. The opposite was true for methyl mercury yields from these same catchments. This indicates that environmental factors other than total mercury concentration are controlling the production and loss of methyl mercury from catchments.

AB Biochars have attracted tremendous attention due to their effects on soil improvement; they enhance carbon storage, soil fertility and quality, and contaminant (organic and heavy metal) immobilization and transformation. These effects could be achieved by modifying soil microbial habitats and (or) directly influencing microbial metabolisms, which together induce changes in microbial activity and microbial community structures. This review links microbial responses, including microbial activity, community structures and soil enzyme activities, with changes in soil properties caused by biochars. In particular, we summarized possible mechanisms that are involved in the effects that biochar-microbe interactions have on soil carbon sequestration and pollution remediation. Special attention has been paid to biochar effects on the formation and protection of soil aggregates, biochar adsorption of contaminants, biochar-mediated transformation of soil contaminants by microorganisms, and biochar-facilitated electron transfer between microbial cells and contaminants and soil organic matter. Certain reactive organic compounds and heavy metals in biochar may induce toxicity to soil microorganisms. Adsorption and hydrolysis of signaling molecules by biochar interrupts microbial interspecific communications, potentially altering soil microbial community structures. Further research is urged to verify the proposed mechanisms involved in biochar-microbiota interactions for soil remediation and improvement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are obligate biotrophs that acquire carbon (C) solely from host plants. AM fungi can proliferate hyphae in, and acquire nitrogen (N) from, organic matter. Although they can transfer some of that N to plants, we tested the hypothesis that organic matter is an important N source for the AM fungi themselves. We grew pairs of plants with and without the AM fungus Glomus hoi in microcosms that allowed only the fungus access to a N-15/C-13-labeled organic patch; in some cases, one plant was shaded to reduce C supply to the fungus. The fungal hyphae proliferated vigorously in the patch, irrespective of shading, and increased plant growth and N content; similar to 3% of plant N came from the patch. The extraradical mycelium of the fungus was N-rich (3-5% N) and up to 31% of fungal N came from the patch, confirming the hypothesis. The fungus acquired N as decomposition products, because hyphae were not C-13-enriched. In a second experiment, hyphae of both G. hoi and Glomus mosseae that exploited an organic material patch were also better able to colonize a new host plant, demonstrating a fungal growth response. These findings show that AM fungi can obtain substantial amounts of N from decomposing organic materials and can enhance their fitness as a result. The large biomass and high N demand of AM fungi means that they represent a global N pool equivalent in magnitude to fine roots and play a substantial and hitherto overlooked role in the nitrogen cycle.

AB During the establishment phase of a biological invasion, population dynamics are strongly influenced by Allee effects and stochastic dynamics, both of which may lead to extinction of low-density populations. Allee effects refer to a decline in population growth rate with a decline in abundance and can arise from various mechanisms. Strategies to eradicate newly established populations should focus on either enhancing Allee effects or suppressing populations below Allee thresholds, such that extinction proceeds without further intervention. The spread phase of invasions results from the coupling of population growth with dispersal. Reaction-diffusion is the simplest form of spread, resulting in continuous expansion and asymptotically constant radial rates of spread. However, spread of most nonindigenous insects is characterized by occasional long-distance dispersal, which results in the formation of isolated colonies that grow, coalesce, and greatly increase spread. Allee effects also affect spread, generally in a negative fashion. Efforts to slow, stop, or reverse spread should incorporate the spread dynamics unique to the target species.

AB Data from a national butterfly monitoring scheme were analysed to test for relationships between temperature and three phenological measures, duration of flight period and timing of both first and peak appearance. First appearances of most British butterflies has advanced in the last two decades and is strongly related to earlier peak appearance and, for multibrooded species, longer flight period. Mean dates of first and peak appearance are examined in relation to Manley's central England temperatures, using regression techniques. We predict that, in the absence of confounding factors, such as interactions with other organisms and land-use change, climate warming of the order of 1 degrees C could advance first and peak appearance of most butterflies by 2-10 days.

AB In order to find and define any assembly rules for communities, we must first investigate the patterns among species assemblages. We used a series of null models to test for patterns in wetland plant composition al the level of species, functional guilds, and traits. At the species level, we found significant checkerboard and nestedness patterns. Three functional guilds had some tendency to contribute a constant percentage to species richness, but after Bonferroni correction there was no significant pattern. Coexisting plant species showed no consistent overall pattern of morphological dispersion. However, when we considered each of 11 traits in turn, we found that 4 traits were overdispersed and 3 were underdispersed. Thus there are morphological assembly rules that constrain wetland plant community composition. These results reconcile contrasting views of community assembly. Communities can be simultaneously structured by a tension between two forces: abiotic external forces that constrain certain traits within limits and biotic internal forces that tend to keep coexisting species from being too similar. Because our sites vary along a fertility/disturbance gradient, we also investigated how trait dispersion varies in space. Trait dispersion increases with soil Fertility; soil phosphorus explains about 36% of the variance in mean nearest neighbor distance. Species richness tends to decline with mean nearest neighbor distance, which contrasts with the general pattern for animal assemblages.

AB Measurements of the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels are consistent with the hypothesis that it is trophic structure that controls the fraction of energy consumed at each trophic level, rather than energetics controlling trophic structure. Moreover, trophic structure is determined by competitive and predator-prey interactions. In freshwater pelagic communities, the collective efficiency of herbivorous plankton in consuming primary producers is up to 10 times as great as is the efficiency of forest herbivores in consuming their food. Conversely, forest predators are about three times as efficient in consuming herbivore production. as are zooplanktivorous fish. The presence of an additional level, piscivorous fish, in pelagic communities accounts for the difference. In the aquatic system, herbivorous zooplankton are freed from predation by the effect of piscivorous fish on their predators; in the terrestrial system, green plants are freed from herbivory by predation on the herbivores. We explain the contrast between freshwater pelagic systems and forests and prairies as follows: Pelagic ecosystems have more trophic levels as a result of selection for small rapidly growing primary producers, which cannot hold space in the fluid medium, in contrast to large space-occupying producers in the terrestrial environment. Consumers in pelagic systems are more frequently gape limited in the size range of food they can ingest than are grasping consumers in terrestrial systems. This difference makes for two largely distinct levels of predators in pelagic communities. The energy within the living, nondetrital components is more finely divided between trophic levels in pelagic systems than in terrestrial systems. Ecological efficiencies do not determine trophic structure; rather, they are its product.

AB This paper presents evidence of a seasonal shift from P to N as the nutrient limiting the accumulation of algal biomass in Chesapeake Bay. Following the winter/spring maximum in freshwater runoff, (1) the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to soluble reactive phosphorus (DIN/PO4) was greater than the N/P of algal biomass; (2) alkaline phosphatase activity was high; (3) phosphate turnover times were short; (4) ammonium turnover times were long; and (5) growth rates of phytoplankton were stimulated by additions of phosphate but not by additions of ammonium or silicate. During the period of low runoff in summer, all indicators reversed, and N limited algal growth rates. Silicate concentrations also showed evidence of biological depletion in spring, which may have limited diatom abundance. Due to the concordance of all indicators at large and small scales, we argue that phytoplankton growth rates exert primary control over biomass accumulation. We conclude that P and Si limit the accumulation of algal biomass along the major axis of Chesapeake Bay in spring, whereas N limits algal accumulation in summer, similar to the conclusions of D'Elia et al. (1986; Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 43: 397-406) for the Patuxent subestuary. Controlling eutrophication of the Bay and its subestuaries will require basin-specific management practices for both N and P reductions in influent waters. Such management efforts will provide ecosystem tests of nutrient limitation on a scale similar to those successfully conducted in lakes.

AB Assisted gene flow (AGF) between populations has the potential to mitigate maladaptation due to climate change. However, AGF may cause outbreeding depression (especially if source and recipient populations have been long isolated) and may disrupt local adaptation to nonclimatic factors. Selection should eliminate extrinsic outbreeding depression due to adaptive differences in large populations, and simulations suggest that, within a few generations, evolution should resolve mild intrinsic outbreeding depression due to epistasis. To weigh the risks of AGF against those of maladaptation due to climate change, we need to know the species' extent of local adaptation to climate and other environmental factors, as well as its pattern of gene flow. AGF should be a powerful tool for managing foundation and resource-producing species with large populations and broad ranges that show signs of historical adaptation to local climatic conditions.

AB Seaweeds are ecologically important primary producers, competitors, and ecosystem engineers that play a central role in coastal habitats ranging from kelp forests to coral reefs. Although seaweeds are known to be vulnerable to physical and chemical changes in the marine environment, the impacts of ongoing and future anthropogenic climate change in seaweed-dominated ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this review, we describe the ways in which changes in the environment directly affect seaweeds in terms of their physiology, growth, reproduction, and survival. We consider the extent to which seaweed species may be able to respond to these changes via adaptation or migration. We also examine the extensive reshuffling of communities that is occurring as the ecological balance between competing species changes, and as top-down control by herbivores becomes stronger or weaker. Finally, we delve into some of the ecosystem-level responses to these changes, including changes in primary productivity, diversity, and resilience. Although there are several key areas in which ecological insight is lacking, we suggest that reasonable climate-related hypotheses can be developed and tested based on current information. By strategically prioritizing research in the areas of complex environmental variation, multiple stressor effects, evolutionary adaptation, and population, community, and ecosystem-level responses, we can rapidly build upon our current understanding of seaweed biology and climate change ecology to more effectively conserve and manage coastal ecosystems.

AB Speciation with gene flow is greatly facilitated when traits subject to divergent selection also contribute to non-random mating. Such traits have been called 'magic traits', which could be interpreted to imply that they are rare, special, or unrealistic. Here, we question this assumption by illustrating that magic traits can be produced by a variety of mechanisms, including ones in which reproductive isolation arises as an automatic by-product of adaptive divergence. We also draw upon the theoretical literature to explore whether magic traits have a unique role in speciation or can be mimicked in their effects by physically linked trait-complexes. We conclude that magic traits are more frequent than previously perceived, but further work is needed to clarify their importance.

AB Species distribution models (SDM) are commonly used to obtain hypotheses on either the realized or the potential distribution of species. The reliability and meaning of these hypotheses depends on the kind of absences included in the training data, the variables used as predictors and the methods employed to parameterize the models. Information about the absence of species from certain localities is usually lacking, so pseudo-absences are often incorporated to the training data. We explore the effect of using different kinds of pseudo-absences on SDM results. To do this, we use presence information on Aphodius bonvouloiri, a dung beetle species of well-known distribution. We incorporate different types of pseudo-absences to create different sets of training data that account for absences of methodological (i.e. false absences), contingent and environmental origin. We used these datasets to calibrate SDMs with GAMs as modelling technique and climatic variables as predictors, and compare these results with geographical representations of the potential and realized distribution of the species created independently. Our results confirm the importance of the kind of absences in determining the aspect of species distribution identified through SDM. Estimations of the potential distribution require absences located farther apart in the geographic and/or environmental space than estimations of the realized distribution. Methodological absences produce overall bad models, and absences that are too far from the presence points in either the environmental or the geographic space may not be informative, yielding important overestimations. GLMs and Artificial Neural Networks yielded similar results. Synthetic discrimination measures such as the Area Under the Receiver Characteristic Curve (AUC) must be interpreted with caution, as they can produce misleading comparative results. Instead, the joint examination of ommission and comission errors provides a better understanding of the reliability of SDM results.

AB The implicit assumption of many scientific and regulatory frameworks that ecosystems impacted by human pressures may be reverted to their original condition by suppressing the pressure was tested using coastal eutrophication. The response to nutrient abatement of four thoroughly studied coastal ecosystems that received increased nutrient inputs between the 1970s and the 1980s showed that the trajectories of these ecosystems were not directly reversible. All four ecosystems displayed convoluted trajectories that failed to return to the reference status upon nutrient reduction. This failure is proposed to result from the broad changes in environmental conditions, all affecting ecosystem dynamics, that occurred over the 30 years spanning from the onset of eutrophication to the reduction of nutrient levels. Understanding ecosystem response to multiple shifting baselines is essential to set reliable targets for restoration efforts.

AB Evolutionary biology has struggled to explain the coexistence of two basic observations: Genetic variation is found in almost all traits in the presence of strong natural and sexual selection in natural populations. These two observations are in direct conflict is such selection should deplete genetic variation. Furthermore, the presence of genetic variation in a trait, and selection acting on that trait, is often not sufficient for the trait to respond to selection. Here, we bring together geometric perspectives on mutation, selection, and genetic variation and show how the perceived incompatibility between these two observations is a consequence of taking a trait-by-trait approach to the multivariate problem of genetic variation and selection. We conclude that the simultaneous presence of widespead genetic variation in, and strong selection on, individual traits indicates that substantial multivariate genetic constraints are likely to be present in natural populations.

AB Increasing attention is being devoted to taking landscape information into account in genetic studies. Among landscape variables, space is often considered as one of the most important. To reveal spatial patterns, a statistical method should be spatially explicit, that is, it should directly take spatial information into account as a component of the adjusted model or of the optimized criterion. In this paper we propose a new spatially explicit multivariate method, spatial principal component analysis (sPCA), to investigate the spatial pattern of genetic variability using allelic frequency data of individuals or populations. This analysis does not require data to meet Hardy - Weinberg expectations or linkage equilibrium to exist between loci. The sPCA yields scores summarizing both the genetic variability and the spatial structure among individuals (or populations). Global structures (patches, clines and intermediates) are disentangled from local ones (strong genetic differences between neighbors) and from random noise. Two statistical tests are proposed to detect the existence of both types of patterns. As an illustration, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) and sPCA are compared using simulated datasets and real georeferenced microsatellite data of Scandinavian brown bear individuals (Ursus arctos). sPCA performed better than PCA to reveal spatial genetic patterns. The proposed methodology is implemented in the adegenet package of the free software R.

AB A behavioural syndrome occurs when individuals behave in a consistent way through time or across contexts and is analogous to 'personality' or 'temperament'. Interest is accumulating in behavioural syndromes owing to their important ecological and evolutionary consequences. There are plenty of opportunities in this burgeoning young field to integrate proximate and functional approaches to studying behaviour, but there are few guidelines about where to start or how to design a study on behavioural syndromes. After summarizing what we do and do not know, this brief review aims to act as a general guide for studying behavioural syndromes. Although the array of possible behavioural combinations can seem overwhelming, there are at least four different strategies that can be used to choose which behaviours or contexts to study in a behavioural syndromes view. I describe the strengths and weaknesses of these nonexclusive strategies, and then discuss the methodological and statistical issues raised by such studies.

AB Why the leaves of many woody species accumulate anthocyanins prior to being shed has long puzzled biologists because it is unclear what effects anthocyanins may have on leaf function. Here, we provide evidence for red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera) that anthocyanins form a pigment layer in the palisade mesophyll layer that decreases light capture by chloroplasts. Measurements of leaf absorbance demonstrated that red-senescing leaves absorbed more light of blue-green to orange wavelengths (495-644 nm) compared with yellow-senescing leaves. Using chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements, we observed that maximum photosystem II (PSII) photon yield of red-senescing leaves recovered from a high-light stress treatment, whereas yellow-senescing leaves failed to recover after 6 h of dark adaptation, which suggests photo-oxidative damage. Because no differences were observed in light response curves of effective PSII photon yield for red- and yellow-senescing leaves, differences between red- and yellow-senescing cannot be explained by differences in the capacities for photochemical and non-photochemical light energy dissipation. A role of anthocyanins as screening pigments was explored further by measuring the responses PSII photon yield to blue light, which is preferentially absorbed by anthocyanins, versus red light, which is poorly absorbed. We found that dark-adapted PSII photon yield of red-senescing leaves recovered rapidly following illumination with blue light. However, red light induced a similar, prolonged decrease in PSII photon yield in both red- and yellow-senescing leaves. We suggest that optical masking of chlorophyll by anthocyanins reduces risk of photo-oxidative damage to leaf cells as they senesce, which otherwise may lower the efficiency of nutrient retrieval from senescing autumn leaves.

AB Sequence comparisons of genomes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from related organisms provide insight into functional conservation and diversification. We compare the sequences of ESTs from the male accessory gland of Drosophila simulans to their orthologs in its close relative Drosophila melanogaster, and demonstrate rapid divergence of many of these reproductive genes. Nineteen (similar to 11%) of 176 independent genes identified in the EST screen contain protein-coding regions with an excess of nonsynonymous over synonymous changes, suggesting that their divergence has been accelerated by positive Darwinian selection. Genes that encode putative accessory gland-specific seminal fluid proteins had a significantly elevated level of nonsynonymous substitution relative to nonaccessory gland-specific genes. With the 57 new accessory gland genes reported here, we predict that similar to 90% of the male accessory gland genes have been identified. The evolutionary EST approach applied here to identify putative targets of adaptive evolution is readily applicable to other tissues and organisms.

AB Models of host-parasite coevolution assume the presence of genetic variation for host resistance and parasite infectivity, as well as genotype-specific interactions. We used the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna and its bacterial microparasite Pasteuria ramosa to study genetic variation for host susceptibility and parasite infectivity within each of two populations. We sought to answer the following questions: Do host clones differ in their susceptibility to parasite isolates? Do parasite isolates differ in their ability to infect different host crones? Are there host clone-parasite isolate interactions? The analysis revealed considerable variation in both hose resistance and parasite infectivity. There were significant host clone-parasite isolate interactions, such that there was no single host clone that was superior to all other clones in the resistance to every parasite isolate. Likewise, there was no parasite isolate that was superior to all other isolates in infectivity to every host clone. This form of host clone-parasite isolate interaction indicates the potential for coevolution based on frequency-dependent selection. Infection success of original host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were isolated together) was significantly higher than infection success of novel host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were created in the laboratory). This finding is consistent with the idea that parasites track specific host genotypes under natural conditions. In addition, correspondence analysis revealed that some host clones, although distinguishable with neutral genetic markers, were susceptible to the same set of parasite isolates and thus probably shared resistance genes.

AB Phylogeographic, nested clade, and mismatch analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation were used to infer the temporal dynamics of distributional and demographic history of brown trout (Salmo trutta). Both new and previously published data were analyzed for 1794 trout from 174 populations. This combined analysis improved our knowledge of the complex evolutionary history of brown trout throughout its native Eurasian and North African range of distribution in many ways. It confirmed the existence of five major evolutionary lineages that evolved in geographic isolation during the Pleistocene and have remained largely allopatric since then. These should be recognized as the basic evolutionarily significant units within brown trout. Finer phylogeographic structuring was also resolved within major lineages. Contrasting temporal juxtaposition of different evolutionary factors and timing of major demographic expansions were observed among lineages. These unique evolutionary histories have been shaped both by the differential latitudinal impact of glaciations on habitat loss and potential for dispersal, as well as climatic impacts and landscape heterogeneity that translated in a longitudinal pattern of genetic diversity and population structuring at more southern latitudes. This study also provided evidence for the role of biological factors in addition to that of physical isolation in limiting introgressive hybridization among major trout lineages.

   implications for the theory of fishing

AB Large, dominant fish species that are the basis of many fisheries may be naturally so successful due partly to "cultivation effects," where adults crop down forage species that are potential competitors/predators of their own juveniles. Such effects imply a converse impact when adult abundance is severely reduced by fishing: increases in forage species may then cause lagged, apparently depensatory decreases in juvenile survival. Depensatory effects can then delay or prevent stock rebuilding. Cultivation effects are apparently common in freshwater communities and may also explain low recruitment success following severe declines of some major marine stocks such as Newfoundland Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Risk of depensatory effects should be a major target of recruitment research, and management policies should aim for considerably higher spawning abundances than has previously been assumed necessary based on recruitment data collected during adult stock declines associated with fishery development.

AB The response of soil respiration to varying environmental factors was studied in four Picea abies stands (47-, 87-, 111- and 146-year old) during the 1998 growing season. While within-site Variations of soil CO2 efflux (up to 1.6 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) were larger than their diurnal variability (<0.25 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), spatial variations within a site were smaller than seasonal changes in soil respiration rates (up to 4.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). Highest within-site variability of soil efflux was generally found during the summer months when maximum flux rates of 4-6 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) were reached (coefficient of variation 40%). Soil temperatures (in the O-f and O-h layers, and A(h) horizon) showed a pronounced seasonal course, in contrast to soil moisture. An exponential equation best described the relationships between soil temperature in the Of layer and soil CO2 efflux (r(2) between 0.75 and 0.81). However, an Arrhenius type equation always resulted in lower r(2) values (0.52-0.71). The Q(10) values ranged between 2.39 (146-year old stand) and 3.22 (87-year old stand), averaging 2.72 for the P. abies stands within the watershed. The removal of litter and organic layers generally affected soil CO2 efflux negatively. In three of the four P. abies stands (47-, 87-, 146-year old stands), soil respiration rates were reduced by 10-20% after removal of the L and O-f layer, and by 30-40% after removal of the L and most of the O-f and O-h layers. Thus, mineral soil respiration seemed to contribute a major fraction to the total soil CO2 flux (> 60%). Trenching shallow fine roots during collar insertion and mechanical inhibition of root in-growth during the following months allowed fine root respiration to be separated from microbial respiration only in times of highest root growth. Microbial respiration seemed to dominate the respiratory CO2 loss from the forest floor (>70%). The comparison of the annual soil CO2 efflux in the 47-year old P. abies stand (about 710 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) with annual litterfall and root net primary productivity estimates supported this conclusion.

AB A plant lineage can compete for resources in a spatially variable environment by colonizing new areas, exploiting resources in those areas quickly before other plants arrive to compete with it, or tolerating competition once other plants do arrive. These specializations are ubiquitous in plant communities, but all three have never been derived from a spatial model of community dynamics-instead, the possibility of rapid exploitation has been either overlooked or confounded with colonization. We use moment equations, equations for the mean densities and spatial covariance of competing plant populations, to characterize these strategies in a fully spatial stochastic model. The moment equations predict endogenous spatial pattern formation and the efficacy of spatial strategies under different conditions. The model shows that specializations for colonization, exploitation, and tolerance are all possible, and these are the only possible spatial strategies; among them, they partition all of the endogenous spatial structure in the environment. The model predicts two distinct short-dispersal specializations where parents disperse their offspring locally, either to exploit empty patches quickly or to fill patches to exclude competitors.

AB Experiments in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, provide direct evidence that large, free-ranging mammalian grazers accelerate nutrient cycling in a natural ecosystem in a way that enhances their own carrying capacity. Both nitrogen and sodium were at considerably higher plant-available levels in soils of highly grazed sites than in soils of nearby areas where animal density is sparse. Fencing that uncoupled grazers and soils indicated that the animals promote nitrogen availability on soils of inherently similar fertility and select sites of higher sodium availability as well as enhancing that availability.

TI Productivity Is a Poor Predictor of Plant Species Richness
SO SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; HYPOTHESIS
AB For more than 30 years, the relationship between net primary productivity and species richness has generated intense debate in ecology about the processes regulating local diversity. The original view, which is still widely accepted, holds that the relationship is hump-shaped, with richness first rising and then declining with increasing productivity. Although recent meta-analyses questioned the generality of hump-shaped patterns, these syntheses have been criticized for failing to account for methodological differences among studies. We addressed such concerns by conducting standardized sampling in 48 herbaceous-dominated plant communities on five continents. We found no clear relationship between productivity and fine-scale (meters(-2)) richness within sites, within regions, or across the globe. Ecologists should focus on fresh, mechanistic approaches to understanding the multivariate links between productivity and richness.

AB In spite of overwhelming experimental evidence to the contrary, rotational grazing continues to be promoted and implemented as the only viable grazing strategy. The goals of this synthesis are to 1) reevaluate the complexity, underlying assumptions, and ecological processes of grazed ecosystems, 2) summarize plant and animal production responses to rotational and continuous grazing, 3) characterize the prevailing perceptions influencing the assessment of rotational and continuous grazing, and 4) attempt to direct the profession toward a reconciliation of perceptions advocating support for rotational grazing systems with that of the experimental evidence. The ecological relationships of grazing systems have been reasonably well resolved, at the scales investigated, and a continuation of costly grazing experiments adhering to conventional research protocols will yield little additional information. Plant production was equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 87% (20 of 23) of the experiments. Similarly, animal production per head and per area were equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 92% (35 of 38) and 84% (27 of 32) of the experiments, respectively. These experimental data demonstrate that a set of potentially effective grazing strategies exist, none of which have unique properties that set one apart from the other in terms of ecological effectiveness. The performance of rangeland grazing strategies are similarly constrained by several ecological variables establishing that differences among them are dependent on the effectiveness of management models, rather than the occurrence of unique ecological phenomena. Continued advocacy for rotational grazing as a superior strategy of grazing on rangelands is founded on perception and anecdotal interpretations, rather than an objective assessment of the vast experimental evidence. We recommend that these evidence-based conclusions be explicitly incorporated into management and policy decisions addressing this predominant land use on rangelands.

AB Dispersal is universally considered important for biodiversity conservation. However, the significance of long- as opposed to short-distance dispersal is insufficiently recognized in the conservation context. Long-distance dispersal (LDD) events, although typically rare, are crucial to population spread and to maintenance of genetic connectivity. The main threats to global biodiversity involve excessive LDD of elements alien to ecosystems and insufficient dispersal of native species, for example, because of habitat fragmentation. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap in the treatment of LDD by reviewing the conservation issues for which LDD is most important. We then demonstrate how taking LDD into consideration can improve conservation management decisions.

TI Testing predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis: a meta-analysis of
   experimental evidence for distance- and density-dependent seed and
   seedling survival

AB 1. The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that specialist natural enemies, such as herbivores and pathogens, maintain diversity in plant communities by reducing survival rates of conspecific seeds and seedlings located close to reproductive adults or in areas of high conspecific density. Variation in the strength of distance- and density-dependent effects is hypothesized to explain variation in plant species richness along climatic gradients, with effects predicted to be stronger in the tropics than the temperate zone and in wetter habitats compared to drier habitats.
   2. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify peer-reviewed experimental studies published in the 40+ years since the hypothesis was first proposed. Using data from these studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the current weight of evidence for the distance and density predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.
   3. Overall, we found significant support for both the distance- and density-dependent predictions. For all studies combined, survival rates were significantly reduced near conspecifics compared to far from conspecifics, and in areas with high densities of conspecifics compared to areas with low conspecific densities. There was no indication that these results were due to publication bias.
   4. The strength of distance and density effects varied widely among studies. Contrary to expectations, this variation was unrelated to latitude, and there was no significant effect of study region. However, we did find a trend for stronger distance and density dependence in wetter sites compared to sites with lower annual precipitation. In addition, effects were significantly stronger at the seedling stage compared to the seed stage.
   5. Synthesis. Our study provides support for the idea that distance- and density-dependent mortality occurs in plant communities world-wide. Available evidence suggests that natural enemies are frequently the cause of such patterns, consistent with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, but additional studies are needed to rule out other mechanisms (e.g. intraspecific competition). With the widespread existence of density and distance dependence clearly established, future research should focus on assessing the degree to which these effects permit species coexistence and contribute to the maintenance of diversity in plant communities.

AB Premise of the study: Just as Sanger sequencing did more than 20 years ago, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is poised to revolutionize plant systematics. By combining multiplexing approaches with NGS throughput, systematists may no longer need to choose between more taxa or more characters. Here we describe a genome skimming (shallow sequencing) approach for plant systematics.
   Methods: Through simulations, we evaluated optimal sequencing depth and performance of single-end and paired-end short read sequences for assembly of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and plastomes and addressed the effect of divergence on reference-guided plastome assembly. We also used simulations to identify potential phylogenetic markers from low-copy nuclear loci at different sequencing depths. We demonstrated the utility of genome skimming through phylogenetic analysis of the Sonoran Desert clade (SDC) of Asclepias (Apocynaceae).
   Key results: Paired-end reads performed better than single-end reads. Minimum sequencing depths for high quality rDNA and plastome assemblies were 40x and 30x, respectively. Divergence from the reference significantly affected plastome assembly, but relatively similar references are available for most seed plants. Deeper rDNA sequencing is necessary to characterize intragenomic polymorphism. The low-copy fraction of the nuclear genome was readily surveyed, even at low sequencing depths. Nearly 160000 bp of sequence from three organelles provided evidence of phylogenetic incongruence in the SDC.
   Conclusions: Adoption of NGS will facilitate progress in plant systematics, as whole plastome and rDNA cistrons, partial mitochondrial genomes, and low-copy nuclear markers can now be efficiently obtained for molecular phylogenetics studies.

AB Over half of the world's human population lives in cities, and for many, urban greenspaces are the only places where they encounter biodiversity. This is of particular concern because there is growing evidence that human well-being is enhanced by exposure to nature. However, the specific qualities of greenspaces that offer the greatest benefits remain poorly understood. One possibility is that humans respond positively to increased levels of biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate the lack of a consistent relationship between actual plant, butterfly, and bird species richness and the psychological well-being of urban greenspace visitors. instead, well-being shows a positive relationship with the richness that the greenspace users perceived to be present. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy, which we investigate, is that people generally have poor biodiversity-identification skills. The apparent importance of perceived species richness and the mismatch between reality and perception pose a serious challenge for aligning conservation and human well-being agendas.

AB Broad-scale studies of climate change effects on freshwater species have focused mainly on temperature, ignoring critical drivers such as flow regime and biotic interactions. We use downscaled outputs from general circulation models coupled with a hydrologic model to forecast the effects of altered flows and increased temperatures on four interacting species of trout across the interior western United States (1.01 million km(2)), based on empirical statistical models built from fish surveys at 9,890 sites. Projections under the 2080s A1B emissions scenario forecast a mean 47% decline in total suitable habitat for all trout, a group of fishes of major socioeconomic and ecological significance. We project that native cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii, already excluded from much of its potential range by nonnative species, will lose a further 58% of habitat due to an increase in temperatures beyond the species' physiological optima and continued negative biotic interactions. Habitat for nonnative brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout Salmo trutta is predicted to decline by 77% and 48%, respectively, driven by increases in temperature and winter flood frequency caused by warmer, rainier winters. Habitat for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, is projected to decline the least (35%) because negative temperature effects are partly offset by flow regime shifts that benefit the species. These results illustrate how drivers other than temperature influence species response to climate change. Despite some uncertainty, large declines in trout habitat are likely, but our findings point to opportunities for strategic targeting of mitigation efforts to appropriate stressors and locations.

AB The intensity, duration and frequency of coastal hypoxia (oxygen concentration < 63 mu M) are increasing due to human alteration of coastal ecosystems and changes in oceanographic conditions due to global warming. Here we provide a concise review of the consequences of coastal hypoxia for sediment biogeochemistry. Changes in bottom-water oxygen levels have consequences for early diagenetic pathways (more anaerobic at expense of aerobic pathways), the efficiency of re-oxidation of reduced metabolites and the nature, direction and magnitude of sediment-water exchange fluxes. Hypoxia may also lead to more organic matter accumulation and burial and the organic matter eventually buried is also of higher quality, i.e. less degraded. Bottom-water oxygen levels also affect the organisms involved in organic matter processing with the contribution of metazoans decreasing as oxygen levels drop. Hypoxia has a significant effect on benthic animals with the consequences that ecosystem functions related to macrofauna such as bio-irrigation and bioturbation are significantly affected by hypoxia as well. Since many microbes and microbial-mediated biogeochemical processes depend on animal-induced transport processes (e.g. re-oxidation of particulate reduced sulphur and denitrification), there are indirect hypoxia effects on biogeochemistry via the benthos. Severe long-lasting hypoxia and anoxia may result in the accumulation of reduced compounds in sediments and elimination of macrobenthic communities with the consequences that biogeochemical properties during trajectories of decreasing and increasing oxygen may be different (hysteresis) with consequences for coastal ecosystem dynamics.

AB The construction of evolutionary trees is now a standard part of exploratory sequence analysis. Bayesian methods for estimating trees have recently been proposed as a faster method of incorporating the power of complex statistical models into the process. Researchers who rely on comparative analyses need to understand the theoretical and practical motivations that underlie these new techniques, and how they differ from previous methods. The ability of the new approaches to address previously intractable questions is making phylogenetic analysis an essential tool in an increasing number of areas of genetic research.

AB The concept of habitat fragmentation has become an important theme in conservation research, and it is often used as if fragmentation were a unitary phenomenon. However, the concept is ambiguous, and empirical studies demonstrate a wide variety of direct and indirect effects, sometimes with mutually opposing implications. The effects of fragmentation vary across organisms, habitat types, and geographic regions. Such a contrast between a schematic concept and multifaceted empirical reality is counterproductive. I analyzed the stabilization of the schematic view of fragmentation by the early 1980s, using a genealogical narrative as a methodological approach. The main assumptions behind the schematic view were: (1) fragments are comparable to oceanic islands; (2) habitats surrounding fragments are hostile to a majority of the organisms; and (3) natural pre-fragmentation conditions were uniform. The stabilization loop of this view was supported by the reduction of empirical research to species-area curve fitting, which always produced expected results. I present a model of the dynamics of fragmentation research that shows the schematic, island-biogeographic view as an "intellectual attractor." Since the 1980s, the theoretical presuppositions of the schematic view have been challenged, and empirical research has become multifaceted. Fragments of a particular habitat type are viewed as elements in a heterogeneous landscape rather than "islands" surrounded by a hostile "sea." However, the island metaphor is still used in conservation contexts in the shape of species-area curves. It is backed by a presupposition that human-influenced environments are essentially different from so-called "natural" environments, but this is unfounded. My suggestion is that our perspective should be broadened still further so that habitat fragmentation is viewed as a particular form of human-induced environmental degradation; I discuss both theoretical and practical implications of this suggestion.

AB Life history theory predicts that parents should value their own survival over that of their offspring in species with a higher probability of adult survival and fewer offspring. We report that Southern Hemisphere birds have higher adult survival and smaller clutch sizes than Northern Hemisphere birds. We subsequently manipulated predation risk to adults versus offspring in 10 species that were paired between North and South America on the basis of phylogeny and ecology. As predicted, southern parents responded more strongly to reduce mortality risk to themselves oven at a cost to their offspring, whereas northern parents responded more strongly to reduce risk to their offspring even at greater risk to themselves.

AB Some individuals (helpers) in cooperatively breeding species provide alloparental care and often suppress their own reproduction. Kin selection is clearly an important explanation for such behaviour, but a possible alternative is group augmentation where individuals survive or reproduce better in large groups and where it therefore pays to recruit new members to the group. The evolutionary stability of group augmentation is currently disputed. We model evolutionarily stable helping strategies by following the dynamics of social groups with varying degrees of subordinate help. We also distinguish between passive augmentation, where a group member benefits from the mere presence of others, and active augmentation, where their presence as such is neutral or harmful, but where helping to recruit new group members may still be beneficial if they in turn actively provide help for the current reproductives ('delayed reciprocity'). The results show that group augmentation (either passive or active) can be evolutionarily stable and explain costly helping by non-reproductive subordinates, either alone or leading to elevated help levels when acting in concert with kin selection. Group augmentation can thus potentially explain the weak relationships between relatedness and helping behaviour that are observed in some cooperatively breeding species. In some cases, the superior mutualistic performance of cooperatively behaving groups can generate an incentive to stay and help which is strong enough to make ecological constraints unnecessary for explaining the stability of cooperatively breeding groups.

ID SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; FRACTAL LANDSCAPES; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; ECOLOGY;
   COEXISTENCE; HABITAT; MODELS
AB Landscape connectivity refers to the functional relationship among habitat patches, owing to the spatial contagion of habitat and the movement responses of organisms to landscape structure. Heterogeneous landscapes provide a particular challenge for modelling population-level responses to habitat fragmentation, because individuals may be utilizing multiple habitats to varying degrees across the landscape. We apply neutral landscape models to understand how species' habitat affinities interacted with landscape structure (i.e., habitat abundance, distribution, and quality as measured by carrying capacity) to affect the redistribution of individuals. Two types of neutral models are presented: random maps, in which the distribution of habitat is spatially independent and fractal maps, in which habitat exhibits an intermediate level of spatial dependence. The neutral landscapes comprised varying proportions of three habitat types, for which species exhibited a preference gradient (high, medium, low). We performed a series of simulation experiments as a factorial design of parameter states to tease apart the underlying factors responsible for population distributional patterns (random vs clumped) in spatially complex mosaics.
   Landscape connectivity is a threshold phenomenon, in which even a minimal loss of habitat near the critical threshold (p(c)) is likely to disconnect the landscape, and which may have consequences for population distributions. The exact value of p(c) depends upon the spatial arrangement of habitat; fractal landscapes exhibited connectivity across a greater range of habitat abundance (p) than random maps (fractal p(c) = 0.29-0.50, random p(c) = 0.59). Although the spatial arrangement of habitat (random vs fractal) was the most important determinant of population distributional patterns, different landscape factors were important in structuring populations in the two types of maps. The relative abundance of habitat had the greatest effect on populations in random landscapes, whereas scale-dependent patterns were evident in fractal landscapes. At fine scales, population dispersion was determined by habitat abundance in both random and fractal maps, although populations were more aggregated (as measured by Morisita's Index, I-m) at this scale in random landscapes. But at coarse scales on fractal maps, population distribution was primarily influenced by species' habitat affinities. Assessment of the independent effects of habitat affinity and habitat carrying capacity on population distributions revealed that the differential interaction of species with landscape structure (i.e., different residence probabilities in each habitat type) was the primary determinant of distributional patterns. Neutral landscape models thus provide a useful tool for determining the relative importance of various components of landscape structure that affect population distributions.

AB Interactions between the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, and native ant species were studied in a 450-ha biological reserve in northern California. Along the edges of the invasion, the presence of Argentine ants significantly reduced the foraging success of native ant species, and vice versa. Argentine ants were consistently better than native ants at exploiting food sources: Argentine ants found and recruited to bait more consistently and in higher numbers than native ant species, and they foraged for longer periods throughout the day. Native ants and Argentine ants frequently fought when they recruited to the same bait, and native ant species were displaced from bait during 60% of these en counters. In introduction experiments, Argentine ants interfered with the foraging of native ant species, and prevented the establishment of new colonies of native ant species by preying upon winged native ant queens. The Argentine ants' range within the preserve expanded by 12 ha between May 1993 and May 1994, and 13 between September 1993 and September 1994, with a corresponding reduction of the range of native ant species. Although some native ants persist locally at the edges of the invasion of Argentine ants, most eventually disappear from invaded areas. Both interference and exploitation competition appear to be important in the displacement of native ant species from areas invaded by Argentine ants.

AB Plant invasions ave a serious threat to natural and managed ecosystems worldwide. The number of species involved and tbe extent of existing invasions renders the problem virtually intractable, and it is likely to worsen as mol-e species are introduced to new habitats and more existing invaders move into a phase of rapid spread We contend that current research and management approaches are inadequate to tackle the problem. The current focus is mostly on the characteristics and control of individual invading species. Much can be gained however, by considering other important components of the invasion problem. Patterns of weed spread indicate that many species have a long lag phase following introduction before they spread explosively. Early detection and treatment of invasions before explosive spread occurs will prevent many future problems. Similarly a focus on the invaded ecosystem and its management, rather than on the invader is likely to be more effective identification of the causal factors enhancing ecosystem invasibility should lend to more-effective integrated control programs. An assessment of the value of particular sites and their degree of disturbance would allow the setting of management priorities for protection and control. Socioeconomic factors frequently play a large part than ecological factors in plant invasions. Changes in human activities in terms of plant introduction and use, land use, and timing of control measures are all required before the plant invasion problem can be tackled adequately Dealing with plant invasions is nn urgent; task that will require difficult decisions about land use and management priorities. These decisions have to be made if we want to conserve biodiversity worldwide.

AB We extend methods of quantitative genetics to studies of the evolution of reaction norms defined over continuous environments. Our models consider both spatial variation (hard and soft selection) and temporal variation (within a generation and between generations). These different forms of environmental variation can produce different evolutionary trajectories even when they favor the same optimal reaction norm. When genetic constraints limit the types of evolutionary changes available to a reaction norm, different forms of environmental variation can also produce different evolutionary equilibria. The methods and models presented here provide a framework in which empiricists may determine whether a reaction norm is optimal and, if it is not, to evaluate hypotheses for why it is not.

AB The net primary production of the biosphere is consumed largely by microorganisms, whose metabolism creates the trophic base for detrital foodwebs, drives element cycles, and mediates atmospheric composition. Biogeochemical constraints on microbial catabolism, relative to primary production, create reserves of detrital organic carbon in soils and sediments that exceed the carbon content of the atmosphere and biomass. The production of organic matter is an intracellular process that generates thousands of compounds from a small number of precursors drawn from intermediary metabolism. Osmotrophs generate growth substrates from the products of biosynthesis and diagenesis by enzyme-catalyzed reactions that occur largely outside cells. These enzymes, which we define as ecoenzymes, enter the environment by secretion and lysis. Enzyme expression is regulated by environmental signals, but once released from the cell, ecoenzymatic activity is determined by environmental interactions, represented as a kinetic cascade, that lead to multiphasic kinetics and large spatiotemporal variation. At the ecosystem level, these interactions can be viewed as an energy landscape that directs the availability and flow of resources. Ecoenzymatic activity and microbial metabolism are integrated on the basis of resource demand relative to environmental availability. Macroecological studies show that the most widely measured ecoenzymatic activities have a similar stoichiometry for all microbial communities. Ecoenzymatic stoichiometry connects the elemental stoichiometry of microbial biomass and detrital organic matter to microbial nutrient assimilation and growth. We present a model that combines the kinetics of enzyme activity and community growth under conditions of multiple resource limitation with elements of metabolic and ecological stoichiometry theory. This biogeochemical equilibrium model provides a framework for comparative studies of microbial community metabolism, the principal driver of biogeochemical cycles.

AB Although sexual interactions between species (reproductive interference) have been reported from a wide range of animal taxa, their potential for determining species coexistence is often disregarded. Here, we review evidence from laboratory and field studies illustrating that heterospecific sexual interactions are frequently associated with fitness loss and can have severe ecological and evolutionary consequences. We define reproductive interference as any kind of interspecific interaction during the process of mate acquisition that adversely affects the fitness of at least one of the species involved and that is caused by incomplete species recognition. We distinguish seven types of reproductive interference: signal jamming, heterospecific rivalry, misdirected courtship, heterospecific mating attempts, erroneous female choice, heterospecific mating, and hybridization. We then discuss the sex-specific costs of these types and highlight two typical features of reproductive interference: density-dependence and asymmetry. Similar to competition, reproductive interference can lead to displacement of one species (sexual exclusion), spatial, temporal, or habitat segregation, changes in life history parameters, and reproductive character displacement. In many cases, patterns of coexistence might be shaped by reproductive interference rather than by resource competition, as the presence of a few heterospecifics might substantially decrease reproductive success. Therefore, interspecific sexual interactions should receive more attention in ecological research. Reproductive interference has mainly been discussed in the context of invasive species or hybrid zones, whereas its influence on naturally-occurring sympatric species pairs has rarely been addressed. To improve our knowledge of the ecological significance of reproductive interference, findings from laboratory experiments should be validated in the field. Future studies should also focus on ecological mechanisms, such as temporal, spatial, or habitat partitioning, that might enable sexually interacting species to coexist. Reproductive interference also has implications for the management of endangered species, which can be threatened by sexual interactions with invasive or common species. Studies of reproductive interference might even provide new insights for biological pest control.

AB Predictive species distribution modelling (SDM) has become an essential tool in biodiversity conservation and management. The choice of grain size (resolution) of environmental layers used in modelling is one important factor that may affect predictions. We applied 10 distinct modelling techniques to presence-only data for 50 species in five different regions, to test whether: (1) a 10-fold coarsening of resolution affects predictive performance of SDMs, and (2) any observed effects are dependent on the type of region, modelling technique, or species considered. Results show that a 10 times change in grain size does not severely affect predictions from species distribution models. The overall trend is towards degradation of model performance, but improvement can also be observed. Changing grain size does not equally affect models across regions, techniques, and species types. The strongest effect is on regions and species types, with tree species in the data sets (regions) with highest locational accuracy being most affected. Changing grain size had little influence on the ranking of techniques: boosted regression trees remain best at both resolutions. The number of occurrences used for model training had an important effect, with larger sample sizes resulting in better models, which tended to be more sensitive to grain. Effect of grain change was only noticeable for models reaching sufficient performance and/or with initial data that have an intrinsic error smaller than the coarser grain size.

AB The design and objective of a community study imply the selection of the appropriate ordination technique in terms of species response models and weighting options. In this paper, we start from the observation that existing two-table ordination techniques and related measures of niche breadth inevitably weight a sample in proportion to its abundance. We introduce a new multivariate method, which gives a more even weight to all sampling units, including those which are species poor or individual poor. We use this new method of analysis which we call OMI (for Outlying Mean Index) to address the question of niche separation and niche breadth. The Outlying Mean Index, or species marginality, measures the distance between the mean habitat conditions used by species (species centroid), and the mean habitat conditions of the sampling area (origin of the niche hyperspace), and OMI analysis places species along habitat conditions using a maximization of their mean OMI. Therefore, the position of the species depends on their niche deviation from a reference, which represents neither the mean nor the most abundant species, but a theoretical ubiquitous species that tolerates the most general habitat conditions (i.e., a hypothetical species uniformly distributed among habitat conditions). We demonstrate that OMI analysis is well suited for the investigation of multidimensional niche breadths in the case of strong limiting factors (e.g., meteorological conditions) or strong driving fortes (e.g., longitudinal stream gradient). Furthermore, the analysis helps in finding which ecological factors are most important for community structure and organization and provides a separation of species based on their niche characteristics.

AB Phylogenetic relationships of mushrooms and their relatives within the order Agaricales were addressed by using nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences. Approximately 900 bases of the 5' end of the nucleus-encoded large subunit RNA gene were sequenced for 154 selected taxa representing most families within the Agaricales. Several phylogenetic methods were used, including weighted and equally weighted parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and distance methods (NJ). The starting tree for branch swapping in the ML analyses was the tree with the highest ML score among previously produced MP and Nj trees. A high degree of consensus was observed between phylogenetic estimates obtained through MP and ML. NJ trees differed according to the distance model that was used: however. all Nj trees still supported most of the same terminal groupings as the Mr anal ML trees did. NJ trees were always significantly suboptimal when evaluated against the best MP and ML trees. by both parsimony and likelihood tests. Our analyses suggest that weighted MP and ML provide the best estimates of Agaricales phylogeny. Similar support was observed between bootstrapping and jackknifing methods for evaluation of tree robustness. Phylogenetic analyses revealed many groups of agaricoid fungi that are supported by moderate to high bootstrap or jackknife values or are consistent with morphology-based classification schemes. Analyses also support separate placement of the boletes and russules, which are basal to the main core group of gilled mushrooms (the Agaricineae of Singer). Examples of monophyletic groups include the families Amanitaceae. Coprinaceae (excluding Coprinus cumatus and subfamily Panaeolideae), Agaricaceae (excluding the Cystodermateae), and Strophariaceae pm parte (Stropharia, Pholiota. and Hypholoma); the mycorrhizal species of Tricholoma (including Leucopaxillus, also mycorrhizal); Mycena and Resinomycena; Termitomyces. Podabrella, and Lyophyllum: and Pleurotus with Hohenbuehelia. Several groups revealed by these data to be nonmonophyletic include the families Tricholomataceae, Cortinariaceae, and Hygrophoraceae and the genera Clitocybe, Omphalina, and Marasmius. This study provides a framework for future systematics studies in the Agaricales and suggestions for analyzing large molecular data sets.

AB Several epidemiological models predict a positive relationship between host population density and abundance of directly transmitted macroparasites. Here, we generalize these, and test the prediction by a comparative study. We used data on communities of gastrointestinal strongylid nematodes from 19 mammalian species, representing examination of 6670 individual hosts. We studied both the average abundance of all strongylid nematodes within a host species, and the two components of abundance, prevalence and intensity. The effects of host body weight, diet, fecundity and age at maturity and parasite body size were controlled for directly, and the phylogenetically independent contrast method was used to control for confounding factors more generally. Host population density and average parasite abundance were strongly positively correlated within mammalian taxa, and across all species when the effects of host body weight were controlled for. Controlling for other variables did not change this. Even when looking at single parasite species occurring in several host species, abundance was highest in the host species with the highest population density. Prevalence and intensity showed similar patterns. These patterns provide the first macroecological evidence consistent with the prediction that transmission rates depend on host population density in natural parasite communities.

AB From a database containing the published nuclear hormone receptor (NR) sequences I constructed an alignment of the C, D and E domains of these molecules. Using this alignment, I have performed tree reconstruction using both distance matrix and parsimony analysis. The robustness of each branch was estimated using bootstrap resampling methods. The trees constructed by these two methods gave congruent topologies. From these analyses I defined six NR subfamilies: (i) a large one clustering thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and ecdysone receptors (EcRs) as well as numerous orphan receptors such as RORs or Rev-erbs; (ii) one containing retinoid X receptors (RXRs) together with COUP, HNF4, tailless, TR2 and TR4 orphan receptors; (iii) one containing steroid receptors; (iv) one containing the NGFIB orphan receptors; (v) one containing FTZ-F1 orphan receptors; and finally (vi) one containing to date only one gene, the GCNF1 orphan receptor. The relationships between the six subfamilies are not known except for subfamilies I and IV which appear to be related. Interestingly, most of the liganded receptors appear to be derived when compared with orphan receptors. This suggests that the ligand-binding ability of NRs has been gained by orphan receptors during the course of evolution to give rise to the presently known receptors. The distribution into six subfamilies correlates with the known abilities of the various NRs to bind to DNA as home-or heterodimers. For example, receptors heterodimerizing efficiently with RXR belong to the first or the fourth subfamilies. I suggest that the ability to heterodimerize evolved once, just before the separation of subfamilies I and IV and that the first NR was able to bind to DNA as a homodimer. From the study of NR sequences existing in vertebrates, arthropods and nematodes, I define two major steps of NR diversification: one that took place very early, probably during the multicellularization event leading to all the metazoan phyla, and a second occurring later on, corresponding to the advent of vertebrates. Finally, I show that in vertebrate species the various groups of NRs accumulated mutations at very different rates.

AB A widely accepted paradigm for speciation in tropical forests, the refuge theory, requires periodic habitat fragmentation driven by global climatic fluctuations to provide conditions for allopatric speciation. This implies that comparative species richness in refugia is due to loss of diverse communities in areas affected by climatic cycles. In this study we compare distribution patterns of bird and plant taxa which we consider to be of either deep phylogenetic lineages or recent radiations, It is demonstrated that lowland areas which have been postulated as Pleistocene refugia are dominated by species which represent lineages of pre-Pleistocene age. Since variations in species richness within these forest tracts reflect currently apparent environmental variables which might be considered to determine carrying capacity, we do not need to postulate that richness is the result of changes in forest cover in the past. Recently diversified taxa of plants and birds are found mainly at the periphery of the main rain forest blocks and in habitat islands outside them. Here, peak concentrations of young restricted-range species are often congruent with clusters of old and biogeographically relictual species. It is suggested that this reflects special intrinsic environmental properties of these areas, in the form of long-term environmental stability caused mainly by persistent orographic rain or mist. In this case, richness is not necessarily due to extinction outside these areas. Stability not only enables survival of relictual taxa, but also promotes morphological differentiation of radiating taxa, leading to aggregates of taxa of restricted distribution.

AB Intertidal seaweeds are periodically exposed to air where they experience a variety of potentially stressful environmental conditions, including nutrient limitation, high Eight, high and low temperature, desiccation, and osmotic stress. This paper considers the current understanding of stress tolerance in intertidal seaweeds and discusses ways in. which future research could increase our understanding of the role of environmental factors in the ecology and physiology of these algae. We believe research is required in at least three areas. 1) Laboratory physiological studies have established that correlations exist between stress tolerance and the vertical distribution of species. However, little information is available on the importance of stress in determining community structure in nature. Field experiments are essential to rebate the impact of single or multiple stresses on the survival, growth, and reproductive output of macroalgae. In particular, it is necessary to clarify, the role of sublethal stress in determining the outcome of competitive interactions. 2) With the exception of obvious lethal effects or damage associated with extreme environmental conditions, such as unusually hot and dry weather, it is difficult to evaluate the occurrence and severity of stress in natural populations of seaweeds. There is a need to develop molecular and biochemical markers specific for individual stresses or groups of stresses to allow the unambiguous and direct determination of stress in situ. 3) Despite the apparent importance of stress in intertidal seaweeds, we are largely ignorant of the mechanistic basis of tolerance. The application of currently available tools of molecular and cell biology to the investigation of stress-induced transcriptional and translational changes could enormously increase our understanding of both the sites of, and pathways involved in, stress tolerance. In summary, there are numerous unanswered fundamental questions about the stress tolerance of intertidal seaweeds, providing opportunities for research ranging from field ecology to molecular biology and biochemistry.

AB During the last decade there has been a rapidly growing interest in the study of phenotypic plasticity in animals. Confused terminology in this field of research may be one reason why the focus of many studies is not as clear as it could be. The field of plasticity highlights the general problem of demonstrating adaptation. We discuss the terminology and methodology of plasticity studies, with particular reference to the question of which patterns should be considered evidence for plasticity as an adaptation to the environment, and how to find such evidence. We suggest a terminology where plasticity can be "adaptive" (i.e. beneficial, and maintained by selection) with respect to a function without strictly being an adaptation for it (evolutionary origin linked to this function), and vice versa. Modifications of the original reaction norm, seen today as differences in plasticity between populations and species, can be adaptations for a function even when the plasticity itself is not (it may follow from constraints or from selection for another function). We selectively review cases reported as evidence of adaptive plasticity in animal morphology and life history, choosing examples from a wide range of taxa to illustrate our criteria for what should be called "adaptive" and "adaptation" when applied to plasticity.

AB Laboratory columns (80 cm long, 10 cm diameter) of peat were constructed from samples collected from a subarctic fen, a temperate bog and a temperate swamp. Temperature and water table position were manipulated to establish their influence on emissions of CO2 and CH4 from the columns. A factorial design experiment revealed significant (P < 0.05) differences in emission of these gases related to peat type, temperature and water table position, as well as an interaction between temperature and water table. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 at 23-degrees-C were an average of 2.4 and 6.6 times larger, respectively, than those at 10-degrees-C. Compared to emissions when the columns were saturated, water table at a depth of 40 cm increased CO2 fluxes by an average of 4.3 times and decreased CH4 emissions by an average of 5.0 times. There were significant temporal variations in gas emissions during the 6-week experiment, presumably related to variations in microbial populations and substrate availability. Using columns with static water table depths of 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 cm, CO2 emissions showed a positive, linear relation with depth, whereas CH4 emissions revealed a negative, logarithmic relation with depth. Lowering and then raising the water table from the peat surface to a depth of 50 cm revealed weak evidence of hysteresis in CO2 emissions between the falling and rising water table limbs. Hysteresis (falling > rising limb) was very pronounced for CH4 emissions, attributed to a release of CH4 stored in pore-water and a lag in the development of anaerobic conditions and methanogenesis on the rising limb. Decreases in atmospheric pressure were correlated with abnormally large emissions of CO2 and CH4 on the falling limb. Peat slurries incubated in flasks revealed few differences between the three peat types in the rates of CO2 production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. There were, however, major differences between peat types in the rates of CH4 consumption under aerobic incubation conditions and CH4 production under anaerobic conditions (bog > fen > swamp), which explain the differences in response of the peat types in the column experiment.

AB Color patterns of natural populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) are a compromise between sexual selection and predation avoidance.  Field data on ambient light spectra, water transmission spectra, courtship and attack distances, and cone pigments of guppies and their predators were used to calculate measures of conspicuousness of guppies under various combinations of visual conditions and vision.  The results suggest that color patterns are relatively more conspicuous to guppies at the times and places of courtship and relatively less conspicuous at the times and places of maximum predator risk.  Some implications to the evolution of vision, visual communication and behavior are discussed.

AB A growing body of empirical evidence is revealing the value of nature experience for mental health. With rapid urbanization and declines in human contact with nature globally, crucial decisions must be made about how to preserve and enhance opportunities for nature experience. Here, we first provide points of consensus across the natural, social, and health sciences on the impacts of nature experience on cognitive functioning, emotional well-being, and other dimensions of mental health. We then show how ecosystem service assessments can be expanded to include mental health, and provide a heuristic, conceptual model for doing so.

AB Vocalizations of anuran amphibians have received much attention in studies of behavioral ecology and physiology, but also provide informative characters for identifying and delimiting species. We here review the terminology and variation of frog calls from a perspective of integrative taxonomy, and provide hands-on protocols for recording, analyzing, comparing, interpreting and describing these sounds. Our focus is on advertisement calls, which serve as premating isolation mechanisms and, therefore, convey important taxonomic information. We provide recommendations for terminology of frog vocalizations, with call, note and pulse being the fundamental subunits to be used in descriptions and comparisons. However, due to the complexity and diversity of these signals, an unequivocal application of the terms call and note can be challenging. We therefore provide two coherent concepts that either follow a note-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units of sound as notes, and their entirety as call) or a call-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units as call whenever they are separated by long silent intervals) in terminology. Based on surveys of literature, we show that numerous call traits can be highly variable within and between individuals of one species. Despite idiosyncrasies of species and higher taxa, the duration of calls or notes, pulse rate within notes, and number of pulses per note appear to be more static within individuals and somewhat less affected by temperature. Therefore, these variables might often be preferable as taxonomic characters over call rate or note rate, which are heavily influenced by various factors. Dominant frequency is also comparatively static and only weakly affected by temperature, but depends strongly on body size. As with other taxonomic characters, strong call divergence is typically indicative of species-level differences, whereas call similarities of two populations are no evidence for them being conspecific. Taxonomic conclusions can especially be drawn when the general advertisement call structure of two candidate species is radically different and qualitative call differences are thus observed. On the other hand, quantitative differences in call traits might substantially vary within and among conspecific populations, and require careful evaluation and analysis. We provide guidelines for the taxonomic interpretation of advertisement call differences in sympatric and allopatric situations, and emphasize the need for an integrative use of multiple datasets (bio-acoustics, morphology, genetics), particularly for allopatric scenarios. We show that small-sized frogs often emit calls with frequency components in the ultrasound spectrum, although it is unlikely that these high frequencies are of biological relevance for the majority of them, and we illustrate that detection of upper harmonics depends also on recording distance because higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly. Bioacoustics remains a prime approach in integrative taxonomy of anurans if uncertainty due to possible intraspecific variation and technical artifacts is adequately considered and acknowledged.

AB A good understanding of the mechanisms and magnitude of the impact of invasive alien species on ecosystem services and biodiversity is a prerequisite for the efficient prioritisation of actions to prevent new invasions or for developing mitigation measures. In this review, we identified alien marine species that have a high impact on ecosystem services and biodiversity in European seas, classified the mechanisms of impact, commented on the methods applied for assessing the impact and the related inferential strength, and reported on gaps in available information. Furthermore, we have proposed an updated inventory of 87 marine species in Europe, representing 13 phyla, which have a documented high impact on ecosystem services or biodiversity.
   Food provision was the ecosystem service that was impacted by the greatest number of alien species (in terms of both positive and negative impacts). Following food provision, the ecosystem services that were negatively affected by the highest number of alien species were ocean nourishment, recreation and tourism, and lifecycle maintenance, while the ecosystem services that were most often positively impacted were cognitive benefits, water purification, and climate regulation. In many cases, marine aliens were found to impact keystone/protected species and habitats. Thirty percent of the assessed species had an impact on entire ecosystem processes or wider ecosystem functioning, more often in a negative fashion. Forty-nine of the assessed species were reported as being ecosystem engineers, which fundamentally modify, create, or define habitats by altering their physical or chemical properties.
   The positive impacts of alien species are probably underestimated, as there is often a perception bias against alien species. Among the species herein assessed as high-impact species, 17 had only negative and 7 only positive impacts; for the majority (63 species), both negative and positive impacts were reported; the overall balance was often unknown. Although there is no doubt that invasive species have modified marine ecosystems, evidence for most of the reported impacts is weak, as it is based on expert judgement or dubious correlations, while only 13% of the reported impacts were inferred via manipulative or natural experiments. A need for stronger inference is evident, to improve our knowledge base of marine biological invasions and better inform environmental managers.

AB Biochar production and application from crop straw had been proposed as one effective countermeasure to mitigate climate change. We conducted a 2-year consecutive field experiment in 2009 and 2010 in rice paddy to gain insight into the consistency over years of biochar effects on rice production and greenhouse gases emissions. Biochar was amended in 2009 before rice transplanting at rates of 0, 10, 20 and 40 t ha(-1) soil emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were monitored with closed chamber method at 7 days interval throughout the whole rice growing season (WRGS) both in 2009 and 2010. The results showed that biochar amendment increased rice productivity, soil pH, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen but decreased soil bulk density in both cycles of rice growth. Soil respiration observed no significant difference between biochar amendment and the corresponding control both in the first and second cycle, respectively. However, biochar amendment decreased nitrous oxide emission but increased methane emission in both cycles. No significant difference in carbon intensity of rice production (GHGI) and global warming potential (GWP) were observed between the biochar amendment at the rate of 10 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha(-1) and control though the GWP and GHGI was increased by 39% and 26% at the rate of 20 t ha(-1) respectively, in the first cycle. However, in the second cycle, both of overall GWP and GHGI were observed significantly decreased under biochar amendment as compared to control, ranging from 7.1% to 18.7% and from 12.4% to 34.8%, respectively. The biochar effect intensity on global warming potential were observed from -2.5% to 39.2% in the first cycle, and from -18.7% to -7.1% in the second cycle. However, the biochar effect intensity on C intensity of rice production was observed from -10.2% to 25.8% in the first cycle, and from -36.9% to -18.6% in the second cycle. Therefore, biochar effect on reducing the overall C intensity of rice production could become stronger in the subsequent cycles than that in the first cycle though a consistently strong effect on reducing N2O emission in a single crop cycle after biochar amendment. Nevertheless, these effects were not found in proportional to biochar amendment rates and a high rice yield but lowest C intensity was achieved under biochar amendment at 10 t ha(-1) in both cycles of the rice paddy in the present study.

AB P>1. Trait-based approaches applied to community ecology have led to a considerable advance in understanding the effect of environmental filters on species assembly. Although plant traits are known to vary both between and within species, little is known about the role of intraspecific trait variability in the non-random assembly mechanisms controlling the coexistence of species, including habitat filtering and niche differentiation.
   2. We investigate the role of intraspecific variability in three key functional traits - specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and height - in structuring grassland communities distributed along a flooding gradient. We quantified the contribution of intraspecific variability relative to interspecific differences in the trait-gradient relationship, and we used a null model approach to detect patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation, with and without intraspecific variability.
   3. Community mean SLA and height varied significantly along the flooding gradient and intraspecific variability accounted for 44% and 32%, respectively, of these trait-gradient relationships. LDMC did not vary along the gradient, with and without accounting for intraspecific variability. Our null model approach revealed significant patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation for SLA and height, but not for LDMC. More strikingly, considering intraspecific trait variability greatly increased the detection of habitat filtering and was necessary to detect niche differentiation processes.
   4. Synthesis. Our study provides evidence for a strong role of intraspecific trait variability in community assembly. Our findings suggest that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by enabling species to pass through both abiotic and biotic filters. We argue that community ecology would benefit from more attention to intraspecific variability.

AB Graph theory is a body of mathematics dealing with problems of connectivity, flow, and routing in networks ranging from social groups to computer networks. Recently, network applications have erupted in many fields, and graph models are now being applied in landscape ecology and conservation biology, particularly for applications couched in metapopulation theory. In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general. Here we review recent applications of network theory to habitat patches in landscape mosaics. We consider (1) the conceptual model underlying these applications; (2) formalization and implementation of the graph model; (3) model parameterization; (4) model testing, insights, and predictions available through graph analyses; and (5) potential implications for conservation biology and related applications. In general, and for a variety of ecological systems, we find the graph model a remarkably robust framework for applications concerned with habitat connectivity. We close with suggestions for further work on the parameterization and validation of graph models, and point to some promising analytic insights.

AB Net ecosystem production is the residual of two much larger fluxes: photosynthesis and respiration. While photosynthesis is a single process with a well-established theoretical underpinning, respiration integrates the variety of plant and microbial processes by which CO2 returns from ecosystems to the atmosphere. Limits to current capacity for predicting ecosystem respiration fluxes across biomes or years result from the mismatch between what is usually measured - bulk CO2 fluxes - and what process-based models can predict - fluxes of CO2 from plant (autotrophic) or microbial (heterotrophic) respiration. Papers in this Thematic Issue and in the recent literature, document advances in methods for separating respiration into autotrophic and heterotrophic components using three approaches: (1) continuous measurements of CO2 fluxes and assimilation of these data into process-based models; (2) application of isotope measurements, particularly radiocarbon; and (3) manipulation experiments. They highlight the role of allocation of C fixed by plants to respiration, storage, growth or transfer to other organisms as a control of seasonal and interannual variability in soil respiration and the oxidation state of C in the terrestrial biosphere. A second theme is the potential for comparing C isotope signatures in organic matter, CO2 evolved in incubations and microbial biomarkers to elucidate the pathways (respiration, recycling, or transformation) of C during decomposition. Together, these factors determine the continuum of timescales over which C is returned to the atmosphere by respiration and enable testing of theories of plant and microbial respiration that go beyond empirical models and allow predictions of future respiration responses to future change in climate, pollution and land use.

   PATTERNS
AB 1. Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory.
   2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term 'interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field.
   3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits.
   4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity.
   5. Finally, the prime focus on predator-prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non-trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.

AB Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of species diversity within ecological communities of sessile organisms include niche differentiation mediated by competitive trade-offs, frequency dependence resulting from species-specific pests, recruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a speciation-extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated by stochasticity (drift). While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community-level patterns. We used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species-area curve. Our model communities had an order-of-magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to infer the large-scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across communities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species-area curves follow a power law with short-range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative-abundance distributions are more even for systems with competitive differences and trade-offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when frequency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed surprisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of community-level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, parameterization of models such as these from field data on the strengths of the different mechanisms could yield insight into their relative roles in diversity maintenance in any given community.

AB Responses of zooplankton, pelagic primary producers, planktonic bacteria, and CO2 exchange with the atmosphere were measured in four lakes with contrasting food webs under a range of nutrient enrichments during a seven-year period, Prior to enrichment, food webs were manipulated to create contrasts between piscivore dominance and planktivore dominance. Nutrient enrichments of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited ratios of N:P > 17:1, by atoms, to maintain P limitation. An unmanipulated reference lake, Paul Lake, revealed baseline variability but showed no trends that could confound the interpretation of changes in the nearby manipulated lakes. Herbivorous zooplankton of West Long Lake (piscivorous fishes) were large-bodied Daphnia spp., in contrast to the small-bodied grazers that predominated in Peter Lake (planktivorous fishes). At comparable levels of nutrient enrichment, Peter Lake's areal chlorophyll and areal primary production rates exceeded those of West Long Lake by factors of approximately three and six, respectively. Grazers suppressed pelagic primary producers in West Long Lake, relative to Peter Lake, even when nutrient input rates were so high that soluble reactive phosphorus accumulated in the epilimnions of both lakes during summer. Peter Lake also had higher bacterial production (but not biomass) than West Long Lake. Hydrologic changes that accompanied manipulation of East Long Lake caused concentrations of colored dissolved organic carbon to increase, leading to considerable variability in fish and zooplankton populations. Both trophic cascades and water color appeared to inhibit the response of primary producers to nutrients in East Long Lake. Carbon dioxide was discharged to the atmosphere by Paul Lake in all years and by the other lakes prior to nutrient addition. During nutrient addition, only Peter Lake consistently absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere, due to high rates of carbon fixation by primary producers. In contrast, CO2 concentrations of West Long Lake shifted to near-atmospheric levels, and net fluxes were near zero, while East Long Lake continued to discharge CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB Tropical forests are being cleared at an alarming rate although our understanding of their ecology is limited. It is therefore essential to design restoration experiments that both further our basic knowledge of tropical ecology and inform management strategies to facilitate recovery of these ecosystems. Here we synthesize the results of research on tropical montane forest recovery in abandoned pasture in Costa Rica to address the following questions: (1) What factors limit tropical forest recovery in abandoned pasture? and (2) How can we use this information to design strategies to facilitate ecosystem recovery? Our results indicate that a number of factors impede tropical forest recovery in abandoned pasture land. The most important barriers are lack of dispersal of forest seeds and seedling competition with pasture grasses. High seed predation, low seed germination, lack of nutrients, high light intensity, and rabbit herbivory also affect recovery. Successful strategies to facilitate recovery in abandoned pastures must simultaneously overcome numerous obstacles. Our research shows that establishment of woody species, either native tree seedlings or early-successional shrubs, can be successful in facilitating recovery, by enhancing seed dispersal and shading out pasture grasses. On the contrary, bird perching structures alone are not an effective strategy, because they only serve to enhance seed dispersal but do not reduce grass cover. Remnant pasture trees can serve as foci of natural recovery and may enhance growth of planted seedlings. Our results highlight the importance of: (1) understanding the basic biology of an ecosystem to design effective restoration strategies; (2) comparing results across a range of sites to determine which restoration strategies are most generally useful; and (3) considering where best to allocate efforts in large-scale restoration projects.

AB In Hawaiian montane forests, we assessed whether the same nutrients limit decomposition and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) along a soil chronosequence where nutrients demonstrably and predictably limit ANPP. At three sites that vary in parent material age (300, 20000, and 4.1 x 10(6) yr), we used fertilization to assess whether nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) limit decomposition. Reciprocal transplants using litter bags allowed us to distinguish limitation by externally supplied nutrients vs. limitation by nutrients within litter. Nutrient limitation of decomposition was not predictable from nutrient limitation of ANPP, in that elevated litter and soil N had only small, if any, effects on decomposition, even at the young site where N limits ANPP. At the oldest site where P limits ANPP, both elevated litter P and increased availability of soil N and P increased decomposition rates. Thus, nutrients may limit decomposition more strongly in low-P than in low-N ecosystems. Fertilization affected litter nutrient dynamics more strongly than it did decomposition, and we observed uptake of both N and P by decomposers that was not always accompanied by changes in decomposition rates. Such nutrient incorporation into decomposing litter may retain nutrients within ecosystems, even when nutrients do not limit decomposition rates.

AB The importance of various factors influencing the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds is critically examined using population genetic models. The factors include gene mutation, initial frequency of resistance alleles, inheritance, weed fitness in the presence and absence of herbicide, mating system, and gene flow. Where weed infestations are heavy, the probability of selecting for resistance can be high even when the rate of mutation is low Subsequent to the occurrence of a resistant mutant, repeated treatments with herbicides having the same mode of action can lead to the rapid evolution of a predominantly resistant population. At a given herbicide selection intensity, the initial frequency of resistance alleles determines the number of generations required to reach a specific frequency of resistant plants. The initial frequency of resistance alleles has a greater influence on the evolutionary process when herbicides impose weak selection, as opposed to very strong selection. Under selection, dominant resistance alleles increase in frequency more rapidly than recessive alleles in random mating or highly outcrossing weed populations. In highly self-fertilizing species, dominant and recessive resistance alleles increase in frequency at approximately the same rate. Gene flow through pollen or seed movement from resistant weed populations can provide a source of resistance alleles in previously susceptible populations. Because rates of gene flow are generally higher than rates of mutation, the time required to reach a high level of resistance in such situations is greatly reduced. Contrary to common misconception, gene flow from a susceptible population to a population undergoing resistance evolution is unlikely to slow the evolutionary process significantly. Accurate measurements of many factors that influence resistance evolution are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain experimentally. Thus, the use of models to predict times to resistance in specific situations is markedly limited. However, with appropriate assumptions, they can be invaluable in assessing the relative effectiveness of various management practices to avoid, or delay, the occurrence of herbicide resistance in weed populations.

TI Key Role of Persistent Free Radicals in Hydrogen Peroxide Activation by

AB We investigated the activation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by biochars (produced from pine needles, wheat, and maize straw) for 2-chlorobiphenyl (2-CB) degradation in the present study. It was found that H2O2 can be effectively activated by biochar, which produces hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) to degrade 2-CB. Furthermore, the activation mechanism was elucidated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and salicylic acid (SA) trapping techniques. The results showed that biochar contains persistent free radicals (PFRs), typically 1018 unpaired spins/gram. Higher trapped [(OH)-O-center dot] concentrations were observed with larger decreases in PFRs concentration, when H2O2 was added to biochar, indicating that PFRs were the main contributor to the formation of (OH)-O-center dot. This hypothesis was supported by the linear correlations between PFRs concentration and trapped [(OH)-O-center dot], as well as k(obs) of 2-CB degradation. The correlation coefficients (R-2) were 0.723 and 0.668 for PFRs concentration vs trapped [(OH)-O-center dot], and PFRs concentration vs k(obs)., respectively, when all biochars pyrolyzed at different temperatures were included. For the same biochar washed by different organic solvents (methanol, hexane, dichloromethane, and toluene), the correlation coefficients markedly increased to 0.818-0.907. Single-electron transfer from PFRs to H2O2 was a possible mechanism for H2O2 activation by biochars, which was supported by free radical quenching studies. The findings of this study provide a new pathway for biochar implication and insight into the mechanism of H2O2 activation by carbonaceous materials (e.g., activated carbon and graphite).

AB Theory predicts that the approach of catastrophic thresholds in natural systems (e. g., ecosystems, the climate) may result in an increasingly slow recovery from small perturbations, a phenomenon called critical slowing down. We used replicate laboratory populations of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for direct observation of critical slowing down before population collapse. We mapped the bifurcation diagram experimentally and found that the populations became more vulnerable to disturbance closer to the tipping point. Fluctuations of population density increased in size and duration near the tipping point, in agreement with the theory. Our results suggest that indicators of critical slowing down can provide advance warning of catastrophic thresholds and loss of resilience in a variety of dynamical systems.

AB Benefits of increased size and functional specialization of cells have repeatedly promoted the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors. Many requirements for multicellular organization (cell adhesion, cell-cell communication and coordination, programmed cell death) likely evolved in ancestral unicellular organisms. However, the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors may be opposed by genetic conflicts that arise when mutant cell lineages promote their own increase at the expense of the integrity of the multicellular organism. Numerous defenses limit such genetic conflicts, perhaps the most important being development from a unicell, which minimizes conflicts from selection among cell lineages, and redistributes genetic variation arising within multicellular individuals between individuals. With a unicellular bottleneck, defecting cell lineages rarely succeed beyond the life span of the multicellular individual. When multicellularity arises through aggregation of scattered cells or when multicellular organisms fuse to form genetic chimeras, there are more opportunities for propagation of defector cell lineages. Intraorganismal competition may partly explain why multicellular organisms that develop by aggregation generally exhibit less differentiation than organisms that develop clonally.

AB Communication involves complex behavior in multiple sensory channels, or "modalities." We provide an overview of multimodal communication and its costs and benefits, place examples of signals and displays from an array of taxa, sensory systems, and functions into our signal classification system, and consider issues surrounding the categorization of multimodal signals. The broadest level of classification is between signals with redundant and nonredundant components, with finer distinctions in each category. We recommend that researchers gather information on responses to each component of a multimodal signal as well as the response to the signal as a whole. We discuss the choice of categories, whether to categorize signals on the basis of the signal or the response, and how to classify signals if data are missing. The choice of behavioral assay may influence the outcome, as may the context of the communicative event. We also consider similarities and differences between multimodal and unimodal composite signals and signals that are sequentially, rather than simultaneously, multimodal.

AB Flux data are noisy, and this uncertainty is largely due to random measurement error. Knowledge of uncertainty is essential for the statistical evaluation of modeled and measured fluxes, for comparison of parameters derived by fitting models to measured fluxes and in formal data-assimilation efforts. We used the difference between simultaneous measurements from two towers located less than 1 km apart to quantify the distributional characteristics of the measurement error in fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and sensible and latent heat (H and LE, respectively). Flux measurement error more closely follows a double exponential than a normal distribution. The CO2 flux uncertainty is negatively correlated with mean wind speed, whereas uncertainty in H and LE is positively correlated with net radiation flux.
   Measurements from a single tower made 24 h apart under similar environmental conditions can also be used to characterize flux uncertainty. Uncertainty calculated by this method is somewhat higher than that derived from the two-tower approach. We demonstrate the use of flux uncertainty in maximum likelihood parameter estimates for simple physiological models of daytime net carbon exchange. We show that inferred model parameters are highly correlated, and that hypothesis testing is therefore possible only when the joint distribution of the model parameters is taken into account.

AB The prevalence and severity of marine diseases have increased over the last 20 years, significantly impacting a variety of foundation and keystone species. One explanation is that changes in the environment caused by human activities have impaired host resistance and/or have increased pathogen virulence. Here, we report evidence from field experiments that nutrient enrichment can significantly increase the severity of two important Caribbean coral epizootics: aspergillosis of the common gorgonian sea fan Gorgonia ventalina and yellow band disease of the reef-building corals Montastraea annularis and M. franksii. Experimentally increasing nutrient concentrations by 2-5x nearly doubled host tissue loss caused by yellow band disease. In a separate experiment, nutrient enrichment significantly increased two measures of sea fan aspergillosis severity. Our results may help explain the conspicuous patchiness of coral disease severity, besides suggesting that minimizing nutrient pollution could be an important management tool for controlling coral epizootics.

AB Many terrestrial communities include omnivorous arthropods that feed on both prey and plant resources. In this review we first discuss some unique morphological, physiological, arid behavioral traits that enable omnivores to exploit such dissimilar foods, and we explore possible evolutionary pathways to omnivory. We then examine possible benefits and costs of omnivory, describe the relationships between omnivory and other high-order complex trophic interactions, and consider the stability level of communities with closed-loop omnivory. Finally, we explore some of the implications of omnivory for crop damage and for biological, chemical, and cultural control practices. We conclude. that the growing realization of the ubiquity of omnivory in nature may require a change in our view of the structure and function of ecological systems.

AB Three hypotheses to discern the strong positive association between juvenile fish and mangrove habitat were tested with field and laboratory experiments. Artificial mangrove structure in the field attracted slightly more juvenile fish than areas without structure. Artificial structure left to accumulate fouling algae attracted four-times the total number of juvenile fish than areas without structure or areas with clean structure. Community composition of fish attracted to structure with fouling algae was different when compared with areas with no structure or clean structure; five species were attracted by structure with fouling algae whilst two species were associated with structure regardless of fouling algae. Algae were linked to increased food availability and it is suggested that this is an important selection criteria for some species. Other species were apparently attracted to structure for different reasons, and provision of shelter appears to be important. Predation pressure influenced habitat choice in small juvenile fish in laboratory experiments. In the absence of predators, small juveniles of four out of five species avoided shelter but when predators were introduced all species actively sought shelter. Large fish were apparently less vulnerable to predators and did not seek shelter when predators were added to their tank. Feeding rate was increased in the mangrove habitat for small and medium-sized fish compared with seagrass beds and mudflats indicating increased food availability or foraging efficiency within this habitat. Larger fish fed more effectively on the mudflats with an increased feeding rate in this habitat compared with adjacent habitats. The most important aspect of the mangrove habitat for small juvenile fish is the complex structure that provides maximum food availability and minimises the incidence of predation. As fish grow a shift in habitat from mangroves to mudflat is a response to changes in diet, foraging efficiency and vulnerability to predators. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SPEECH; RECOGNITION; CUES
AB Whereas the perception of emotion from facial expression has been extensively studied cross-culturally, little is known about judges' ability to infer emotion from vocal cues. This article reports the results from a study conducted in nine countries in Europe, the United States, and Asia on vocal emotion portrayals of anger, sadness, fear, joy, and neutral voice as produced by professional German actors. Data show an overall accuracy of 66% across all emotions and countries. Although accuracy was substantially better than chance, there were sizable differences ranging from 74% in Germany to 52% in Indonesia. However, patterns of confusion were very similar across all countries. These data suggest the existence of similar inference rules from vocal expression across cultures. Generally, accuracy decreased with increasing language dissimilarity from German in spite of the use of language-free speech samples. It is concluded that culture- and language-specific paralinguistic patterns may influence the decoding process.

AB Large areas of semiarid grasslands in the southwestern United States have been virtually replaced by shrubs during the past century. Understanding the causes and consequences of such vegetation dynamics requires that we elucidate the interplay between external forces of change (e.g., climate, human impacts) and the internal forces within these ecosystems that foster resilience and/or stability. Several conceptual models of arid ecosystems address this interplay by including the potential role of autogenic shrub effects on ecosystem processes, which lead to the formation of "resource islands" and tend to promote shrub persistence. Specifically, during the process of shrub establishment and maturation, the cycling of nutrients is progressively confined to the zones of litter accumulation beneath shrubs, while bare intershrub spaces become increasingly nutrient poor. As shrub resource islands develop, there is increased interception and stemflow by shrub canopies, confining infiltration of nutrient-enriched rainfall directly beneath the shrubs; the barren intershrub spaces generate overland flow, soil erosion by wind and water, and nutrient losses. These islands are preferred sites for the regeneration of shrubs and herbaceous plants and are correlated with spatial variation in soil microbial populations and soil microfauna that promote nutrient cycling. Lf further changes in the transition between grassland and shrubland are to be correctly predicted-or if we wish to intervene and redirect transitions-we must develop a greater mechanistic understanding of the structural and functional relationships between shrubs and the resource islands associated with them.
   We conducted a 3-yr field study in the Jornada Basin of southern New Mexico to explore the relationships between seasonal manipulations of soil water and its impact on soil nutrient dynamics of resource islands and shrub growth and physiology. At our study site, where total annual precipitation is similar to 230 mm (similar to 65% falls during the summer period), we simulated seasonal drought in summer (1 June-30 September) and winter/spring (1 October-31 May) by constructing large rainfall-exclusion shelters over shrub resource islands at different stages of development. Our experiment tests two principal hypotheses. The first is that the two major shrub species in the Jornada Basin, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), have different growth phenologies, rooting patterns, and physiological responses to resource availability (primarily water). The second is that different size classes of shrubs ("small" and "large") represent distinct stages of resource island development (i.e., "young" and "mature," respectively) and, hence, different stabilities-that is, as islands develop, their associated shrubs become less coupled to short-term fluctuations in precipitation and more resistant to long-term drought or climate shifts.
   With regard to the first hypothesis, we conclude that the two species are relatively similar in function despite the different phenological "strategies" of Larrea (evergreen) and Prosopis (winter deciduous), In the absence of drought, both species exhibited maximal rates of shoot and root growth, as well as high photosynthesis and transpiration, in late spring. This remained as the period for maximal growth and physiological activity for Prosopis shrubs that experienced drought in either summer or winter/spring. On the other hand, Larrea shrubs that experienced drought in winter/spring had maximal growth and activity shifted to the summer period, and in the absence of drought, Larrea shrubs also exhibited high physiological activity during the summer (especially following high rainfall). Thus, Larrea appears to have a greater capacity for shifting its activity patterns to alternate periods to take advantage of changes in resource availability. Shrubs of both species appeared well adapted to withstand season-long droughts. Mechanisms for survival include the following capacities: (1) to shift growth and physiological activity to utilize different temporal moisture (Larrea); (2) to utilize different levels of soil water (both species); (3) to carry out limited physiological activity and growth during drought (especially Larrea); and (4) to compensate for some negative impacts of drought through enhanced physiology (especially Prosopis) and growth (especially Larrea) in the season following drought. With regard to the second hypothesis, we again found more similarities than differences between the different aged (young vs. mature) islands. The stage of maturity of a resource island complex did not seem to be a significant factor to the growth and physiological activity of the shrub.

AB This paper concerns the response of foraging animals to variability in rate of gain, or risk. Both the empirical and theoretical literatures relevant to this issue are reviewed. The methodology and results from fifty-nine studies in which animals are required to choose between foraging options differing in the variances in the rate of gain available are tabulated, We found that when risk is generated by variability in the amount of reward, animals are most frequently risk-averse and sometimes indifferent to risk, although in some studies preference depends on energy budget. In contrast, when variability is in delay to reward, animals are universally risk-prone. A range of functional, descriptive and mechanistic accounts for these findings is described, none of which alone is capable of accommodating all aspects of the data. Risk-sensitive foraging theory provides the only currently available explanation for why energy budget should affect preference. An information-processing model that incorporates Weber's law provides the only general explanation for why animals should be risk-averse with variability in amount and risk-prone with delay. A theory based on the mechanisms of associative learning explains quantitative aspects of risk-proneness for delay; specifically why the delay between choice and reward should have a stronger impact on preference than delays between the reward and subsequent choice. It also explains why animals should appear to commit the ''fallacy of the average,'' maximising the expected ratio of amount of reward over delay to reward when computing rates rather than the ratio of expected amount over expected delay. We conclude that only a fusion of functional and mechanistic thinking will lead to progress in the understanding of animal decision making.

AB Few comparative studies of spatial patterns at different scales have examined several species in the same habitat or the same species over a range of habitats. Therefore, variability in patterns among species or among habitats has seldom been documented. This study quantifies spatial patterns of a suite of intertidal snails and a species of barnacle using a range of statistical techniques. Variability in densities was quantified from the scale of adjacent quadrats (over a distance of centimeters) to tens of kilometers. Significant differences in abundances occurred primarily at two spatial scales. Small-scale differences were found at the scales of centimeters or 1-2 m and, for many species on many shores, these accounted for most of the variability in abundances from place to place. These are likely to be determined by behavioural responses to small-scale patches of microhabitat. Large-scale differences in abundance were also found in most species at the scale of hundreds of meters alongshore. These are likely to be due to variation in recruitment (and/or mortality) because of limited dispersal by adults of these species. There was little or no additional variation among shores, separated by tens of kilometers, than was shown among patches of shore separated by hundreds of meters. Identification of the scale(s) at which significant differences in abundance are found focus attention on the processes (and the scales at which these processes operate) that influence patterns of distribution and abundance. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of various procedures are discussed.

AB Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission from infected patients to health-care workers has been well documented, but transmission from an infected health-care worker to a patient has not been reported. After identification of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient who had no known risk factors for HIV infection but who had undergone an invasive procedure performed by a dentist with AIDS, six other patients of this dentist were found to be HIV-infected. Molecular biologic studies were conducted to complement the epidemiologic investigation. Portions of the HIV proviral envelope gene from each of the seven patients, the dentist, and 35 HIV-infected persons from the local geographic area were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Three separate comparative genetic analyses-genetic distance measurements, phylogenetic tree analysis, and amino acid signature pattern analysis-showed that the viruses from the dentist and five dental patients were closely related. These data, together with the epidemiologic investigation, indicated that these patients became infected with HIV while receiving care from a dentist with AIDS.

AB Uncovering the genetic and evolutionary basis of local adaptation is a major focus of evolutionary biology. The recent development of cost-effective methods for obtaining high-quality genome-scale data makes it possible to identify some of the loci responsible for adaptive differences among populations. Two basic approaches for identifying putatively locally adaptive loci have been developed and are broadly used: one that identifies loci with unusually high genetic differentiation among populations (differentiation outlier methods) and one that searches for correlations between local population allele frequencies and local environments (genetic-environment association methods). Here, we review the promises and challenges of these genome scan methods, including correcting for the confounding influence of a species' demographic history, biases caused by missing aspects of the genome, matching scales of environmental data with population structure, and other statistical considerations. In each case, we make suggestions for best practices for maximizing the accuracy and efficiency of genome scans to detect the underlying genetic basis of local adaptation. With attention to their current limitations, genome scan methods can be an important tool in finding the genetic basis of adaptive evolutionary change.

AB With the exception of a few model species, individual differences in cognition remain relatively unstudied in non-human animals. One intriguing possibility is that variation in cognition is functionally related to variation in personality. Here, we review some examples and present hypotheses on relationships between personality (or behavioural syndromes) and individual differences in cognitive style. Our hypotheses are based largely on a connection between fast-slow behavioural types (BTs; e.g. boldness, aggressiveness, exploration tendency) and cognitive speed-accuracy trade-offs. We also discuss connections between BTs, cognition and ecologically important aspects of decision-making, including sampling, impulsivity, risk sensitivity and choosiness. Finally, we introduce the notion of cognition syndromes, and apply ideas from theories on adaptive behavioural syndromes to generate predictions on cognition syndromes.

AB Global population increases and climate change underscore the need for better comprehension of how plants acquire and process nutrients such as iron. Using cell type-specific transcriptional profiling, we identified a pericycle-specific iron deficiency response and a bHLH transcription factor, POPEYE (PYE), that may play an important role in this response. Functional analysis of PYE suggests that it positively regulates growth and development under iron-deficient conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis and transcriptional profiling reveal that PYE helps maintain iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of known iron homeostasis genes and other genes involved in transcription, development, and stress response. PYE interacts with PYE homologs, including IAA-Leu Resistant3 (ILR3), another bHLH transcription factor that is involved in metal ion homeostasis. Moreover, ILR3 interacts with a third protein, BRUTUS (BTS), a putative E3 ligase protein, with metal ion binding and DNA binding domains, which negatively regulates the response to iron deficiency. PYE and BTS expression is also tightly coregulated. We propose that interactions among PYE, PYE homologs, and BTS are important for maintaining iron homeostasis under low iron conditions.

AB Human activities exert global-scale impacts on our environment with significant implications for freshwater-driven services and hazards for humans and nature. Our approach to the science of hydrology needs to significantly change so that we can understand and predict these implications. Such an adjustment is a necessary prerequisite for the development of sustainable water resource management strategies and to achieve long-term water security for people and the environment. Hydrology requires a paradigm shift in which predictions of system behavior that are beyond the range of previously observed variability or that result from significant alterations of physical (structural) system characteristics become the new norm. To achieve this shift, hydrologists must become both synthesists, observing and analyzing the system as a holistic entity, and analysts, understanding the functioning of individual system components, while operating firmly within a well-designed hypothesis testing framework. Cross-disciplinary integration must become a primary characteristic of hydrologic research, catalyzing new research and nurturing new educational models. The test of our quantitative understanding across atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere will necessarily lie in new approaches to benchmark our ability to predict the regional hydrologic and connected implications of environmental change. To address these challenges and to serve as a catalyst to bring about the necessary changes to hydrologic science, we call for a long-term initiative to address the regional implications of environmental change.

AB OCBIL theory aims to develop an integrated series of hypotheses explaining the evolution and ecology of, and best conservation practices for, biota on very old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs). Conventional theory for ecology and evolutionary and conservation biology has developed primarily from data on species and communities from young, often disturbed, fertile landscapes (YODFELs), mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. OCBILs are rare, but are prominent in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region, South Africa's Greater Cape, and Venezuela's Pantepui Highlands. They may have been more common globally before Pleistocene glaciations. Based on the premise that natural selection has favoured limited dispersability of sedentary organisms, OCBILs should have elevated persistence of lineages (Gondwanan Heritage Hypothesis) and long-lived individuals (Ultimate Self Hypothesis), high numbers of localised rare endemics and strongly differentiated population systems. To counter such natural fragmentation and inbreeding due to small population size, ecological, cytogenetic and genetic mechanisms selecting for the retention of heterozygosity should feature (the James Effect). The climatic stability of OCBILs should be paralleled by persistence of adjacent semi-arid areas, conducive to speciation (Semiarid Cradle Hypothesis). Special nutritional and other biological traits associated with coping with infertile lands should be evident, accentuated in plants, for example, through water-foraging strategies, symbioses, carnivory, pollination and parasitism. The uniquely flat landscapes of southwestern Australia have had prolonged presence of saline lakes along palaeoriver systems favouring evolution of accentuated tolerance to salinity. Lastly, unusual resiliences and vulnerabilities might be evident among OCBIL organisms, such as enhanced abilities to persist in small fragmented populations but great susceptibility to major soil disturbances. In those places where it is most pertinent, OCBIL theory hopefully lays a foundation for future research and for better informed conservation management.

AB Global warming is predicted to cause distributional changes in organisms whose geographic ranges are controlled by temperature. We report a recent latitudinal and altitudinal expansion of the pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa, whose larvae build silk nests and feed on pine foliage in the winter. In north-central France (Paris Basin), its range boundary. has shifted by 87 km northwards between 1972 and 2004; in northern Italy (Alps), an altitudinal shift of 110-230 in upwards occurred between 1975 and 2004. By experimentally linking Winter temperature, feeding activity, and survival of T. pityocampa larvae, we attribute the expansions to increased winter survival due to a warming trend over the past three decades. In the laboratory we determined the minimum nest and night air temperatures required for larval feeding and developed a mechanistic model based on these temperature thresholds. We tested the model in a translocation experiment that employed natural temperature gradients as spatial analogues for global warming. In all transects we transferred colonies of T. pityocampa larvae to sites within zones of historical distribution, recent distribution, and outside the present range. We monitored air and nest temperature, incoming solar radiation, larval phenology, feeding activity, and survival. Early-season temperature effects on phenology were evident with delayed development of colonies in the more extreme (colder) sites. In the coldest months, our model was consistent With the observed patterns of feeding activity: Feeding was, progressively reduced with increasing latitude,or elevation, as predicted by the lower number of hours when the feeding threshold was reached, which negatively affected final survival. Insolation raised nest temperature and increased feeding activity on the south but not the north aspect. Prolonged temperature drops below the feeding thresholds occurred at all-sites, leading to starvation and partial mortality. Nonetheless, even the most extreme sites still allowed some feeding and, consequently, up to 20% colony survival and successful pupation. Given that the present distribution of the oligophagous T. pityocampa is not constrained by the distribution of its actual or potential hosts, and that warmer winters will cause the number of hours of feeding to increase and the probability of the lower lethal temperature to decrease, we expect the trend of improved survival in previously prohibitive environments to continue, causing further latitudinal and altitudinal expansion. This work highlights the need to develop temperature-based predictive models for future range shifts of winter-limited species, with potential applications in management.

AB Owing to the exponential growth of genome databases, phylogenetic trees are now widely used to test a variety of evolutionary hypotheses. Nevertheless, computation time burden limits the application of methods such as maximum likelihood nonparametric bootstrap to assess reliability of evolutionary trees. As an alternative, the much faster Bayesian inference of phylogeny, which expresses branch support as posterior probabilities, has been introduced. However, marked discrepancies exist between nonparametric bootstrap proportions and Bayesian posterior probabilities, leading to difficulties in the interpretation of sometimes strongly conflicting results. As an attempt to reconcile these two indices of node reliability, we apply the nonparametric bootstrap resampling procedure to the Bayesian approach. The correlation between posterior probabilities, bootstrap maximum likelihood percentages, and bootstrapped posterior probabilities was studied for eight highly diverse empirical data sets and were also investigated using experimental simulation. Our results show that the relation between posterior probabilities and bootstrapped maximum likelihood percentages is highly variable but that very strong correlations always exist when Bayesian node support is estimated on bootstrapped character matrices. Moreover, simulations corroborate empirical observations in suggesting that, being more conservative, the bootstrap approach might be less prone to strongly supporting a false phylogenetic hypothesis. Thus, apparent conflicts in topology recovered by the Bayesian approach were reduced after bootstrapping. Both posterior probabilities and bootstrap supports are of great interest to phylogeny as potential upper and lower bounds of node reliability, but they are surely not interchangeable and cannot be directly compared.

AB Although both food availability and predation risk have been hypothesized to affect dolphin habitat use and group size, no study has measured both factor's concurrently to determine their relative influences. From 1997 to 1999, we investigated the effect of food availability and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) predation risk on bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) habitat use and group size in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Food availability was measured by fish trapping, while predation risk was assessed by shark catch rates, acoustic tracks, and Crittercam deployments. Dolphin habitat use was determined using belt transects. The biomass of dolphin prey did not vary seasonally and was significantly greater in shallow habitats than in deeper ones. Tiger sharks were virtually absent during cold months of 1997 and 1998, abundant in warm months of all years, and found at an intermediate density during cold months of 1999. When present, shark density was highest in shallow habitats. Decreased echolocation efficiency in very shallow water and poor visual detection of tiger shark's (camouflaged over seagrass) probably further enhance the riskiness of such habitats, and the relative riskiness of shallow habitats is supported by the observation that dolphins select deep waters in Which to rest. The observed dolphin group sizes were consistent with a food-safety trade-off. Groups were larger in more dangerous shallow habitats and larger during resting than during foraging. Foraging dolphins matched the distribution of their food when sharks were absent. However, during warm months, the distribution of foraging dolphins significantly deviated from that of their food, with fewer dolphins foraging in the productive (but dangerous) shallow habitats than expected on the basis of food alone. When shark density was intermediate, habitat use by foraging dolphins was more similar to the high-shark-density seasons than periods of low shark density. These results suggest that foraging dolphin distributions reflect a trade-off between predation risk, and food availability. Because the distribution and abundance of tiger sharks are influenced by species other than dolphins, the distribution of the tiger sharks' primary prey may indirectly influence dolphin habitat use, suggesting that it is important to consider the community context in studies of habitat use.

AB The extent of the diversity of marine prokaryotes is not well known, primarily because of poor cultivability. However, new techniques permit the characterization of such organisms without culturing, via 16S rRNA sequences obtained directly from biomass. We performed such an analysis by polymerase chain reaction amplification with universal primers on five oligotrophic open-ocean samples: from 100-m (three samples) and 500-m depths in the western California Current (Pacific Ocean) and from a 10-m depth in the Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda. Of 61 clones, 90% were in clusters of two or more related marine clones obtained by ourselves or others. We report 15 clones related to clone SAR 11 found earlier near Bermuda (S. J. Giovannoni, T. B. Britschgi, C. L. Moyer, and K. G. Field, Nature [London] 345:60-63, 1990), 11 related to marine cyanobacteria, 9 clustered in a group affiliated with gram-positive bacteria, 9 in an archaeal cluster we recently described (mostly from the 500-m sample), 4 in a novel gamma-proteobacterial cluster, and 6 in three two-membered clusters (including other archaea). One clone was related to flavobacteria. Only the cyanobacteria plus one other clone, related to Roseobacter denitrificans (formerly Erythrobacter longus Och114), were within 10% sequence identity to any previously sequenced cultured organism in a major data base. We never found more than two occurrences of the same sequence in a sample, although four times we found identical sequences between samples, two of which were between oceans; one of these sequences was also identical to SAR 11. Overall, the results point to broadly diverse microbial assemblages, with the common presence of heretofore phylogenetically undescribed groups.

AB A parsimony analysis of 57 angiosperm rbcL sequences was conducted to test the monophyly of the Asteridae and to identify major lineages within the Asteridae. Three major clades, the Caryophyllidae, the Rosidae plus Dilleniidae, and the Asteridae sensu lato, emerge from an unresolved radiation in the "higher" dicots. The Asteridae sens. lat. include the Ericales, Cornales, and Apiales in addition to the Asteridae sens. str. Two major lineages within the Asteridae sens. lat. are identified: the Dipsacales, Apiales, Asterales, and Campanulales in one, and the Gentianales, Scrophulariales, Lamiales, Boraginales, and Solanales in the other. This analysis demonstrates the utility of molecular phylogenies to help place problematic taxa, such as the Menyanthaceae, Oleaceae, and Callitrichaceae, within the Asteridae. Implications from this phylogenetic analysis and evidence from the fossil record lead to the suggestion that the origin and diversification of the major higher-dicot lineages occurred during a relatively short period of time about 80-95 million years ago.

AB Climate change is driving changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ocean that have consequences for marine ecosystems. Here, we review evidence for the responses of marine life to recent climate change across ocean regions, from tropical seas to polar oceans. We consider observed changes in calcification rates, demography, abundance, distribution, and phenology of marine species. We draw on a database of observed climate change impacts on marine species, supplemented with evidence in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discuss factors that limit or facilitate species responses, such as fishing pressure, the availability of prey, habitat, light and other resources, and dispersal by ocean currents. We find that general trends in species' responses are consistent with expectations from climate change, including shifts in distribution to higher latitudes and to deeper locations, advances in spring phenology, declines in calcification, and increases in the abundance of warm-water species. The volume and type of evidence associated with species responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions and taxonomic groups, with predominance of evidence derived from the heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of the impact of climate change being associated with the impacts of changing temperature, with few observations of effects of changing oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters), or ocean acidification. Observations of species responses that have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals).

AB Background: Species are considered the fundamental unit in many ecological and evolutionary analyses, yet accurate, complete, accessible taxonomic frameworks with which to identify them are often unavailable to researchers. In such cases DNA sequence-based species delimitation has been proposed as a means of estimating species boundaries for further analysis. Several methods have been proposed to accomplish this. Here we present a Bayesian implementation of an evolutionary model-based method, the general mixed Yule-coalescent model (GMYC). Our implementation integrates over the parameters of the model and uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships using the output of widely available phylogenetic models and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation in order to produce marginal probabilities of species identities.
   Results: We conducted simulations testing the effects of species evolutionary history, levels of intraspecific sampling and number of nucleotides sequenced. We also re-analyze the dataset used to introduce the original GMYC model. We found that the model results are improved with addition of DNA sequence and increased sampling, although these improvements have limits. The most important factor in the success of the model is the underlying phylogenetic history of the species under consideration. Recent and rapid divergences result in higher amounts of uncertainty in the model and eventually cause the model to fail to accurately assess uncertainty in species limits.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that the GMYC model can be useful under a wide variety of circumstances, particularly in cases where divergences are deeper, or taxon sampling is incomplete, as in many studies of ecological communities, but that, in accordance with expectations from coalescent theory, rapid, recent radiations may yield inaccurate results. Our implementation differs from existing ones in two ways: it allows for the accounting for important sources of uncertainty in the model (phylogenetic and in parameters specific to the model) and in the specification of informative prior distributions that can increase the precision of the model. We have incorporated this model into a user-friendly R package available on the authors' websites.

AB P>Two major approaches address the need to predict species distributions in response to environmental changes. Correlative models estimate parameters phenomenologically by relating current distributions to environmental conditions. By contrast, mechanistic models incorporate explicit relationships between environmental conditions and organismal performance, estimated independently of current distributions. Mechanistic approaches include models that translate environmental conditions into biologically relevant metrics (e.g. potential duration of activity), models that capture environmental sensitivities of survivorship and fecundity, and models that use energetics to link environmental conditions and demography. We compared how two correlative and three mechanistic models predicted the ranges of two species: a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris) and a fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Correlative and mechanistic models performed similarly in predicting current distributions, but mechanistic models predicted larger range shifts in response to climate change. Although mechanistic models theoretically should provide more accurate distribution predictions, there is much potential for improving their flexibility and performance.

AB Climate change is altering the phenology of many species and the timing of their interactions with other species, but the impacts of these phenological shifts on species interactions remain unclear. Classical approaches to the study of phenology have typically documented changes in the timing of single life-history events, while phenological shifts affect many interactions over entire life histories. In this study, we suggest an approach that integrates the phenology and ontogeny of species interactions with a fitness landscape to provide a common mechanistic framework for investigating phenological shifts. We suggest that this ontogeny-phenology landscape provides a flexible method to document changes in the relative phenologies of interacting species, examine the causes of these phenological shifts, and estimate their consequences for interacting species.

AB Background: Molecular evolutionary studies share the common goal of elucidating historical relationships, and the common challenge of adequately sampling taxa and characters. Particularly at low taxonomic levels, recent divergence, rapid radiations, and conservative genome evolution yield limited sequence variation, and dense taxon sampling is often desirable. Recent advances in massively parallel sequencing make it possible to rapidly obtain large amounts of sequence data, and multiplexing makes extensive sampling of megabase sequences feasible. Is it possible to efficiently apply massively parallel sequencing to increase phylogenetic resolution at low taxonomic levels?
   Results: We reconstruct the infrageneric phylogeny of Pinus from 37 nearly-complete chloroplast genomes (average 109 kilobases each of an approximately 120 kilobase genome) generated using multiplexed massively parallel sequencing. 30/33 ingroup nodes resolved with >= 95% bootstrap support; this is a substantial improvement relative to prior studies, and shows massively parallel sequencing-based strategies can produce sufficient high quality sequence to reach support levels originally proposed for the phylogenetic bootstrap. Resampling simulations show that at least the entire plastome is necessary to fully resolve Pinus, particularly in rapidly radiating clades. Metaanalysis of 99 published infrageneric phylogenies shows that whole plastome analysis should provide similar gains across a range of plant genera. A disproportionate amount of phylogenetic information resides in two loci (ycf1, ycf2), highlighting their unusual evolutionary properties.
   Conclusion: Plastome sequencing is now an efficient option for increasing phylogenetic resolution at lower taxonomic levels in plant phylogenetic and population genetic analyses. With continuing improvements in sequencing capacity, the strategies herein should revolutionize efforts requiring dense taxon and character sampling, such as phylogeographic analyses and species-level DNA barcoding.

AB In recent years, avian systematics has been characterized by a diminished reliance on morphological cladistics of modern taxa, intensive palaeornithogical research stimulated by new discoveries and an inundation by analyses based on DNA sequences. Unfortunately, in contrast to significant insights into basal origins, the broad picture of neornithine phylogeny remains largely unresolved. Morphological studies have emphasized characters of use in palaeontological contexts. Molecular studies, following disillusionment with the pioneering, but non-cladistic, work of Sibley and Ahlquist, have differed markedly from each other and from morphological works in both methods and findings. Consequently, at the turn of the millennium, points of robust agreement among schools concerning higher-order neornithine phylogeny have been limited to the two basalmost and several mid-level, primary groups. This paper describes a phylogenetic (cladistic) analysis of 150 taxa of Neornithes, including exemplars from all non-passeriform families, and subordinal representatives of Passeriformes. Thirty-five outgroup taxa encompassing Crocodylia, predominately theropod Dinosauria, and selected Mesozoic birds were used to root the trees. Based on study of specimens and the literature, 2954 morphological characters were defined; these characters have been described in a companion work, approximately one-third of which were multistate (i.e. comprised at least three states), and states within more than one-half of these multistate characters were ordered for analysis. Complete heuristic searches using 10 000 random-addition replicates recovered a total solution set of 97 well-resolved, most-parsimonious trees (MPTs). The set of MPTs was confirmed by an expanded heuristic search based on 10 000 random-addition replicates and a full ratchet-augmented exploration to ascertain global optima. A strict consensus tree of MPTs included only six trichotomies, i.e. nodes differing topologically among MPTs. Bootstrapping (based on 10 000 replicates) percentages and ratchet-minimized support (Bremer) indices indicated most nodes to be robust. Several fossil Neornithes (e.g. Dinornithiformes, Aepyornithiformes) were placed within the ingroup a posteriori either through unconstrained, heursitic searches based on the complete matrix augmented by these taxa separately or using backbone-constraints. Analysis confirmed the topology among outgroup Theropoda and achieved robust resolution at virtually all levels of the Neornithes. Findings included monophyly of the palaeognathous birds, comprising the sister taxa Tinamiformes and ratites, respectively, and the Anseriformes and Galliformes as monophyletic sister-groups, together forming the sister-group to other Neornithes exclusive of the Palaeognathae (Neoaves).
   Noteworthy inferences include: (i) the sister-group to remaining Neoaves comprises a diversity of marine and wading birds; (ii) Podicipedidae are the sister-group of Gaviidae, and not closely related to the Phoenicopteridae, as recently suggested; (iii) the traditional Pelecaniformes, including the shoebill (Balaeniceps rex) as sister-taxon to other members, are monophyletic; (iv) traditional Ciconiiformes are monophyletic; (v) Strigiformes and Falconiformes are sister-groups; (vi) Cathartidae is the sister-group of the remaining Falconiformes; (vii) Ralliformes (Rallidae and Heliornithidae) are the sister-group to the monophyletic Charadriiformes, with the traditionally composed Gruiformes and Turniciformes (Turnicidae and Mesitornithidae) sequentially paraphyletic to the entre foregoing clade; (viii) Opisthocomus hoazin is the sister-taxon to the Cuculiformes (including the Musophagidae); (ix) traditional Caprimulgiformes are monophyletic and the sister-group of the Apodiformes; (x) Trogoniformes are the sister-group of Coliiformes; (xi) Coraciiformes, Piciformes and Passeriformes are mutually monophyletic and closely related; and (xii) the Galbulae are retained within the Piciformes. Unresolved portions of the Neornithes (nodes having more than one most-parsimonious solution) comprised three parts of the tree: (a) several interfamilial nodes within the Charadriiformes; (b) a trichotomy comprising the (i) Psittaciformes, (ii) Columbiformes and (iii) Trogonomorphae (Trogoniformes, Coliiformes) + Passerimorphae (Coraciiformes, Piciformes, Passeriformes); and (c) a trichotomy comprising the Coraciiformes, Piciformes and Passeriformes. The remaining polytomies were among outgroups, although several of the highest-order nodes were only marginally supported; however, the majority of nodes were resolved and met or surpassed conventional standards of support. Quantitative comparisons with alternative hypotheses, examination of highly supportive and diagnostic characters for higher taxa, correspondences with prior studies, complementarity and philosophical differences with palaeontological phylogenetics, promises and challenges of palaeogeography and calibration of evolutionary rates of birds, and classes of promising evidence and future directions of study are reviewed. Homology, as applied to avian examples of apparent homologues, is considered in terms of recent theory, and a revised annotated classification of higher-order taxa of Neornithes and other closely related Theropoda is proposed.

AB Atmospheric changes such as elevated CO2 are of global extent, exert prime influences in the remaining wilderness areas, and are second in importance only to effects of land use on ecosystems in most parts of the world. This study is an attempt to summarize, from a biological viewpoint, knowledge of the influences of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on terrestrial ecosystems, as derived from empirical data. I first briefly recall key aspects of the global carbon cycle, mention important conceptual aspects and research tools, and then discuss in greater depth how elevated CO2 is likely to affect vegetation processes. Besides a stimulation of photosynthesis, the most robust findings on plant responses to elevated CO2 are changes in active tissue quality (wider C/N ratio) and effects on community dynamics. Results of experimental work offer a number of plausible projections with respect to future ecosystem processes and organismic interactions, but manipulative experiments appear unsuitable to prove or disprove C sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems. In certain regions, consequences of climatic changes and soluble-nitrogen deposition are likely to be greater than direct CO2 effects on the carbon balance of vegetation. The significance of the ecosystem approach, the use of fully coupled plant-soil systems, and the consideration of nonlinear responses are highlighted. The current understanding of the CO2 problem offers sufficient justification to urge measures for moderating human forcing of atmospheric change.

AB I draw attention to the need for ecologists to take spatial structure into account more seriously in hypothesis testing. If spatial autocorrelation is ignored, as it usually is, then analyses of ecological patterns in terms of environmental factors can produce very misleading results. This is demonstrated using synthetic but realistic spatial patterns with known spatial properties which are subjected to classical correlation and multiple regression analyses. Correlation between an autocorrelated response variable and each of a set of explanatory variables is strongly biased in favour of those explanatory variables that are highly autocorrelated - the expected magnitude of the correlation coefficient increases with autocorrelation even if the spatial patterns are completely independent. Similarly, multiple regression analysis finds highly autocorrelated explanatory variables "significant" much more frequently than it should. The chances of mistakenly identifying a "significant" slope across an autocorrelated pattern is very high if classical regression is used. Consequently, under these circumstances strongly autocorrelated environmental factors reported in the literature as associated with ecological patterns may not actually be significant. It is likely that these factors wrongly described as important constitute a red-shifted subset of the set of potential explanations, and that more spatially discontinuous factors (those with bluer spectra) are actually relatively more important than their present status suggests. There is much that ecologists can do to improve on this situation. I discuss various approaches to the problem of spatial autocorrelation from the literature and present a randomisation test for the association of two spatial patterns which has advantages over currently available methods.

AB Globally, lakes are currently accumulating organic carbon (OC) at an estimated annnal rate of about 42 Tg.yr(-1). Most of the OC in all but the most oligotrophic of these lakes is autochthonous, produced by primary production in the lakes. The sediments of reservoirs accumulate an additional 160 Tg annually, and peatlands contribute 96 Tg annually. These three carbon pools collectively cover less than 2% of the Earth's surface and constitute a carbon sink of about 300 Tg.yr(-1). Although the oceans cover 71% of the Earth's surface, they accumulate OC at a rate of only about 100 Tg.yr(-1).

AB 1. To test several hypotheses about acclimation and adaptation of photosynthesis and respiration to differing light conditions, we investigated the interspecific relationships between leaf and root metabolism, chemistry and morphology in high and low light conditions for young seedlings of nine boreal tree species that differ in relative growth rate (RGR).
   2. Light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(sat)), whole-plat nitrogen (N) uptake rates, leaf and root respiration and morphology, and RGR all varied in parallel among the nine species when grown in both 5% and 25% of full sunlight. RGR, A(sat), leaf and root respiration (R-d), and N uptake rate per unit root mass or length differed significantly among species, ranking (from high to low): Populus, Betula and Larix SPP (all deciduous) and then to five evergreen conifers (Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp,), which were generally comparable in these measures.
   3, A(sat), leaf and root R-d and N uptake rates were all correlated (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9) with species traits, such as seed mass, leaf life span and shade-tolerance rankings. Mass-based A(sat) was greater in conifer seedlings raised in low than high light. In contrast, area-based A(sat) was higher for plants grown in high than low light, especially in the deciduous species. Once adjusted for differences in plant mass, leaf or root respiration rates did not differ for plants grown in low vs high light.
   4, Interspecific variation in RGR was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with rates of photosynthesis, respiration and N uptake. Leaf photosynthesis and respiration rates were correlated to specific leaf area and leaf N concentrations (r approximate to 0.9). Root respiraristi rates, N uptake rates, specific root length (root length per root dry mass) and root N concentrations were all highly correlated with each other (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9). These data suggest a close coupling of tissue-level metabolism, chemistry and structure with whole-plant performance and species ecophysiological and life-history traits.

AB The MADS-box encodes a novel type of DNA-binding domain found so far in a diverse group of transcription factors from yeast, animals, and seed plants. Here, our first aim was to evaluate the primary structure of the MADS-box. Compilation of the 107 currently available MADS-domain sequences resulted in a signature which can strictly discriminate between genes possessing or lacking a MADS-domain and allowed a classification of MADS-domain proteins into several distinct subfamilies. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of known eukaryotic MADS-box genes, which is the first comprising animal as well as fungal and plant homologs, showed that the vast majority of subfamily members appear on distinct subtrees of phylogenetic trees, suggesting that subfamilies represent monophyletic gene clades and providing the proposed classification scheme with a sound evolutionary basis. A reconstruction of the history of the MADS-box gene subfamilies based on the taxonomic distribution of contemporary subfamily members revealed that each subfamily comprises highly conserved putative orthologs and recent paralogs. Some subfamilies must be very old (1,000 MY or more), while others are more recent. In general, subfamily members tend to share highly similar sequences: expression patterns, and related functions. The defined species distribution, specific function, and strong evolutionary conservation of the members of most subfamilies suggest that the establishment of different subfamilies was followed by rapid fixation and was thus highly advantageous during eukaryotic evolution. These gene subfamilies may have been essential prerequisites for the establishment of several complex eukaryotic body structures, such as muscles in animals and certain reproductive structures in higher plants, and of some signal transduction pathways. Phylogenetic trees indicate that after establishment of different subfamilies, additional gene duplications led to a further increase in the number of MADS-box genes. However, several molecular mechanisms of MADS-box gene diversification were used to a quite different extent during animal and plant evolution. Known plant MADS-domain sequences diverged much faster than those of animals, and gene duplication and sequence diversification were extensively used for the creation of new genes during plant evolution, resulting in a relatively large number of interacting genes, In contrast, the available data on animal genes suggest that increase in gene number was only moderate in the lineage leading to mammals, but in the case of MEF2-like gene products, heterodimerization between different splice variants may have increased the combinatorial possibilities of interactions considerably. These observations demonstrate that in metazoan and plant evolution, increased combinatorial possibilities of MADS-box gene product interactions correlated with the evolution of increasingly complex body plans.

AB Almost the entire sequences of 18S rDNA were determined for two chaetognaths, five echinoderms, a hemichordate, and two urochordates (a larvacean and a salp). Phylogenetic comparisons of the sequences, together with those of other deuterostomes (an ascidian, a cephalochordate, and vertebrates) and protostomes (an arthropod and a mollusc), suggest the monophyly of the deuterostomes, with the exception of the chaetognaths. Chaetognaths may not be a group of deuterostomes. The deuterostome group closest to vertebrates was the group of cephalochordates. Ascidians, larvaceans, and salps seem to form a discrete group (urochordates), in which the early divergence of larvaceans is evident. These results support the hypothesis that chordates evolved from free-living ancestors.

AB Many of the most interesting questions ecologists ask lead to analyses of spatial data. Yet, perhaps confused by the large number of statistical models and fitting methods available, many ecologists seem to believe this is best left to specialists. Here, we describe the issues that need consideration when analysing spatial data and illustrate these using simulation studies. Our comparative analysis involves using methods including generalized least squares, spatial filters, wavelet revised models, conditional auto-regressive models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate regression coefficients from synthetic but realistic data sets, including some which violate standard regression assumptions. We assess the performance of each method using two measures and using statistical error rates for model selection. Methods that performed well included generalized least squares family of models and a Bayesian implementation of the conditional auto-regressive model. Ordinary least squares also performed adequately in the absence of model selection, but had poorly controlled Type I error rates and so did not show the improvements in performance under model selection when using the above methods. Removing large-scale spatial trends in the response led to poor performance. These are empirical results; hence extrapolation of these findings to other situations should be performed cautiously. Nevertheless, our simulation-based approach provides much stronger evidence for comparative analysis than assessments based on single or small numbers of data sets, and should be considered a necessary foundation for statements of this type in future.

TI Energy balance and emissions associated with biochar sequestration and

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English

AB The implications for greenhouse gas emissions of optimizing a slow pyrolysis-based bioenergy system for biochar and energy production rather than solely for energy production were assessed. Scenarios for feedstock production were examined using a life-cycle approach. We considered both purpose grown bioenergy crops (BEC) and the use of crop wastes (CW) as feedstocks. The BEC scenarios involved a change from growing winter wheat to purpose grown miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn as bioenergy crops. The CW scenarios consider both corn stover and winter wheat straw as feedstocks. Our findings show that the avoided emissions are between 2 and 5 times greater when biochar is applied to agricultural land (2-19 Mg CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)) than used solely for fossil energy offsets. 41-64% of these emission reductions are related to the retention of C in biochar, the rest to offsetting fossil fuel use for energy, fertilizer savings, and avoided soil emissions other than CO2. Despite a reduction in energy output of approximately 30% where the slow pyrolysis technology is optimized to produce biochar for land application, the energy produced per unit energy input at 2-7 MJ/MJ is greater than that of comparable technologies such as ethanol from corn. The C emissions per MWh of electricity production range from 91-360 kg CO2 MWh(-1), before accounting for C offset due to the use of biochar are considerably below the lifecycle emissions associated with fossil fuel use for electricity generation (600-900 kg CO2 MWh(-1)). Low-temperature slow pyrolysis offers an energetically efficient strategy for bioenergy production, and the land application of biochar reduces greenhouse emissions to a greater extent than when the biochar is used to offset fossil fuel emissions.

AB We evaluate whether species interaction frequency can be used as a surrogate for the total effect of a species on another. Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per-interaction effect, using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large-scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species-rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I) and total effect (T) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per-interaction effect (P) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta-analysis using data on I, P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong, positive relationship between T and I, in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus, frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction, regardless of their effectiveness on a per-interaction basis.

AB Watershed land cover is widely used as a predictor of stream-ecosystem condition. However, numerous spatial factors can confound the interpretation of correlative analyses between land cover and stream indicators, particularly at broad spatial scales. We used a stream-monitoring data set collected from the Coastal Plain of Maryland, USA to address analytical challenges presented by (1) collinearity of land-cover class percentages, (2) spatial autocorrelation of land cover and stream data, (3) intercorrelations among and spatial autocorrelation within abiotic intermediaries that link land cover to stream biota, and (4) spatial arrangement of land cover within watersheds. We focused on two commonly measured stream indicators, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and macroinvertebrate assemblages, to evaluate how different spatial considerations may influence results. Partial correlation analysis of land-cover percentages revealed that simple correlations described relationships that could not be separated from the effects of other land-cover classes or relationships that changed substantially when the influences of other land-cover classes were taken into account. Partial Mantel tests showed that all land-cover percentages were spatially autocorrelated, and this spatial phenomenon accounted for much of the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages that could naively be attributed to certain classes (e.g., percentage cropland). We extended our use of partial Mantel tests into a path-analytical framework and identified several independent pathways between percentage developed land and instream measurements after factoring out spatial autocorrelation and other confounding variables; however, under these conditions, percentage cropland was only linked to nitrate-N. Further analyses revealed that spatial arrangement of land cover, as measured by areal buffers and distance weighting, influenced the amount of developed land, resulting in a threshold change in macroinvertebrate-assemblage composition. Moreover, distance-weighted percentage cropland improved predictions of stream nitrate-N concentrations in small watersheds, but not in medium or large ones. Collectively, this series of analyses clarified the magnitude and critical scales of effects of different land-cover classes on Coastal Plain stream ecosystems and may serve as an analytical framework for other studies. Our results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on these important spatial considerations; otherwise, we risk obscuring the relationships between watershed land cover and the condition of stream ecosystems.

AB 1. Management of rangelands has long operated under the paradigm of minimizing spatially discrete disturbances, often under the objective of reducing inherent heterogeneity within managed ecosystems. Management of grazing animals has focused on uniform distribution of disturbance, so that no areas are heavily disturbed or undisturbed (i.e. management to the 'middle').
   2. A model of the fire-grazing interaction argues that grazing and fire interact through a series of positive and negative feedbacks to cause a shifting mosaic of vegetation pattern across the landscape. This interaction was important in the evolution of species in the North American Great Plains grasslands. This approach has the potential to serve as an ecological-based model for management of grasslands with a long evolutionary history of grazing.
   3. We compared a heterogeneity-based approach, in which fire is applied to discrete patches, with typical homogeneity-based land management in the North American Great Plains, to determine if patch burning followed by focal grazing creates a shifting mosaic pattern of vegetation structure and composition.
   4. Our data suggest that spatially discrete fires promote focal grazing, where grazing animals devote 75% of grazing time within the one-third of the area that has been burned within the past year. These focal disturbances cause local changes in the plant community and increase patch-level heterogeneity across landscapes. As the focal disturbance is shifted to other patches over time, successional processes lead to changes in local plant communities and the patchwork landscape can be described as a shifting mosaic.
   5. A patch-dynamic approach can be accomplished in the tallgrass prairie through applying spatially discrete fires and allowing animals free access to a diversity of landscape elements that vary in time since focal disturbance. This increases heterogeneity across the landscape, a variable that has been shown to be critical to some wildlife species as well as the structure and function of grassland ecosystems.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that the fire-grazing model may be useful for generating heterogeneity in grassland management. Discrete fires are applied to patches, and patchy grazing by herbivores promotes a shifting vegetation mosaic across the landscape. Furthermore, application of the model has the potential of increasing the area of rangelands under management for conservation purposes, because livestock production is maintained at a level similar to traditional management. So, by managing transient focal patches that move through the landscape, heterogeneity has the potential to be a central paradigm for managing landscapes for multiple objectives, such as biodiversity and agricultural productivity.

AB Species richness, the simplest index of biodiversity, varies greatly over broad spatial scales. Richness-climate relationships often account for >80% of the spatial variance in richness. However, it has been suggested that richness-climate relationships differ significantly among geographic regions and that there is no globally consistent relationship. This study investigated the global patterns of species and family richness of angiosperms in relation to climate. We found that models relating angiosperm richness to mean annual temperature, annual water deficit, and their interaction or models relating richness to annual potential evapotranspiration and water deficit are both globally consistent and very strong and are independent of the diverse evolutionary histories and functional assemblages of plants in different parts of the world. Thus, effects of other factors such as evolutionary history, postglacial dispersal, soil nutrients, topography, or other climatic variables either must be quite minor over broad scales ( because there is little residual variation left to explain) or they must be strongly collinear with global patterns of climate. The correlations shown here must be predicted by any successful hypothesis of mechanisms controlling richness patterns.

AB Temperature responses of rates of respiratory CO2 efflux from plants, soils, and ecosystems are frequently modelled using exponential functions with a constant Q(10) near 2.0 (fractional change in rate with a 10 degreesC increase in temperature). However, we present evidence that Q(10) declines with short-term increases in temperature in a predictable manner across diverse plant taxa. Thus, models using a constant Q(10) are biased, and use of a temperature-corrected Q(10) may improve the accuracy of modelled respiratory CO2 efflux in plants and ecosystems in response to temperature and predicted global climate changes.

AB Natal dispersal is a process that is critical in the spatial dynamics of populations, including population spread recolonization, and gene flow. It is a central focus of conservation issues for many vertebrate species. Using data for 77 bird and 68 mammal species we tested whether median and maximum natal dispersal distances were correlated with body mass, diet type, social system, taxonomic family, and migratory status. Body mass and diet type were found to predict both median and maximum natal dispersal distances in mammals: large species dispersed farther than small ones, and carnivorous species dispersed farther than herbivores and omnivores. Similar relationships occurred for carnivorous bird species, but not for herbivorous or omnivorous ones. Natal dispersal distances in birds or mammals were not significantly related to broad categories of social systems. Only in birds were factors such as taxonomic relatedness and migratory status correlated with natal dispersal, and then only for maximum distances. Summary properties of dispersal processes appeared to be derived from interactions among behavioral and morphological characteristics of species and from their linkages to the dynamics of resource availability in landscapes.
   In all the species we examined, most dispersers moved relatively short distances, and long-distance dispersal was uncommon. On the basis of these findings, we fit an empirical model based on the negative exponential distribution for calculating minimum probabilities that animals disperse particular distances from their natal areas. This model, coupled with knowledge of a species' body mass and diet type, can be used to conservatively predict dispersal distances for different species and examine possible consequences of large-scale habitat alterations on connectedness between populations. Taken together, our results can provide managers with the means to identify species vulnerable to landscape-level habitat changes such as forest fragmentation. In addition, our dispersal models can be used to predict which species in a community are likely to be the most vulnerable to loss of connectedness and allow managers to test the merits of alternative habitat conservation plans.

AB 1. Destructive subsampling or restrictive sampling are often standard procedures to obtain independence of spatial observations in home range analyses. We examined whether home range estimators based upon kernel densities require serial independence of observations, by using a Monte Carlo simulation, antler flies and snapping turtles as models.
   2. Home range size, time partitioning and total straight line distances travelled were tested to determine if subsampling improved kernel performance and estimation of home range parameters.
   3. The accuracy and precision of home range estimates from the simulated data set improved at shorter time intervals despite the increase in autocorrelation among the observations.
   4. Subsampling did not reduce autocorrelation among locational observations of snapping turtles or antler flies, and home range size, time partitioning and total distance travelled were better represented by autocorrelated observations.
   5. We found that kernel densities do not require serial independence of observations when estimating home range, and we recommend that researchers maximize the number of observations using constant time intervals to increase the accuracy and precision of their estimates.

AB Latitudinal diversity gradients are first-order expressions of diversity patterns both on land and in the oceans, although the current hypotheses that seek to explain them are based chiefly on terrestrial data, We have assembled a database of the geographic ranges of 3,916 species of marine prosobranch gastropods living on the shelves of the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans, from the tropics to the Arctic Ocean, Western Atlantic and eastern Pacific diversities are similar, and the diversity gradients are strikingly similar despite many important physical and historical differences between the oceans, This shared diversity pattern cannot be explained by: (i) latitudinal differences in species range-length (Rapoport's rule); (ii) species-area effects; or (iii) recent geologic histories, One parameter that does correlate significantly with diversity in both oceans is solar energy input, as represented by average sea surface temperature, If this correlation is causal, sea surface temperature is probably linked to diversity through some aspect of productivity, In this case, diversity is an evolutionary outcome of trophodynamic processes inherent in ecosystems, and not just a byproduct of physical geographies.

AB The Yellowstone fires of 1988 affected >250 000 ha, creating a mosaic of burn severities across the landscape and providing an ideal opportunity to study effects of fire size and pattern on postfire succession. We asked whether vegetation responses differed between small and large burned patches within the fire-created mosaic in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and evaluated the influence of spatial patterning on the postfire vegetation. Living vegetation in a small (1 ha), moderate (70-200 ha), and large (500-3600 ha) burned patch at each of three geographic locations was sampled annually from 1990 to 1993, Burn severity and patch size had significant effects on most biotic responses. Severely burned areas had higher cover and density of lodgepole pine seedlings, greater abundance of opportunistic species, and lower richness of vascular plant species than less severely burned areas. Larger burned patches had higher cover of tree seedlings and shrubs, greater densities of lodgepole pine seedlings and opportunistic species, and lower species richness than smaller patches. Herbaceous species present before the fires responded individually to burn severity and patch size; some were more abundant in large patches or severely burned areas, while others were more abundant in small patches or lightly burned areas. To date, dispersal into the burned areas from the surrounding unburned forest has not been an important mechanism for reestablishment of forest species. Most plant cover in burned areas consisted of resprouting survivors during the first 3 yr after the fires. A pulse of seedling establishment in 1991 suggested that local dispersal from these survivors was a dominant mechanism for reestablishment of forest herbs. Succession across much of YNP appeared to be moving toward plant communities similar to those that burned in 1988, primarily because extensive biotic residuals persisted even within very large burned areas. However, forest reestablishment remained questionable in areas of old (>400 yr) forests with low prefire serotiny. Despite significant effects of burn severity and patch size, the most important explanatory variable for most biotic responses was geographic location, particularly as related to broad-scale patterns of serotiny in Pinus contorta. We conclude that the effects of fire size and pattern were important and some may be persistent, but that these landscape-scale effects occurred within an overriding context of broader scale gradients.

   AMERICA

DT Article
ID DNA; POPULATIONS; ANCIENT; HUMANS
AB The nature of domestic cattle origins in Africa are unclear as archaeological data are relatively sparse. The earliest domesticates were humpless, or Bos taurus, in morphology and may have shared a common origin with the ancestors of European cattle in the Near East. Alternatively, local strains of the wild ox, the aurochs, may have been adopted by peoples in either continent either before or after cultural influence from the Levant. This study examines mitochondrial DNA displacement loop sequence variation in 90 extant bovines drawn from Africa, Europe, and India. Phylogeny estimation and analysis of molecular variance verify that sequences cluster significantly into continental groups. The Indian Bos indicus samples are most markedly distinct from the others, which is indicative of a B. taurus nature for both European and African ancestors. When a calibration of sequence divergence is performed using comparisons with bison sequences and an estimate of 1 Myr since the Bison/Bos Leptobos common ancestor, estimates of 117-275,000 B.P. and 22-26,000 B.P. are obtained for the separation between Indians and others and between African and European ancestors, respectively. As cattle domestication is thought to have occurred approximately 10,000 B.P., these estimates suggest the domestication of genetically discrete aurochsen strains as the origins of each continental population. Additionally, patterns of variation that are indicative of population expansions (probably associated with the domestication process) are discernible in Africa and Europe. Notably, the genetic signatures of these expansions are clearly younger than the corresponding signature of African/European divergence.

AB The ecosystem services approach is an established framework for the balanced evaluation of ecological, economic and social landscape resources. It promotes functional synergies (win-win situations) as well as trade-offs among various benefits resulting from ecosystem processes. Spatial aspects of heterogeneity and configuration play a major role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services and hence in human wellbeing. Cultural artifacts also contribute to landscape functionality. Because of the underlying areal aspects, an additional term, landscape service has been proposed and is increasingly used (Termorshuizen and Opdam. 2009). We take a particular interest in spatial aspects of this framework and the optimization of trade-offs between landscape services.
   Firstly, spatial heterogeneity is assessed by means of landscape metrics computed as indicators for landscape services. Landscape heterogeneity is a key measure of biodiversity and contributes to several valuable functions. Habitat connectivity and other measures of landscape structure are also essential criteria for the behavior of metapopulations and for recreational value.
   Secondly, service providing areas (SPAs) are discussed as the areal basis for service provision. Similarly, service benefiting areas (SBAs) and connecting areas (SCAs) for the transfer of matter, energy and organisms between them are investigated. Place-based assessment addresses such areas. We thus show possibilities for estimating and evaluating landscape units.
   Thirdly, the landscape consists of the natural environment, artifacts from past human use, current human activity and even social thinking. The landscape services approach in a wider sense allows us to take social/cultural services better into account because they depend strongly on heritage assets, structural characteristics, historical conditions end even cultural specifics; which can hardly be subsumed to ecosystems. Place-based assessment is an appropriate solution for combining several spatial categories. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Continental-scale reconstructions have been made for the mid-Holocene (MH, around 6 ka) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, around 21 ka), allowing comparison with palaeoclimate simulations currently being carried out as part of the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The synthesis of the available MH and LGM climate reconstructions and their uncertainties, obtained using modern-analogue, regression and model-inversion techniques, is presented for four temperature variables and two moisture variables. Reconstructions of the same variables based on surface-pollen assemblages are shown to be accurate and unbiased. Reconstructed LGM and MH climate anomaly patterns are coherent, consistent between variables, and robust with respect to the choice of technique. They support a conceptual model of the controls of Late Quaternary climate change whereby the first-order effects of orbital variations and greenhouse forcing on the seasonal cycle of temperature are predictably modified by responses of the atmospheric circulation and surface energy balance.

AB Although some organisms have moved to higher elevations and latitudes in response to recent climate change, there is little consensus regarding the capacity of different species to track rapid climate change via range shifts. Understanding species' abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading-edge range shifts and species' traits. We found expected relationships for several datasets, including diet breadth in North American Passeriformes and egg-laying habitat in British Odonata. However, models generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management. Trait-based range shift forecasts face several challenges, including quantifying relevant natural history variation across large numbers of species and coupling these data with extrinsic factors such as habitat fragmentation and availability.

AB We assessed the relative roles of local environmental conditions and dispersal on community structure in a landscape of lakes for the major trophic groups. We use taxonomic presence-absence and abundance data for bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish from 18 lakes in southern Quebec, Canada. The question of interest was whether communities composed of organisms with more limited dispersal abilities, because of size and life history ( zooplankton and fish) would show a different effect of lake distribution than communities composed of good dispersers ( bacteria and phytoplankton). We examine the variation in structure attributable to local environmental (i.e., lake chemical and physical variables) vs. dispersal predictors ( i.e., overland and watercourse distances between lakes) using variation partitioning techniques. Overall, we show that less motile species ( crustacean zooplankton and fish) are better predicted by spatial factors than by local environmental ones. Furthermore, we show that for zooplankton abundances, both overland and watercourse dispersal pathways are equally strong, though they may select for different components of the community, while for fish, only watercourses are relevant dispersal pathways. These results suggest that crustacean zooplankton and fish are more constrained by dispersal and therefore more likely to operate as a metacommunity than are bacteria and phytoplankton within this studied landscape.

AB Quantitative genetics provides one of the most promising frameworks with which to unify the fields of macroevolution and microevolution. The genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) is crucial to quantitative genetic predictions about macroevolution. In spite of years of study, we still know little about how G evolves. Recent studies have been applying an increasingly phylogenetic perspective and more sophisticated statistical techniques to address G matrix evolution. We propose that a new field, comparative quantitative genetics, has emerged. Here we summarize what is known about several key questions in the field and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the many statistical and conceptual approaches now being employed. Past studies have made it clear that the key question is no longer whether G evolves but rather how fast and in what manner. We highlight the most promising future directions for this emerging field.

AB The analysis of some species-rich, well-defined food webs shows that they display the so-called small world behavior shared by a number of disparate complex systems. The three systems analysed (Ythan estuary web, Silwood web and the Little Rock lake web) have different levels of taxonomic resolution, but all of them involve high clustering and short path lengths (near two degrees of separation) between species. Additionally, the distribution of connections P(k) which is skewed in all the webs analysed shows long tails indicative of power-law scaling. These features suggest that communities might be self-organized in a non-random fashion that might have important consequences in their resistance to perturbations (such as species removal). The consequences for ecological theory are outlined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Over the years, the evolutionary importance of natural hybridization has been a contentious issue. At one extreme is the relatively common view of hybridization as an evolutionarily unimportant process. A less common perspective, but one that has gained support over the past decade, is that of hybridization as a relatively widespread and potentially creative evolutionary process. Indeed, studies documenting the production of hybrid genotypes exhibiting a wide range of fitnesses have become increasingly common. In this review, we examine the genetic basis of such variation in hybrid fitness. In particular, we assess the genetic architecture of hybrid inferiority (both sterility and inviability). We then extend our discussion to the genetic basis of increased fitness in certain hybrid genotypes. The available evidence argues that hybrid inferiority is the result of widespread negative epistasis in a hybrid genetic background. In contrast, increased hybrid fitness can be most readily explained through the segregation of additive genetic factors, with epistasis playing a more limited role.

AB We use focal-species analysis to apply a graph-theoretic approach to landscape connectivity in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. In doing so we demonstrate the utility of a mathematical graph as an ecological construct with respect to habitat connectivity. Graph theory is a well established mainstay of information technology and is concerned with highly efficient network flow. It employs fast algorithms and compact data structures that are easily adapted to landscape-level focal species analysis. American mink (Mustela vison) and prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) share the same habitat but have different dispersal capabilities, and therefore provide interesting comparisons on connections in the landscape. We built graphs using GIS coverages to define habitat patches and determined the functional distance between the patches with least-cost path modeling. Using graph operations concerned with edge and node removal we found that the landscape is fundamentally connected for mink and fundamentally unconnected for prothonotary warblers. The advantage of a graph-theoretic approach over other modeling techniques is that it is a heuristic framework which can be applied with very little data and improved from the initial results. We demonstrate the use of graph theory in a metapopulation context and suggest that graph theory as applied to conservation biology can provide leverage on applications concerned with landscape connectivity.

AB Recent research shows that the dominance of evergreen species in nutrient-poor environments can be explained by their low nutrient loss rates. From this work it appears that the plant traits that are associated with low nutrient loss rates lead to low maximum-dry-matter production and to low rates of litter decomposition. This suggests a positive feedback between the evergreen habit and low nutrient availability. The growth characteristics of evergreens lead to a low responsiveness to environmental changes. As a result, global warming may lead to changes in the distribution of evergreens.

AB In this paper we review the published literature on patterns of abundance and aggregation of macroparasites in wildlife host populations. We base this survey on quantitative analyses of mean burden and a number of measures of the degree of aggregation of parasite burdens between hosts. All major parasite and vertebrate host taxa were represented in the database. Mean parasite burden was found to be log-normally distributed, indicating that all parasite burdens are regulated to some degree. In addition, all but one of the parasitic infections were aggregated with respect to their hosts, and the relationship between log mean parasite burden and log variance was found to be very strong (R(2) = 0.87). That is, for a given mean parasite burden there are constraints on the degree of variation in individual host burdens. The aggregated nature of the parasitic infections is also apparent from other measures of the degree of aggregation: prevalence - mean relationships, and the negative binomial parameter, k. Using a relatively new technique for parasitological infection data - tree-based models, as well as traditional linear models - a number of the parasitic infections was found to be associated with systematically lower or higher parasite burdens.

AB Parasites are thought to maximize the number of successfully transmitted offspring by trading off propagule production against host survival. In a horizontally transmitted microparasitic disease in Daphnia, a planktonic crustacean, increasing geographic distance between host and parasite origin was found to be correlated with a decrease in spore production and virulence. This finding indicates local adaptation of the parasite, but contradicts the hypothesis that long-standing coevolved parasites are less virulent than novel parasites. Virulence can be explained as the consequence of balancing the positive genetic correlation between host mortality and strain-specific spore production.

   SCALE; DEBT
AB Recent global warming is acting across marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems to favor species adapted to warmer conditions and/or reduce the abundance of cold-adapted organisms (i.e., "thermophilization" of communities). Lack of community responses to increased temperature, however, has also been reported for several taxa and regions, suggesting that "climatic lags" may be frequent. Here we show that microclimatic effects brought about by forest canopy closure can buffer biotic responses to macroclimate warming, thus explaining an apparent climatic lag. Using data from 1,409 vegetation plots in European and North American temperate forests, each surveyed at least twice over an interval of 12-67 y, we document significant thermophilization of ground-layer plant communities. These changes reflect concurrent declines in species adapted to cooler conditions and increases in species adapted to warmer conditions. However, thermophilization, particularly the increase of warm-adapted species, is attenuated in forests whose canopies have become denser, probably reflecting cooler growing-season ground temperatures via increased shading. As standing stocks of trees have increased in many temperate forests in recent decades, local microclimatic effects may commonly be moderating the impacts of macroclimate warming on forest understories. Conversely, increases in harvesting woody biomass-e.g., for bioenergy-may open forest canopies and accelerate thermophilization of temperate forest biodiversity.

AB Phenology, by controlling the seasonal activity of vegetation on the land surface, plays a fundamental role in regulating photosynthesis and other ecosystem processes, as well as competitive interactions and feedbacks to the climate system. We conducted an analysis to evaluate the representation of phenology, and the associated seasonality of ecosystem-scale CO2 exchange, in 14 models participating in the North American Carbon Program Site Synthesis. Model predictions were evaluated using long-term measurements (emphasizing the period 20002006) from 10 forested sites within the AmeriFlux and Fluxnet-Canada networks. In deciduous forests, almost all models consistently predicted that the growing season started earlier, and ended later, than was actually observed; biases of 2 weeks or more were typical. For these sites, most models were also unable to explain more than a small fraction of the observed interannual variability in phenological transition dates. Finally, for deciduous forests, misrepresentation of the seasonal cycle resulted in over-prediction of gross ecosystem photosynthesis by +160 145 g C m-2 yr-1 during the spring transition period and +75 +/- 130 g C m-2 yr-1 during the autumn transition period (13% and 8% annual productivity, respectively) compensating for the tendency of most models to under-predict the magnitude of peak summertime photosynthetic rates. Models did a better job of predicting the seasonality of CO2 exchange for evergreen forests. These results highlight the need for improved understanding of the environmental controls on vegetation phenology and incorporation of this knowledge into better phenological models. Existing models are unlikely to predict future responses of phenology to climate change accurately and therefore will misrepresent the seasonality and interannual variability of key biosphereatmosphere feedbacks and interactions in coupled global climate models.

AB The publication of a haplotype tree of human mitochondrial DNA variation in 1987 provoked a controversy about the details of recent human evolution that continues to this day. Now many haplotype trees are available, and new analytical techniques exist for testing hypotheses about recent evolutionary history using haplotype trees. Here I present formal statistical analysis of human haplotype trees for mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosomal DNA, two X-linked regions and six autosomal regions. A coherent picture of recent human evolution emerges with two major themes. First is the dominant role that Africa has played in shaping the modern human gene pool through at least two-not one-major expansions after the original range extension of Homo erectus out of Africa. Second is the ubiquity of genetic interchange between human populations, both in terms of recurrent gene flow constrained by geographical distance and of major population expansion events resulting in interbreeding, not replacement.

AB 1 We used data from 35 independently published studies world-wide to analyse the effects of plant litter on the germination, establishment, species richness and above-ground biomass of plants. Overall, the short-term effects of litter on vegetation were mostly negative, although their magnitude varied with vegetation variable, study method, experimental duration, latitude, habitat, type and quantity of litter and target species.
   2 Species richness was more affected than above-ground biomass by litter, suggesting that litter may play a direct role in structuring plant communities as well as influencing competition in productive habitats. Litter had a stronger overall effect on plant germination than on establishment, suggesting that a litter-reducing disturbance will have more effect early in the growth season.
   3 On average, vegetation was more affected by litter in field than in glasshouse studies and during 2-year than during 1-year studies. The effect on biomass switched from negative after 1 year to positive after 3 years.
   4 The absolute effects of litter on germination and establishment decreased and the absolute effects on above-ground biomass increased with latitude. Ecosystem type also influenced the effects significantly.
   5 Vegetation was generally more depressed by higher litter quantities. Litter composed of forbs and tree leaves had a stronger effect on vegetation than grass litter. The impact of a certain type of litter may therefore be related to its decomposition rate.
   6 Tree species were more affected than forbs and grasses by litter, at least at the colonization stage.

AB Phylogenetic and diversity analysis of the mtDNA control region sequence variation of 821 individuals from Europe and the Middle East distinguishes five major lineage groups with different internal diversities and divergence times. Consideration of the diversities and geographic distribution of these groups within Europe and the Middle East leads to the conclusion that ancestors of the great majority of modern, extant lineages entered Europe during the Upper Paleolithic. A further set of lineages arrived from the Middle East much later, and their age and geographic distribution within Europe correlates well with archaeological evidence for two culturally and geographically distinct Neolithic colonization events that are associated with the spread of agriculture. It follows from this interpretation that the major extant lineages throughout Europe predate the Neolithic expansion and that the spread of agriculture was a substantially indigenous development accompanied by only a relatively minor component of contemporary Middle Eastern agriculturalists. There is no evidence of any surviving Neanderthal lineages among modern Europeans.

AB The plant functional types (growth forms) traditionally recognized by arctic ecologists provide a useful framework for predicting vegetation responses to, and effects on, ecosystem processes. These functional types are similar to those objectively defined by cluster analysis ba,ed on traits expected to influence ecosystem processes. Principal components analysis showed that two major suites of traits (related to growth rate and woodiness) explain the grouping of species into functional types. These plant functional types are useful because they (1) influence many ecological processes (e.g. productivity, transpiration, and nutrient cycling) in similar ways, (2) predict both responses to and effects on environment, including disturbance regime, and (3) show no strong relationship with traits determining migratory ability (so that no functional type will be eliminated by climatic change simply because it cannot migrate). Circumstantial evidence for the ecological importance of these functional types comes from the distribution of types along environmental gradients and the known ecological effects of traits (e.g., effects of litter quality on decomposition and of plant height on winter albedo) that characterize each functional type. The paleorecord provides independent evidence that some of these functional types have responded predictably to past climatic changes. Field experiments also show that plant functional types respond predictably to changes in soil resources (water and nutrients) but less predictably to temperature. We suggest that evidence for the validity of arctic plant functional types is strong enough to warrant their use in regional models seeking to predict the transient response of arctic ecosystems to global change.

AB It was relatively easy to produce alternative community states as a function of variability in a sequence of species invasions employed to assemble a community. Numerous mechanisms and processes are capable of producing both temporary and nonrecoverable differences in community structure. They include priority effects, intransitivities, emergent properties (e.g., vulnerability to invasion, specific topologies), and effects specific to differences in assembly sequences themselves. In ecological systems, the existence of alternative states presents a difficult comparative problem in the search for unifying principles that might underlie community-level organization. This problem can be solved only if we understand the cause of alternative states and determine whether such states are persistent or transient. Otherwise, ecological communities appear so variable that general principles and mechanisms elude detection, even if they exert a powerful influence over the structure of the system. Mechanisms that are documented as controlling community organization and the population dynamics of component species are not necessarily the mechanisms responsible for observed patterns. Factors uncovered in any extant community may be responsible only for maintaining the status quo. The reason these factors (e.g., competition, predation, parasitism) are currently operating is often a direct function of community-assembly mechanics. Community-assembly processes and dynamics must be understood if we are to discern properly between maintenance and causal mechanisms.

AB We produced a reference sequence of the 1-gigabase chromosome 3B of hexaploid bread wheat. By sequencing 8452 bacterial artificial chromosomes in pools, we assembled a sequence of 774 megabases carrying 5326 protein-coding genes, 1938 pseudogenes, and 85% of transposable elements. The distribution of structural and functional features along the chromosome revealed partitioning correlated with meiotic recombination. Comparative analyses indicated high wheat-specific inter-and intrachromosomal gene duplication activities that are potential sources of variability for adaption. In addition to providing a better understanding of the organization, function, and evolution of a large and polyploid genome, the availability of a high-quality sequence anchored to genetic maps will accelerate the identification of genes underlying important agronomic traits.

To understand the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes in mediating microbial community succession, a unique framework composed of four different cases was developed for fluidic and nonfluidic ecosystems. The framework was then tested for one fluidic ecosystem: a groundwater system perturbed by adding emulsified vegetable oil (EVO) for uranium immobilization. Our results revealed that groundwater microbial community diverged substantially away from the initial community after EVO amendment and eventually converged to a new community state, which was closely clustered with its initial state. However, their composition and structure were significantly different from each other. Null model analysis indicated that both deterministic and stochastic processes played important roles in controlling the assembly and succession of the groundwater microbial community, but their relative importance was time dependent. Additionally, consistent with the proposed conceptual framework but contradictory to conventional wisdom, the community succession responding to EVO amendment was primarily controlled by stochastic rather than deterministic processes. During the middle phase of the succession, the roles of stochastic processes in controlling community composition increased substantially, ranging from 81.3% to 92.0%. Finally, there are limited successional studies available to support different cases in the conceptual framework, but further well-replicated explicit time-series experiments are needed to understand the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in controlling community succession.

AB Functional diversity is at the heart of current research in the field of conservation biology. Most of the indices that measure diversity depend on variables that have various statistical types (e.g. circular, fuzzy, ordinal) and that go through a matrix of distances among species. We show how to compute such distances from a generalization of Gower's distance, which is dedicated to the treatment of mixed data. We prove Gower's distance can be extended to include new types of data. The impact of this generalization is illustrated on a real data set containing 80 plant species and 13 various traits. Gower's distance allows an efficient treatment of missing data and the inclusion of variable weights. An evaluation of the real contribution of each variable to the mixed distance is proposed. We conclude that such a generalized index will be crucial for analyzing functional diversity at small and large scales.

AB Recent reviews of plant-pollinator mutualistic networks showed that generalization is a common pattern in this type of interaction. Here we examine the ecological correlates of generalization patterns in plant-pollinator networks. especially how interaction patterns covary with latitude, elevation, and insularity. We review the few published analyses of whole networks and include unpublished material, analyzing 29 complete plant-pollinator networks that encompass arctic, alpine, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical-tropical areas. The number of interactions observed (1) was a linear function of network size (M) the maximum number of interactions: In I = 0.575 + 0.61 In M; R-2 = 0.946. The connectance (C), the fraction of observed interactions relative to the total possible. decreased exponentially with species richness, the SLIM of animal and plant species in each community (A + P): C = 13.83 exp[-0.003(A + P)]. After controlling for species richness, the residual connectance was significantly lower in highland (>1500 in elevation) than in lowland networks and differed marginally among biogeographic regions, with both alpine and tropical networks showing a trend for lower residual connectance. The two Mediterranean networks showed the highest residual connectance. After correcting for variation in network size, plant species were shown to be more generalized at higher latitude and lowland habitats, but showed increased specialization on islands. Oceanic island networks showed an impoverishment of potential animal pollinators (lower ratio of animal to plant species. A : P. compared to mainland networks) associated with this trend of increased specialization. Plants, but not their flower-visiting animals, supported the often-repeated statements about higher specificity in the tropics than at higher latitudes. The pattern of interaction buildup as diversity increases in pollination networks does not differ appreciably from other mutualisms, such as plant-seed disperser networks or more complex food webs.

AB The study of bird song dialects was once considered the most promising approach for investigating the role of behaviour in reproductive divergence and speciation. However, after a series of studies yielding conflicting results, research in the field slowed significantly. Recent findings, on how ecological factors may lead to divergence in both song and morphology, necessitate a re-examination. We focus primarily on species with learned song, examine conflicting results in the literature and propose some potential new directions for future studies. We believe an integrative approach, including an examination of the role of ecology in divergent selection, is essential for gaining insight into the role of song in the evolution of assortative mating. Habitat-dependent selection on both song and fitness-related characteristics can lead to parallel divergence in these traits. Song may, therefore, provide females with acoustic cues to find males that are most fit for a particular habitat. In analysing the role of song learning in reproductive divergence, we focus on post-dispersal plasticity in a conceptual framework. We argue that song learning may initially constrain reproductive divergence, while in the later stages of population divergence it may promote speciation.

AB In host-parasite coevolutionary arms races, parasites probably have an evolutionary advantage. Parasite populations should be locally adapted, having higher mean fitness on sympatric than allopatric hosts. Here we assess evidence for local parasite advantage. Further we investigate how adaptation and counter-adaptation of parasites and hosts, necessarily occurring in sympatry, can generate a pattern of local adaptation. Already simple frequency-dependent selection models generate complex patterns of parasite performance on sympatric and allopatric populations. In metapopulations, with extinction, recolonization, and gene flow, variable selection pressure and stochasticity may obscure local processes or change the level at which local adaptation occurs. Alternatively, gene flow may introduce adaptive variation, so differential migration rates can modify the asymmetry of host and parasite evolutionary rates. We conclude that local adaptation is an average phenomenon. Its detection requires adequate replication at the appropriate level, that at which the local processes occur.

AB Primary production, plant biomass, plant element content, and various measures of turnover and element cycling were compared among four contrasting tundra vegetation types near Toolik Lake, Alaska.  The study sites were selected to represent extreme examples of the wide variation in plant growth form composition that is typical of northern ecosystems.  The aim of the research was to determine whether vegetation types that differ in their dominant plant growth form also differ in their production:biomass relationships and overall patterns of element use.
   The four sites included tussock tundra, a deciduous shrub-dominated riparian tundra, an evergreen heath tundra, and wet sedge tundra.  Biomass and element content (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) were determined for both vascular and nonvascular plants, and production estimates were obtained for vascular plants.  Production and biomass of most tissues were determined by quadrat harvest methods, with additional, separate determinations of stem secondary growth and belowground rhizome growth as components of net primary production (NPP).  Production, biomass, and element content of roots were not determined.
   Vascular plant biomass (excluding roots) varied by nearly 9 x among sites, from 217 to 1877 g/m2.  At least 50% of the vascular biomass at all four sites was belowground stems, but the relative allocation to leaves vs. aboveground stems varied greatly.  When mosses and lichens were included, total biomass varied by only 5 x among sites, and lichens were in fact the most abundant plant form at the evergreen heath site.  The element content in vascular biomass of these communities varied by 8-21 x, depending upon the element; including mosses and lichens, element content varied by 6-12x.
   Primary productivity of vascular plants also varied sharply among sites, from 32 to 305 g.m-2.yr-1 (not including root production).  Leaves were the largest single component of NPP at all sites, but the relative importance of above- and belowground stem growth varied considerably.  The element requirements of vascular NPP varied by 9-17x, depending upon the element.
   Despite these order-of-magnitude differences among sites in biomass, production, and element requirements, and the dramatic variation in allocation patterns, there was remarkably little difference among sites in the overall production : biomass relationships and element turnover.  These overall similarities were due to the dominant effect of stems and rhizomes in the whole-plant and whole-vegetation biomass and element budgets.  The wide range of leaf turnover rates and leaf production efficiencies was compensated at the whole-plant level by stem processes, especially element storage.  Thus, we conclude that plant growth form composition is not a good indicator of whole-vegetation biomass turnover rates and patterns of element use, although growth form composition is related to total production and biomass.

AB Understanding, modeling, and predicting the impact of global change on ecosystem functioning across biogeographical gradients can benefit from enhanced capacity to represent biota as a continuous distribution of traits. However, this is a challenge for the field of biogeography historically grounded on the species concept. Here we focus on the newly emergent field of functional biogeography: the study of the geographic distribution of trait diversity across organizational levels. We show how functional biogeography bridges species-based biogeography and earth science to provide ideas and tools to help explain gradients in multifaceted diversity (including species, functional, and phylogenetic diversities), predict ecosystem functioning and services worldwide, and infuse regional and global conservation programs with a functional basis. Although much recent progress has been made possible because of the rising of multiple data streams, new developments in ecoinformatics, and new methodological advances, future directions should provide a theoretical and comprehensive framework for the scaling of biotic interactions across trophic levels and its ecological implications.

Time-sensitive relationships, such as migration, breeding and predation, may be disrupted or altered, which may in turn alter the rates of reproduction and survival, leading some populations to decline and others to increase in abundance. However, finding evidence for disrupted relationships, or lack thereof, and their demographic effects, is difficult because the necessary detailed observational data are rare. Moreover, we do not know how sensitive species will generally be to phenological mismatches when they occur. Existing long-term studies provide preliminary data for analysing the phenology and demography of species in several locations. In many instances, though, observational protocols may need to be optimized to characterize timing-based multi-trophic interactions. As a basis for future research, we outline some of the key questions and approaches to improving our understanding of the relationships among phenology, demography and climate in a multi-trophic context. There are many challenges associated with this line of research, not the least of which is the need for detailed, long-term data on many organisms in a single system. However, we identify key questions that can be addressed with data that already exist and propose approaches that could guide future research.

AB Forecasts of species range shifts under climate change are fraught with uncertainties and ensemble forecasting may provide a framework to deal with such uncertainties. Here, a novel approach to partition the variance among modeled attributes, such as richness or turnover, and map sources of uncertainty in ensembles of forecasts is presented. We model the distributions of 3837 New World birds and project them into 2080. We then quantify and map the relative contribution of different sources of uncertainty from alternative methods for niche modeling, general circulation models (AOGCM), and emission scenarios. The greatest source of uncertainty in forecasts of species range shifts arises from using alternative methods for niche modeling, followed by AOGCM, and their interaction. Our results concur with previous studies that discovered that projections from alternative models can be extremely varied, but we provide a new analytical framework to examine uncertainties in models by quantifying their importance and mapping their patterns.

ID COEXISTENCE; VARIABILITY; PREDATION; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE
AB Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained(1-3). Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches(4-6); this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity(3,6-8). That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors(9). The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities(10,11). Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare-the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.

AB P>Knowledge of the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in natural ecosystems is a major bottleneck in mycorrhizal ecology. Here, we aimed to apply 454 sequencing - providing a new level of descriptive power - to assess the AMF diversity in a boreonemoral forest.
   454 sequencing reads of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of Glomeromycota were assigned to sequence groups by blast searches against a custom-made annotated sequence database.
   We detected 47 AMF taxa in the roots of 10 plant species in a 10 x 10 m plot, which is almost the same as the number of plant species in the whole studied forest. There was a significant difference between AMF communities in the roots of forest specialist plant species and in the roots of habitat generalist plant species. Forest plant species hosted 22 specialist AMF taxa, and the generalist plants shared all but one AMF taxon with forest plants, including globally distributed generalist fungi. These AMF taxa that have been globally recorded only in forest ecosystems were significantly over-represented in the roots of forest plant species.
   Our findings suggest that partner specificity in AM symbiosis may occur at the level of ecological groups, rather than at the species level, of both plant and fungal partners.

AB Population connectivity plays significant roles on both evolutionary and ecological time-scales; however, quantifying the magnitude and pattern of exchange between populations of marine organisms is hindered by the difficulty of tracking the trajectory and fate of propagules. We explored biophysical correlates of population substructure to determine how well pelagic larval duration (PLD) correlates with population genetic estimates of connectivity in a sample of 300 published studies drawn pseudo-randomly from about 1600 hits on electronic searches. In direct contrast to the general expectation of a strong correlation, we find that average PLD is poorly correlated (r(2) < 0.1) with genetic structure (F-ST). Furthermore, even this weak correlation is anchored by non-pelagic dispersal, because removal of the zero PLD class (direct developers) from the analysis resulted in a non-significant relationship between FST and PLD. For species in which minimum, maximum, and mean PLDs were available, it is noteworthy that both minimum and maximum PLDs are better correlated with FST than the mean larval duration, which has been used in all such previous studies. A 3-way ANCOVA reveals that genetic marker class (allozymes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial DNA sequences), as opposed to habitat or swimming ability, explain most of the variation in F-ST (F = 7.113, df = 2, p = 0.001), with higher values Of FST obtained from mtDNA than with either microsatellites or allozymes (which were not significantly different). Our meta-analysis refutes recent reviews and conventional wisdom that PLD is a good predictor of the magnitude of gene flow and geographic scale of population structure in marine systems.

AB Much research has focused on identifying species that are susceptible to extinction following ecosystem fragmentation, yet even those species that persist in fragmented habitats may have fundamentally different ecological roles than conspecifics in unimpacted areas. Shifts in trophic role induced by fragmentation, especially of abundant top predators, could have transcendent impacts on food web architecture and stability, as well as ecosystem function. Here we use a novel measure of trophic niche width, based on stable isotope ratios, to assess effects of aquatic ecosystem fragmentation on trophic ecology of a resilient, dominant, top predator. We demonstrate collapse in trophic niche width of the predator in fragmented systems, a phenomenon related to significant reductions in diversity of potential prey taxa. Collapsed niche width reflects a homogenization of energy flow pathways to top predators, likely serving to destabilize remnant food webs and render apparently resilient top predators more susceptible to extinction through time.

AB Nutrient loading to coastal bay ecosystems is of a similar magnitude as that to deeper, river-fed estuaries, yet our understanding of the eutrophication process in these shallow systems lags far behind. In this synthesis, we focus on one type of biotic feedback that influences eutrophication patterns in coastal bays-the important role of primary producers in the 'coastal filter'. We discuss the 2 aspects of plant-mediated nutrient cycling as eutrophication induces a shift in primary producer dominance: (1) the fate of nutrients bound in plant biomass, and (2) the effects of primary producers on biogeochemical processes that influence nutrient retention. We suggest the following generalizations as eutrophication proceeds in coastal bays: (1) Long-term retention of recalcitrant dissolved and particulate organic matter will decline as seagrasses are replaced by algae with less refractory material. (2) Benthic grazers buffer the early effects of nutrient enrichment, but consumption rates will decline as physico-chemical conditions stress consumer populations. (3) Mass transport of plant-bound nutrients will increase because attached perennial macrophytes will be replaced by unattached ephemeral algae that move with the water. (4) Denitrification will be an unimportant sink for N because primary producers typically outcompete bacteria for available N, and partitioning of nitrate reduction will shift to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium in later stages of eutrophication. In tropical/subtropical systems dominated by carbonate sediments, eutrophication will likely result in a positive feedback where increased sulfate reduction and sulfide accumulation in sediments will decrease P adsorption to Fe and enhance the release of P to the overlying water.

AB As phloem feeders and major vectors of plant viruses, aphids are important pests of agricultural and horticultural crops worldwide. The processes of aphid settling and reproduction on plants therefore have a direct economic impact, and a better understanding of these events may lead to improved management strategies. Aphids are also important model organisms in the analysis of population differentiation and speciation in animals, and new ideas on plant utilization influence our understanding of the mechanisms generating biological diversity. Recent research suggests that the dominant cues controlling plant preference and initiation of reproduction are detected early during the stylet penetration process, well before the nutrient supply (phloem) is contacted. Aphids regularly puncture cells along the stylet pathway and ingest cytosolic samples, and the cues stimulating settling and parturition likely are metabolites present in peripheral (nonvascular) plant cells. We discuss these findings and their implications for aphid evolution and management.

AB An adaptive landscape concept outlined by G.G. Simpson constitutes the major conceptual bridge between the fields of micro- and macroevolutionary study. Despite some important theoretical extensions since 1944, this conceptual bridge has been ignored in many empirical studies. In this article, we review the status of theoretical work and emphasize the importance of models for peak movement. Although much theoretical work has been devoted to evolution on stationary, unchanging landscapes, an important new development is a focus on the evolution of the landscape itself. We also sketch an agenda of empirical issues that is inspired by theoretical developments.

AB Root development is remarkably sensitive to variations in the supply and distribution of inorganic nutrients in the soil. Here we review examples of the ways in which nutrients such as N, P, K and Fe can affect developmental processes such as root branching, root hair production, root diameter, root growth angle, nodulation and proteoid root formation. The nutrient supply can affect root development either directly, as a result of changes in the external concentration of the nutrient, or indirectly through changes in the internal nutrient status of the plant. The direct pathway results in developmental responses that are localized to the part of the root exposed to the nutrient supply; the indirect pathway produces systemic responses and seems to depend on long-distance signals arising in the shoot. We propose the term `trophomorphogenesis' to describe the changes in plant morphology that arise from variations in the availability or distribution of nutrients in the environment. We discuss what is currently known about the mechanisms of external and internal nutrient sensing, the possible nature of the long-distance signals and the role of hormones in the trophomorphogenic response.

AB Parasitism is one of the most successful modes of life displayed by living organisms, as measured by how often it evolved and how many parasitic species are presently in existence. Studying the diversity of parasites is particularly relevant because sympatric diversification may be important in some parasite taxa, and because of the opportunity for independent tests of evolutionary hypotheses in the many separate lineages in which parasitism evolved. Our incomplete knowledge of existing parasite species-the result of a range of phenomena that includes inadequate sampling effort or the lumping of different cryptic species under one name-is not always a major obstacle for the study of parasite diversity. Patterns in the diversity of parasites may be associated with either host or parasite characteristics. The distribution of parasite diversity among host taxa does not simply reflect the species diversity of the hst taxa themselves; life history and ecological traits of hosts appear to play important roles. These may determine the likelihood that hosts are colonized by parasite species over evolutionary time. It is not yet clear whether some host traits also favor intrahost speciation and diversification of parasites, and the formation of new parasite species. Certain features of parasites may also be associated with speciation and diversification. Only parasite body size has received much attention; the patterns observed are not greatly different form those of free-living species, with small-bodied parasite taxa being more speciose than related large-bodied taxa. Epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproductive rate of parasites, or R-0, can also generate predictions regarding the distribution or evolution of parasite diversity. For instance, parasite taxa characterized by high R-0 values may be more speciose than related taxa with lower values of R0; such predictions remain untested. Large-scale biogeographical patterns of diversity have only been well studied for metazoan parasites of marine fish; for these parasites, latitudinal have only been well studied for metazoan parasites of marine fish; for these parasites, latitudinal patterns can be explained by effects of temperature on speciation rates and epidemiological variables, though other causes are possible. The emphasis for future research must shift from pattern description to the elucidation of the processes responsible for the structure and diversity of parasite faunas. A better integration of ecological and historical (or phylogenetic) approaches to the study of parasite diversity should make this objective possible.

AB Landscape ecology and metapopulation ecology share a common interest in developing measures that describe the structure of heterogeneous landscapes, but the specific aim in metapopulation ecology is to construct measures that help predict the dynamics of species with information about the structure of fragmented landscapes. The amount of habitat that individuals in a metapopulation have access to can be divided into four components, the amount of habitat in the present habitat parch (A(i)), the amount of connected habitat in other patches available via migration (Gamma(i)), the amount of presented habitat in the present patch after time period Delta t(A(i)'). and the amount of linked habitat in other patches after time period Delta t(Gamma(i)'). Deterministic threshold conditions for metapopulation persistence in patch networks can be approximated with these quantities. For instance, in a version of the Levins model with er;tinction risk proportional to the inverse of patch area and colonization probability proportional to patch connectivity, the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence is given by <(Gamma A)over bar> +Var(Gamma A)/<(Gamma A)over bar> > e/c, where e and c are the species-specific extinction and colonization parameters. I conjecture that with measures A' and Gamma' the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence can be extended to dynamic landscapes, in which all or part of population turnover is caused by turnover in the habitat patches themselves. The measures of habitat availability described in this paper can be used to rank dissimilar fragmented landscapes in terms of their capacity to support a viable metapopulation.

AB Interactions among predators can a have substantial effect on the total impact of the predator complex. We investigated the interaction between foliar-foraging (Coccinella septempunctata) and ground-foraging (Harpalus pennsylvanicus) predators of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in a series of laboratory and field experiments. The intensity and direction of the interaction were determined by comparing the combined and individual impacts of both predators.
   In a laboratory mesocosm, the combined predation rate of both predators was nearly double the sum of their individual predation rates. The mechanism for the interaction was the aphid "dropping" behavior elicited by C. septempunctata, which rendered the aphids susceptible to predation by H. pennsylvanicus on the ground. The strength of the synergistic interaction increased with increasing prey density. The interaction between the predators was also demonstrated in both open and closed field cages where the combined impact of the two predators on aphid population growth was significantly greater than the sum of their individual impacts.
   These results indicate that the importance of ground-foraging predators in agroecosystems may need to be reevaluated and that positive interactions between predators must be considered in models predicting the impact of multiple predator complexes.

AB The generality of relationships between soil net nitrogen (N) mineralization, aboveground N cycling, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) for temperate forest ecosystems is unclear. It is also not known whether these variables and their relationships differ between evergreen and deciduous forests, or across soil types. To address these questions we compiled data on annual rates of in situ net N mineralization and ANPP for 16 conifer and 34 hardwood forests, including plantations and natural stands on a range of soils at six locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota, USA. For 31 natural stands, 48 stands with native species (including plantations), and all data, ANPP increased linearly with annual net N mineralization rates. Native evergreen conifer and two deciduous hardwood types (oaks and mesic hardwoods) followed similar patterns in this regression, indicating common functional relationships at the ecosystem level. The relationship of N mineralization and ANPP differed between finer textured Alfisol soils and sandier Entisols, with higher ANPP at any given N mineralization level in Alfisols. A multiple regression of N mineralization on soil texture (percentage silt plus clay), litterfall N, and mean annual temperature explained 81% of the variance in annual N mineralization for natural stands, and a multiple regression of ANPP on soil texture and annual N mineralization rate explained 83% of the variance in ANPP.
   Naturally regenerated forest types differed in mean annual net N mineralization, litterfall N, and ANPP, and all were greater in oaks than in mesic hardwoods or conifers, respectively. However, differences among the 50 stands and six locations were largely a result of differences in soils and stand origin. For all natural hardwood stands, ANPP and N mineralization were greater on fine-textured Alfisols than on sandy Entisols. For evergreen conifers, ANPP and N mineralization were greater in plantations on Alfisols than in natural stands on Histosols, Entisols, or Spodosols. Hardwood and evergreen conifer stands did not differ significantly in ANPP or N mineralization on comparable soils and stand origin: they differed neither as plantations on Alfisols nor as natural stands on Entisols. This suggests that observed average differences among natural forest types in ANPP and N mineralization resulted largely from variation in their distribution on differing soils, and not from feedback effects on N mineralization or differing productivity per available N.
   These data suggest that, at a regional scale, at least half of the variation in ANPP can be attributed to variation in annual N mineralization. Both ANPP and N mineralization differ more strongly with soil type/parent material than with forest type; ANPP at any given level of N mineralization is higher on silty/loamy Alfisols than on sandy Entisols, Histosols, or Spodosols, but not different for coniferous and broad-leaved deciduous species. There is no indication of N saturation of ANPP within the range of natural N availability in these forests.

AB A global primary productivity and phytogeography model is described. The model represents the biochemical processes of photosynthesis and the dependence of gas exchange on stomatal conductance, which in turn depends on temperature and soil moisture. Canopy conductance controls soil water loss by evapotranspiration. The assignment of nitrogen uptake to leaf layers is proportional to irradiance, and respiration and maximum assimilation rates depend on nitrogen uptake and temperature. Total nitrogen uptake is derived from soil carbon and nitrogen and depends on temperature. The long-term average annual carbon and hydrological budgets dictate canopy leaf area. Although observations constrain soil carbon and nitrogen, the distribution of vegetation types is not specified by an underlying map. Variables simulated by the model are compared to experimental results. These comparisons extend from biochemical processes to the whole canopy, and the comparisons are favorable for both current and elevated CO2 atmospheres. The model is used to simulate the global distributions of leaf area index and annual net primary productivity. These distributions are sufficiently realistic to demonstrate that the model is useful for analyzing vegetation responses to global environmental change.

AB Diverse, severe, and location-specific impacts on agricultural production are anticipated with climate change. The last IPCC report indicates that the rise of CO2 and associated "greenhouse" gases could lead to a 1.4 to 5.8 A degrees C increase in global surface temperatures, with subsequent consequences on precipitation frequency and amounts. Temperature and water availability remain key factors in determining crop growth and productivity; predicted changes in these factors will lead to reduced crop yields. Climate-induced changes in insect pest, pathogen and weed population dynamics and invasiveness could compound such effects. Undoubtedly, climate- and weather-induced instability will affect levels of and access to food supply, altering social and economic stability and regional competiveness. Adaptation is considered a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production. Changes that will not radically modify the monoculture nature of dominant agroecosystems may moderate negative impacts temporarily. The biggest and most durable benefits will likely result from more radical agroecological measures that will strengthen the resilience of farmers and rural communities, such as diversification of agroecosytems in the form of polycultures, agroforestry systems, and crop-livestock mixed systems accompanied by organic soil management, water conservation and harvesting, and general enhancement of agrobiodiversity. Traditional farming systems are repositories of a wealth of principles and measures that can help modern agricultural systems become more resilient to climatic extremes. Many of these agroecological strategies that reduce vulnerabilities to climate variability include crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic management, water conservation and harvesting, etc. Understanding the agroecological features that underlie the resilience of traditional agroecosystems is an urgent matter, as they can serve as the foundation for the design of adapted agricultural systems. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events (hurricanes and droughts) in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to farms with increased levels of biodiversity. Field surveys and results reported in the literature suggest that agroecosystems are more resilient when inserted in a complex landscape matrix, featuring adapted local germplasm deployed in diversified cropping systems managed with organic matter rich soils and water conservation-harvesting techniques. The identification of systems that have withstood climatic events recently or in the past and understanding the agroecological features of such systems that allowed them to resist and/or recover from extreme events is of increased urgency, as the derived resiliency principles and practices that underlie successful farms can be disseminated to thousands of farmers via Campesino a Campesino networks to scale up agroecological practices that enhance the resiliency of agroecosystems. The effective diffusion of agroecological technologies will largely determine how well and how fast farmers adapt to climate change.

AB In 1985, Michael Soule asked, "What is conservation biology?" We revisit this question more than 25 years later and offer a revised set of core principles in light of the changed global context for conservation. Most notably, scientists now widely acknowledge that we live in a world dominated by humans, and therefore, the scientific underpinnings of conservation must include a consideration of the role of humans. Today's conservation science incorporates conservation biology into a broader interdisciplinary field that explicitly recognizes the tight coupling of social and natural systems. Emerging priorities include pursuing conservation within working landscapes, rebuilding public support, working with the corporate sector, and paying better attention to human rights and equity. We argue that in conservation, strategies must be promoted that simultaneously maximize the preservation of biodiversity and the improvement of human well-being.

AB Ecosystem productivity commonly increases asymptotically with plant species diversity, and determining the mechanisms responsible for this well-known pattern is essential to predict potential changes in ecosystem productivity with ongoing species loss. Previous studies attributed the asymptotic diversity-productivity pattern to plant competition and differential resource use (e.g., niche complementarity). Using an analytical model and a series of experiments, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that host-specific soil microbes can be major determinants of the diversity-productivity relationship in grasslands. In the presence of soil microbes, plant disease decreased with increasing diversity, and productivity increased nearly 500%, primarily because of the strong effect of density-dependent disease on productivity at low diversity. Correspondingly, disease was higher in plants grown in conspecific-trained soils than heterospecific-trained soils (demonstrating host-specificity), and productivity increased and host-specific disease decreased with increasing community diversity, suggesting that disease was the primary cause of reduced productivity in species-poor treatments. In sterilized, microbe-free soils, the increase in productivity with increasing plant species number was markedly lower than the increase measured in the presence of soil microbes, suggesting that niche complementarity was a weaker determinant of the diversity-productivity relationship. Our results demonstrate that soil microbes play an integral role as determinants of the diversity-productivity relationship.

AB Terrestrial biodiversity is dominated by plants and the herbivores that consume them, and they are one of the major conduits of energy flow up to higher trophic levels. Here, we address the processes that have generated the spectacular diversity of flowering plants (> 300,000 species) and insect herbivores (likely > 1 million species). Long-standing macroevolutionary hypotheses have postulated that reciprocal evolution of adaptations and subsequent bursts of speciation have given rise to much of this biodiversity. We critically evaluate various predictions based on this coevolutionary theory. Phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral states has revealed evidence for escalation in the potency or variety of plant lineages' chemical defenses; however, escalation of defense has been moderated by tradeoffs and alternative strategies (e. g., tolerance or defense by biotic agents). There is still surprisingly scant evidence that novel defense traits reduce herbivory and that such evolutionary novelty spurs diversification. Consistent with the coevolutionary hypothesis, there is some evidence that diversification of herbivores has lagged behind, but has nevertheless been temporally correlated with that of their host-plant clades, indicating colonization and radiation of insects on diversifying plants. However, there is still limited support for the role of host-plant shifts in insect diversification. Finally, a frontier area of research, and a general conclusion of our review, is that community ecology and the long-term evolutionary history of plant and insect diversification are inexorably intertwined.

AB The scientific literature contains numerous descriptions of observed and potential effects of global climate change on species and ecosystems. In response to anticipated effects of climate change, conservation organizations and government agencies are developing "adaptation strategies" to facilitate the adjustment of human society and ecological systems to altered climate regimes. We reviewed the literature and climate-change adaptation plans that have been developed in United States, Canada, England, Mexico, and South Africa and found 16 general adaptation strategies that relate directly to the conservation of biological diversity. These strategies can be grouped into four broad categories: land and water protection and management; direct species management; monitoring and planning; and law and policy. Tools for implementing these strategies are similar or identical to those already in use by conservationists worldwide (land and water conservation, ecological restoration, agrienvironment schemes, species translocation, captive propagation, monitoring, natural resource planning, and legislation/regulation). Although our review indicates natural resource managers already have many tools that can be used to address climate-change effects, managers will likely need to apply these tools in novel and innovative ways to meet the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change.

AB There is general acknowledgement that both the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex are implicated in reinforcement-guided decision making, and emotion and social behaviour. Despite the interest that these areas generate in both the cognitive neuroscience laboratory and the psychiatric clinic, ideas about the distinctive contributions made by each have only recently begun to emerge. This reflects an increasing understanding of the component processes that underlie reinforcement-guided decision making, such as the representation of reinforcement expectations, the exploration, updating and representation of action values, and the appreciation that choices are guided not just by the prospect of reward but also by the costs that action entails. Evidence is emerging to suggest that the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex make distinct contributions to each of these aspects of decision making.

AB Compared with the other major nutrients, phosphorus is by far the least mobile and available to plants in most soil conditions. Although phosphorus is abundant in soils in both organic and inorganic forms, it is frequently a major or even the prime limiting factor for plant growth. The bioavailability of soil inorganic phosphorus in the rhizosphere varies considerably with plant species, nutritional status of soil and ambient soil conditions. To circumvent phosphorus deficiency, phosphate- solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) could play an important role in supplying phosphate to plants in a more environmentally-friendly and sustainable manner. The solubilization of phosphatic compounds by naturally abundant PSM is very common under in vitro conditions; the performance of PSM in situ has been contradictory. The variability in the performance has thus greatly hampered the large-scale application of PSM in sustainable agriculture. Numerous reasons have been suggested for this, but none of them have been conclusively investigated. Despite the variations in their performance, PSM are widely applied in agronomic practices in order to increase the productivity of crops while maintaining the health of soils. This review presents the results of studies on the utilization of PSM for direct application in agriculture under a wide range of agro-ecological conditions with a view to fostering sustainable agricultural intensification in developing countries of the tropics and subtropics.

AB The genetic divergence time between two species varies substantially across the genome, conveying important information about the timing and process of speciation. Here we develop a framework for studying this variation and apply it to about 20 million base pairs of aligned sequence from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and more distantly related primates. Human-chimpanzee genetic divergence varies from less than 84% to more than 147% of the average, a range of more than 4 million years. Our analysis also shows that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred less than 6.3 million years ago and probably more recently, conflicting with some interpretations of ancient fossils. Most strikingly, chromosome X shows an extremely young genetic divergence time, close to the genome minimum along nearly its entire length. These unexpected features would be explained if the human and chimpanzee lineages initially diverged, then later exchanged genes before separating permanently.

AB Historically, six small lakes in southwestern British Columbia each contained a sympatric species pair of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These pairs consisted of a 'benthic' and 'limnetic' species that had arisen postglacially and, in four of the lakes, independently. Sympatric sticklebacks are considered biological species because they are morphologically, ecologically and genetically distinct and because they are strongly reproductively isolated from one another. The restricted range of the species pairs places them at risk of extinction, and one of the pairs has gone extinct after the introduction of an exotic catfish. In another lake, Enos Lake, southeastern Vancouver Island, an earlier report suggested that its species pair is at risk from elevated levels of hybridization. We conducted a detailed morphological analysis, as well as genetic analysis of variation at five microsatellite loci for samples spanning a time frame of 1977 to 2002 to test the hypothesis that the pair in Enos Lake is collapsing into a hybrid swarm. Our morphological analysis showed a clear breakdown between benthics and limnetics. Bayesian model-based clustering indicated that two morphological clusters were evident in 1977 and 1988, which were replaced by 1997 by a single highly variable cluster. The most recent 2000 and 2002 samples confirm the breakdown. Microsatellite analysis corroborated the morphological results. Bayesian analyses of population structure in a sample collected in 1994 indicated two genetically distinct populations in Enos Lake, but only a single genetic population was evident in 1997, 2000, and 2002. In addition, genetic analyses of samples collected in 1997, 2000, and 2002 showed strong signals of 'hybrids'; they were genetically intermediate to parental genotypes. Our results support the idea that the Enos Lake species pair is collapsing into a hybrid swarm. Although the precise mechanism(s) responsible for elevated hybridization in the lake is unknown, the demise of the Enos Lake species pair follows the appearance of an exotic crayfish, Pascifasticus lenisculus, in the early 1990s.

AB 1. Society benefits immeasurably from rivers. Yet over the past century, humans have changed rivers dramatically, threatening river health. As a result, societal well-being is also threatened because goods and services critical to human society are being depleted.
   2. 'Health' - shorthand for good condition (e.g. healthy economy, healthy communities) - is grounded in science yet speaks to citizens.
   3. Applying the concept of health to rivers is a logical outgrowth of scientific principles, legal mandates, and changing societal values.
   4. Success in protecting the condition, or health, of rivers depends on realistic models of the interactions of landscapes, rivers, and human actions.
   5. Biological monitoring and biological endpoints provide the most integrative view of river condition, or river health. Multimetric biological indices are an important and relatively new approach to measuring river condition.
   6. Effective multimetric indices depend on an appropriate classification system, the selection of metrics that give reliable signals of river condition, systematic sampling protocols that measure those biological signals, and analytical procedures that extract relevant biological patterns.
   7. Communicating results of biological monitoring to citizens and political leaders is critical if biological monitoring is to influence environmental policies.
   8. Biological monitoring is essential to identify biological responses to human actions. By using the results to describe the condition, or health, of rivers and their adjacent landscapes and to diagnose causes of degradation, we can develop restoration plans, estimate the ecological risks associated with land use plans in a watershed, or select among alternative development options to minimize river degradation.

AB The Hawaiian Islands form as the Pacific Plate moves over a 'hot spot' in the earth's mantle where magma extrudes through the crust to build huge shield volcanos. The islands subside and erode as the plate carries them to the north-west, eventually to become coral atolls and seamounts. Thus islands are ordered linearly by age, with the oldest islands in the north-west (e.g. Kauai at 5.1 Ma) and the youngest in the south-east (e.g. Hawaii at 0.43 Ma). K-Ar estimates of the date of an island's formation provide a maximum age for the taxa inhabiting the island. These ages can be used to calibrate rates of molecular change under the following assumptions: (i) K-Ar dates are accurate; (ii) tree topologies show that derivation of taxa parallels the timing of island formation; (iii) populations do not colonize long after island emergence; (iv) the coalescent point for sister taxa does not greatly predate the formation of the colonized younger island; (v) saturation effects and (vi) among-lineage rate variation are minimal or correctable; and (vii) unbiased standard errors of distances and regressions can be estimated from multiple pairwise comparisons. We use the approach to obtain overall corrected rate calibrations for: (i) part of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in Hawaiian drepanidines (0.016 sequence divergence/Myr); (ii) the Yp1 gene in Hawaiian Drosophila (0.019/Myr Kambysellis et al. 1995); and (iii) parts of the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA and tRNA(val) in Laupala crickets (0.024-0.102/Myr, Shaw 1996). We discuss the reliability of the estimates given the assumptions (i-vii) above and contrast the results with previous calibrations of Adh in Hawaiian Drosophila and chloroplast DNA in lobeliods.

AB Ecomorphological analyses that search for patterns of association between morphological and prey-use data sets will have a greater chance of understanding the causal relationships between form and diet if the morphological variables used have known consequences for feeding performance. We explore the utility of fish body size, mouth gape and jaw-lever mechanics in predicting patterns of prey use in two very different communities of fishes, Caribbean coral reef fishes, and species of the Centrarchidae that live in Lake Opinicon, Ontario. In spite of major differences in the spectrum of potential prey available, the centrarchids of Lake Opinicon show dietary transitions during ontogeny that are very similar to those seen among and within species of Caribbean groupers (Serranidae). The transition from small zooplankton to intermediate sized invertebrates and ultimately to fishes appears to be very general in ram-suction feeding fishes and is probably driven largely by the constraints of mouth size on prey capture ability. The jaw-lever systems for mouth opening and closing represent direct trade-offs for speed and force of jaw movement. The ratio of in-lever to out-lever in the opening system changes during ontogeny in bluegill, indicating that the mechanics and kinematics of jaw movement may change as well. Among 34 species of Caribbean reef fishes, biting species had jaw-closing ratios that favored force translation, while species that employ rapid-strike ram-suction had closing ratios that enhanced speed of closing and mouth opening ratios that favored a more rapid expansion of the mouth during the strike. We suggest that when prey are categorized into functional groups, reflecting the specific performance features that are important in capturing and handling them, and the differences among habitats in the available prey resource are taken into account, general patterns can be found in morphology-diet relations that cross phylogenetic boundaries.

AB Interspecific competition driving divergence in adaptive radiation has not previously been tested experimentally. Natural selection on a morphologically variable species of stickle-back fish was contrasted in the presence and absence of a close relative. Selection was nondirectional when the target species was alone, whereas addition of the second species favored individuals most different from it morphologically and ecologically. Disproportionately severe competition between similar phenotypes indicates frequency-dependent selection, verifying a crucial element of theory of competition and character divergence. The findings help resolve outstanding debates on the ecological causes of diversification and the evolutionary consequences of competitive interactions.

AB Systems linking people and nature, known as social-ecological systems, are increasingly understood as complex adaptive systems. Essential features of these complex adaptive systems - such as nonlinear feedbacks, strategic interactions, individual and spatial heterogeneity, and varying time scales - pose substantial challenges for modeling. However, ignoring these characteristics can distort our picture of how these systems work, causing policies to be less effective or even counterproductive. In this paper we present recent developments inmodeling social-ecological systems, illustrate some of these challenges with examples related to coral reefs and grasslands, and identify the implications for economic and policy analysis.

AB Variability of above-ground net primary production (ANPP) of arid to sub-humid ecosystems displays a closer association with precipitation when considered across space (based on multiyear averages for different locations) than through time (based on year-to-year change at single locations). Here, we propose a theory of controls of ANPP based on four hypotheses about legacies of wet and dry years that explains space versus time differences in ANPP-precipitation relationships. We tested the hypotheses using 16 long-term series of ANPP. We found that legacies revealed by the association of current-versus previous-year conditions through the temporal series occur across all ecosystem types from deserts to mesic grasslands. Therefore, previous-year precipitation and ANPP control a significant fraction of current-year production. We developed unified models for the controls of ANPP through space and time. The relative importance of current-versus previous-year precipitation changes along a gradient of mean annual precipitation with the importance of current-year PPT decreasing, whereas the importance of previous-year PPT remains constant as mean annual precipitation increases. Finally, our results suggest that ANPP will respond to climate-change-driven alterations in water availability and, more importantly, that the magnitude of the response will increase with time.

AB Global change is challenging plant and animal populations with novel environmental conditions, including increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, warmer temperatures, and altered precipitation regimes. In some cases, contemporary or "rapid" evolution can ameliorate the effects of global change. However, the direction and magnitude of evolutionary responses may be contingent upon interactions with other community members that also are experiencing novel environmental conditions. Here, we examine plant adaptation to drought stress in a multigeneration experiment that manipulated aboveground-belowground feedbacks between plants and soil microbial communities. Although drought stress reduced plant growth and accelerated plant phenologies, surprisingly, plant evolutionary responses to drought were relatively weak. In contrast, plant fitness in both drought and nondrought environments was linked strongly to the rapid responses of soil microbial community structure to moisture manipulations. Specifically, plants were most fit when their contemporary environmental conditions (wet vs. dry soil) matched the historical environmental conditions (wet vs. dry soil) of their associated microbial community. Together, our findings suggest that, when faced with environmental change, plants may not be limited to "adapt or migrate" strategies; instead, they also may benefit from association with interacting species, especially diverse soil microbial communities, that respond rapidly to environmental change.

AB Genomic scans of multiple populations often reveal marker loci with greatly increased differentiation between populations. Often this differentiation coincides in space with contrasts in ecological factors, forming a genetic-environment association (GEA). GEAs imply a role for local adaptation, and so it is tempting to conclude that the strongly differentiated markers are themselves under ecologically based divergent selection, or are closely linked to loci under such selection. Here, we highlight an alternative and neglected explanation: intrinsic (i.e. environment-independent) pre- or post-zygotic genetic incompatibilities rather than local adaptation can be responsible for increased differentiation. Intrinsic genetic incompatibilities create endogenous barriers to gene flow, also known as tension zones, whose location can shift over time. However, tension zones have a tendency to become trapped by, and therefore to coincide with, exogenous barriers due to ecological selection. This coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can occur easily in spatially subdivided populations, even if the loci involved are unlinked. The result is that local adaptation explains where genetic breaks are positioned, but not necessarily their existence, which can be best explained by endogenous incompatibilities. More precisely, we show that (i) the coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can easily occur even when ecological selection is weak; (ii) when environmental heterogeneity is fine-grained, GEAs can emerge at incompatibility loci, but only locally, in places where habitats and gene pools are sufficiently intermingled to maintain linkage disequilibria between genetic incompatibilities, local-adaptation genes and neutral loci. Furthermore, the association between the locally adapted and intrinsically incompatible alleles (i.e. the sign of linkage disequilibrium between endogenous and exogenous loci) is arbitrary and can form in either direction. Reviewing results from the literature, we find that many predictions of our model are supported, including endogenous genetic barriers that coincide with environmental boundaries, local GEA in mosaic hybrid zones, and inverted or modified GEAs at distant locations. We argue that endogenous genetic barriers are often more likely than local adaptation to explain the majority of Fst-outlying loci observed in genome scan approaches - even when these are correlated to environmental variables.

AB Water temperatures are increasing in many streams and rivers throughout the US. We analyzed historical records from 40 sites and found that 20 major streams and rivers have shown statistically significant, long-term warming. Annual mean water temperatures increased by 0.009-0.077 degrees C yr(-1), and rates of warming were most rapid in, but not confined to, urbanizing areas. Long-term increases in stream water temperatures were typically correlated with increases in air temperatures. If stream temperatures were to continue to increase at current rates, due to global warming and urbanization, this could have important effects on eutrophication, ecosystem processes such as biological productivity and stream metabolism, contaminant toxicity, and loss of aquatic biodiversity.

AB In urban and suburban areas, stormwater runoff is a primary stressor on surface waters. Conventional urban stormwater drainage systems often route runoff directly to streams and rivers, thus exacerbating pollutant inputs and hydrologic disturbance, and resulting in the degradation of ecosystem structure and function. Decentralized stormwater management tools, such as low impact development (LID) or water sensitive urban design (WSUD), may offer a more sustainable solution to stormwater management if implemented at a watershed scale. These tools are designed to pond, infiltrate, and harvest water at the source, encouraging evaporation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and re-use of stormwater. While there are numerous demonstrations of WSUD practices, there are few examples of widespread implementation at a watershed scale with the explicit objective of protecting or restoring a receiving stream. This article identifies seven major impediments to sustainable urban stormwater management: (1) uncertainties in performance and cost, (2) insufficient engineering standards and guidelines, (3) fragmented responsibilities, (4) lack of institutional capacity, (5) lack of legislative mandate, (6) lack of funding and effective market incentives, and (7) resistance to change. By comparing experiences from Australia and the United States, two developed countries with existing conventional stormwater infrastructure and escalating stream ecosystem degradation, we highlight challenges facing sustainable urban stormwater management and offer several examples of successful, regional WSUD implementation. We conclude by identifying solutions to each of the seven impediments that, when employed separately or in combination, should encourage widespread implementation of WSUD with watershed-based goals to protect human health and safety, and stream ecosystems.

AB Landscape connectivity can be viewed from two perspectives that could be considered as extremes of a gradient: functional connectivity (refers to how the behavior of a dispersing organism is affected by landscape structure and elements) and structural connectivity (depends on the spatial configuration of habitat patches in the landscape like vicinity or presence of barriers). Here we argue that dispersal behavior changes with landscape configuration stressing the evolutionary dimension that has often been ignored in landscape ecology. Our working hypothesis is that the functional grain of resource patches in the landscape is a crucial factor shaping individual movements, and therefore influencing landscape connectivity. Such changes are likely to occur on the short-term (some generations). We review empirical studies comparing dispersal behavior in landscapes differing in their fragmentation level, i.e., with variable resource grain. We show that behavioral variation affecting each of the three stages of the dispersal process (emigration, displacement or transfer in the matrix, and immigration) is indeed likely to occur according to selective pressures resulting from changes in the grain of the landscape (mortality or deferred costs). Accordingly, landscape connectivity results from the interaction between the dispersal behavior of individuals and the grain of each particular landscape. The existence of this interaction requires that connectivity estimates (being based on individual-based models, least cost distance algorithms, and structural connectivity metrics or even Euclidian distance) should be carefully evaluated for their applicability with respect to the required level of precision in species-specific and landscape information.

AB The importance of interspecific competition is a highly controversial and unresolved issue for community ecology in general, and for phytophagous insects in particular. Recent advancements, however, in our understanding of indirect (plant- and enemy-mediated) interactions challenge the historical paradigms of competition. Thus, in the context of this rapidly developing field, we re-evaluate the evidence for interspecific competition in phytophagous insects using a meta-analysis of published studies. Our analysis is specifically designed to test the assumptions underlying traditional competition theory, namely that competitive interactions are symmetrical, necessitate spatial and temporal co-occurrence, and increase in intensity as the density, phylogenetic similarity, and niche overlap of competing species increase. Despite finding frequent evidence for competition, we found very little evidence that plant-feeding insects conform to theoretical predictions for interspecific competition. Interactions were highly asymmetrical, similar in magnitude within vs. between feeding guilds (chewers vs. sap-feeders), and were unaffected by the quantity of resources removed (% defoliation). There was mixed support for the effects of phylogeny, spatial/temporal separation, and the relative strength of intra- vs. interspecific competition. Clearly, a new paradigm that accounts for indirect interactions and facilitation is required to describe how interspecific competition contributes to the organization of phytophagous insect communities, and perhaps to other plant and animal communities as well.

AB Here we present a meta-analytic approach to analyzing Population interactions across the North Atlantic Ocean. We assembled all available biomass time series for a well-documented predator-prey couple, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), to test whither the temporal dynamics of these populations are consistent with the "top-down" or the "bottom-up" hypothesis. Eight out of nine regions showed inverse correlations of cod and shrimp biomass supporting the "top-down" view. Exceptions occurred only close to the southern range limits of both species, Random-effects meta-analysis showed that shrimp biomass was strongly negatively related to cod biomass, but not to Ocean temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, cod biomass was positively related to ocean temperature. The strength of the cod-shrimp relationship. however, declined with increasing mean temperature.
   These results show that changes in predator Populations can have strong effects on prey populations in oceanic food webs, and that the strength of these interactions may be sensitive to changes in mean ocean temperature. This means that the effects of overfishing in the ocean cascade down to lower trophic levels, as has been shown previously for lakes and coastal seas. In order to further investigate these processes, we establish a methodological framework to analyze species interactions from time series data.

AB Sexes play different roles in reproduction and the adaptive significance of the often remarkably distinct morphologies of adult males and females is documented frequently. Yet, in most vertebrates, the sexes are nearly identical in morphology during early development and undergo highly divergent growth to achieve different adult sizes. The mechanisms that enable the virtually genetically identical sexes to have such divergent growth are not well understood. Of special interest are the constraints that a shared gene pool imposes on sex-specific modifications of growth and the ways that males and females overcome these constraints in response to divergent selection pressures. Recent studies show that the rapid evolution of sex-specific developmental regulators and modifiers can produce sexual dimorphism in size whilst maintaining the integrity of the developmental program that is shared between the sexes.

AB Over the last three decades, many studies have attempted to explain forager diets by using optimal diet theory (ODT). Despite some obvious successes, the utility of this theory remains controversial. We reviewed the results of 134 studies of optimal diet theory to test hypotheses on factors that can explain variation in the ability of ODT to predict diets and diet shifts in response to changes in prey availability. Our major conclusion is that while ODT has generally worked well for foragers that feed on immobile prey, the theory often failed to predict the diets of foragers that attack mobile prey. We found only mixed support for the hypothesis that the theory works better when the study scenario more closely fits the assumptions of the model. Contrary to our a priori predictions, forager types (invertebrate versus ectothermic vertebrate versus endothermic vertebrate) did not differ in their likelihood of corroborating ODT. Two explanations for why optimal diet theory does not work well with mobile prey are that studies on mobile prey often lack information on key parameters that are required to rigorously test ODT, and that with mobile prey, variations among prey in vulnerability (encounter rate and capture success) are often more important than variation in predator active choice in determining predator diets.

ID NINO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; EL; CALIFORNIA; PATTERNS; BIRDS
AB Progress toward understanding factors that Limit abundances of migratory birds, including climate change, has been difficult because these species move between diverse Locations, often on different continents. For black-throated blue warblers (Dendroica caerulescens), demographic rates in both tropical winter quarters and north temperate breeding grounds varied with fluctuations in the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Adult survival and fecundity were Lower in El Nino years and higher in La Nina years. Fecundity, in turn, was positively correlated with subsequent recruitment of new individuals into winter and breeding populations. These findings demonstrate that migratory birds can be affected by shifts in global climate patterns and emphasize the need to know how events throughout the annual cycle interact to determine population size.

TI Loss-of-function mutations in a calcium-channel alpha(1)-subunit gene in
   Xp11.23 cause incomplete X-linked congenital stationary night blindness
SO NATURE GENETICS

ID B-WAVE; ELECTRORETINOGRAM; EXPRESSION; SUBTYPE; DNA
AB X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a recessive non-progressive retinal disorder characterized by night blindness, decreased visual acuity, myopia, nystagmus and strabismus(1-3). Two distinct clinical entities of X-linked CSNB have been proposed(4). Patients with complete CSNB show moderate to severe myopia, undetectable rod function and a normal cone response, whereas patients with incomplete CSNB show moderate myopia to hyperopia and subnormal but measurable rod and cone function. The electrophysiological and psychophysical features of these clinical entities suggest a defect in retinal neurotransmission. The apparent clinical heterogeneity in X-linked CSNB reflects the recently described genetic heterogeneity in which the locus for complete CSNB (CSNB1) was mapped to Xp11.4, and the locus for incomplete CSNB (CSNB2) was refined within Xp11.23 (ref. 5). A novel retina-specific gene mapping to the CSNB2 minimal region was characterized and found to have similarity to voltage-gated L-type calcium channel alpha(1)-subunit genes. Mutation analysis of this new alpha(1)-subunit gene, CACNA1F, in 20 families with incomplete CSNB revealed six different mutations that are all predicted to cause premature protein truncation. These findings establish that loss-of-function mutations in CACNA1F cause incomplete CSNB, making this disorder an example of a human channelopathy of the retina.

AB The phytoplankton community of eutrophic shallow lakes is often dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria of the family Oscillatoriaceae. In this paper we follow two independent approaches to show that this situation is likely to be one of two alternative stable states of the algal community. First we analyze patterns of cyanobacterial dominance observed in the field, and show that these patterns imply that the algal community is a hysteretic system with two alternative equilibria. Then, we construct a simple competition model to show that hysteresis should in fact be expected from differences in physiology between cyanobacteria and algae. The basic mechanism is that cyanobacteria are the superior competitors under conditions of low light, but also promote such conditions, as they can cause a higher turbidity per unit of phosphorus than other algae. This mechanism of hysteresis offers an explanation for the resistance of cyanobacteria dominance in shallow lakes to restoration efforts by means of nutrient reduction.

TI Invasibility of species rich communities in riparian zones

LA English
DT Article
ID VEGETATION
AB Invasibility of riparian plant communities was estimated by the percentage of alien species found along the Adour River (Southwest France) and along Lookout Creek, McKenzie River, and Willamette River (Central Cascades, Oregon, U.S.A.). At the patch scale, the invasibilities of riparian plant communities were compared between one exceptionally rich site of the Adour River and patches selected in the Hob and Dungeness watersheds (Olympic Peninsula, Washington, U.S.A.). Alien species represented 24% of 1396 species for the Adour and 30% of 851 species for the McKenzie. They represented 24% of 148 species for the Hob drainage and 28% of 200 species for the Dungeness drainage. Similar trends were found along the Adour River and along the McKenzie River for changes in total number of species per site and in percentages of alien species per site. These trends may be related to the intermediate disturbance regimes and tot he physical structure of the riparian corridors. Climatic and human factors are also involved in these longitudinal changes. Positive linear relationships were found between the total number of species and the percentage of aliens observed in each site. At the patch scale, most of the sampled communities contained alien species. Although mature vegetative patches appeared to be invasible, young communities contained more alien species than older ones. For entire corridors, a positive linear relationship was found between total species richness and percentage of alien species in each patch type for the richest site of the Adour River. This may be partially explained by landscape features considered in a successional context. We suggest the use of empirical rules, and stress the importance of riparian systems for monitoring the conservation of local and regional species pools are suggested.

AB Most models for plant litter decomposition link degradation rates to measures of climate or litter composition, rather than directly to microbial activity. We developed a model based on the premise that saprotrophic microbial communities maximize their productivity by optimizing their allocation of resources in the production of extracellular carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus-acquiring enzymes. In this model, enzyme activity indicators are used to estimate decomposition rates and to assess relative N and P availability. This approach may facilitate estimation of decomposition rates in the field and improve ecological forecasting.

AB The use of phylogenies in ecology is increasingly common and has broadened our understanding of biological diversity. Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriatemetric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information.
   Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify 'anchor' representatives: for alpha-diversity metrics these are PD (Faith's phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics. The guide outlined herein will help researchers navigate the current jungle of indices.

AB Global change, especially land-use intensification, affects human well-being by impacting the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (multifunctionality). However, whether biodiversity loss is a major component of global change effects on multifunctionality in real-world ecosystems, as in experimental ones, remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed biodiversity, functional composition and 14 ecosystem services on 150 agricultural grasslands differing in land-use intensity. We also introduce five multifunctionality measures in which ecosystem services were weighted according to realistic land-use objectives. We found that indirect land-use effects, i.e. those mediated by biodiversity loss and by changes to functional composition, were as strong as direct effects on average. Their strength varied with land-use objectives and regional context. Biodiversity loss explained indirect effects in a region of intermediate productivity and was most damaging when land-use objectives favoured supporting and cultural services. In contrast, functional composition shifts, towards fast-growing plant species, strongly increased provisioning services in more inherently unproductive grasslands.

AB Nutrient resorption in plants influences nutrient availability and cycling and is a key process in biogeochemical models. Improved estimates of resorption parameters are needed for predicting long-term primary productivity and for improving such models. Currently, most models assume a value of 50% resorption for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and lack resorption data for other nutrients and for specific vegetation types. We provide global estimates of resorption efficiencies and nutrient concentrations for carbon (C), N, and P and the first global-scale estimates for essential nutrients such as potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). We also examine leaf mass loss during senescence (LML) globally and for different plant types, thus defining a mass loss correction factor (MLCF) needed to quantify unbiased resorption values. We used a global meta-analysis of 86 studies and; similar to 1000 data points across climates for green and senesced leaves in six plant types: ferns, forbs, graminoids, conifers, and evergreen and deciduous woody angiosperms. In general, N and P resorption differed significantly from the commonly used global value of 50% (62.1%, 64.9%, respectively; P, 0.05). Ca, C, and Mg showed lower average resorptions of 10.9%, 23.2%, and 28.6%, respectively, while K had the highest resorption, at 70.1%. We also found that resorption of all nutrients except Ca depended on leaf nutrient-status; globally, C, N, P, K, and Mg showed a decrease in resorption with increased nutrient status. On average, global leaf mass loss was 24.2%. Overall, our resorption data differ substantially from commonly assumed values and should help improve ecological theory and biogeochemical and land-surface models.

AB We performed a meta-analysis of published studies and long-term monitoring data sets to evaluate the effects of dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis), two of the world's most problematic biological invaders, on the biogeochemistry, flora, and fauna of lakes and rivers across North America and Eurasia. Dreissenid effects were structured along two distinct energy pathways. For the pelagic-profundal pathway, large mean reductions in phytoplankton (-35% to -78%) and zooplankton (-40% to -77%) biomass occurred and were dependent on habitat type. The largest effects were found in rivers, followed by littoral and pelagic habitats in lakes. In contrast, benthic energy pathways within littoral habitats of lakes and rivers showed dramatic increases in mean benthic algal and macrophyte biomass (+170% to +180%), sediment-associated bacteria (about +2000%), non-dreissenid zoobenthic biomass (+160% to +210%), and total zoobenthic biomass, which includes dreissenid mussel soft tissues (+2000%). Our study quantifies the remarkable ability of these invasive mussels to shift aquatic food webs and energy flow from pelagic-profundal to benthic littoral energy pathways, and it provides a basis for forecasting their impacts in diverse freshwater ecosystems. Our meta-analysis approach was a powerful tool for moving beyond the idiosyncrasies of individual case studies and may be equally powerful for assessing impacts of other biological invaders.

AB 1. Natural biogeochemical processes and diverse communities of aquatic biota regulate freshwater quantity and quality in ways that are not sufficiently acknowledged nor appreciated by the water resources management community. The establishment and enforcement of environmental flow requirements offer promising means to improve and care for these critical environmental services. This Special Issue provides new insights and novel techniques to determine, protect and restore ecologically and socially sustainable flow regimes, and thereby help achieve the water-related goals of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.
   2. Whilst alteration of flow, sediment, organic matter and thermal regimes interact to reduce biological diversity and the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems - and thereby degrade the properties and ecological services most valued by humans - environmental flows' left in rivers, or restored to developed rivers, will sustain many ecological and societal values. The success of river protection and rehabilitation / restoration depends upon understanding and accurately modelling relationships between hydrological patterns, fluvial disturbance and ecological responses in rivers and flood-plains.
   3. This Special Issue presents new analytical and modelling approaches to support the development of hydro-ecological models and environmental flow standards at multiple spatial scales - applicable to all rivers in any economic and societal setting. Examples include the new framework Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) founded on hydrological classification and gradient analysis; ecological trait analysis; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Bayesian Decision Networks; and Integrated Basin Flow Assessment (IBFA).
   4. Advances in the allocation of flood flows along the River Murray in Australia, an Ecosystems Function Model (HEC-EFM) for the Bill Williams River restoration programme in Arizona ( U. S. A), the European Water Framework Directive, and improved management of hydroelectric dams demonstrate the potential for significant ecological recovery following partial restoration of natural river flow regimes. 5. Based on contributions to this Special Issue, the action agenda of the 2007 Brisbane Declaration on environmental flows and the wider literature, we propose an invigorated global research programme to construct and calibrate hydro-ecological models and to quantify the ecological goods and services provided by rivers in contrasting hydro-climatic settings across the globe. A major challenge will be to find acceptable ways to manage rivers for multiple uses. Climate change intensifies the urgency. Environmental flows help to preserve the innate resilience of aquatic ecosystems, and thereby offer the promise of improved sustainability and wellbeing for people as well as for ecosystems.

AB Ecologists can be overwhelmed by the number of metrics available to quantify landscape structure. Clarification of interrelationships and redundancy is needed to guide metric selection and interpretation for the purpose of landscape monitoring. In this study we identified independent components of class- and landscape-level structure in multiple landscapes in each of three large and geographically disjunct study areas. We used FRAGSTATS and principal components analysis (PCA) to identify independent components of landscape structure, and cluster analysis to group the components. We then calculated the universality, strength, and consistency of the identified landscape structure components. At the class-level we identified 24 independent configuration components. Seven of these components were nearly universal and consistent in interpreted meaning. At the landscape-level there were 17 independent structure components. Eight of these components were universal and consistent. These results indicate that there are consistent combinations of metrics that universally describe the major attributes of landscape structure at the class- and lands cape-levels.

AB Agricultural intensification poses a serious threat to biodiversity as a consequence of increased land-use intensity, decreased landscape heterogeneity and reduced habitat diversity. Although there is interest in the preservation of total species richness of an agricultural landscape (gamma diversity), the effects of intensification have been assessed primarily by species richness at a local scale (alpha diversity). This ignores species richness between local communities (beta diversity), which is an important component of total species richness.
   In this study, measures of land-use intensity, landscape structure and habitat diversity were related to gamma, alpha and beta diversity of wild bees (Apoidea), carabid beetles (Carabidae), hoverflies (Syrphidae), true bugs (Heteroptera) and spiders (Araneae) within 16 local communities in 24 temperate European agricultural landscapes.
   The total landscape species richness of all groups was most strongly affected by increased proximity of semi-natural habitat patches. Bees also decreased in landscapes with a high intensity of farmland management, demonstrating additive effects of both factors.
   Separating total species diversity into components, the decrease in total species richness could be attributed primarily to a decrease in species diversity between local communities. Species richness of the local communities of all investigated groups decreased with increasing land-use intensity and, in the case of spiders, decreasing proximity of the semi-natural habitat patches.
   The effect of increased habitat diversity appeared to be of secondary importance to total species richness but caused a shift in the relative contribution of alpha and beta diversity towards the latter.
   Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that the effects of agricultural change operate at a landscape level and that examining species diversity at a local level fails to explain the total species richness of an agricultural landscape. The coincidence of patterns of beta diversity with those of gamma diversity emphasizes that such information is of crucial importance for the implementation and evaluation of restoration programmes aiming to restore sustainable countryside diversity. As local extinction processes in highly fragmented landscapes shape biodiversity, priority should be given to the conservation of diverse agricultural landscape remnants in Europe.

AB Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is an important index of hydrologic budgets at different spatial scales and is a critical variable for understanding regional biological processes. It is often an important variable in estimating actual evapotranspiration (AET) in rainfall-runoff and ecosystem modeling. However, PET is defined in different ways in the literature and quantitative estimation of PET with existing mathematical formulas produces inconsistent results. The objectives of this study are to contrast six commonly used PET methods and quantify the long term annual PET across a physiographic gradient of 36 forested watersheds in the southeastern United States. Three temperature based (Thornthwaite, Hamon, and Hargreaves-Samani) and three radiation based (Turc, Makkink, and Priestley-Taylor) PET methods are compared. Long term water balances (precipitation, streamflow, and AET) for 36 forest dominated watersheds from 0.25 to 8213 km(2) in size were estimated using associated hydrometeorological and land use databases. The study found that PET values calculated from the six methods were highly correlated (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.85 to 1.00). Multivariate statistical tests, however, showed that PET values from different methods were significantly different from each other. Greater differences were found among the temperature based PET methods than radiation based PET methods. In general, the Priestley-Taylor, Turc, and Hamon methods performed better than the other PET methods. Based on the criteria of availability of input data and correlations with AET values, the Priestley-Taylor, Turc, and Hamon methods are recommended for regional applications in the southeastern United States.

AB The study of interspecific variation in plant ecological strategies has revealed suites of traits associated with leaf life span and with maximum levels of water deficit (measured as leaf water potentials). Here, the relationship between these sets of traits was examined in a study of 20 co-occurring chaparral shrubs that vary in leaf habit, rooting depth, and regeneration strategies. Leaf life span (LLS) and minimum seasonal water potentials (psi(min)) were not significantly correlated, suggesting that they are associated with independent aspects of functional variation. Multiple regression analyses of a large suite of physiological, functional, and phenological attributes in relation to these two "anchor traits" supported this view. Short LLS was significantly associated with high specific leaf area, hi-h carbon assimilation and leaf nitrogen (per mass), early onset of growth, and a multistemmed, short stature growth form. This suite of traits was also associated with opportunistic regeneration following physical disturbance. Area-based gas exchange was not tightly linked to LLS. Low psi(min) (i.e., greater water deficit) was associated with high wood density, small vessel diameters, thin twigs, low leaf area: sapwood area ratios, and early onset of leaf abscission. Among the evergreen species, this suite of traits was most characteristic of post-fire seeders, which depend on high drought tolerance for post-fire regeneration of seedlings. Plant stature was the only trait associated with both the LLS axis and the psi(min) axis of functional variation. A two-dimensional strategy space, approximately defined by LLS and psi(min), can be used to distinguish contrasting strategies of drought tolerance vs. avoidance, and alternative modes of regeneration following fire and other disturbance. This conceptual scheme illustrates the strength of a trait-based approach to defining plant strategies in relation to resource availability and disturbance.

   INSERTIONS; SPECIATION; DELETIONS; SELECTION; VIRILIS
AB Newly emerging data from genome sequencing projects suggest that gene duplication, often accompanied by genetic map changes, is a common and ongoing feature of all genomes. This raises the possibility that differential expansion/contraction of various genomic sequences may be just as important a mechansim of phenotypic evolution as changes at the nucleotide level. However, the population-genetic mechanisms responsible for the success vs. failure of newly arisen gene duplicates are poorly understood. We examine the influence of various aspects of gene structure, mutation rates, degree of linkage, and population size (N) on the joint fate of a newly arisen duplicate gene and its ancestral locus. Unless there is active selection against duplicate genes, the probability of permanent establishment of such genes is usually no less than 1/(4N) (half of the neutral expectation), and it call be orders of magnitude greater if neofunctionalizing mutations are common. The probability of a map change (reassignment of a key function of air ancestral locus to a new chromosomal location) induced by a newly arisen duplicate is also generally >1/(4N) for unlinked duplicates, suggesting that. recurrent gene duplication and alternative silencing may be a common mechanism for generating microchromosomal rearrangements responsible for postreproductive isolating barriers among species. Relative to subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization is expected to become a progressively more important mechanism of duplicate-gene preservation in populations with increasing size. However, even in large populations, the probability of neofunctionalization scales only with the square of the selective advantage. Tight linkage also influences the probability of duplicate-gene preservation, increasing the probability of subfunctionalization but decreasing the probability of neofunctionalization.

AB During the mid-1900s, most of the island of Puerto Rico was deforested, but a shift in the economy from agriculture to small industry beginning in the 1950s resulted in the abandonment of agricultural lands and recovery of secondary forest. This unique history provides an excellent opportunity to study secondary forest succession and suggest strategies for tropical forest restoration. To determine the pattern of secondary succession, we describe the woody vegetation in 71 abandoned pastures and forest sites in four regions of Puerto Rico. The density, basal area, aboveground biomass, and species richness of the secondary forest sites were similar to those of the old growth forest sites (>80 yr) after approximately 40 years. The dominant species that colonized recently abandoned pastures occurred over a broad elevational range and are widespread in the neotropics. The species richness of Puerto Rican secondary forests recovered rapidly, but the species composition was quite different in comparison with old growth forest sites, suggesting that enrichment planting will be necessary to restore the original composition. Exotic species were some of the most abundant species in the secondary forest, but their long-term impact depended on life history characteristics of each species. These data demonstrate that one restoration strategy for tropical forest in abandoned pastures is simply to protect the areas from fire, and allow natural regeneration to produce secondary forest. This strategy will be most effective if remnant forest (i.e., seed sources) still exist in the landscape and soils have not been highly degraded. Patterns of forest recovery also suggest strategies for accelerating natural recovery by planting a suite of generalist species that are common in recently abandoned pastures in Puerto Rico and throughout much of the neotropics.

ID SIMILARITY; RICHNESS
AB A popular way to suggest a regional influence on local species diversity has been to plot local versus regional diversity. The form of these curves has been interpreted as evidence for or against "community saturation" due to species interactions. This interpretation, however, is unwarranted. Using the concepts of alpha, beta and gamma diversity, I show that local-regional richness curves are determined by the way total diversity is partitioned between its alpha and beta components, which itself is a matter of scale. Changing the scale of the local community amounts to changing the scale at which the heterogeneity of the interactions between organisms and their environment manifests itself, and hence the balance between alpha and beta diversity. Community saturation may occur because of physical limitations, but there are no theoretical grounds for the belief that species interactions set an absolute upper limit to diversity at any scale. A distinction between different meanings of the concept of "saturation" is proposed to clarify this issue. I argue that the challenge now is to understand the relationship between alpha and beta diversity at multiple scales, and the processes that determine it.

AB The consequences of permanent loss of species or species groups from plant communities are poorly understood, although there is increasing evidence that individual species effects are important in modifying ecosystem properties. We conducted a field experiment in a New Zealand perennial grassland ecosystem, creating artificial vegetation gaps and imposing manipulation treatments on the reestablishing vegetation. Treatments consisted of continual removal of different subsets or "functional groups" of the flora. We monitored vegetation and soil biotic and chemical properties over a 3-yr period.
   Plant competitive effects were clear: removal of the C-3 grass Lolium perenne L. enhanced vegetative cover, biomass, and species richness of both the C-4 grass and dicotyledonous weed functional groups and had either positive or negative effects on the legume Trifolium repens L., depending on season. Treatments significantly affected total plant cover and biomass; in particular, C-4 grass removal reduced total plant biomass in summer, because no other species had appropriate phenology. Removal of C-4 grasses reduced total root biomass and drastically enhanced overall shoot-to-root biomass ratios. Aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) was not strongly affected by any treatment, indicating strong compensatory effects between different functional components of the flora.
   Removing all plants often negatively affected three further trophic levels of the decomposer functional food web: microflora, microbe-feeding nematodes, and predaceous nematodes. However, as long as plants were present, we did not find strong effects of removal treatments, NPP, or plant biomass on these trophic groupings, which instead were most closely related to spatial variation in soil chemical properties across all trophic levels, soil N in particular. Larger decomposer organisms, i.e., Collembola and earthworms, were unresponsive to any factor other than removal of all plants, which reduced their populations. We also considered five functional components of the soil biota at finer taxonomic levels: three decomposer components (microflora, microbe-feeding nematodes, predaceous nematodes) and two herbivore groups (nematodes and arthropods). Taxa within these five groups responded to removal treatments, indicating that plant community composition has multitrophic effects at higher levels of taxonomic resolution. The principal ordination axes summarizing community-level data for different trophic groups in the soil food web were related to each other in several instances, but the plant ordination axes were only significantly related to those of the soil microfloral community. There were time lag effects, with ordination axes of soil-associated herbivorous arthropods and microbial-feeding nematodes being related to ordination axes representing plant community structure at earlier measurement dates. Taxonomic diversity of some soil organism groups was linked to plant removals or to plant diversity. For herbivorous arthropods, removal of C-4 grasses enhanced diversity; there were negative correlations between plant and arthropod diversity, presumably because of negative influences of C-4 species in the most diverse treatments. There was evidence of lag relationships between diversity of plants and that of the three decomposer groups, indicating multitrophic effects of altering plant diversity.
   Relatively small effects of plant removal on the decomposer food web were also apparent in soil processes regulated by this food web. Decomposition rates of substrates added to soils showed no relationship with treatment, and rates of CO2 evolution from the soil were only adversely affected when all plants were removed. Few plant functional-group effects on soil nutrient dynamics were identified. Although some treatments affected temporal variability (and thus stability) of soil biotic properties (particularly CO2 release) throughout the experiment, there was no evidence of destabilizing effects of plant removals.
   Our data provide evidence that permanent exclusion of plant species from the species pool can have important consequences for overall vegetation composition in addition to the direct effects of vegetation removal, and various potential effects on both the above- and belowground subsystems. The nature of many of these effects is driven by which plant species are lost from the system, which depends on the various attributes or traits of these species.

AB Recent experiments have provided some evidence that loss of biodiversity may impair the functioning and sustainability of ecosystems. However, we still lack adequate theories and models to provide robust generalizations, predictions, and interpretations for such results. Here I present a mechanistic model of a spatially structured ecosystem in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient, This model shows that plant species richness does not necessarily enhance ecosystem processes, but it identifies two types of factors that could generate such an effect: (i) complementarity among species in the space they occupy below ground and (ii) positive correlation between mean resource-use intensity and diversity. In both cases, the model predicts that plant biomass, primary productivity. and nutrient retention all increase with diversity, similar to results reported in recent field experiments. These two factors, however, have different implications for the understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, The model also shows that the effect of species richness on productivity or other ecosystem processes is masked by the effects of physical environmental parameters on these processes. Therefore, comparisons among sites cannot reveal it, unless abiotic conditions are very tightly; controlled. Identifying and separating out the mechanisms behind ecosystem responses to biodiversity should become the focus of future experiments.

Too often, we ignore the fact that most phenotypic traits change throughout growth and development of individual plants, and that rates of growth and development are highly variable. Plants growing in different environments are likely to grow at different rates, and will be of different sizes and stages of development at a particular age. When we compare plants as a function of plant size or developmental stage, as well as a function of age, we broaden our understanding of phenotypic variation between plants.

AB Continent-scale biogeography has been extensively studied in soils and marine systems, but little is known about biogeographical patterns in non-marine sediments. We used barcode pyrosequencing to quantify the effects of local geochemical properties and geographic distance for bacterial community structure and membership, using sediment samples from 15 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (41670 km apart). Bacterial communities were surprisingly diverse, and distinct from soil communities. Four of 26 phyla detected were dominant: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, albeit 20.2% of sequences were unclassified at the phylum level. As previously observed in acidic soil, pH was the dominant factor influencing alkaline sediment community structure, phylotype richness and phylogenetic diversity. In contrast, archaeal communities were less affected by pH. More geographically distant sites had more dissimilar communities (r = 0.443, P = 0.030). Variance partitioning analysis showed that geographic distance (historical contingencies) contributed more to bacterial community variation (12.2%) than any other factor, although the environmental factors explained more variance when combined (28.9%). Together, our results show that pH is the best predictor of bacterial community structure in alkaline sediments, and confirm that both geographic distance and chemical factors govern bacterial biogeography in lake sediments.

AB Species spatial distributions are the result of population demography, behavioral traits, and species interactions in spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions. Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site-by-species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis. Doing so allows one to deal with spatially explicit ecological models of beta diversity in a biogeographic context through the multiscale analysis of spatial patterns in original species data tables, including spatial characterization of fitted or residual variation from environmental models. We summarize here the recent progress for specifying spatial features through spatial weighting matrices and spatial eigenfunctions in order to define spatially constrained or scale-explicit multivariate analyses. Through a worked example on tropical tree communities, we also show the potential of the overall approach to identify significant residual spatial patterns that could arise from the omission of important unmeasured explanatory variables or processes.

AB Phylogenies are important for addressing various biological questions such as relationships among species or genes, the origin and spread of viral infection and the demographic changes and migration patterns of species. The advancement of sequencing technologies has taken phylogenetic analysis to a new height. Phylogenies have permeated nearly every branch of biology, and the plethora of phylogenetic methods and software packages that are now available may seem daunting to an experimental biologist. Here, we review the major methods of phylogenetic analysis, including parsimony, distance, likelihood and Bayesian methods. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses and provide guidance for their use.

AB Interactions between natural selection and environmental change are well recognized and sit at the core of ecology and evolutionary biology. Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco- evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer-algae chemostats; alewife-zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife-zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco- evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco- evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems.

AB The extent of larval dispersal on coral reefs has important implications for the persistence of coral reef metapopulations, their resilience and recovery from an increasing array of threats, and the success of protective measures. This article highlights a recent dramatic increase in research effort and a growing diversity of approaches to the study of larval retention within (self-recruitment) and dispersal among (connectivity) isolated coral reef populations. Historically, researchers were motivated by alternative hypotheses concerning the processes limiting populations and structuring coral reef assemblages, whereas the recent impetus has come largely from the need to incorporate dispersal information into the design of no-take marine protected area (MPA) networks. Although the majority of studies continue to rely on population genetic approaches to make inferences about dispersal, a wide range of techniques are now being employed, from small-scale larval tagging and paternity analyses, to large-scale biophysical circulation models. Multiple approaches are increasingly being applied to cross-validate and provide more realistic estimates of larval dispersal. The vast majority of empirical studies have focused on corals and fishes, where evidence for both extremely local scale patterns of self-recruitment and ecologically significant connectivity among reefs at scales of tens of kilometers (and in some cases hundreds of kilometers) is accumulating. Levels of larval retention and the spatial extent of connectivity in both corals and fishes appear to be largely independent of larval duration or reef size, but may be strongly influenced by geographic setting. It is argued that high levels of both self-recruitment and larval import can contribute to the resilience of reef populations and MPA networks, but these benefits will erode in degrading reef environments.

AB The higher ranks of the class Actinobacteria were proposed and described in 1997, At each rank, the taxa were delineated from each other solely on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogenetic clustering and taxon-specific 16S rRNA signature nucleotides. In the past 10 years, many novel members have been assigned to this class while, at the same time, some members have been reclassified. The new 16S rRNA gene sequence information and the changes in phylogenetic positions of some taxa influence decisions about which 16S rRNA nucleotides to define as taxon-specific. As a consequence, the phylogenetic relationships of Actinobacteria at higher levels may need to be reconstructed. Here, we present new 16S rRNA signature nucleotide patterns of taxa above the family level and indicate the affiliation of genera to families. These sets replace the signatures published in 1997. In addition, Actinopolysporineae subord. nov. and Actinopolysporaceae fam. nov. are proposed to accommodate the genus Actinopolyspora, Kineosporiineae subord. nov. and Kineosporiaceae fam. nov. are proposed to accommodate the genera Kineococcus, Kineosporia and Quadrisphaera, Beutenbergiaceae fam. nov. is proposed to accommodate the genera Beutenbergia, Georgenia and Salana and Cryptosporangiaceae fam. nov. is proposed to accommodate the genus Cryptosporangium. The families Nocardiaceae and Gordoniaceae are proposed to be combined in an emended family Nocardiaceae. Emended descriptions are also proposed for most of the other higher taxa.

AB The orchid family is renowned for its enormous diversity of pollination mechanisms and unusual]), high occurrence of non-rewarding flowers compared to other plant families. The mechanisms of deception in orchids include generalized food deception, food-deceptive floral mimicry, brood-site initiation,. shelter imitation, pseudoantagonism, rendezvous attraction and sexual deception. Generalized food deception is the most common mechanism (reported in 38 genera) followed by sexual deception (18 genera). floral deception in orchids has been intensively studied since Darwin, but the evolution of non-rewarding flowers still presents a major puzzle for evolutionary biology. The two principal hypotheses as to how, deception could increase fitness in plants are (i) reallocation of resources associated with reward production to flowering and seed production, and (ii) higher levels of cross-pollination due to pollinators visiting fewer flowers oil non-rewarding plants, resulting in more outcrossed progeny and more efficient pollen export. Biologists have also tried to explain why deception is overrepresented in the orchid family. These explanations include: (i) efficient removal and deposition of pollinaria from orchid flowers in a single pollinator visit, thus obviating the need for rewards to entice multiple visits from pollinators; (iii) efficient transport of orchid pollen, thus requiring less reward-induced pollinator constancy; (iii) low-density populations in many, orchids, thus limiting the learning of associations of floral phenotypes and rewards by pollinators; (iv) packaing of pollen in pollinaria with limited carry-over from flower 91 to flower, thus increasing the risks of geitonogamous self-pollination when pollinators visit many flowers on rewarding plants. All of these general and orchid-specific hypotheses are difficult to reconcile with the well-established pattern for rewardlessness to result in low pollinator visitation rates and consequently low levels of fruit production. Arguments that deception evolves because rewards are costly are particularly problematic in that small amounts of nectar are unlikely to have a significant effect on the energy budget of orchids, and because reproduction in orchids is often severely pollen-, rather than resource-limited. Several recent experimental studies have shown that deception promotes cross-pollination, but it remains unknown whether actual outcrossing rates are generally higher in deceptive orchids. Our review of the literature shows that there is currently no evidence that deceptive orchids carry higher levels of genetic load (all indirect measure of outcrossing rate) than their rewarding counterparts. Cross-pollination does, however, result in dramatic increases in seed quality in almost all orchids and has the potential to increase pollen export (by reducing pollen discounting). We suggest that floral deception is particularly beneficial, because of its promotion of outcrossing, when pollinators are abundant, but that when pollinators are consistently rare, selection may favour a nectar reward or a shift to autopollination. Given that nectar-rewardlessness is likely to have been the ancestral condition in orchids and yet is evolutionarily labile, more attention will need to be given to explanations as to why deception constitutes an 'evolutionarily stable strategy'.

TI River restoration

AB [1] River restoration is at the forefront of applied hydrologic science. However, many river restoration projects are conducted with minimal scientific context. We propose two themes around which a research agenda to advance the scientific basis for river restoration can be built. First, because natural variability is an inherent feature of all river systems, we hypothesize that restoration of process is more likely to succeed than restoration aimed at a fixed end point. Second, because physical, chemical, and biological processes are interconnected in complex ways across watersheds and across timescales, we hypothesize that restoration projects are more likely to be successful in achieving goals if undertaken in the context of entire watersheds. To achieve restoration objectives, the science of river restoration must include ( 1) an explicit recognition of the known complexities and uncertainties, ( 2) continued development of a theoretical framework that enables us to identify generalities among river systems and to ask relevant questions, ( 3) enhancing the science and use of restoration monitoring by measuring the most effective set of variables at the correct scales of measurement, ( 4) linking science and implementation, and ( 5) developing methods of restoration that are effective within existing constraints. Key limitations to river restoration include a lack of scientific knowledge of watershed-scale process dynamics, institutional structures that are poorly suited to large-scale adaptive management, and a lack of political support to reestablish delivery of the ecosystem amenities lost through river degradation. This paper outlines an approach for addressing these shortcomings.

   ANALYSIS; SIGNALING PATHWAYS
AB Transcript patterns elicited in response to attack reveal, at the molecular level, how plants respond to aggressors. These patterns are fashioned both by inflicted physical damage as well as by biological components displayed or released by the attacker. Different types of attacking organisms might therefore be expected to elicit different transcription programs in the host. Using a large-scale DNA microarray, we characterized gene expression in damaged as well as in distal Arabidopsis thaliana leaves in response to the specialist insect, Pieris rapae. More than 100 insect-responsive genes potentially involved in defense were identified, including genes involved in pathogenesis, indole glucosinolate metabolism, detoxification and cell survival, and signal transduction. Of these 114 genes, 111 were induced in Pieris feeding, and only three were repressed. Expression patterns in distal leaves were markedly similar to those of local leaves. Analysis of wild-type and jasmonate mutant plants, coupled with jasmonate treatment, showed that between 67 and 84% of Pieris-regulated gene expression was controlled, totally or in part, by the jasmonate pathway. This was correlated with increased larval performance on the coronatine insensitive1 glabrous1 (coi1-1 gl1) mutant. Independent mutations in COI1 and GL1 led to a faster larval weight gain, but the gl1 mutation had relatively little effect on the expression of the insect-responsive genes examined. Finally, we compared transcript patterns in Arabidopis in response to larvae of the specialist P. rapae and to a generalist insect, Spodoptera littoralis. Surprisingly, given the complex nature of insect salivary components and reported differences between species, almost identical transcript profiles were observed. This study also provides a robustly characterized gene set for the further investigation of plant-insect interaction.

AB Host-plant selection by phytophagous insects is largely determined by adult insects choosing the developmental location of offspring. Knowledge of natural selection leads to theoretical predictions about how adult behaviour might respond to host quality, the abundance of host-plants, adult egg-load, age and available search time, density-dependence, and stochastic effects. Debates about the value of simple adaptive models can only be settled by repeated testing and reformulation. The theoretical basis of adaptive host selection is quite strong, but several challenges remain. Models are lacking which are both general enough to be applicable to a wide rang of species, and easy to test. The role of variability in plant abundance and other stochastic forces requires clarification. Empirically, good field studies of the effect of host-plants on insect fitness are rare, but without them little progress can be made. The assessment of host-preference also requires attention. Quantitative tests of theory are rare, probably because general models do not encompass enough relevant natural history for each particular species. However much anecdotal and qualitative evidence seems to reflect adaptive predictions. A challenge for the future is to assess the adaptive value of particular mechanisms of host-selection, and to relate these to the predictions made in simple adaptive models.

AB Genetic variation at 20 microsatellite loci was surveyed to determine the evolutionary relationships and molecular biogeography of 20 different cattle populations from Africa, Europe and Asia. Phylogenetic reconstruction and multivariate analysis highlighted a marked distinction between humpless (taurine) and humped (zebu) cattle, providing strong support for a separate origin for domesticated zebu cattle. A molecular clock calculation using bison (Bison sp.) as an outgroup gave an estimated divergence time between the two subspecies of 610,000-850,000 years. Substantial differences in the distribution of alleles al 10 of these loci were observed between zebu and taurine cattle. These markers subsequently proved very useful for investigations of gene flow and admixture in African populations. When these data were considered in conjunction with previous mitochondrial and Y chromosomal studies, a distinctive male-mediated pattern of zebu genetic introgression was revealed. The introgression of zebu-specific alleles in African cattle afforded a high resolution perspective on the hybrid nature of African cattle populations and also suggested that certain West African populations of valuable disease-tolerant taurine cattle are under threat of genetic absorption by migrating zebu herds.

AB Canalization is the suppression of phenotypic variation. Depending on the causes of phenotypic variation, one speaks either of genetic or environmental canalization. Genetic canalization describes insensitivity of a character to mutations, and the insensitivity to environmental factors is called environmental canalization. Genetic canalization is of interest because it influences the availability of heritable phenotypic variation to natural selection, and is thus potentially important in determining the pattern of phenotypic evolution. In this paper a number of population genetic models are considered of a quantitative character under stabilizing selection. The main purpose of this study is to define the population genetic conditions and constraints for the evolution of canalization. Environmental canalization is modeled as genotype specific environmental variance. It is shown that stabilizing selection favors genes that decrease environmental variance of quantitative characters. However, the theoretical limit of zero environmental variance has never been observed. Of the many ways to explain this fact, two are addressed by our model. It is shown that a "canalization limit" is reached if canalizing effects of mutations are correlated with direct effects on the same character. This canalization limit is predicted to be independent of the strength of stabilizing selection, which is inconsistent with recent experimental data (Sterns et al. 1995). The second model assumes that the canalizing genes have deleterious pleiotropic effects. If these deleterious effects are of the same magnitude as all the other mutations affecting fitness very strong stabilizing selection is required to allow the evolution of environmental canalization. Genetic canalization is modeled as an influence on the average effect of mutations at a locus of other genes. It is found that the selection for genetic canalization critically depends on the amount of genetic variation present in the population. The more genetic variation, the stronger the selection for canalizing effects. All factors that increase genetic variation favor the evolution of genetic canalization (large population size, high mutation rate, large number of genes). If genetic variation is maintained by mutation-selection balance, strong stabilizing selection can inhibit the evolution of genetic canalization. Strong stabilizing selection eliminates genetic variation to a level where selection for canalization does not work anymore. It is predicted that the most important characters (in terms of fitness) are not necessarily the most canalized ones, if they are under very strong stabilizing selection (k > 0.2 V-e). The rate of decrease of mutational variance V-m is found to be less than 10% of the initial V-m. From this result it is concluded that characters with typical mutational variances of about 10(-3) V-e are in a metastable state where further evolution of genetic canalization is too slow to be of importance at a microevolutionary time scale.

AB Concerted action is needed to address public health issues raised by climate change. In this Review we discuss infections acquired through various routes (arthropod vector, rodent, water, food, and air) in view of a changing climate in Europe. Based on an extensive review of published work and expert workshops, we present an assessment of the infectious disease challenges: incidence, prevalence, and distribution are projected to shift in a changing environment. Due to the high level of uncertainty on the rate of climate change and its impact on infectious diseases, we propose to mount a proactive public health response by building an integrated network for environmental and epidemiological data. This network would have the capacity to connect epidemic intelligence and infectious disease surveillance with meteorological, entomological, water quality, remote sensing, and other data, for multivariate analyses and predictions. Insights from these analyses could then guide adaptation strategies and protect population health from impending threats related to climate change.

AB Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are becoming increasingly interested in networks as a framework to study plant-animal mutualisms within their ecological context. Although such focus on networks has brought about important insights into the structure of these interactions, relatively little is still known about the mechanisms behind these patterns.
   The aim in this paper is to offer an overview of the mechanisms influencing the structure of plant-animal mutualistic networks. A brief summary is presented of the salient network patterns, the potential mechanisms are discussed and the studies that have evaluated them are reviewed. This review shows that researchers of plant-animal mutualisms have made substantial progress in the understanding of the processes behind the patterns observed in mutualistic networks. At the same time, we are still far from a thorough, integrative mechanistic understanding. We close with specific suggestions for directions of future research, which include developing methods to evaluate the relative importance of mechanisms influencing network patterns and focusing research efforts on selected representative study systems throughout the world.

AB In this essay, I argue that the seemingly indestructible concept of the community as a local, interacting assemblage of species has hindered progress toward understanding species richness at local to regional scales. I suggest that the distributions of species within a region reveal more about the processes that generate diversity patterns than does the co-occurrence of species at any given point. The local community is an epiphenomenon that has relatively little explanatory power in ecology and evolutionary biology. Local coexistence cannot provide insight into the ecogeographic distributions of species within a region, from which local assemblages of species derive, nor can local communities be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin, maintenance, and regulation of species richness, either locally or regionally. Ecologists are moving toward a community concept based on interactions between populations over a continuum of spatial and temporal scales within entire regions, including the population and evolutionary processes that produce new species.

AB Although oxidative stress is a central topic in biochemical and medical research, the number of reports on its relevance in fife-history studies of non-human animals is still low. Information about oxidative stress in wild birds may help describe functional interactions among the components of life-history traits. Currently available evidence suggests that oxidative stress may impart an important physiological cost on longevity, reproduction, immune response or intense physical activity. Given the gaps in our present knowledge, it is still premature to attempt to draw definitive conclusions and basic questions (e.g. how is oxidative stress generated and how do organisms cope with it?) have vet to be fully explored under natural conditions. Therefore, caution is needed in developing hypotheses or drawing general conclusions until additional data become available to perform more rigorous comparative analyses.

AB Restoration ecology is a young academic field, but one with enough history to judge it against past and current expectations of the science's potential. The practice of ecological restoration has been identified as providing ideal experimental settings for tests of ecological theory; restoration was to be the 'acid test' of our ecological understanding. Over the past decade, restoration science has gained a strong academic foothold, addressing problems faced by restoration practitioners, bringing new focus to existing ecological theory and fostering a handful of novel ecological ideas. In particular, recent advances in plant community ecology have been strongly linked with issues in ecological restoration. Evolving models of succession, assembly and state-transition are at the heart of both community ecology and ecological restoration. Recent research on seed and recruitment limitation, soil processes, and diversity-function relationships also share strong links to restoration. Further opportunities may lie ahead in the ecology of plant ontogeny, and on the effects of contingency, such as year effects and priority effects. Ecology may inform current restoration practice, but there is considerable room for greater integration between academic scientists and restoration practitioners.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; phylum Glomeromycota) are ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite their acknowledged importance in ecology, most research on AMF has focused on effects on individual plant hosts, with more recent efforts aimed at the level of the plant community. Research at the ecosystem level is less prominent, but potentially very promising. Numerous human-induced disturbances (including global change and agro-ecosystem management) impinge on AMF functioning; hence study of this symbiosis from the ecosystem perspective seems timely and crucial. In this paper, I discuss four (interacting) routes via which AMF can influence ecosystem processes. These include indirect pathways (through changes in plant and soil microbial community composition), and direct pathways (effects on host physiology and resource capture, and direct mycelium effects). I use the case study of carbon cycling to illustrate the potentially pervasive influence of AMF on ecosystem processes. A limited amount of published research on AMF ecology is suited for direct integration into ecosystem studies (because of scale mismatch or ill-adaptation to the 'pools and flux' paradigm of ecosystem ecology); I finish with an assessment of the tools (experimental designs, response variables) available for studying mycorrhizae at the ecosystem scale.

AB The fate of carbon (C) in organisms, food webs, and ecosystems is to a major extent regulated by mass-balance principles and the availability of other key nutrient elements. In relative terms, nutrient limitation implies excess C, yet the fate of this C may be quite different in autotrophs and heterotrophs. For autotrophs nutrient limitation means less fixation of inorganic C or excretion of organic C, while for heterotrophs nutrient limitation means that more of ingested C will "go to waste" in the form of egestion or respiration. There is in general a mismatch between autotrophs and decomposers that have flexible but generally high C:element ratios, and consumers that have lower C:clement ratios and tighter stoichiometric regulation. Thus, C-use efficiency in food webs may be governed by the element ratios in autotroph biomass and tend to increase when C:element ratios in food approach those of consumers. This tendency has a strong bearing on the sequestration of C in ecosystems, since more C will be diverted to detritus entering soils or sediments when C-use efficiency is low due to stoichiometric imbalance. There will be a strong evolutionary pressure to utilize such excess C for structural and metabolic purposes. This article explores how these basic principles may regulate C sequestration on different scales in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

AB There is increasing recognition of the quantitative importance of metal accumulation from dietary pathways in different marine food webs. With a simple kinetic model requiring measurements of metal assimilation efficiency (AE), metal efflux rate and ingestion activity of the relevant animals, it is possible to predict the transfer (and potential biomagnification) of metals along diverse marine food chains. In this paper, food chain transfer in different marine food chains (planktonic and benthic) is reviewed, and any potential biomagnification of metals is predicted using the simple kinetic equation. It is well recognized that metal concentrations in animals are probably not related to the trophic level in the food chain, but some metals (Hg and Zn) may potentially be influenced by the numbers of trophic interactions involved. Depending on these different trophic interactions, the potential biomagnification of metals is influenced by metal assimilation or metal efflux rate or both. Metals may potentially be biomagnified in benthic food chains; principally, in those with gastropods as top predators, as they can efficiently sequester dietary metals. The biodiminution of metals (concentration decreases at a higher trophic level) in the classical marine planktonic food chain (phytoplankton to copepods to fish) is largely the result of the effective efflux of metals by the copepods and the very low assimilation of metals by marine fish. Although many past studies have considered the physico-chemical properties of metals in prey in controlling food chain transfer, it is suggested that the physiological and biochemical processes in the herbivore or predator should be emphasized in future studies. Also, the complicated metal-handling strategies found in different marine organisms clearly need to be appreciated.

AB Successful management of invasive weeds will require active attempts to prevent new introductions, vigilant detection of nascent populations and persistent efforts to eradicate the worst invaders. To achieve these objectives, invasion ecology offers five groups of complementary approaches. (i) Stochastic approaches allow probabilistic predictions about potential invaders based on initial population size, residence time and number of introduction attempts. (ii) Empirical taxon-specific approaches are based on previously documented invasions of particular taxa. (iii) Evaluations of the biological characters of non-invasive taxa and successful invaders give rise either to general or to habitat-specific screening procedures. (iv) Evaluation of environmental compatibility helps to predict whether a particular plant taxon can invade specific habitats. (v) Experimental approaches attempt to tease apart intrinsic and extrinsic factors underlying invasion success. An emerging theory of plant invasiveness based on biological characters has resulted in several rather robust predictions which are presented in this paper.

AB According to the Red Queen hypothesis-which states that interactions among species (such as hosts and parasites) lead to constant natural selection for adaptation and counter-adaptation-the disproportionate evolutionary success of parasites on common host genotypes leads to correlated selection for sexual reproduction(1-8) and local adaptation by the parasite population(9-14). Here we determined whether local adaptation is due to disproportionate infection of common host genotypes, and, if so, whether infection of common host genotypes is due to commonness per se, or some other aspect of these genotypes. In a reciprocal cross-inoculation experiment parasites occupying the same geographical area (sympatric) infected locally common host genotypes significantly more often than rare host genotypes, whereas parasites occupying separate geographical areas (allopatric) showed no such significant difference. A mixed source of parasites (containing F-1 hybrids) also showed no difference in infection between rare and common host genotypes. These results show that local adaptation results from parasite tracking of locally common host genotypes, and, as such, a necessary condition of the Red Queen hypothesis is met.

AB We discuss a framework for studying the evolution of morphology in insects, based on the concepts of "phenotypic plasticity" and "reaction norms." We illustrate this approach with the evolution of some of the most extreme morphologies in insects: exaggerated, sexually selected male ornaments and weapons, and elaborate social insect soldier castes. Most of these traits scale with body size, and these scaling relationships are often nonlinear. We argue that scaling relationships are best viewed as reaction norms, and that the evolution of exaggerated morphological traits results from genetic changes in the slope and/or shape of these scaling relationships. After reviewing literature on sexually selected and caste-specific structures, we suggest two possible routes to the evolution of exaggerated trait dimensions: (a) the evolution of steeper scaling relationship slopes and (b) the evolution of sigmoid or discontinuous scaling relationship shapes. We discuss evolutionary implications of these two routes to exaggeration and suggest why so many of the most exaggerated insect structures scale nonlinearly with body size. Finally, we review literature on insect development to provide a comprehensive picture of how scaling relationships arise and to suggest how they may be modified through evolution.

AB Few wetland studies from temperate North America have related either species richness or plant community composition to any direct measure of nutrient availability, or examined changes in species composition following experimental nutrient additions. Studies of wetlands in western Europe and of other terrestrial ecosystems in North America frequently show that nutrient enrichment leads to changes in species composition, declines in overall plant species diversity, and loss of rare and uncommon species. We therefore used an extensive literature survey and analysis of data on plant species composition, species richness, productivity or standing crop, and C:N:P stoichiometry in plant tissues and surface soils to draw conclusions about the nature of nutrient limitation in temperate North American bogs, fens, marshes, and swamps, and to infer their potential response to nutrient enrichment. We searched all major bibliographic data bases for studies containing such data (through March 1998) and added relevant data from our own ongoing research. We analyzed plant and soil data sets by wetland type and by wetland soil type, and the plant data set also by growth form.
   Existing studies appear to confirm common generalizations: (1) plant community type changes across broad nutrient gradients; (2) species richness declines as various indicators of nutrient availability increase beyond some threshold; and (3) rare and uncommon species are almost always associated with species-rich communities. However, (1) these generalizations do not always hold within community types; (2) for many community types, the threshold beyond which richness declines has not been established, and high or low diversity may occur below that threshold; and (3) the failure of many studies to include bryophytes precludes drawing strong conclusions about nutrient availability and diversity in peatlands.
   Marshes had significantly lower mean nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios in live tissue than other wetland types (bogs, fens, and swamps), which did not differ significantly from each other. Mean N:P ratios in live tissues were significantly higher in peatlands than in mineral-soil wetlands. Nitrogen:phosporus ratios in litter did not differ significantly between peatlands and mineral-soil wetlands but were higher than in live tissues. Among growth forms, the highest mean N:P ratios in live tissues occurred in bryophytes, and the lowest in vascular herbaceous species. Only bryophyte live tissues differed significantly from other growth forms; litter N:P ratios were not significantly different among growth forms.
   Average N:P ratios in surface soils were lower in marshes and swamps than in bogs and fens. Wetlands on mineral soils had lower average N:P ratios than wetlands on peat soils. Average surface soil N:P ratios rose sharply at high soil organic-matter contents (greater than or equal to 90%) and were generally greater than 16 at organic-matter concentrations above 20%.
   In combination, plant tissue and surface soil N:P ratios suggest that a large proportion of North American wetlands are either P limited or co-limited by N and P, especially those occurring on organic soils. Only marshes have N:P ratios in both live tissues and surface soils that consistently indicate N limitation, although soils data suggest that the majority of swamps are also N limited. Vascular herbaceous species appear to be N limited, but no pattern is apparent among other growth forms. Inferences drawn from N:P stoichiometry need to be verified by examining ecosystem response to experimental fertilization. High variances in plant and soil N:P ratios suggest that understanding nutrient limitation at both the community and individual-species level may be necessary to predict changes in species composition and richness with nutrient enrichment.

AB Vegetation, seed rain, seed germination, microclimate, and soil physical and chemical parameters were measured in a recently abandoned pasture and adjacent primary rain forest in southern Costa Rica. The goal of this study was to assess the importance of these factors in limiting forest regeneration in abandoned pastures. Seed rain of anima dispersed species decreased dramatically in the pasture >5 m from the forest/pasture edge; fewer wind dispersed seeds fell in the pasture than in the forest, but the difference was much less than for anima dispersed seeds. Percent seed germination of most species studied was similar in the forest and in pasture with grasses; seed germination was lower during the dry season in areas of pasture cleared of grasses. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and photon flux density (PFD) were much higher in the pasture than in the forest at 1 m above the ground. VPD and PFD at ground level and soil temperature were similar in the pasture and the forest, indicating that pasture grasses strongly modify microclimatic conditions near the soil surface. The lowest gravimetric water content recorded in the pasture during the dry season was 0.5 and leaf relative water contents of the two species measured in the forest and pasture were identical, suggesting that plants in the pasture were not water stressed. Levels of most soil nutrients were lower in the pasture as compared to the forest; however, aboveground and root biomass for seedling grown in pasture and forest soils did not differ significantly. Although a number of factors impede forest recovery in abandoned pastures, these results suggest that the most important limitation is lack of seed dispersal.

AB Herbivores can often control plant dynamics by mediating positive feedbacks in plant species' influence on nutrient cycling. In a 7-yr field experiment in a nitrogen-limited Minnesota oak savanna, we tested whether herbivores accelerated or decelerated nitrogen (N) cycling through their effects on plants. We measured effects of excluding insect (primarily Orthoptera and Homoptera) and mammalian herbivores (primarily white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus) on above-and belowground plant biomass, plant species composition, plant tissue nitrogen concentration, available soil N and light, and total N and carbon (C) in different pools (soil, roots, litter, etc.). Herbivore exclusion strongly increased cover and biomass of the legume Lathyrus venosus and a few species of woody plants. These effects were associated with greater aboveground standing crop, reduced belowground standing crop, and reduced light penetration to the ground surface. Herbivore exclusion also modified N cycling through greater N content of live, aboveground plant tissue early in the growing season and of Litter and belowground tissue late in the growing season. Herbivore exclusion also increased soil nitrate and total available N concentrations but did not alter total soil or plant N. Our results support the hypothesis that herbivores indirectly decelerate N cycling by decreasing the abundance of plant species with nitrogen-rich tissues. However, other factors, ;such as disturbance from fire, may mediate herbivore effects on long-term changes in N and C pools. Herbivores may therefore indirectly control productivity, N cycling, and succession by consuming nitrogen-fixing and woody plants that have strong effects on plant resources (e.g., nitrogen and light).

AB Groundwater depletion threatens many riparian ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions of the world. The aquifer that sustains Arizona's San Pedro River riparian ecosystem, for example, is threatened by regional groundwater declines and localized pumping from the alluvial aquifer. This paper demonstrates the important role of shallow groundwater in structuring the San Pedro River plant community, portions of which function as reference areas that indicate site potential for a globally rare forest type (Sonoran riparian Populus-Salix forests). Several ecological indicators varied with depth to groundwater, including a weighted average wetland indicator score calculated for herbaceous and woody plant species, cover of plants within wetland indicator groups, and frequency of indicator plant species. These relationships can be used in a space-for-time substitution to predict consequences of groundwater decline. For example, the wetland indicator score changed sharply as depth to groundwater ranged from 0 to 4 m, and abundance of obligate wetland herbs (the group most sensitive to groundwater changes) declined sharply at groundwater depths below approximate to 0.25 m. Such sequential ''desertification'' of the riparian flora (i.e., loss or reduction in cover of species based on their probability of occurrence in wetlands) is one predicted response to groundwater decline. Other predicted impacts of groundwater decline include reduced establishment of Populus fremontii-Salix gooddingii forests, and reduced cover of herbaceous species associated with the fine-textured soils and shady conditions of floodplain terraces stabilized by these early seral tree species. High floodplain terraces (depth to groundwater of 5-8 m) had wetland indicator scores below those of upland sites and were vegetated by species (e.g., Prosopis velutina and Sporabolus wiightii) with low sensitivity to groundwater changes.

AB In population models, omnivorous predation (i.e., predation on > 1 trophic level) generally has a destabilizing influence, whereas habitat heterogeneity tends to stabilize both predatory and competitive interactions. I experimentally evaluated the impact of a native omnivorous predator and of habitat structural complexity on the structure of a freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate community. Perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged vegetation present or absent. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, size structure, and diversity as well as gut contents of perch were monitored over a 2-mo summer period.
   Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost exclusively during the whole experiment, whereas in the absence of vegetation, perch successively increased their consumption of microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria (Insecta: Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had an effect on the diversity (Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity) of only nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates (i.e., potential prey), vegetation had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all macroinvertebrates.
   The results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. Perch may have affected nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores simultaneously through direct consumption and through indirect release from invertebrate predation, which could explain the lack of a perch effect on nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores. Complex interactions between the omnivorous predator, intermediate consumers, and resource species (macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores) may explain the relationship between perch density and macroinvertebrate diversity. The reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone. Predatory invertebrates may thus play a more important role in food web dynamics of littoral than of pelagic communities.

AB The ongoing evolution of tracer mixing models has resulted in a confusing array of software tools that differ in terms of data inputs, model assumptions, and associated analytic products. Here we introduce MixSIAR, an inclusive, rich, and flexible Bayesian tracer (e.g., stable isotope) mixing model framework implemented as an open-source R package. Using MixSIAR as a foundation, we provide guidance for the implementation of mixing model analyses. We begin by outlining the practical differences between mixture data error structure formulations and relate these error structures to common mixing model study designs in ecology. Because Bayesian mixing models afford the option to specify informative priors on source proportion contributions, we outline methods for establishing prior distributions and discuss the influence of prior specification on model outputs. We also discuss the options available for source data inputs (raw data versus summary statistics) and provide guidance for combining sources. We then describe a key advantage of MixSIAR over previous mixing model software-the ability to include fixed and random effects as covariates explaining variability in mixture proportions and calculate relative support for multiple models via information criteria. We present a case study of Alligator mississippiensis diet partitioning to demonstrate the power of this approach. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of limitations to mixing model applications. Through MixSIAR, we have consolidated the disparate array of mixing model tools into a single platform, diversified the set of available parameterizations, and provided developers a platform upon which to continue improving mixing model analyses in the future.

AB Species can be defined as populations that are diagnosably distinct, reproductively isolated, cohesive, or exclusive groups of organisms. Boundaries between species in sympatry are maintained by intrinsic barriers to gene exchange; these boundaries may not be uniform in space, in time, or across the genome. Here, we explore the nature of the species boundary, defined as the phenotypes/genes/genome regions that remain differentiated in the face of potential hybridization and introgression. We emphasize that species boundaries are semipermeable, with permeability (gene exchange) being a function of genome region. The early evidence for semipermeable species boundaries came from data on differential introgression in hybrid zones. This "genic view" of species was common in the hybrid zone literature even when few molecular markers were available to characterize genome-wide patterns of variation. Now, molecular tools allow detailed characterization of differentiation between diverging lineages and patterns of variation across natural hybrid zones, but the questions being asked by evolutionary biologists have remained much the same. Recent data (from DNA sequences and genotypes) reinforce earlier conclusions about the semipermeable nature of most species boundaries. However, debate persists over the nature and extent of genome divergence that accompanies speciation.

AB Stable carbon isotopes are used extensively to examine physiological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes related to ecosystem, regional, and global carbon cycles and provide information at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Much is known about the processes that regulate the carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of leaf, plant, and ecosystem carbon pools and of photosynthetic and respiratory carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes. In this review, systematic patterns and mechanisms underlying variation in delta C-13 of plant and ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes are described. We examine the hypothesis that the delta C-13 of leaf biomass can be used as a reference point for other carbon pools and fluxes, which differ from the leaf in delta C-13 in a systematic fashion. Plant organs are typically enriched in C-13 relative to leaves, and most ecosystem pools and respiratory fluxes are enriched relative to sun leaves of dominant plants, with the notable exception of root respiration. Analysis of the chemical and isotopic composition of leaves and leaf respiration suggests that growth respiration has the potential to contribute substantially to the observed offset between the delta C-13 values of ecosystem respiration and the bulk leaf. We discuss the implications of systematic variations in delta C-13 of ecosystem pools and CO2 fluxes for studies of carbon cycling within ecosystems, as well as for studies that use the delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2 to diagnose changes in the terrestrial biosphere over annual to millennial time scales.

AB Biological invasions are global threats to biodiversity and parasites might play a role in determining invasion outcomes. Transmission of parasites from invading to native species can occur, aiding the invasion process, whilst the 'release' of invaders from parasites can also facilitate invasions. Parasites might also have indirect effects on the outcomes of invasions by mediating a range of competitive and predatory interactions among native and invading species. Although pathogen outbreaks can cause catastrophic species loss with knock-on effects for community structure, it is less clear what impact persistent, sub-lethal parasitism has on native-invader interactions and community structure. Here, we show that the influence of parasitism on the outcomes of animal invasions is more subtle and wide ranging than has been previously realized.

AB Predator-induced phenotypic plasticity is widespread in nature and includes variation in life history, morphology, and behavior. In organisms with complex life histories, predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in the larval period has been widely documented. Several models predict how organisms should alter their size at and time to metamorphosis in response to an increased risk of predation. A survey of empirical studies finds that these theoretical predictions are frequently met. However, no one model performs the best. Additionally, there are several results not predicted by any model. Predator-induced plasticity in metamorphic traits may be related to predator-induced changes in larval morphology and behavior. Predictions of predator effects on larval traits are generally met, except for direct costs of predator-induced morphological phenotypes. Future work should incorporate more detailed studies of growth rate, morphology, and behavior during the larval period, as well as studies of size-specific mortality rates in the presence and absence of predators.

AB Stable isotopes are a powerful research tool in environmental sciences and their use in ecosystem research is increasing. In this review we introduce and discuss the relevant details underlying the use of carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions in ecosystem gas exchange research. The current use and potential developments of stable isotope measurements together with concentration and flux measurements of CO2 and water vapor are emphasized. For these applications it is critical to know the isotopic identity of specific ecosystem components such as the isotopic composition of CO2, organic matter, liquid water, and water vapor, as well as the associated isotopic fractionations, in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Combining stable isotopes and concentration measurements is very effective through the use of "Keeling plots." This approach allows the identification of the isotopic composition and the contribution of ecosystem, or ecosystem components, to the exchange fluxes with the atmosphere. It also allows the estimation of net ecosystem discrimination and soil disequilibrium effects. Recent modifications of the Keeling plot approach permit examination of CO2 recycling in ecosystems. Combining stable isotopes with dynamic flux measurements requires precision in isotopic sampling and analysis, which is currently at the limit of detection. Combined with the micrometeorological gradient approach (applicable mostly in grasslands and crop fields), stable isotope measurements allow separation of net CO2 exchange into photosynthetic and soil respiration components, and the evapotranspiration flux into soil evaporation and leaf transpiration. Similar applications in conjunction with eddy correlation techniques (applicable to forests, in addition to grasslands and crop fields) are more demanding, but can potentially be applied in combination with the Keeling plot relationship. The advance and potential in using stable isotope measurements should make their use a standard component in the limited arsenal of ecosystem-scale research tools.

AB Habitat fragmentation has been shown to influence the abundance, movements, and persistence of many species. We asked the following questions: (1) Do species respond mainly to habitat loss or to the changes in habitat configuration resulting from this loss? (2) Do species exhibit sharp thresholds in their response to forest cover or configuration? We compared the relative influence of forest cover and configuration on 15 bird species in 33 landscapes (6.25 km(2)) in eastern Ontario, Canada. Forest cover in these landscapes varied between 3.4% and 66. The metrics we used to quantify forest configuration were correlated to forest cover, so we regressed these configuration metrics against cover and used the residuals in logistic regression models. Of the 15 forest bird species included in the analyses, the presence of only 3 (Downy Woodpecker [Picoides pubescens], Brown Creeper [Certhia americana], and White-breasted Nuthatch [Sitta carolinensis]) was not significantly related to either cotter or configuration of woodland Forest cover and configuration each were significant predictors of the presence of 6 species in landscapes occupied in both years, and 3 species responded both to cover and configuration, Models based on single years showed variability in the landscape characteristics that were significant predictor of the presence of each species These results indicate that (1) landscape structure was an important predictor of bird distribution, (2) both forest cover and configuration were important predictors of species presence, and (3) responses were species-specific Effects of forest cover and configuration on species presence generally were not characterized by sharp thresholds, preventing the application of simple management rules. Although forest cover is an important feature of landscape structure, our results indicate that woodland configuration is far from negligible component that should also be incorporated in conservation strategies.

AB 1. Ecological factors influencing prey selection by tiger Panthera tigris, leopard Panthera pardus and dhole Cuon alpinus were investigated in an intact assemblage of large mammals in the tropical forests of Nagarahole, southern India, between 1986 and 1990.
   2. Densities of large herbivores were estimated using line transects, and population structures from area counts. Carnivore diets were determined from analyses of seats (faeces) and kills. Selectivity for prey species was inferred from likelihood ratio tests comparing observed counts of seats to hypothesized seat frequencies generated from prey density estimates using parametric bootstrap simulations. Predator selectivity for size, age, sex and physical condition of prey was estimated using selection indices.
   3. Ungulate and primate prey attained a density of 91 animals km(-2) and comprised 89-98% of the biomass killed. Predators showed significant (P < 0.05) selectivity among prey species. Gaur Bos gaurus were preferred by tigers, whereas wild pig Sus scrofa were under-represented in leopard diet, and langur Presbytis entellus underrepresented in dhole diet.
   4. Tigers selected prey weighing more than 176 kg, whereas leopard and dhole focused on prey in the 30-175 kg size class. The average weights of principal prey killed by tiger, leopard and dhole were, respectively, 91.5 kg, 37.6 kg and 43.4 kg. Tiger predation was biased towards adult males in chital, sambar and wild pig, and towards young gaur. Dholes selectively preyed on adult male chital, whereas leopards did not.
   5. These findings suggest that if there is choice, large carnivores selectively kill larger prey, and non-selective predation patterns reported from other tropical forests may be the result of scarcity of large prey. Because availability of prey in the appropriate size classes is not a limiting resource, selective predation may facilitate large carnivore coexistence in Nagarahole. Community structures of large carnivores in tropical forests may be highly sensitive to natural or human-induced variations in the relative densities of different size classes of prey.

AB It is widely believed that mutualisms, interspecific interactions that benefit both species, have been grossly neglected relative to their true importance in nature. I have reviewed the recent primary literature in order to assess quantitatively the frequency of studies of mutualism, the types of questions they address, and their general scientific approach. All articles appearing from 1986 to 1990 in nine major journals that publish ecological and evolutionary research were examined. It is clear that mutualism research is not in fact rare. Studies of interspecific interactions made up about 22% of the over 4500 articles published during this period; of these, about one-quarter investigated some form of mutualism. Over 90% of them investigated plant-animal interactions, primarily pollination (52 %) and seed dispersal (31 %), a bias probably related in part to the particular journals examined. The diversity of questions addressed in these articles was surprisingly low. The majority (63 %) focused simply on identifying the mutualists of some species of interest. Furthermore, almost all studies were unilateral, that is, they focused on only one of the interacting species, plants being studied much more frequently than their animal partners.
   Mutualism studies do not appear to have focused on mutualism as a form of interaction in the same way as studies of competition and predation. Rather, researchers have treated mutualism primarily as a life history attribute of one of the two partners. Consequently, although an impressive amount of information has accumulated about these interactions, we are still far from achieving an overall picture that transcends the boundaries of particular taxa or combinations of taxa. Three other obstacles have prevented data on mutualisms from being brought together: the historical isolation of studies of different kinds of mutualism, a nearly total disconnection between mutualism theories and empirical studies, and the unilateral approach almost always used to study these bilateral interactions. I identify eight research questions whose answers have the potential to reveal broad-based generalizations about the evolution and ecology of mutualism.

AB The biodiversity of a site should depend on the interplay of local colonization (gain) and extinction (loss) rates, but few theoretical explanations of diversity patterns on productivity gradients have included effects of productivity on colonization. In an 11-yr study, experimental increases in productivity via nitrogen addition generally led to decreased species richness in four grassland fields Decreased diversity in productive plots was caused as much by lower rates of species gain as by greater rates of loss of existing species. Annual grasses and forbs had high gain and loss rates, but these were independent of productivity. In contrast, the rates of gain of perennial grass and forb species declined with productivity, and their rates of loss increased.
   Species richness was dependent on litter mass and on light penetration, but not on aboveground living plant mass, suggesting that there was no direct effect of productivity on diversity. Diversity in periodically burned prairie, which had low litter mass, was independent of productivity by the 10th and 11th yr of the study. Results suggest that diversity is lower in productive grasslands because accumulated litter, and possibly lower light penetration, inhibit germination and/or survival of seedlings, and thus decrease rates of establishment by new species. Higher productivity also leads to higher rates of loss, presumably via competitive displacement, of existing species. Results do not support the hypothesis that soil N heterogeneity controls diversity on the temporal and spatial scales of this study.

AB Decomposition and nutrient release patterns of prunings of three woody agroforestry plant species (Acioa barteri, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala), maize (Zea mays) stover and rice (Oryza sativa) straw, were investigated under field conditions in the humid tropics, using litterbags of three mesh sizes (0.5, 2 and 7 mm) which allowed differential access of soil fauna. The decomposition rate constants ranged from 0.01 to 0.26 week-1, decreasing in the following order; Gliricidia prunings > Leucaena prunings > rice straw > maize stover > Acioa prunings. Negative correlations were observed between decomposition rate constants and C:N ratio (P < 0.004), percent lignin (P < 0.014) and polyphenol content (P < 0.053) of plant residues. A positive correlation was observed between decomposition rate constant and mesh-size of litterbag (P < 0.057). These results indicate that both the chemical composition of plant residues and nature of the decomposer played an important role in plant residue decomposition.
   Nutrient release differed with quality of plant residues and litterbag mesh-size. Total N, P, Ca and Mg contents of plant residues decreased with time for Gliricidia and Leucaena prunings, maize stover, and rice straw, and increased with time for Acioa prunings. There was some indication of N immobilization in maize stover and rice straw; P immobilization in Leucaena prunings and rice straw; and Ca immobilization in maize stover, rice straw and Gliricidia and Leucaena prunings. Acioa prunings immobilized N, P, Ca and Mg. All plant residues released K rapidly. Nutrient release increased with increasing mesh-size of litterbags, suggesting that soil faunal activities enhanced nutrient mobilization.

AB Trait-based studies have become extremely common in plant ecology. Trait-based approaches often rely on the tacit assumption that intraspecific trait variability (ITV) is negligible compared to interspecific variability, so that species can be characterized by mean trait values. Yet, numerous recent studies have challenged this assumption by showing that ITV significantly affects various ecological processes. Accounting for ITV may thus strengthen trait-based approaches, but measuring trait values on a large number of individuals per species and site is not feasible. Therefore, it is important and timely to synthesize existing knowledge on ITV in order to (1) decide critically when ITV should be considered, and (2) establish methods for incorporating this variability. Here we propose a practical set of rules to identify circumstances under which ITV should be accounted for. We formulate a spatial trait variance partitioning hypothesis to highlight the spatial scales at which ITV cannot be ignored in ecological studies. We then refine a set of four consecutive questions on the research question, the spatial scale, the sampling design, and the type of studied traits, to determine case-by-case if a given study should quantify ITV and test its effects. We review methods for quantifying ITV and develop a step-by-step guideline to design and interpret simulation studies that test for the importance of ITV. Even in the absence of quantitative knowledge on ITV, its effects can be assessed by varying trait values within species within realistic bounds around the known mean values. We finish with a discussion of future requirements to further incorporate ITV within trait-based approaches. This paper thus delineates a general framework to account for ITV and suggests a direction towards a more quantitative trait-based ecology. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Ecosystems worldwide are receiving increasing amounts of reactive nitrogen (N) through anthropogenic activities. Although the effects of increased N inputs on plant communities have been reasonably well studied, few comparable studies have examined impacts on whole soil bacterial communities, though they play critical roles in ecosystem functioning. We sampled soils from two long-term ecological research (LTER) experimental N gradients, both of which have been amended with NH4NO3; a grassland at Cedar Creek (27 years of N additions) and an agricultural field at Kellogg Biological Station (8 years of N additions). By examining shifts in bacterial communities across these contrasting ecosystem types, we could test competing hypotheses about the direct and indirect factors that might drive bacterial responses to elevated N inputs. Bacterial community structure was highly responsive to N additions. We observed predictable and consistent changes in the structure of the bacterial communities across both ecosystem types. Our results suggest that bacterial communities across these gradients are more structured by N and/or soil carbon availability than by shifts in the plant community or soil pH associated with the elevated nitrogen inputs. In contrast to the pronounced shifts in bacterial community composition and in direct contrast to the patterns often observed in plant communities, increases in N availability did not have consistent effects on the richness and diversity of soil bacterial communities.

TI THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACT OF INVASIVE CANE TOADS (BUFO MARINUS) IN AUSTRALIA

AB Although invasive species are viewed as major threats to ecosystems worldwide, few such species have been studied in enough detail to identify the pathways, magnitudes, and timescales of their impact on native fauna. One of the most intensively studied invasive taxa in this respect is the cane toad (Bulb marinus), which was introduced to Australia in 1935. A review of these studies suggests that a single pathway lethal toxic ingestion of toads by flog-eating predators is the major mechanism of impact, but that the magnitude of impact varies dramatically among predator taxa, as well as through space and time. Populations of large predators (e.g., varanid and scincid lizards, elapid snakes, freshwater crocodiles, and dasyurid marsupials) may be imperilled by toad invasion, but impacts vary spatially even within the same predator species. Some of the taxa severely impacted by toad invasion recover within a few decades, via aversion learning and longer-term adaptive changes. No native species have gone extinct as a result of toad invasion, and many native taxa widely imagined lobe at risk are not affected, largely as a mull of their physiological ability to tolerate toad toxins (e.g., as found in many birds and rodents), as well as the reluctance of many native anuran-eating predators to consume toads, either innately or as a learned response. Indirect effects of cane toads as mediated through trophic webs are likely as important as direct effects, but they are more difficult to study. Overall, some Australian native species (mostly large predators) have declined due to cane toads; others, especially species formerly consumed by those predators, have benefited. For yet others, effects have been minor or have been mediated indirectly rather than through direct interactions with the invasive toads. Factors that increase a predator's vulnerability to toad invasion include habitat overlap with toads, anurophagy, large body size, inability to develop rapid behavioral aversion to toads as prey items, and physiological vulnerability to bufotoxins as a result of a lack of coevolutionary history of exposure to other bufonid taxa.

AB Arthropod predators and parasitoids provide valuable ecosystem services in agricultural crops by suppressing populations of insect herbivores. Many natural enemies are influenced by non-crop habitat surrounding agricultural fields, and understanding if, and at what scales, land use patterns influence natural enemies is essential to predicting how landscape alters biological control services. Here we focus on biological control of soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matumura, a specialist crop pest recently introduced to the north-central United States. We measured the amount of biological control service supplied to soybean in 26 replicate fields across Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota across two years (2005 2006). We measured the impact of natural enemies by experimentally excluding or allowing access to soybean aphid infested plants and comparing aphid population growth over 14 days. We also monitored aphid and natural enemy populations at large in each field. Predators, principally coccinellid beetles, dominated the natural enemy community of soybean in both years. In the absence of aphid predators, A. glycines increased significantly, with 5.3-fold higher aphid populations on plants in exclusion cages vs. the open field after 14 days. We calculated a biological control services index (BSI) based on relative suppression of aphid populations and related it to landscape diversity and composition at multiple spatial scales surrounding each site. We found that BSI values increased with landscape diversity, measured as Simpson's D. Landscapes dominated by corn and soybean fields provided less biocontrol service to soybean compared with landscapes with an abundance of crop and non-crop habitats. The abundance of Coccinellidae was related to landscape composition, with beetles being more abundant in landscapes with an abundance of forest and grassland compared with landscapes dominated by agricultural crops. Landscape diversity and composition at a scale of 1.5 km surrounding the focal field explained the greatest proportion of the variation in BSI and Coccinellidae abundance. This study indicates that natural enemies provide a regionally important ecosystem service by suppressing a key soybean pest, reducing the need for insecticide applications. Furthermore, it suggests that management to maintain or enhance landscape diversity has the potential to stabilize or increase biocontrol services.

AB We review the ecological rationale behind the potential compatibility between top predators and biodiversity conservation, and examine their effectiveness as surrogate species. Evidence suggests that top predators promote species richness or are spatio-temporally associated with it for six causative or noncausative reasons: resource facilitation, trophic cascades, dependence on ecosystem productivity, sensitivity to dysfunctions, selection of heterogeneous sites and links to multiple ecosystem components, Therefore, predator-centered conservation may deliver certain biodiversity goals. To this aim, predators have been employed in conservation as keystone, umbrella, sentinel, flagship, and indicator species. However, quantitative tests of their surrogate-efficacy have been astonishingly few Evidence suggests they may function as structuring agents and biodiversity indicators in some ecosystems but not others, and that they perform poorly as umbrella species; more consensus exists for their efficacy as sentinel and flagship species. Conservation biologists need to use apex predators more cautiously, is part of wider, context-dependent mixed strategies.

Neonates have to cope with an array of plant surface characters as well as internal characters once the integument is ruptured. These characters, as well as microclimatic conditions, vary within and between plant modules and interact with larval feeding requirements, strongly affecting movement behavior, which may be extensive even for such small organisms. In addition to these factors, there is an array of predators, pathogens, and parasitoids with which first instars must contend. Not surprisingly, mortality in neonates is high but can vary widely. Experimental and manipulative studies, as well as detailed observations of the animal, are vital if the subtle interaction of factors responsible for this high and variable mortality are to be understood. These studies are essential for an understanding of theories linking female oviposition behavior with larval survival, plant defense theory, and population dynamics, as well as modern crop resistance breeding programs.

AB Ecologists have searched for general principles, or assembly rules, which determine how species combine to form communities. Two major strands of research highlight the interaction of assembly rules operating at different levels of community organisation, and within uncertain local and historical contingencies. Here, we review the literature on community assembly within the context of three principal determinants: dispersal constraints, environmental constraints and internal dynamics. This classification separates external factors (dispersal and environmental constraints) from internal processes (internal dynamics). We assert that assembly rules are general, deterministic and mechanistic, and operate on internal dynamics within the constraints imposed by the local environment and the history of species invasions. Several assembly rules have been proposed to operate within and across trophic levels, as well as on whole systems. The rules act through resource dynamics and spatial dynamics to select species or subsets of species that can coexist, and may lead to patterns of increasing biomass and non-random spatial distributions. Environmental constraints restrict species establishment and mediate interactions among successful colonists; a change in environmental constraints, either exogenous or endogenous, may drive community change. Even in systems at equilibrium, environmental constraints influence the outcome of assembly rules. Dispersal constraints determine the pool of potential colonists available at a particular time and place, and are a complex amalgam of species-specific traits, storage effects, landscape ecology, and history. The order and timing of species invasions (dispersal constraints) interact with assembly rules to produce priority effects. The directionality of community assembly may be lost if either the rate of species invasions or the rate of non-selective species extinctions exceeds the rate at which species are selected by assembly rules. The falling apart, or disassembly, of a community through breakdown of species interactions may follow different rules or a different assembly trajectory.

AB We conducted a field experiment in a successional grassland to investigate the short-term effects of nitrogen enrichment and plant litter on plant species richness and on the establishment of a native grass (Andropogon gerardi) that was experimentally introduced to the study site as seed. Additions of nitrogen fertilizer to experimental plots over two growing seasons increased plant production as indicated by increases in both living plant biomass and litter biomass. Increased productivity reduced species richness by effectively preventing the seedling establishment of the subordinate forb species and reduced the recruitment of Andropogon gerardi by inhibiting both germination and survival. Litter removals carried out at each of two levels of nitrogen enrichment (no nitrogen, nitrogen added) showed that litter significantly reduced species richness by the same amount in fertilized and unfertilized plots, suggesting that living biomass and litter were purely additive, rather than interactive in their effects. In contrast, the results of litter additions suggested that the declines in richness associated with fertilization could largely be due to the suppressive effects of increased litter biomass alone. As a whole, the results indicate that litter and living biomass are largely substitutable in their inhibitory effects on species richness in highly productive successional grasslands due to their independent and equivalent capacities to attenuate light to very low levels. This study highlights the combined roles of competition and plant litter in influencing the diversity of grasslands through effects on seedling establishment.

TI SIMILARITY-BASED TESTING FOR COMMUNITY PATTERN - THE 2-WAY LAYOUT WITH
   NO REPLICATION
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MEIOBENTHIC COMMUNITY; MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT; DISTURBANCE; POLLUTION;
   DESIGN
AB The large, sparse arrays of species counts arising in both field and experimental community studies do not lend themselves to standard statistical tests based on multivariate normality. Instead, a valid and more revealing approach uses informal display methods, such as clustering or multi-dimensional scaling ordination (MDS), based on a biologically-motivated definition of pairwise similarity of samples in terms of species composition. Formal testing methods are still required, however, to establish that real assemblage differences exist between sites, times, experimental treatments, pollution states, etc. Earlier work has described a range of Mantel-type permutation or randomisation procedures, making no distributional assumptions, which are termed ANOSIM tests because of their dependence only on (rank) similarities and the analogy to one and two-way ANOVA. This paper extends these tests to cover an important practical case, previously unconsidered, that of a two-way layout without replication. Such cases arise for single samples (or pseudo-replicates) taken in a baseline monitoring survey of several sites over time, or a mesocosm experiment in which ''treatments'' are replicated only once within each experimental ''block''. Significance tests are given for the overall presence of a treatment (or time) effect, based on a measure of concordance between rank similarities of samples within each block (or site); the role of the two factors can be reversed to obtain a test for block effects. As in the analogous univariate ANOVA test, the method relies on absence or relative weakness of treatment x block ''interactions''. Its scope is illustrated with data from two experimental and two field studies, involving meiofaunal communities from soft-sediment and macro-algal habitats. It is seen also to accommodate a modest degree of missing data. Whilst the failure to replicate adequately is not encouraged-a richer inference is available with genuine replication-the paper does provide a limited way forward for hypothesis testing in the absence of replicates.

AB It has long been recognised that cities exhibit their own microclimate and are typically warmer than the surrounding rural areas. This 'mesoscale' influence is known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect and results largely from modification of surface properties leading to greater absorption of solar radiation, reduced convective cooling and lower water evaporation rates. Cities typically contain less vegetation and bodies of water than rural areas, and existing green and bluespace is often under threat from increasing population densities. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the key ways in which green and bluespace affect both urban canopy- and boundary-layer temperatures, examined from the perspectives of city-planning, urban climatology and climate science. The analysis suggests that the evapotranspiration-based cooling influence of both green and bluespace is primarily relevant for urban canopy-layer conditions, and that tree-dominated greenspace offers the greatest heat stress relief When it is most needed. However, the magnitude and transport of cooling experienced depends on size, spread, and geometry of greenspaces, with some solitary large parks found to offer minimal boundary layer cooling. Contribution to cooling at the scale of the urban boundary-layer climate is attributed mainly to greenspace increasing surface roughness and thereby improving convection efficiency rather than evaporation. Although bluespace cooling and transport during the day can be substantial, nocturnal warming is highlighted as likely when conditions are most oppressive. However, when both features are employed together they can offer many synergistic ecosystem benefits including cooling. The ways in which green and bluespace infrastructure is applied in future urban growth strategies, particularly in countries expected to experience rapid urbanisation, warrants greater consideration in urban planning policy to mitigate the adverse effects of the UHI and enhance climate resilience.

DE effective communication; protocol; statistical analysis; visualization
AB Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.

AB Ecological systems are vulnerable to irreversible change when key system properties are pushed over thresholds, resulting in the loss of resilience and the precipitation of a regime shift. Perhaps the most important of such properties in human-modified landscapes is the total amount of remnant native vegetation. In a seminal study Andren proposed the existence of a fragmentation threshold in the total amount of remnant vegetation, below which landscape-scale connectivity is eroded and local species richness and abundance become dependent on patch size. Despite the fact that species patch-area effects have been a mainstay of conservation science there has yet to be a robust empirical evaluation of this hypothesis. Here we present and test a new conceptual model describing the mechanisms and consequences of biodiversity change in fragmented landscapes, identifying the fragmentation threshold as a first step in a positive feedback mechanism that has the capacity to impair ecological resilience, and drive a regime shift in biodiversity. The model considers that local extinction risk is defined by patch size, and immigration rates by landscape vegetation cover, and that the recovery from local species losses depends upon the landscape species pool. Using a unique dataset on the distribution of non-volant small mammals across replicate landscapes in the Atlantic forest of Brazil, we found strong evidence for our model predictions - that patch-area effects are evident only at intermediate levels of total forest cover, where landscape diversity is still high and opportunities for enhancing biodiversity through local management are greatest. Furthermore, high levels of forest loss can push native biota through an extinction filter, and result in the abrupt, landscape-wide loss of forest-specialist taxa, ecological resilience and management effectiveness. The proposed model links hitherto distinct theoretical approaches within a single framework, providing a powerful tool for analysing the potential effectiveness of management interventions.

AB Remobilization to the atmosphere of only a small fraction of the methane held in East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) sediments could trigger abrupt climate warming, yet it is believed that sub-sea permafrost acts as a lid to keep this shallow methane reservoir in place. Here, we show that more than 5000 at-sea observations of dissolved methane demonstrates that greater than 80% of ESAS bottom waters and greater than 50% of surface waters are supersaturated with methane regarding to the atmosphere. The current atmospheric venting flux, which is composed of a diffusive component and a gradual ebullition component, is on par with previous estimates of methane venting from the entire World Ocean. Leakage of methane through shallow ESAS waters needs to be considered in interactions between the biogeosphere and a warming Arctic climate.

AB In contrast to pulses in resource availability following disturbance events, many of the most pressing global changes, such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and nitrogen deposition, lead to chronic and often cumulative alterations in available resources. Therefore, predicting ecological responses to these chronic resource alterations will require the modification of existing disturbance-based frameworks. Here, we present a conceptual framework for assessing the nature and pace of ecological change under chronic resource alterations. The "hierarchical-response framework'' (HRF) links well-documented, ecological mechanisms of change to provide a theoretical basis for testing hypotheses to explain the dynamics and differential sensitivity of ecosystems to chronic resource alterations. The HRF is based on a temporal hierarchy of mechanisms and responses beginning with individual (physiological/metabolic) responses, followed by species reordering within communities, and finally species loss and immigration. Each mechanism is hypothesized to differ in the magnitude and rate of its effects on ecosystem structure and function, with this variation depending on ecosystem attributes, such as longevity of dominant species, rates of biogeochemical cycling, levels of biodiversity, and trophic complexity. Overall, the HRF predicts nonlinear changes in ecosystem dynamics, with the expectation that interactions with natural disturbances and other global-change drivers will further alter the nature and pace of change. The HRF is explicitly comparative to better understand differential sensitivities of ecosystems, and it can be used to guide the design of coordinated, cross-site experiments to enable more robust forecasts of contemporary and future ecosystem dynamics.

AB In this paper I outline the parameters of nonhuman charisma in the context of UK biodiversity conservation. Although conservationists frequently discuss charismatic species in their professional discourse there is little existing work that explores the character of this charisma and how it operates in environmental governance. In this paper I map nonhuman charisma and explore its ontological, ethical, and epistemological implications. I first illustrate a three-part typology of nonhuman charisma, comprising ecological, aesthetic, and corporeal charisma. Exploring nonhuman agency through the lens of charisma I contribute to ongoing efforts in geography and cognate disciplines to forge a 'more-than-human' understanding of agency and ethics. Nonhuman charisma provides a bounded relational ontology for considering nonhuman difference. Furthermore, nonhuman charisma draws attention to the importance of affect in understanding environmental ethics. Affect provides the vital motivating force that impels people to get involved in conservation. Second, I provide an example of nonhuman charisma in action. I draw on earlier work on human charisma to explore how charismatic organisms, operating as 'flagship species, are mobilised as boundary objects to achieve organisation order in the assemblages of UK biodiversity conservation.

AB Burgeoning consumer interest in organically produced foods has made organic farming one of the fastest growing segments of agriculture. This growth has not been supported adequately by rigorous research to address challenges such as arthropod pest management. The research that has been conducted, however, is complemented by research in aspects of conventional agriculture that may have applicability in organic systems, as well as by research in underpinning fields such as applied ecology. This article synthesizes the available literature in relation to a conceptual model of arthropod pest management strategies suitable for organic systems. The present work uses the four phases of the model to review the strategies in an agroecological context and provides a synthesis of the factors that influence the success of each phase. Rather than constituting a fringe science, pest management research for organic systems draws on cutting edge science in fields such as landscape and chemical ecology and has a bright future.

AB 1 Although drought frequency and severity are predicted to increase across numerous continental interiors, the consequences of these changes for dominant plants are largely unknown. Over the last decade, the south-western US has experienced six drought years, including the extreme droughts of 1996 and 2002, which led to widespread tree mortality across northern Arizona.
   2 We examined the impact of these droughts on the co-dominant tree species of the pinyon-juniper woodland (Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma), a major vegetation type in the US.
   3 Pinyon mortality following both droughts was 6.5-fold higher than juniper mortality. In addition, large pinyons suffered 2-6-fold greater mortality than small pinyons, a pattern associated with higher mortality of reproductively mature trees and survival of smaller pinyons resulting from facilitation by established vegetation. Differential mortality of large pinyons resulted in a vegetation shift such that the pinyon-juniper woodlands are becoming dominated by juniper, a species that is typical of lower elevations and more arid conditions.
   4 Sites that experienced high pinyon mortality during the first drought suffered additional mortality during the second drought, so that reductions in tree densities and the resulting release from below-ground competition did not buffer surviving pinyons against additional mortality during the second drought. Such repeated mortality events also suggest that these stands may suffer chronic stress.
   5 Reductions in biotic associations (e.g. avian seed dispersers, ectomycorrhizas and nurse plants) that will probably result from extreme mortality of large pinyons ensure that the observed vegetation shifts will be persistent. Because approximately 1000 species are associated with pinyon pine, the shift in the structure of these woodlands has large-scale community consequences.

   STATISTICS; UNDERSTORY; COMMUNITY
AB Ecologists have traditionally viewed the total species diversity within a set of communities as the product of the average diversity within a community (alpha) and the diversity among the communities (beta). This multiplicative concept of species diversity contrasts with the lesser known idea that alpha- and beta-diversities sum to give the total diversity. This additive partitioning of species diversity is nearly as old as the multiplicative concept, yet ecologists are just now beginning to use additive partitioning to examine patterns of species diversity. In this review we discuss why additive partitioning remained "hidden" until just a few years ago. The rediscovery of additive partitioning has expanded the way in which ecologists define and measure beta-diversity. Beta diversity is no longer relegated to describing change only along all environmental gradient. Through additive partitioning, beta-diversity is explicitly an average amount of diversity just as is a-diversity. We believe that the additive partitioning of diversity into alpha and beta components will continue to become more widely used because it allows for a direct comparison of alpha- and beta-diversities. It also has particular relevance for testing ecological theory concerned with the determinants of species diversity at multiple spatial scales and potential applications ill conservation biology.

AB Humans transformed Western Atlantic coastal marine ecosystems before modern ecological investigations began, Paleoecological. archeological, and historical reconstructions demonstrate incredible losses of large vertebrates and oysters from the entire Atlantic coast. Untold millions of large fishes, sharks, sea turtles, and manatees were removed from the Caribbean in the 17th to 19th centuries. Recent collapses of reef corals and seagrasses are due ultimately to losses of these large consumers as much as to more recent changes in climate, eutrophication, or outbreaks of disease. Overfishing in the 19th century reduced vast beds of oysters in Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries to a few percent of pristine abundances and promoted eutrophication. Mechanized harvesting of bottom fishes like cod set off a series of trophic cascades that eliminated kelp forests and then brought them back again as fishers fished their way down food webs to small invertebrates. Lastly, but most pervasively, mechanized harvesting df the entire continental shelf decimated large, long-lived fishes and destroyed three-dimensional habitats built up by sessile corals, bryozoans, and sponges. The universal pattern of losses demonstrates that no coastal ecosystem is pristine and few wild fisheries are sustainable along the entire Western Atlantic coast. Reconstructions of ecosystems lost only a century or two ago demonstrate attainable goals of establishing large and effective marine reserves if society is willing to pay the costs. Historical reconstructions provide a new scientific framework for manipulative experiments at the ecosystem scale to explore the feasibility and benefits of protection of our living coastal resources.

AB In many animals, males can generally increase their fitness by mating with many mates, but females cannot produce more offspring than the number of their eggs. In spite of this restriction, females often mate with more than one male. In species without any male-provided resource benefits, females are thought to obtain some 'genetic benefits' from males that enhance offspring quality. The evolution of female multiple mating is often confused with the issue of female mate choice, but mate choice is actually possible in the single-mating situation. Therefore, we still need to explain the possible advantage of multiple mating over single mating.

AB Based on prior evidence of coordinated multiple leaf trait scaling, we hypothesized that variation among species in leaf dark respiration rate (R-d) should scale with variation in traits such as leaf nitrogen (N), leaf life-span, specific leaf area (SLA), and net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)). However, it is not known whether such scaling if it exists, is similar among disparate biomes and plant functional types. We tested this idea by examining the interspecific relationships between R-d measured at a standard temperature and leaf life-span, N, SLA and A(max) for 69 species from four functional groups (forbs, broad-leafed trees and shrubs, and needle-leafed conifers) in six biomes traversing the Americas. alpine tundra/subalpine forest, Colorado; cold temperate forest/ grassland, Wisconsin; cool temperate forest, North Carolina; desert/shrubland, New Mexico; subtropical forest, South Carolina; and tropical rain forest, Amazonas, Venezuela. Area-based R-d was positively related to area-based leaf N within functional groups and for all species pooled, but not when comparing among species within any site. At all sites, mass-based R-d (Rd-mass) decreased sharply with increasing leaf life-span and was positively related to SLA and mass-based A(max) and leaf N (leaf N-mass). These intra-biome relationships were similar in shape and slope among sites, where in each case we compared species belonging to different plant functional groups. Significant Rd-mass-N-mass relationships were observed in all functional groups (pooled across sites), but the relationships differed, with higher R-d at any given leaf N in functional groups (such as forbs) with higher SLA and shorter leaf life-span. Regardless of biome or functional group, Rd-mass was well predicted by all combinations of leaf life-span, N-mass and/or SLA (r(2) > 0.79, P < 0.0001). At any given SLA, Rd-mass rises with increasing N-mass and/or decreasing leaf life-span and at any level of N-mass, Rd-mass rises with increasing SLA and/or decreasing leaf life-span. The relationships between R-d and leaf traits observed in this study support the idea of a global set of predictable interrelationships between key leaf morphological, chemical and metabolic traits.

TI Carbon accumulation in peatland
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID RAISED MIRE; FINLAND; AGE
AB (1) Models of pear accumulation are developed that include constant, linear and quadratic decay of dry mass remaining. Profiles of dry bulk density of 795 peatlands distributed over Finland are used to infer cumulative carbon for each site. These values and basal ages are themselves used to infer rates of growth and decay of the peat. (2) A method, 'function parameter fitting' (FPF), is devised to estimate parameter values in non-linear functions when there are uncertainties in both variables, as there are in cumulative carbon and age. Where the data are highly variable then results with FPF are substantially different from those used hitherto that assume uncertainty in only the dependent variable. (3) For five regions in Finland and in Boreal Canada the inferred rate of addition, p(*) [M L-2 T-1], is related to degree-days above zero, and decay, a(*) [T-1] is related logarithmically to mean annual temperature. The present day rate of accumulation of carbon in northern peatlands is about 5.6 Tmol yr(-1) or, as dry mass, 0.07 Gt yr(-1). (4) There are difficulties in the interpretation of LARCA (= LORCA = long term average rate of carbon accumulation). Understanding of peatland dynamics may result from the use of intrinsic models allowing decay: it is unlikely to emerge from the exotic models in common use.

AB A numerical process-based model of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics is described and tested. The model, Hybrid v3.0, treats the daily cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water within the biosphere and between the biosphere and the atmosphere. It combines a mass-balance approach with the capacity to predict the relative dominance of different species or generalised plant types (such as evergreen needleleaved trees, cold deciduous broadleaved trees, and C3 grasses). The growth of individual trees is simulated on an annual timestep, and the growth of a grass layer is simulated on a daily timestep. The exchange of carbon, nitrogen, and water with the atmosphere and the soil is simulated on a daily timestep (except the flux of tree litter to the soil, which occurs annually). Individual trees and the grass layer compete with each other for light, water, and nitrogen within a 'plot'. Larger and taller plants shade smaller ones; they also take up a greater proportion of the available water and nitrogen. The above-ground space in each plot is divided into 1 m deep layers for the purposes of calculating irradiance interception; horizontal variation in the plot environment is not treated. The soil is represented as a single layer, with a daily hydrological budget. Decomposition of soil organic matter is calculated using an empirical sub-model. The initial size of each tree seedling is stochastic. To predict the mean behaviour of the model for a particular boundary condition it is necessary to simulate a number of plots. Hybrid v3.0 has been written with three major requirements in mind: (i) the carbon, water, and nutrient cycles must be fully coupled in the soil-plant-atmosphere system; (ii) the internal constraints on the model's behaviour, and the driving forces for the model, must be the same as those which operate in nature (e.g., climate, nitrogen deposition, and the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and O-2); and (iii) the model must be constructed so that it is capable of predicting transient as well as equilibrium responses to climate change. These conditions have largely been met by constructing the model around a set of fundamental hypotheses regarding the general constraints under which plants and soils behave, independently of any particular location or time. The model is thus potentially capable of making reliable predictions of ecosystem behaviour and structure under future, new, atmospheric conditions. The model is tested for a site in eastern North America. A quasi-equilibrium is reached after approximately 250 years with 10 plots. It is found that more plots are not necessary in order to obtain a reliable estimate of mean behaviour. Predictions of productivity, leaf area index, foliage nitrogen, soil carbon, and biomass carbon are all within the range expected for this location.

AB Panax the ginseng genus, is one of the most medicinally important genera in the Orient and demonstrates a classical eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct distributional pattern. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and the 5.8S coding region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat were obtained for the 12 species of Panax to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. Of the 2 eastern North American species, P. quinquefolius and P. trifolius, P. quinquefolius was suggested to be more closely related to the eastern Asian species in the ITS tree, while P. trifolius was phylogenetically isolated. Monophyly of the three medicinally most important species, P. ginseng, P. notoginseng, and P. quinquefolius, suggested by previous workers, was not supported by the ITS data. A close phylogenetic relationship between Panax: and Aralia was supported. Several biogeographical implications were inferred: (1) two divergence events have produced the eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct distribution in Panax (2) no intercontinental species pairs are found in Panax; (3) a discrepancy between the sequence divergence pattern and the phylogenetic pattern was observed in Panax, suggesting the need for caution in using sequence divergence data alone in inferring biogeographical patterns; (4) the Himalayas and central and western China are the current centers of diversity of the ginseng genus; and (5) the low ITS sequence divergence and a close relationship among species in that region suggest that rapid evolutionary radiation may have created such a diversity of Panax in the Himalayas and in central and western China.

ID FOREST FRAGMENTATION; POPULATION; DYNAMICS; DENSITY; SURVIVAL; WARBLERS;
   RATES
AB Fragmentation of breeding habitat in North America has been implicated in the decline of forest-nesting, Neotropical migrant birds. We used a comparative approach to examine the effects of fragmentation on three forest-nesting migrants: Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). We surveyed birds and monitored reproductive success on 28 study plots in fragmented and contiguous forests in true midwestern regions. Distribution of individuals between fragmented and contiguous forests appeared to vary among species and regions, but total nest failure was significantly higher in fragments than contiguous forests in both regions for all species (p = 0.053). We attributed greater nest failure to increased nest predation (p = 0.093) and increased brood parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater, p = 0.009). In addition to greater total nest failure partial nest failure due to cowbird parasitism led to a reduction in the number of host fledglings. Although the causes of nest mortality appeared to be species specific, total nest failure and partial nest failure acted in concert to reduce the number of offspring per adult for all three species on fragments. We used simple population growth models to assess the viability of the three species in fragmented and contiguous habitats in both regions. In general populations on fragments appeared to be population sinks and populations on continguous forests appeared to be population sources. Assuming constant mortality during winter, projected growth indicated that without immigration Ovenbird and Red-eyed Vireo populations should become extinct on fragments in both regions and Wood Thrush populations should be maintained or slightly decline on fragments. Populations of all three species should increase in contiguous habitats in both regions without emigration. We suggest that habitat fragmentation reduces local reproduction and may have ramifications for the entire population. A clear understanding of population demography depends on examination of demographic dynamics within and among sources and sinks. We emphasize that the long-term viability of these species depends on maintaining large tracts of forest throughout the breeding range until the spatial scale at which source and sink populations interact can be determined.

AB A long-term, large-scale empirical test of the recruitment limitation hypothesis was done by sampling fish populations from the southern Great Barrier Reef after having monitored their recruitment histories for 9 years. After adjustment for demographic differences, recruitment patterns explained over 90 percent of the spatial variation in abundance of a common damselfish among seven coral reefs. The age structures from individual reefs also preserved major temporal variations in the recruitment signal over at least 10 years. Abundance and demography of this small fish at these spatial and temporal scales can be explained almost entirely as variable recruitment interacting with density-independent mortality.

AB The diversity of organisms and complexity of ecosystems prevent thorough inventory and monitoring of protected areas, yet sound databases are needed to manage ecosystems for long-term persistence. One strategy is therefore to focus monitoring on indicator organisms, but guidelines are lacking for selecting appropriate species or groups. This paper presents a simple protocol based on ordination techniques for establishing the indicator properties of a group of organisms and for selecting an indicator species subset for more intensive monitoring. Use of ordination allows inclusion of many more taxa than have been traditionally used for natural areas monitoring, and need not rely on detailed knowledge of species biology. As an example, I studied the indicator properties of a butterfly taxocene in a rain forest in Madagascar. Butterflies have been suggested as particularly good environmental indicators due to their sensitivity to micro-climate and light level changes, and their interactions as larvae and adults with different sets of host plants. The indicator properties of butterfly assemblages were evaluated in this study with respect to a known pattern of environmental heterogeneity along topographic/moisture and disturbance gradients. Butterfly assemblages were found to be excellent indicators of heterogeneity due to the topographic/moisture gradient, limited indicators of heterogeneity due to anthropogenic disturbance, and poor indicators of plant diversity. The protocol defined in this study is widely applicable to other groups of organisms, spatial scales, and environmental gradients. By examining the environmental correlates of the distribution of species assemblages, this protocol can assess the indicator proper-ties of target species groups.

AB In Holcus lanatus L. phosphate and arsenate are taken up by the same transport system. Short-term uptake kinetics of the high affinity arsenate transport system were determined in excised roots of arsenate-tolerant and non-tolerant genotypes. In tolerant plants the V(max) of ion uptake in plants grown in phosphate-free media was decreased compared to non-tolerant plants, and the affinity of the uptake system was lower than in the non-tolerant plants. Both the reduction in V(max) and the increase in K(m) led to reduced arsenate influx into tolerant roots. When the two genotypes were grown in nutrient solution containing high levels of phosphate, there was little change in the uptake kinetics in tolerant plants. In non-tolerant plants, however, there was a marked decrease in the V(max) to the level of the tolerant plants but with little change in the K(m). This suggests that the low rate of arsenate uptake over a wide range of differing root phosphate status is due to loss of induction of the synthesis of the arsenate (phosphate) carrier.

AB Aim
   Various techniques model a species' niche and potential distribution by comparing the environmental conditions of occurrence localities with those of the overall study region (via a background or pseudoabsence sample). Here, we examine how changes in the extent of the study region (ignored or under-appreciated in most studies) affect models of two rodents, Nephelomys caracolus and Nephelomys meridensis.
   Location
   North-central South America.
   Methods
   We used Maxent to model the species' potential distributions via two methods of defining the study region. In Method 1 (typical of most studies to date), we calibrated the model in a large study region that included the ranges of both species. In Method 2, we calibrated the model using a smaller study region surrounding the localities of the focal species, and then applied it to the larger region. Because the study region of Method 1 is likely to include areas of suitable conditions that are unoccupied because of dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions, this approach is prone to overfitting to conditions found near the occupied localities. In contrast, Method 2 should avoid such problems but may require further assumptions ('clamping' in Maxent) to make predictions for areas with environmental conditions beyond those found in the smaller study region. For each method, we calculated several measures of geographic interpredictivity between predictions for the species (cross-species AUC, cross-species omission rate, and proportional geographic overlap).
   Results
   Compared with Method 1, Method 2 revealed a larger predicted area for each species, less concentrated around known localities (especially for N. caracolus). It also led to higher cross-species AUC values, lower cross-species omission rates and higher proportions of geographic overlap. Clamping was minimal and occurred primarily in regions unlikely to be suitable.
   Main conclusions
   Method 2 led to more realistic predictions and higher estimates of niche conservatism. Conclusions reached by many studies depend on the selection of an appropriate study region. Although detailed information regarding dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions will typically be difficult to obtain, consideration of coarse distributional patterns, topography and vegetational zones often should permit delimitation of a much more reasonable study region than the extremely large ones currently in common use.

AB Forest soil carbon (C) storage is a significant component of the global C cycle, and is important for sustaining forest productivity. Although forest management may have substantial impacts on soil C storage, experimental data from forest harvesting studies have not been synthesized recently. To quantify the effects of harvesting on soil C, and to identify sources of variation in soil C responses to harvest, we used meta-analysis to test a database of 432 soil C response ratios drawn from temperate forest harvest studies around the world. Harvesting reduced soil C by an average of 8 +/- 3% (95% CI), although numerous sources of variation mediated this significant, overall effect. In particular, we found that C concentrations and C pool sizes responded differently to harvesting, and forest floors were more likely to lose C than mineral soils. Harvesting caused forest floor C storage to decline by a remarkably consistent 30 +/- 6%, but losses were significantly smaller in coniferous/mixed stands (-20%) than hardwoods (-36%). Mineral soils showed no significant, overall change in C storage due to harvest, and variation among mineral soils was best explained by soil taxonomy. Alfisols and Spodosols exhibited no significant changes, and Inceptisols and Ultisols lost mineral soil C (-13% and -7%, respectively). However, these C losses were neither permanent nor unavoidable. Controls on variation within orders were not consistent, but included species composition, time, and sampling depth. Temporal patterns and soil C budgets suggest that forest floor C losses probably have a lesser impact on total soil C storage on Alfisols, Inceptisols, and Ultisols than on Spodosols, which store proportionately large amounts of C in forest floors with long C recovery times (50-70 years). Mineral soil C losses on Inceptisols and Ultisols indicate that these orders are vulnerable to significant harvest-induced changes in total soil C storage, but alternative residue management and site preparation techniques, and the passage of time, may mitigate or negate these losses. Key findings of this analysis, including the dependence of forest floor and mineral soil C storage changes on species composition and soil taxonomic order, suggest that further primary research may make it possible to create predictive maps of forest harvesting effects on soil C storage.

AB Our knowledge of the distribution and amount of terrestrial biomass is based almost entirely on ground measurements over an extremely small, and possibly biased sample, with many regions still unmeasured. Our understanding of changes in terrestrial biomass is even more rudimentary, although changes in land use, largely tropical deforestation, are estimated to have reduced biomass, globally. At the same time, however, the global carbon balance requires that terrestrial carbon storage has increased, albeit the exact magnitude, location, and causes of this residual terrestrial sink are still not well quantified. A satellite mission capable of measuring aboveground woody biomass could help reduce these uncertainties by delivering three products. First, a global map of aboveground woody biomass density would halve the uncertainty of estimated carbon emissions from land use change. Second, an annual, global map of natural disturbances could define the unknown but potentially large proportion of the residual terrestrial sink attributable to biomass recovery from such disturbances. Third, direct measurement of changes in aboveground biomass density (without classification of land cover or carbon modeling) would indicate the magnitude and distribution of at least the largest carbon sources (from deforestation and degradation) and sinks (from woody growth). The information would increase our understanding of the carbon cycle, including better information on the magnitude, location, and mechanisms responsible for terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon. This paper lays out the accuracy, spatial resolution, and coverage required for a satellite mission that would generate these products.

AB Evolutionary ecologists and population biologists have recently considered that ecological and evolutionary changes are intimately linked and can occur on the same time-scale. Recent theoretical developments have shown how the feedback between ecological and evolutionary dynamics can be linked, and there are now empirical demonstrations showing that ecological change can lead to rapid evolutionary change. We also have evidence that microevolutionary change can leave an ecological signature. We are at a stage where the integration of ecology and evolution is a necessary step towards major advances in our understanding of the processes that shape and maintain biodiversity. This special feature about 'eco-evolutionary dynamics' brings together biologists from empirical and theoretical backgrounds to bridge the gap between ecology and evolution and provide a series of contributions aimed at quantifying the interactions between these fundamental processes.

AB Background: The timescale of prokaryote evolution has been difficult to reconstruct because of a limited fossil record and complexities associated with molecular clocks and deep divergences. However, the relatively large number of genome sequences currently available has provided a better opportunity to control for potential biases such as horizontal gene transfer and rate differences among lineages. We assembled a data set of sequences from 32 proteins (similar to 7600 amino acids) common to 72 species and estimated phylogenetic relationships and divergence times with a local clock method.
   Results: Our phylogenetic results support most of the currently recognized higher-level groupings of prokaryotes. Of particular interest is a well-supported group of three major lineages of eubacteria ( Actinobacteria, Deinococcus, and Cyanobacteria) that we call Terrabacteria and associate with an early colonization of land. Divergence time estimates for the major groups of eubacteria are between 2.5 - 3.2 billion years ago (Ga) while those for archaebacteria are mostly between 3.1 - 4.1 Ga. The time estimates suggest a Hadean origin of life ( prior to 4.1 Ga), an early origin of methanogenesis (3.8 - 4.1 Ga), an origin of anaerobic methanotrophy after 3.1 Ga, an origin of phototrophy prior to 3.2 Ga, an early colonization of land 2.8 - 3.1 Ga, and an origin of aerobic methanotrophy 2.5 - 2.8 Ga.
   Conclusions: Our early time estimates for methanogenesis support the consideration of methane, in addition to carbon dioxide, as a greenhouse gas responsible for the early warming of the Earths' surface. Our divergence times for the origin of anaerobic methanotrophy are compatible with highly depleted carbon isotopic values found in rocks dated 2.8 - 2.6 Ga. An early origin of phototrophy is consistent with the earliest bacterial mats and structures identified as stromatolites, but a 2.6 Ga origin of cyanobacteria suggests that those Archean structures, if biologically produced, were made by anoxygenic photosynthesizers. The resistance to desiccation of Terrabacteria and their elaboration of photoprotective compounds suggests that the common ancestor of this group inhabited land. If true, then oxygenic photosynthesis may owe its origin to terrestrial adaptations.

AB Fecal glucocorticoid metabolite analyses are increasingly being used by a variety of scientists (e.g., conservation biologists, animal scientists) to examine glucocorticoid (i.e., stress hormone) secretion in domestic and wild vertebrates. Adrenocortical activity (i.e., stress response) is of interest to conservation biologists because stress can alter animal behavior, reduce resistance to disease, and affect population performance. The noninvasiveness of fecal-based assessments is attractive, particularly when studying endangered species, because samples can often be obtained without disturbing the animal. Despite such advantages, many confounding factors inhibit the utility of this technique in addressing conservation problems. In particular, interpretation of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) measures may be confounded by the length of time animals are held in captivity, normal seasonal and daily rhythms, body condition. sample storage and treatment techniques, diet of the animal, assay selection, animal status (i.e., social ranking, reproductive status), sample age and condition, and sample mass. Further complicating interpretation and utility of these measures is the apparent species-specific response to these factors. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the factors that confound interpretation of FGM measures, summarize research that addresses these issues, and offer an agenda for future research and interpretation. We urge conservation biologists to carefully consider confounding factors and the relationship between FGM secretion and population performance and biological costs when investigating effects of environmental and human-induced disturbances on wildlife. The crisis nature of many decisions in conservation biology often requires decisions from limited data; however, confirmatory results should not be posited when data are incomplete or confounding factors are not understood. Building reliable databases, and research with surrogate species when possible, will aid future efforts and enhance the utility of FGM assays. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Designing an efficient sampling strategy is of crucial importance for habitat suitability modelling. This paper compares four such strategies, namely, 'random', 'regular', 'proportional-stratified' and 'equal -stratified'- to investigate (1) how they affect prediction accuracy and (2) how sensitive they are to sample size. In order to compare them, a virtual species approach (Ecol. Model. 145 (2001) 111) in a real landscape, based on reliable data, was chosen. The distribution of the virtual species was sampled 300 times using each of the four strategies in four sample sizes. The sampled data were then fed into a GLM to make two types of prediction: (1) habitat suitability and (2) presence/ absence. Comparing the predictions to the known distribution of the virtual species allows model accuracy to be assessed. Habitat suitability predictions were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and presence/absence predictions by Cohen's K agreement coefficient. The results show the 'regular' and 'equal-stratified' sampling strategies to be the most accurate and most robust. We propose the following characteristics to improve sample design: (1) increase sample size, (2) prefer systematic to random sampling and (3) include environmental information in the design'.

AB Some 60% of coastal rivers and bays in the U.S. have been moderately to severely degraded by nutrient pollution. Both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contribute to the problem, although for most coastal systems N additions cause more damage. Globally, human activity has increased the flux of N and P from land to the oceans by 2-fold and 3-fold, respectively. For N, much of this increase has occurred over the past 40 years, with the increase varying by region. Human activity has increased the flux of N in the Mississippi River basin by 4-fold, in the rivers of the northeastern U.S. by 8-fold, and in the rivers draining to the North Sea by more than 10-fold. The sources of nutrients to the coast vary. For some estuaries, sewage treatment plants are the largest single input; for most systems nonpoint sources of nutrients are now of relatively greater importance, both because of improved point source treatment and control (particularly for P) and because of increases in the total magnitude of nonpoint sources (particularly for N) over the past three decades. For P, agricultural activities dominate nonpoint source fluxes. Agriculture is also the major source of N in many systems, including the flux of N down the Mississippi River, which has contributed to the large hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. For both P and N, agriculture contributes to nonpoint source pollution both through losses at the field scale, as soils erode away and fertilizer is leached to surface and ground waters, and from losses from animal feedlot operations. In the U.S. N from animal wastes that leaks directly to surface waters or is volatilized to the atmosphere as ammonia may be the single largest source of N that moves from agricultural operations into coastal waters. In some regions, including the northeastern U.S., atmospheric deposition of oxidized N from fossil-fuel combustion is the major flux from nonpoint sources. This atmospheric component of the N flux into estuaries has often been underestimated, particularly with respect to deposition onto the terrestrial landscape with subsequent export downstream. Because the relative importance of these nutrient sources varies among regions and sites, so too must appropriate and effective mitigation strategies. The regional nature and variability of nutrient sources require that nutrient management efforts address large geographic areas.

AB [1] While most land models developed for use with climate models represent vegetation as discrete biomes, this is, at least for mixed life-form biomes, inconsistent with the leaf-level and whole-plant physiological parameterizations needed to couple these biogeophysical models with biogeochemical and ecosystem dynamics models. In this paper, we present simulations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research land surface model (NCAR LSM) that examined the effect of representing vegetation as patches of plant functional types (PFTs) that coexist within a model grid cell. This approach is consistent with ecological theory and models and allows for unified treatment of vegetation in climate and ecosystem models. In the standard NCAR LSM the PFT composition and leaf area for each grid cell are obtained by classifying grid cells as 1 of 28 possible biomes. Here, we develop a data set from 1-km satellite data that provides each model grid cell a unique PFT composition and leaf area for each PFT. Global simulations at 3degrees x 3degrees spatial resolution showed that ground temperature, ground evaporation, and northern high-latitude winter albedo exhibited direct responses to these landscape changes, which led to indirect effects such as in soil moisture and sensible and latent heat fluxes. Additional simulations at 2degrees x 2degrees and 1degrees x 1degrees spatial resolution showed that low-resolution simulations masked landscape heterogeneity in both approaches but the satellite-based, continuous representation of vegetation reduced model sensitivity to resolution. It is argued that the use of spatially continuous distributions of coexisting PFTs is a necessary step to link climate and ecosystem models.

ID CO2; CYCLE; AIR; DIOXIDE; OXYGEN; RATIO
AB Recent time-series measurements of atmospheric O-2 show that the land biosphere and world oceans annually sequestered 1.4 +/- 0.8 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 gigatons of carbon, respectively between mid-1991 and mid-1997. The rapid storage of carbon by the Land biosphere from 1991 to 1997 contrasts with the 1980s, when the land biosphere was approximately neutral. Comparison with measurements of delta(13)CO(2) implies an isotopic flux of 89 +/- 21 gigatons of carbon per mil per year, in agreement with model- and inventory-based estimates of this flux. Both the delta(13)C and the O-2 data show significant interannual variability in carbon storage over the period of record. The general agreement of the independent estimates from O-2 and delta(13)C is a robust signal of variable carbon uptake by both the Land biosphere and the oceans.

AB Wildfires across western North America have increased in number and size over the past three decades, and this trend will continue in response to further warming. As a consequence, the wildland-urban interface is projected to experience substantially higher risk of climate-driven fires in the coming decades. Although many plants, animals, and ecosystem services benefit from fire, it is unknown how ecosystems will respond to increased burning and warming. Policy and management have focused primarily on specified resilience approaches aimed at resistance to wildfire and restoration of areas burned by wildfire through fire suppression and fuels management. These strategies are inadequate to address a new era of western wildfires. In contrast, policies that promote adaptive resilience to wildfire, by which people and ecosystems adjust and reorganize in response to changing fire regimes to reduce future vulnerability, are needed. Key aspects of an adaptive resilience approach are (i) recognizing that fuels reduction cannot alter regional wildfire trends; (ii) targeting fuels reduction to increase adaptation by some ecosystems and residential communities to more frequent fire; (iii) actively managing more wild and prescribed fires with a range of severities; and (iv) incentivizing and planning residential development to withstand inevitable wildfire. These strategies represent a shift in policy and management from restoring ecosystems based on historical baselines to adapting to changing fire regimes and from unsustainable defense of the wildlandurban interface to developing fire-adapted communities. We propose an approach that accepts wildfire as an inevitable catalyst of change and that promotes adaptive responses by ecosystems and residential communities to more warming and wildfire.

AB Anthropogenic drivers of environmental change often have multiple effects, including changes in biodiversity, species composition, and ecosystem functioning. It remains unknown whether such shifts in biodiversity and species composition may, themselves, be major contributors to the total, long-term impacts of anthropogenic drivers on ecosystem functioning. Moreover, although numerous experiments have shown that random losses of species impact the functioning of ecosystems, human-caused losses of biodiversity are rarely random. Here we use results from long-term grassland field experiments to test for direct effects of chronic nutrient enrichment on ecosystem productivity, and for indirect effects of enrichment on productivity mediated by resultant species losses. We found that ecosystem productivity decreased through time most in plots that lost the most species. Chronic nitrogen addition also led to the nonrandom loss of initially dominant native perennial C-4 grasses. This loss of dominant plant species was associated with twice as great a loss of productivity per lost species than occurred with random species loss in a nearby biodiversity experiment. Thus, although chronic nitrogen enrichment initially increased productivity, it also led to loss of plant species, including initially dominant species, which then caused substantial diminishing returns from nitrogen fertilization. In contrast, elevated CO2 did not decrease grassland plant diversity, and it consistently promoted productivity over time. Our results support the hypothesis that the long-term impacts of anthropogenic drivers of environmental change on ecosystem functioning can strongly depend on how such drivers gradually decrease biodiversity and restructure communities.

ID PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; EXTINCTION RISK; BIODIVERSITY; PREDICTORS; TRAITS;
   NICHE
AB Many species are projected to become vulnerable to twenty-first-century climate changes(1,2), with consequent effects on the tree of life. If losses were not randomly distributed across the tree of life, climate change could lead to a disproportionate loss of evolutionary history(3-5). Here we estimate the consequences of climate change on the phylogenetic diversities of plant, bird and mammal assemblages across Europe. Using a consensus across ensembles of forecasts for 2020, 2050 and 2080 and high-resolution phylogenetic trees, we show that species vulnerability to climate change clusters weakly across phylogenies. Such phylogenetic signal in species vulnerabilities does not lead to higher loss of evolutionary history than expected with a model of random extinctions. This is because vulnerable species have neither fewer nor closer relatives than the remaining clades. Reductions in phylogenetic diversity will be greater in southern Europe, and gains are expected in regions of high latitude or altitude. However, losses will not be offset by gains and the tree of life faces a trend towards homogenization across the continent.

AB Mechanistic models of community assembly state that biotic and abiotic filters constrain species establishment through selection on their functional traits. Predicting this assembly process is hampered because few studies directly incorporate environmental measurements and scale LIP from species to community level and because the functional traits' significance is environment dependent. We analyzed community assembly by measuring structure, environmental conditions, and species traits of secondary forests in a species-rich tropical system. We found, as hypothesized, that community structure shaped the local environment and that strong relationships existed between this environment and the traits of the most Successful species of the regeneration communities. Path and multivariate analyses showed that temperature and leaf traits that regulate it were the most important factors of community differentiation. Comparisons between the trait composition of the forest's regeneration, juvenile, and adult communities showed a Consistent community assembly pattern. These results allowed LIS to identify the major functional traits and environmental factors involved in the assembly of dry-forest Communities and demonstrate that environmental filtering is a predictable and fundamental process of community assembly, even in a complex system such as a tropical forest.

AB Intact ecosystems contain large numbers of competing but coexisting species. Although numerous alternative theories have provided potential explanations for this high biodiversity, there have been few field experiments testing between these theories. In particular, theory predicts that higher diversity of coexisting competitors could result from greater niche dimensionality(1), for example larger numbers of limiting resources or factors. Alternatively, diversity could be independent of niche dimensionality because large numbers of species can coexist when limited by just one or two factors if species have appropriate trade-offs(2). Here we show that plant coexistence and diversity result from the 'niche dimensionality' of a habitat. Plant species numbers decreased with increasing numbers of added limiting soil resources ( soil moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus and base cations), which is consistent with theoretical predictions that an increased supply of multiple limiting resources can reduce niche dimension. An observational field study gave similar results. The niche dimension hypothesis also explained diversity changes in the classic Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted. Our results provide an alternative mechanistic explanation for the effects of nutrient eutrophication on the diversity of terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.

AB The ecosystem engineering concept focuses on how organisms physically change the abiotic environment and how this feeds back to the biota. While the concept was formally introduced a little more than 10 years ago, the underpinning of the concept can be traced back to more than a century to the early work of Darwin. The formal application of the idea is yielding new insights into the role of species in ecosystems and many other areas of basic and applied ecology. Here we focus on how temporal, spatial and organizational scales usefully inform the roles played by ecosystem engineers and their incorporation into broader ecological contexts. Two particular, distinguishing features of ecosystem engineers are that they affect the physical space in which other species live and their direct effects can last longer than the lifetime of the organism - engineering can in essence outlive the engineer. Together, these factors identify critical considerations that need to be included in models, experimental and observational work. The ecosystem engineering concept holds particular promise in the area of ecological applications, where influence over abiotic variables and their consequent effects on biotic communities may facilitate ecological restoration and counterbalance anthropogenic influences.

AB Roads present formidable barriers to dispersal. We examine movements of two highly mobile carnivores across the Ventura Freeway near Los Angeles, one of the busiest highways in the United States. The two species, bobcats and coyotes, can disappear from habitats isolated and fragmented by roads, and their ability to disperse across the Ventura Freeway tests the limits of vertebrates to overcome anthropogenic obstacles. We combine radio-telemetry data and genetically based assignments to identify individuals that have crossed the freeway. Although the freeway is a significant barrier to dispersal, we find that carnivores can cross the freeway and that 5-32% of sampled carnivores crossed over a 7-year period. However, despite moderate levels of migration, populations on either side of the freeway are genetically differentiated, and coalescent modelling shows their genetic isolation is consistent with a migration fraction less than 0.5% per generation. These results imply that individuals that cross the freeway rarely reproduce. Highways and development impose artificial home range boundaries on territorial and reproductive individuals and hence decrease genetically effective migration. Further, territory pile-up at freeway boundaries may decrease reproductive opportunities for dispersing individuals that do manage to cross. Consequently, freeways are filters favouring dispersing individuals that add to the migration rate but little to gene flow. Our results demonstrate that freeways can restrict gene flow even in wide-ranging species and suggest that for territorial animals, migration levels across anthropogenic barriers need to be an order of magnitude larger than commonly assumed to counteract genetic differentiation.

AB Pathogens that can infect multiple host species will have different dynamics than pathogens that are restricted to a single species of host. This article examines the conditions for establishment and long-term population dynamic behavior of pathogens that infect multiple species of hosts. The article attempts to address three major questions in this area: First, under which conditions will increases in the diversity of host species buffer infectious disease outbreaks, and under which conditions will host diversity amplify disease outbreaks? Second, under what conditions is it possible to control an infectious agent by focusing control against only one host species? Third, what role does host species diversity play in maintaining pathogen persistence? The answers to these questions supply some important general insights into the role that biodiversity plays in buffering humans and other species against new and emerging pathogens.

AB Coral reefs worldwide are being degraded because of global warming (coral bleaching) and coastal development (sedimentation and eutrophication). Predicting the risk of species extinctions from this type of habitat degradation is one of the most challenging and urgent tasks facing ecologists. Habitat specialists are thought to be more prone to extinction than generalists; however, specialists may be more susceptible to extinction because (1) they are specialists per se, (2) they are less abundant than generalists, or (3) both. Here, I show that declines in coral abundance lead to corresponding declines in the abundance of coral-dwelling fishes, but with proportionally greater losses to specialists than generalists. In addition, specialists have smaller initial population sizes than generalists. Consequently, specialists face a dual risk of extinction because their already small populations decline more rapidly than those of generalists. Corresponding with this increased extinction risk, I describe the local extinction of one specialist species and the near-global extinction of another species. I conclude that habitat specialists will be the first species lost from coral reefs because their small populations suffer the most from human-induced disturbances.

AB Pursuit of sustainable development requires a systems approach to the design of industrial product and service systems. Although many business enterprises have adopted sustainability goals, the actual development of sustainable systems remains challenging because of the broad range of economic, environmental and social factors that need to be considered across the system life cycle. Traditional systems engineering practices try to anticipate and resist disruptions but may be vulnerable to unforeseen factors. An alternative is to design systems with inherent "resilience" by taking advantage of fundamental properties such as diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Previous work on sustainable design has focused largely upon ecological efficiency improvements. For example, companies have found that reducing material and energy intensity and converting wastes into valuable secondary products creates value for shareholders as well as for society at large. To encourage broader systems thinking, a design protocol is presented that involves the following steps: identifying system function and boundaries, establishing requirements, selecting appropriate technologies, developing a system design, evaluating anticipated performance, and devising a practical means for system deployment. The approach encourages explicit consideration of resilience in both engineered systems and the larger systems in which they are embedded.

AB Many marine organisms are sedentary as adults and are redistributed between generations by the oceanic transport of planktonic larvae. In order to assess interactions among oceanographic and biological processes that determine larval dispersal patterns, we introduce a Lagrangian (or water-parcel-following) description of larval transport. This formalism is used to determine larval dispersal kernels (larval settlement probability distributions) for a range of ocean flows, planktonic larval durations and settlement pre-competency/competency periods. Paths of individual planktonic larval releases are modeled statistically and, by averaging over many individuals, ensemble estimates of larval dispersal are determined. Typical dispersal scales vary from a few km to >400 km. Modeled dispersal kernels are well explained using only a few readily available biological and oceanographic parameters, and derived dispersal scales agree well with population-genetic estimates, suggesting that the model has reasonable predictive power. An index for regional-scale self-seeding is presented, and is used as a tool to evaluate the efficiency of marine conservation areas. Finally, settlement patterns resulting from larval releases made over short times (days to months) should be comprised of a small number of discrete samples taken from the long-term averaged dispersal kernel. The resulting larval dispersal patterns will be quasi-random in both space and time, which will have important implications for the interpretation of settlement time series and the prediction of recruitment of sessile organisms.

AB While ecologists are well aware that spatial heterogeneity is scale-dependent, a general understanding of scaling relationships of spatial pattern is still lacking. One way to improve this understanding is to systematically examine how pattern indices change with scale in real landscapes of different kinds. This study, therefore, was designed to investigate how a suite of commonly used landscape metrics respond to changing grain size, extent, and the direction of analysis (or sampling) using several different landscapes in North America. Our results showed that the responses of the 19 landscape metrics fell into three general categories: Type I metrics showed predictable responses with changing scale, and their scaling relations could be represented by simple scaling equations (linear, power-law, or logarithmic functions); Type II metrics exhibited staircase-like responses that were less predictable; and Type III metrics behaved erratically in response to changing scale, suggesting no consistent scaling relations. In general, the effect of changing grain size was more predictable than that of changing extent. Type I metrics represent those landscape features that can be readily and accurately extrapolated or interpolated across spatial scales, whereas Type II and III metrics represent those that require more explicit consideration of idiosyncratic details for successful scaling. To adequately quantify spatial heterogeneity, the metric-scalograms (the response curves of metrics to changing scale), instead of single-scale measures, seem necessary.

AB Spatially explicit information on the species composition and structure of forest vegetation is needed at broad spatial scales for natural resource policy analysis and ecological research. We present a method for predictive vegetation mapping that applies direct gradient analysis and nearest-neighbor imputation to ascribe detailed ground attributes of vegetation to each pixel in a digital landscape map. The gradient nearest neighbor method integrates vegetation measurements from regional grids of field plots, mapped environmental data, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. In the Oregon coastal province, species gradients were most strongly associated with regional climate and geographic location, whereas variation in forest structure was best explained by Landsat TM variables. At the regional level, mapped predictions represented the range of variability in the sample data, and predicted area by vegetation type closely matched sample-based estimates. At the site level, mapped predictions maintained the covariance structure among multiple response variables. Prediction accuracy for tree species occurrence and several measures of vegetation structure and composition was good to moderate. Vegetation maps produced with the gradient nearest neighbor method are appropriately used for regional-level planning, policy analysis, and research, not to guide local management decisions.

AB Plant pathogens cause mortality and reduce fecundity of individual plants, drive host population dynamics, and affect the structure and composition of natural plant communities. Pathogens are responsible for both numerical changes in host populations and evolutionary changes through selection for resistant genotypes. Linking such ecological and evolutionary dynamics has been the focus of a growing body of literature on the effects of plant diseases in natural ecosystems. A guiding principle is the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal scales at which plants and pathogens interact. This review summarizes the effects of diseases on populations of wild plants, focusing in particular on the mediation of plant competition and succession, the maintenance of plant species diversity, as well as the process of rapid evolutionary changes in host-pathogen symbioses.

AB Leaf structural and chemical characteristics were compared in pairs of species that were phylogenetically independently contrasted along rainfall gradients (10 pairs) or soil nutrient gradients (9 pairs), using perennial plants in New South Wales, Australia. The objective was to test hypotheses regarding leaf attributes that should be successful in sustaining populations in vegetation at lower vs. higher rainfall or lower vs. higher soil nutrients, and especially to assess the proposition that lower rainfall and lower soil nutrients favor similar shifts in leaf attributes, and in this sense can be grouped together as sources of "stress." Some evolutionary divergences in leaf structure occurred repeatedly toward the lower end of both rainfall and soil nutrient gradients. These include narrower leaves, lower specific leaf area (SLA), thicker lamina, and denser leaf tissue. In other respects, the different resource gradients appeared to favor different leaf attributes. In 8 of 10 contrasts, plants of low-water environments had more sclerified vasculature than their relatives on higher rainfall sites. This may be an adaptation to resist wilting and so mitigate cell damage. In 9 of 10 contrasts, plants of low-water environments had more nitrogen per unit leaf area than their relatives in high-rainfall sites. This may be to exploit higher light availability in arid communities. In 7 of 9 contrasts, plants from low soil nutrient environments had thicker epidermis than their relatives on higher nutrient soils. In 8 of 9 soil nutrient contrasts, leaf nitrogen concentration was lower in the low-nutrient species, and consequently, the ratios of phenol/N and tannin/N were higher. Thicker epidermis and increased defense/N ratios may reduce herbivory and thereby reduce demand on soil nutrients required to replace leaves.

AB Fish exhibit an enormous variety of reproductive patterns. There is external and internal fertilization, simultaneous and sequential hermaphroditism as well as gonochorism, and an extremely widespread occurrence of parasitic reproductive behaviour among males. In most fish species there is a great size range of reproductive males, setting the stage for divergent, intraspecific reproductive patterns and an unparalleled concentration of alternative male reproductive phenotypes. Recent theoretical, empirical and comparative evidence suggests that adaptations to sperm competition in fish might be responsible for some of the most intriguing examples of reproductive design known.

AB Twelve aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes have been identified in humans. These genes, located on different chromosomes, encode a group of enzymes which oxidizes varieties of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. Metabolic disorders and clinical problems associated with mutations of ALDH1. ALDH2, ALDH4, ALDH10 and succinic semialdehyde (SSDH) genes have been emerged. Comparison of the human ALDHs indicates a wide range ol divergency (> 80-<15 % identity at the protein sequence level) among them. However, several protein regions, some of which are implicated in functional activities, are conserved in the family members.
   The phylogenic tree constructed of 56 ALDH sequences of humans, animals, fungi, protozoa and eubacteria, suggests that the present-day human ALDH genes were derived from four ancestral genes that existed prior to the divergence of Eubacteria and Eukaryotes. The neighbor-joining tree derived from 12 human ALDHs and antiquitin indicates that diversification within the ALDH1/2/5/6 gene cluster occurred during the Neoproterozoic period (about 800 million years ago). Duplication in the ALDH 3/10/7/8 gene cluster occurred in Phanerozoic period (about 300 million years ago). Separations of ALDH3/ALDH10 and that of ALDH7/ALDH8 had occurred during the period of appearance and radiation of mammalian species.

AB Peatlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, amounting to approximately 455 Pg. Carbon builds up in these water-saturated environments owing to the presence of phenolic compounds-which inhibit microbial activity and therefore prevent the breakdown of organic matter. Anoxic conditions limit the activity of phenol oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of phenolic compounds. Droughts introduce oxygen into these systems, and the frequency of these events is rising. Here, we combine in vitro manipulations, mesocosm experiments and field observations to examine the impact of drought on peatland carbon loss. We show that drought stimulates bacterial growth and phenol oxidase activity, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of phenolic compounds in peat. This further stimulates microbial growth, causing the breakdown of organic matter and the release of carbon dioxide in a biogeochemical cascade. We further show that re-wetting the peat accelerates carbon losses to the atmosphere and receiving waters, owing to drought-induced increases in nutrient and labile carbon levels, which raise pH and stimulate anaerobic decomposition. We suggest that severe drought, and subsequent re-wetting, could destabilize peatland carbon stocks; understanding this process could aid understanding of interactions between peatlands and other environmental trends, and lead to the development of strategies for increasing carbon stocks.

AB The initial response of individuals to human-induced environmental change is often behavioural. This can improve the performance of individuals under sudden, large-scale perturbations and maintain viable populations. The response can also give additional time for genetic changes to arise and, hence, facilitate adaptation to new conditions. On the other hand, maladaptive responses, which reduce individual fitness, may occur when individuals encounter conditions that the population has not experienced during its evolutionary history, which can decrease population viability. A growing number of studies find human disturbances to induce behavioural responses, both directly and by altering factors that influence fitness. Common causes of behavioural responses are changes in the transmission of information, the concentration of endocrine disrupters, the availability of resources, the possibility of dispersal, and the abundance of interacting species. Frequent responses are alterations in habitat choice, movements, foraging, social behaviour and reproductive behaviour. Behavioural responses depend on the genetically determined reaction norm of the individuals, which evolves over generations. Populations first respond with individual behavioural plasticity, whereafter changes may arise through innovations and the social transmission of behavioural patterns within and across generations, and, finally, by evolution of the behavioural response over generations. Only a restricted number of species show behavioural adaptations that make them thrive in severely disturbed environments. Hence, rapid human-induced disturbances often decrease the diversity of native species, while facilitating the spread of invasive species with highly plastic behaviours. Consequently, behavioural responses to human-induced environmental change can have profound effects on the distribution, adaptation, speciation and extinction of populations and, hence, on biodiversity. A better understanding of the mechanisms of behavioural responses and their causes and consequences could improve our ability to predict the effects of human-induced environmental change on individual species and on biodiversity.

AB Aim To determine the functional relationships between, and the relative importance of, different driver variables (mean annual precipitation, soil properties, fire and herbivory) in regulating woody plant cover across broad environmental gradients in African savannas.
   Location Savanna grasslands of East, West and Southern Africa.
   Methods The dependence of woody cover on mean annual precipitation (MAP), soil properties (texture, nitrogen mineralization potential and total phosphorus), fire regimes, and herbivory (grazer, browser + mixed feeder, and elephant biomass) was determined for 161 savanna sites across Africa using stochastic gradient boosting, a refinement of the regression tree analysis technique.
   Results All variables were significant predictors of woody cover, collectively explaining 71% of the variance in our data set. However, their relative importance as regulators of woody cover varied. MAP was the most important predictor, followed by fire return periods, soil characteristics and herbivory regimes. Woody cover showed a strong positive dependence on MAP between 200 and 700 mm, but no dependence on MAP above this threshold when the effects of other predictors were accounted for. Fires served to reduce woody cover below rainfall-determined levels. Woody cover showed a complex, non-linear relationship with total soil phosphorus, and was negatively correlated with clay content. There was a strong negative dependence of woody cover on soil nitrogen (N) availability, suggesting that increased N-deposition may cause shifts in savannas towards more grassy states. Elephants, mixed feeders and browsers had negative effects on woody cover. Grazers, on the other hand, depressed woody cover at low biomass, but favoured woody vegetation when their biomass exceeded a certain threshold.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate complex and contrasting relationships between woody cover, rainfall, soil properties and disturbance regimes in savannas, and suggest that future environmental changes such as altered precipitation regimes, N-enrichment and elevated levels of CO2 are likely to have opposing, and potentially interacting, influences on the tree-grass balance in savannas.

AB The way predators control their prey populations is determined by the interplay between predator hunting mode and prey antipredator behavior. It is uncertain, however, how the effects of such interplay control ecosystem function. A 3- year experiment in grassland mesocosms revealed that actively hunting spiders reduced plant species diversity and enhanced aboveground net primary production and nitrogen mineralization rate, whereas sit- and- wait ambush spiders had opposite effects. These effects arise from the different responses to the two different predators by their grasshopper prey- the dominant herbivore species that controls plant species composition and accordingly ecosystem functioning. Predator hunting mode is thus a key functional trait that can help to explain variation in the nature of top- down control of ecosystems.

AB Stoichiometric relations in plants, with emphasis on C:N:P, are reviewed. Both theoretically and empirically it is found for whole plants as well as for different tissues that: nitrogen concentrations increase slower than phosphorus concentrations. A lack of data prevents the establishment of relations between nitrogen and other elements. Optimal element ratios where elements are simultaneously limiting growth can be established. There is a considerable variability around these optimal ratios in observed values. Conclusions about the ecological significance of stoichiometric relations based on these observations may therefore be biased. The significance of this variability remains to be established.

AB Ecologists have long been puzzled by the fact that there are so many similar species in nature. Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.

AB We present a multisite analysis of the relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning within the European BIODEPTH network of plant-diversity manipulation experiments. We report results of the analysis of 11 variables addressing several aspects of key ecosystem processes like biomass production, resource use (space, light, and nitrogen), and decomposition, measured across three years in plots of varying plant species richness at eight different European grassland field sites. Differences among sites explained substantial and significant amounts of the variation of most of the ecosystem processes examined. However, against this background of geographic variation, all the aspects of plant diversity and composition we examined (i.e., both numbers and types of species and functional groups) produced significant, mostly positive impacts on ecosystem processes.
   Analyses using the additive partitioning method revealed that complementarity effects (greater net yields than predicted from monocultures due to resource partitioning, positive interactions, etc.) were stronger and more consistent than selection effects (the covariance between monoculture yield and change in yield in mixtures) caused by dominance of species with particular traits. In general, communities with a higher diversity of species and functional groups were more productive and utilized resources more completely by intercepting more light, taking up more nitrogen, and occupying more of the available space. Diversity had significant effects through both increased vegetation cover and greater nitrogen retention by plants when this resource was more abundant through N-2 fixation by legumes. However, additional positive diversity effects remained even after controlling for differences in vegetation cover and for the presence of legumes in communities. Diversity effects were stronger on above- than belowground processes. In particular, clear diversity effects on decomposition were only observed at one of the eight sites.
   The ecosystem effects of plant diversity also varied between sites and years. In general, diversity effects were lowest in the first year and stronger later in the experiment, indicating that they were not transitional due to community establishment. These analyses of our complete ecosystem process data set largely reinforce our previous results, and those from comparable biodiversity experiments, and extend the generality of diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships to multiple sites, years, and processes.

AB Habitat alteration and biotic invasions are the two leading causes of global environmental change and biodiversity loss. Recent innovative experiments have shown that habitat disturbance can have drastic effects that cascade to adjacent ecosystems by altering the flow of resource subsidies from donor systems. Likewise, exotic species invasions could alter subsidies and affect distant food webs, but very few studies have tested this experimentally. Here we report evidence from a large-scale field experiment in northern Japan that invasion of normative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) interrupted reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey that drove stream and adjacent riparian forest food webs. Rainbow trout usurped terrestrial prey that fell into the stream, causing native Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma) to shift their foraging to insects that graze algae from the stream bottom. This indirectly increased algal biomass, but also decreased biomass of adult aquatic insects emerging from the stream to the forest. In turn, this led to a 65% reduction in the density of riparian-specialist spiders in the forest. Thus, species invasions can interrupt flows of resources between interconnected ecosystems and have effects that propagate across their boundaries, effects that may be difficult to anticipate without in-depth understanding of food web relationships.

ID CHALK-GRASSLAND; BUTTERFLIES; MANAGEMENT
AB The conservation of biological diversity requires an integrated approach covering the ecological demands of a multitude of species. Integration may be achieved by focusing on a careful selection of target species, which is rare in practice. Calcareous grasslands offer a case in point. Although they harbour a high diversity of both plant and insect species, in management the emphasis is placed on the flora. This results in an underestimation of, notably, the importance of structural heterogeneity in the vegetation. As an apparent consequence, conservation management in the Netherlands has been much more successful for the flora than for butterflies. In contrast. Germany shows promising efforts to integrate both plant and animal species in conservation management and landscape planning. The main constraints for a successfully integrated conservation management presently consist of a limited availability and exchange of information, and an insufficient organisation of research and management at an international level.

AB The problem of inferring confidence sets of gene trees is discussed without assuming that the substitution model or the branching pattern of any of the investigated trees is correct. In this case, widely used methods to compare genealogies can give highly contradicting results. Here, three methods to infer confidence sets that are robust against model misspecification are compared, including a new approach based on estimating the confidence in a specific tree using expected-likelihood weights. The power of the investigated methods is studied by analysing HIV-1 and mtDNA sequence data as well as simulated sequences. Finally, guidelines for choosing an appropriate method to compare multiple gene trees are provided.

AB An important principle of environmental science is that changes in single components of systems are likely to have consequences elsewhere in the same systems. In the sea, food web data are one of the few foundations for predicting such indirect effects, whether of fishery exploitation or following recovery in marine protected areas (MPAs). We review the available literature on one type of indirect interaction in benthic marine ecosystems, namely trophic cascades, which involve three or more trophic levels connected by predation, Because many indirect effects have been revealed through fishery exploitation, in some cases we include humans as trophic levels. Our purpose is to establish how widespread cascades might be, and infer how likely they are to affect the properties of communities following the implementation of MPAs or intensive resource exploitation We review 39 documented cascades (eight of which include humans as a trophic level) from 21 locations around the world; all but two of the cascades are from shallow systems underlain by hard substrata (kelp forests, rocky subtidal, coral reefs and rocky intertidal), We argue that these systems are well represented because they are accessible and also amenable to the type of work that is necessary, Nineteen examples come from the central-eastern and north-eastern Pacific, while no well-substantiated benthic cascades have been reported from the NE, CE or SW Atlantic, the Southern Oceans, E Indian Ocean or NW Pacific, The absence of examples from those zones is probably due to lack of study. Sea urchins are very prominent in the subtidal examples, and gastropods, especially limpets, in the intertidal examples; we suggest that this may reflect their predation by fewer specialist predators than is the case with fishes, but also their conspicuousness to investigators. The variation in ecological resolution amongst studies, and in intensity of study amongst systems and regions, indicates that more cascades will likely be identified in due course. Broadening the concept of cascades to include pathogenic interactions would immediately increase the number of examples. The existing evidence is that cascade effects are to be expected when hard-substratum systems are subject to artisanal resource exploitation, but that the particular problems of macroalgal overgrowth on Caribbean reefs and the expansion of coralline barrens in the Mediterranean rocky-sublittoral will not be readily reversed in MPAs, probably because factors other than predation-based cascades have contributed to them in the first place. More cascade effects are likely to be found in the soft-substratum systems that are crucial to so many large-scale fisheries, when opportunities such as those of MPAs and fishing gradients become available for study of such systems, and the search is widened to less conspicuous focal organisms such as polychaetes and crustaceans.

AB We describe a new PCR-based method for distinguishing human and cow fecal contamination in coastal waters without culturing indicator organisms, and we show that the method can be used to track bacterial marker sequences in complex environments. We identified two human-specific genetic markers and five cow-specific genetic markers in fecal samples by amplifying 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments from members of the genus Bifidobacterium and the Bacteroides-Prevotella group and performing length heterogeneity PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. Host-specific patterns suggested that there are species composition differences in the Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides-Prevotella populations of human and cow feces. The patterns were highly reproducible among different hosts belonging to the same species. Additionally, all host-specific genetic markers were detected in water samples collected from areas frequently contaminated with fecal pollution. Ease of detection and longer survival in water made Bacteroides-Prevotella indicators better than Bifidobacterium indicators. Fecal 16S rDNA sequences corresponding to our Bacteroides-Prevotella markers comprised closely related gene clusters, none of which exactly matched previously published Bacteroides or Prevotella sequences. Our method detected host-specific markers in water at pollutant concentrations of 2.8 x 10(-5) to 2.8 x 10(-7) g (dry weight) of feces/liter and 6.8 x 10(-7) g (dry weight) of sewage/liter. Although our aim was to identify nonpoint sources of fecal contamination, the method described here should be widely applicable for monitoring spatial and temporal fluctuations in specific bacterial groups in natural environments.

ID ECOSYSTEMS; MODEL
AB Maintaining natural hydrologic variability is essential in conserving native riverine biota and river ecosystem integrity. Hydrologic variation plays a major role in structuring the biotic diversity within river ecosystems as it controls key habitat conditions within the river channel, the floodplain, and hyporheic (stream-influenced ground water) zones. Alterations in streamflow regimes may modify many of these habitat attributes and impair ecosystem connectivity. We demonstrate use of the 'Range of Variability Approach' for assessing hydrologic alteration at available streamgauge sites throughout a river basin. We then illustrate a technique for spatially mapping the degree of hydrologic alteration for river reaches at and between streamgauge sites. Such maps can be used to assess the Loss of natural hydrologic variation at a river basin scale, thereby facilitating river restoration planning. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We determined the taxonomic status of six Bacillus species (Bacillus alginolyticus, Bacillus chondroitinus, Bacillus curdlanolytials, Bacillus glucanolyticus, Bacillus kobensis, and Bacillus thiaminolyticus) by using the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence and cellular fatty acid composition analyses. Phylogenetic analysis clustered these species closely with the Paenibacillus species. Like the Paenibacillus species, the six Bacillus species contained anteiso-C-15:0 fatty acid as a major cellular fatty acid. The use of a specific PCR primer designed for differentiating the genus Paenibacillus from other members of the Bacillaceae showed that the six Bacillus species had the same amplified 16S rRNA gene fragment as members of the genus Paenibacillus. Based on these observations and other taxonomic characteristics, the six Bacillus species were transferred to the genus Paenibacillus. In addition, we propose emendation of the genus Paenibacillus.

   NUMBER
AB We formalize the use of allele frequency and geographic information for the construction of gene trees at the intraspecific level and extend the concept of evolutionary parsimony to molecular variance parsimony. The central principle is to consider a particular gene tree as a variable to be optimized in the estimation of a given population statistic. We propose three population statistics that are related to variance components and that are explicit functions of phylogenetic information. The methodology is applied in the context of minimum spanning trees (MSTs) and human mitochondrial DNA restriction data, but could be extended to accommodate other tree-making procedures, as well as other data types. We pursue optimal trees by heuristic optimization over a search space of more than 1.29 billion MSTs. This very large number of equally parsimonious trees underlines the lack of resolution of conventional parsimony procedures. This lack of resolution is highlighted by the observation that equally parsimonious trees yield very different estimates of population genetic diversity and genetic structure, as shown by null distributions of the population statistics, obtained by evaluation of 10,000 random MSTs. We propose a non-parametric test for the similarity between any two trees, based on the distribution of a weighted coevolutionary correlation. The ability to test for tree relatedness leads to the definition of a class of solutions instead of a single solution. Members of the class share virtually all of the critical internal structure of the tree but differ in the placement of singleton branch tips.

AB The world's big rivers and their floodplains were central to development of civilization and are now home to c. 2.7 billion people. They are economically vital whilst also constituting some of the most diverse habitats on Earth. However, a number of anthropogenic stressors, including large-scale damming, hydrological change, pollution, introduction of non-native species and sediment mining, challenge their integrity and future, as never before. The rapidity and extent of such change is so great that large-scale, and potentially irreparable, transformations may ensue in periods of years to decades, with ecosystem collapse being possible in some big rivers. Prioritizing the fate of the world's great river corridors on an international political stage is imperative. Future sustainable management, and establishment of environmental flow requirements for the world's big rivers, must be supported through co-ordinated international funding, and trans-continental political agreement to monitor these rivers, finance their continual upkeep and help ameliorate increasing anthropogenic pressures. To have any effect, all of these must be set within an inclusive governance framework across scales, organizations and local populace.

AB A focus on the phenotypic characteristics of microorganisms-their traits-offers a path for interpreting the growing amount of microbiome data. We review key aspects of microbial traits, as well as approaches used to assay their phylogenetic distribution. Recent studies reveal that microbial traits are differentially conserved across the tree of life and appear to be conserved in a hierarchical fashion, possibly linked to their biochemical complexity. These results suggest a predictive framework whereby the genetic (or taxonomic) resolution of microbiome variation among samples provides information about the traits under selection. The organizational parallels seen among human and free-living microbiomes seem to support this idea. Developments in this framework may offer predictions not only for how microbial composition responds to changing environmental conditions, but also for how these changes may alter the health or functioning in human, engineered, and environmental systems.

AB Classifying the biological traits of organisms can test conceptual frameworks of life-history strategies and allow for predictions of how different species may respond to environmental disturbances. We apply a trait-based classification approach to a complex and threatened group of species, scleractinian corals. Using hierarchical clustering and random forests analyses, we identify up to four life-history strategies that appear globally consistent across 143 species of reef corals: competitive, weedy, stress-tolerant and generalist taxa, which are primarily separated by colony morphology, growth rate and reproductive mode. Documented shifts towards stress-tolerant, generalist and weedy species in coral reef communities are consistent with the expected responses of these life-history strategies. Our quantitative trait-based approach to classifying life-history strategies is objective, applicable to any taxa and a powerful tool that can be used to evaluate theories of community ecology and predict the impact of environmental and anthropogenic stressors on species assemblages.

AB The abrupt decline in the sea's capacity to provide crucial ecosystem services requires a new ecosystem-based approach for maintaining and recovering biodiversity and integrity. Ecosystems are places, so marine spatial planners and managers must understand the heterogeneity of biological communities and their key components (especially apex predators and structure-forming species), and of key processes (e.g., population connectivity, interaction webs, biogeochemistry) that maintain them. as well as heterogeneity of human uses. Maintaining resistance and resilience to stressors is crucial. Because marine populations and ecosystems exhibit complex system behaviors, managers cannot safety assume they will recover when stressors are reduced, so prevention is a far more robust management strategy than seeking a cure for degraded systems.

AB Pollinators are required for producing 15-30% of the human food supply, and farmers rely on managed honey bees throughout the world to provide these services. Yet honey bees are not always the most efficient pollinators of all crops and are declining in various parts of the world. Crop pollination shortages are becoming increasingly common. We found that behavioral interactions between wild and honey bees increase the pollination efficiency of honey bees on hybrid sunflower up to 5-fold, effectively doubling honey bee pollination services on the average field. These indirect contributions caused by interspecific interactions between wild and honey bees were more than five times more important than the contributions wild bees make to sunflower pollination directly. Both proximity to natural habitat and crop planting practices were significantly correlated with pollination services provided directly and indirectly by wild bees. Our results suggest that conserving wild habitat at the landscape scale and altering selected farm management techniques could increase hybrid sunflower production. These findings also demonstrate the economic importance of interspecific interactions for ecosystem services and suggest that protecting wild bee populations can help buffer the human food supply from honey bee shortages.

AB Some species introduced into new geographical areas from their native ranges wreak ecological and economic havoc in their new environment. Although many studies have searched for either species or habitat characteristics that predict invasiveness of exotic species, the match between characteristics of the invader and those of members of the existing native community may be essential to understanding invasiveness. Here, we find that one metric, the phylogenetic relatedness of an invader to the native community, provides a predictive tool for invasiveness. Using a phylogenetic supertree of all grass species in California, we show that highly invasive grass species are, on average, significantly less related to native grasses than are introduced but noninvasive grasses. The match between the invader and the existing native community may explain why exotic pest species are not uniformly noxious in all novel habitats. Relatedness of invaders to the native biota may be one useful criterion for prioritizing management efforts of exotic species.

AB The Orchidaceae are one of the most species-rich plant families and their floral diversity and pollination biology have long intrigued evolutionary biologists. About one-third of the estimated 18 500 species are thought to be pollinated by deceit. To date, the focus has been on how such pollination evolved, how the different types of deception work, and how it is maintained, but little progress has been made in understanding its evolutionary consequences. To address this issue, we discuss here how deception affects orchid mating systems, the evolution of reproductive isolation, speciation processes and neutral genetic divergence among species. We argue that pollination by deceit is one of the keys to orchid floral and species diversity. A better understanding of its evolutionary consequences could help evolutionary biologists to unravel the reasons for the evolutionary success of orchids.

AB Peatlands have been subject to artificial drainage for centuries. This drainage has been in response to agricultural demand, forestry, horticultural and energy properties of peat and alleviation of flood risk. However, there are several environmental problems associated with drainage of peatlands. This paper describes the nature of these problems and examines the evidence for changes in hydrological and hydrochemical processes associated with these changes. Traditional black-box water balance approaches demonstrate little about wetland dynamics and therefore the science of catchment response to peat drainage is poorly understood. It is crucial that a more process-based approach be adopted within peatland ecosystems. The environmental problems associated with peat drainage have led, in part, to a recent reversal in attitudes to peatlands and we have seen a move towards wetland restoration. However, a detailed understanding of hydrological, hydrochemical and ecological process-interactions will be fundamental if we are to adequately restore degraded peatlands, preserve those that are still intact and understand the impacts of such management actions at the catchment scale.

AB Functional innovations after gene duplication may result in altered functional constraints between member gene clusters of a gene family. This type (type I) of functional divergence is measured by the coefficient of functional divergence (theta(lambda)), which can be interpreted as the decrease in rate correlation between gene clusters, or the probability that the evolutionary rate at a site is statistically independent between two gene clusters. A simple stochastic model has been developed for estimating theta(lambda) and testing its statistical significance. The current model includes the model of rate variation among sites as a special case when theta(lambda) = 0. Moreover, we have developed a site-specific profile based on the hidden Markov model to identify critical amino acid residues that are responsible for these functional differences between two gene clusters, which may have great potential in functional genomics.

AB Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites has been proposed as a mechanism maintaining genetic diversity in both host and parasite populations, In particular, the high levels of genetic diversity widely observed at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of vertebrate hosts are consistent with the hypothesis of parasite-driven balancing selection acting to maintain MHC genetic diversity, To date, however, empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis, especially from natural populations, has been lacking, A large unmanaged population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries L.) is used to investigate associations between MHC variation, juvenile survival, and parasite resistance. We show in an unmanaged, nonhuman population that allelic variation within the MHC is significantly associated with differences in both juvenile survival and resistance to intestinal nematodes, Certain MHC alleles are associated with low survivorship probabilities and high levels of parasitism or vies versa, We conclude that parasites ape likely to play a major role in the maintenance of MHC diversity In this population.

AB Our objective is to describe a multi-layer model of C-3-canopy processes that effectively simulates hourly CO2 and latent energy (LE) fluxes in a mixed deciduous Quercus-Acer (oak-maple) stand in central Massachusetts, USA, The key hypothesis governing the biological component of the model is that stomatal conductance (g(s)) is varied so that daily carbon uptake per unit of foliar nitrogen is maximized within the limitations of canopy water availability, The hydraulic system is modelled as an analogue to simple electrical circuits in parallel, including a separate soil hydraulic resistance, plant resistance and plant capacitance for each canopy layer, Stomatal opening is initially controlled to conserve plant water stores and delay the onset of water stress, Stomatal closure at a threshold minimum leaf water potential prevents xylem cavitation and controls the maximum rate of water flux through the hydraulic system, We show a strong correlation between predicted hourly CO2 exchange rate (r(2) = 0 . 86) and LE (r(2) = 0 . 87) with independent whole-forest measurements made by the eddy correlation method during the summer of 1992, Our theoretical derivation shows that observed relationships between CO2 assimilation and LE flux can be explained on the basis of stomatal behaviour optimizing carbon gain, and provides an explicit link between canopy structure, soil properties, atmospheric conditions and stomatal conductance.

AB Ramphocelus tanagers are distributed throughout the Neotropical lowlands. In this paper, mitochrondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data from cytochrome b and ND2 genes are used to estimate relationships among seven of nine species of the avian genus Ramphocelus. Genetic differentiation is high between Ramphocelus passerinii passerinii and Ramphocelus passerinii costaricensis, and the two subspecies are diagnosable and distinct from one another both morphologically and genetically. Thus, elevation to species status is recommended, Three clades are supported by both gene sequences; one clade contains R. passerinii, R. costaricensis, and R. icteronotus; the second clade contains Ramphocelus carbo, Ramphocelus bresilius, and Ramphocelus nigrogularis; the third clade contains Ramphocelus sanguinolentus. The degree of saturation was assessed for both genes and saturation of third position of codons occurs by 10-12% uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence. The general area cladogram suggests the following area relationships: Pacific and Caribbean Central America are sister areas, Choco is the sister to the Central American area, and Amazonia/southeastern Brazil is the outgroup area to the Choco/Central American clade.

AB The use of comparative methods to test evolutionary hypotheses has become more common at both the macro- and microevolutionary levels. The application of such techniques is especially troublesome at the interface of these levels because phylogenetic relationships are often difficult to estimate. The use of a technique developed to estimate intraspecific cladograms combined with more traditional methods of phylogenetic estimation can improve the estimate in data sets containing a range of diversity when the lower bound of the range approaches 0% divergence. For nucleotide sequence data from the 16S region of the mitochondrial DNA from 72 individuals representing 37 species, this combined-procedures approach improved the estimate of phylogenetic relationships using maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and neighbor-joining methods. The estimated trees were used to examine systematic hypotheses relating to the crayfish genus Orconectes and species relationships within the subgenus Procericambarus. The monophyly of Procericambarus is not supported by the mitochondrial data, and the hypotheses of unique origins of various morphological features previously used in determining crayfish relationships is unsupported.

AB DNA hybridization data (hydroxyapatite method, 50 to 70-degrees-C) indicate that Rickettsia prowazekii, the type species of the type genus of the family Rickettsiaceae, is substantially less closely related to Rochalimaea species than was previously thought. The levels of relatedness of Rickettsia prowazekii to Rochalimaea species and to Bartonella bacilliformis under optimal conditions for DNA reassociation were 0 to 14%, with 25.5% or greater divergence in related sequences. When stringent reassociation criteria were used, the levels of relatedness were 0 to 2%. The genera Bartonella and Rochalimaea are currently classified in different families (the Bartonellaceae and the Rickettsiaceae) in the order Rickeusiales. On the basis of DNA relatedness data, previous 16S rRNA sequence data, guanine-plus-cytosine contents, and phenotypic characteristics, neither Bartonella bacilliformis nor Rochalimaea species are closely related to other organisms currently classified in the order Rickettsiales. In fact, the closest relative of these organisms is Brucella abortus. It is therefore proposed that the family Bartonellaceae should be removed from the order Rickettsiales. Previous 16S rRNA sequence data and DNA hybridization data revealed high levels of relatedness between Bartonella bacilliformis and the four Rochalimaea species, indicating that these species are members of a single genus. It is proposed that the genus Rochalimaea should be united with the genus Bartonella in the family Bartonellaceae. The name Bartonella is retained as the genus name since it has nomenclatural priority over the name Rochalimaea. This means that new combinations for the Rochalimaea species must be created. Proposals are therefore made for the creation of Bartonella quintana comb. nov., Bartonella vinsonii comb. nov., Bartonella henselae comb. nov., and Bartonella elizabethae comb. nov.

AB Apical dominance is the control exerted by the apical portions of the shoot over the outgrowth of the lateral buds. The classical explanations for correlative inhibition have focused on hormone/nutrient hypotheses. The remarkable progress that has been made in the technology of endogenous hormone quantification in plant tissue has not been accompanied by comparable progress in the elucidation of mechanisms of hormone action in apical dominance. Evidence from hormonal studies suggests that apically Produced auxin indirectly suppresses axillary bud outgrowth that is Promoted by cytokinin originating from roots/shoots. Significant involvement with other hormones, although less likely, has not been ruled out. Possible changes in tissue sensitivity to hormones should not be overlooked. Auxin-induced oligosaccharide signals originating from the cell walls of shoot tips or polyamines may function as secondary inhibitors to bud growth. Alternatively, apically produced auxin may suppress lateral bud growth by inhibiting auxin export from these buds. Support for a critical role for nutrients in apical dominance keeps resurfacing, especially for auxin-directed nutrient transport and for water as a possible inducing signal for bud outgrowth. Histological and biochemical analyses of lateral buds recently released from apical dominance are urgently needed. The feasibility of manipulating endogenous auxin/cytokinin content in plant tissue by gene insertion and modulation opens the door to exciting approaches as does the use of hormone insensitive/resistant mutants. There is also need to recognize the existence of variability of apical dominance mechanisms among different plant types. The aesthetic and economic implications of understanding apical dominance for the modification of plant structure and form are extremely significant.

AB While human-induced rapid environmental changes are putting many organisms at risk of extinction, others are doing better than ever. This raises the question of why organisms differ in their tolerance to environmental alterations. Here, we ask whether and how behavioural adjustments assist animals in dealing with the urbanization process, one of the primary causes of biodiversity loss and biotic homogenization. Based on a literature review, we present both theoretical and empirical arguments to show that behavioural adjustments to urban habitats are widespread and that they may potentially be important in facilitating resource use, avoiding disturbances and enhancing communication. While a growing number of studies report behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals, very few studies directly address the underlying mechanisms. In some cases, the changes in behaviour occur very rapidly and involve learning, and hence can be attributed to behavioural plasticity. In other cases, however, it cannot be ruled out that behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals result from natural selection or nonrandom sorting of individuals by behavioural traits that affect dispersal, habitat selection or establishment. Because the urbanization process is expected to continue to threaten biodiversity in the near future, there is some urgency to improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which behaviour helps animals to cope with such environmental alterations.

AB Although much progress has been made in identifying the genes (and, in rare cases, mutations) that contribute to phenotypic variation, less is known about the effects that these genes have on fitness. Nonetheless, genes are commonly labelled as 'adaptive' if an allele has been shown to affect a phenotype with known or suspected functional importance or if patterns of nucleotide variation at the locus are consistent with positive selection. In these cases, the 'adaptive' designation may be premature and may lead to incorrect conclusions about the relationships between gene function and fitness. Experiments to test targets and agents of natural selection within a genomic context are necessary for identifying the adaptive consequences of individual alleles.

AB Shrub encroachment into grass-dominated biomes is occurring globally due to a variety of anthropogenic activities, but the consequences for carbon (C) inputs, storage and cycling remain unclear. We studied eight North American graminoid-dominated ecosystems invaded by shrubs, from arctic tundra to Atlantic coastal dunes, to quantify patterns and controls of C inputs via aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Across a fourfold range in mean annual precipitation (MAP), a key regulator of ecosystem C input at the continental scale, shrub invasion decreased ANPP in xeric sites, but dramatically increased ANPP (> 1000 g m(-2)) at high MAP, where shrub patches maintained extraordinarily high leaf area. Concurrently, the relationship between MAP and ANPP shifted from being nonlinear in grasslands to linear in shrublands. Thus, relatively abrupt (< 50 years) shifts in growth form dominance, without changes in resource quantity, can fundamentally alter continental-scale pattern of C inputs and their control by MAP in ways that exceed the direct effects of climate change alone.

AB Leopards Panthera pardus have a catholic diet and are generally thought to prey on medium-sized ungulates; however, knowledge on which species are actually preferred and avoided is lacking, along with an understanding of why such preferences arise. Twenty-nine published and four unpublished studies of leopard diet that had relative prey abundance estimates associated with them were analysed from 13 countries in 41 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the leopard. A Jacobs' index value was calculated for each prey species in each study and the mean of these was then tested against a mean of 0 using t or sign tests for preference or avoidance. Leopards preferentially prey upon species within a weight range of 10-40 kg. Regression plots suggest that the most preferred mass of leopard prey is 25 kg, whereas the mean body mass of significantly preferred prey is 23 kg. Leopards prefer prey within this body mass range, which occur in small herds, in dense habitat and afford the hunter minimal risk of injury during capture. Consequently, impala, bushbuck and common duiker are significantly preferred, with chital likely to also be preferred with a larger sample size from Asian sites. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided, as are species that are restricted to open vegetation or that have sufficient anti-predator strategies. The ratio of mean leopard body mass with that of their preferred prey is less than 1 and may be a reflection of their solitary hunting strategy. This model will allow us to predict the diet of leopards in areas where dietary information is lacking, also providing information to assist wildlife managers and conservation bodies on predator carrying capacity and predator-prey interactions.

AB Since the publication of the unified neutral theory in 2001, there has been much discussion of the theory, pro and con. The hypothesis of ecological equivalence is the fundamental yet controversial idea behind neutral theory. Assuming trophically similar species are demographically alike (symmetric) on a per capita basis is only an approximation, but it is equivalent to asking: How many of the patterns of ecological communities are the result of species similarities, rather than of species differences? The strategy behind neutral theory is to see how far one can get with the simplification of assuming ecological equivalence before introducing more complexity. In another paper, I review the empirical evidence that led me to hypothesize ecological equivalence among many of the tree species in the species-rich tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). In this paper, I develop a simple model for the evolution of ecological equivalence or niche convergence, using as an example evolution of the suite of life history traits characteristic of shade tolerant tropical tree species. Although the model is simple, the conclusions from it seem likely to be robust. I conclude that ecological equivalence for resource use are likely to evolve easily and often, especially in species-rich communities that are dispersal and recruitment limited. In the case of the BCI forest, tree species are strongly dispersal- and recruitment-limited, not only because of restricted seed dispersal, but also because of low recruitment success due to heavy losses of the seedling stages to predators and pathogens and other abiotic stresses such as drought. These factors and the high species richness of the community strongly reduce the potential for competitive exclusion of functionally equivalent or nearly equivalent species.

AB Sexual reproduction is associated with the evolution of anisogamy and sperm-producing males and egg-laying females. The ensuing competition for mates has led to sexual selection and coevolution of the sexes. Mathematical models arc extensively used to test the plausibility of different complicated scenarios for the evolution of sexual traits. Unfortunately, the diversity of models is now itself equally bewildering. Here we clarify some of the current debate by reviewing evolutionary explanations for the relationship between anisogamy, potential reproductive rates, parental care, sex roles, and mate choice. We review the benefits females might gain by mating with certain males rather than others. We also consider other forms of selection that can make females mate nonrandomly. One way empiricists can contribute to resolving theoretical disputes is to quantify the cost of expressing mating biases in the appropriate life-history currency.

AB The theory of r- and K-selection was one of the first predictive models for life-history evolution. It helped to galvanize the empirical field of comparative life-history and dominated thinking on the subject from the late 1960s through the 1970s. Large quantities of field data were collected that claimed to test predictions of the theory. By the early 1980s, sentiment about the theory had changed so completely that a proposal to test it or the use of it to interpret empirical results would likely be viewed as archaic and naive. The theory was displaced,by demographic models that concentrated on mortality patterns as the cause of life-history evolution. Although demographic models are known for their density-independent approach and focus on extrinsic mortality, these models can incorporate many ecological features captured by r- and K-selection, such as density-dependent population regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations. We highlight the incorporation of these factors in recent theory, then show how they are manifest in our research on life-history evolution in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Explanations of the repeatable suites of life-history differences across populations of guppies originate from demographic models of predator-driven age-specific mortality. Recently, careful examination of guppy demography and habitat has revealed that density-dependent regulation and resource availability may have influenced the evolution of guppy life histories. In the field, these factors covary with predation risk; however, they can be uncoupled experimentally, providing insight into how they may have synergistically driven guppy life-history evolution. Although life-history theory has shifted away from a focus on r- and K-selection, the themes of density-dependent regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations are integral to current demographic theory and are potentially important in any natural system.

AB General guidelines on the quantitative representation of heterogeneity in ecology are still lacking. Without a precise definition and sound quantification of heterogeneity, statements involving the concept will continue to be confusing, and comparative studies and hypothesis testing will be ineffective. To solve this problem we propose an operational definition of ecological heterogeneity that facilitates quantification based on the data types of concern. We use two examples to demonstrate how our definition and quantification of spatial heterogeneity can be applied in practice.

AB Comparative sequencing of the maturase-encoding chloroplast gene matK has great potential for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships not only within families, but also within genera of land plants. This gene of 1550 bp is easily amplified due to highly conserved, flanking coding regions that include the trnK exons, rps16, and psbA. Several available sequencing primers also have wide applicability. Parsimony analysis of 45 matK sequences representing Saxifragaceae sensu stricto provides a level of resolution comparable to that obtained via chloroplast DNA restriction site analysis. Furthermore, this analysis suggests relationships among genera and species that are highly concordant with the results of separate analyses of rbcL sequences and chloroplast DNA restriction sites, and with those of combined analyses of these three chloroplast DNA data sets. Parsimony analysis of 31 matK sequences representing all six sections of Gilia (Polemoniaceae) and 10 allied genera provides strong evidence for the polyphyly of Gilia and suggests relationships among sections of Gilia that are highly concordant with a recent ITS sequence analysis of the Polemoniaceae. Our analyses suggest that matK sequences are not strongly biased toward transitions, and the frequency of mutations at the first and second codon positions approach the frequency of mutations in the third codon position.

AB Although rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are expected to directly affect forest ecosystems, little is known of how specific ecological interactions will be modified. This research evaluated the effects of enriched CO2 on the productivity and phytochemistry of forest trees and performance of associated insects. Our experimental system consisted of three tree species (quaking aspen [Populus tremuloides], red oak [Quercus rubra], sugar maple [Acer saccharum]) that span a range from fast to slow growing, and two species of leaf-feeding insects (gypsy moth [Lymantria dispar] and forest tent caterpillar [Malacosoma disstria]). Carbon-nutrient balance theory provided a framework for tests of three hypotheses; in response to enriched CO2: (1) relative increases in tree growth rates will be greatest for aspen and least for maple, (2) relative decreases in protein and increases in carbon-based compounds will be greatest for aspen and least for maple, and (3) relative reductions in performance will be greatest for insects fed aspen and least for insects fed maple. We grew 1-yr-old seedlings for 60 d under ambient (385 +/- 5 muL/L) or elevated (642 +/- 2 muL/L) CO2 regimes at the University of Wisconsin Biotron. After 50 d, we conducted feeding trials with penultimate-instar gypsy moth and forest tent caterpillars. After 60 d, a second set of trees was harvested and partitioned into root, stem, and leaf tissues. We subsequently analyzed leaf material for a variety of compounds known to affect performance of insect herbivores.
   In terms of actual dry-matter production, aspen responded the most to enriched CO2 atmospheres whereas maple responded the least. Proportional growth increases (relative to ambient plants), however, were highest for oak and least for maple. Effects of elevated CO2 on biomass allocation patterns differed among the three species; root-to-shoot ratios increased in aspen, decreased in oak, and did not change in maple. Enriched CO2 altered concentrations of primary and secondary metabolites in leaves, but the magnitude and direction of effects were species-specific. Aspen showed the largest change in storage carbon compounds (starch), whereas maple experienced the largest change in defensive carbon compounds (condensed and hydrolyzable tannins). Consumption rates of insects fed high-CO2 aspen increased dramatically, but growth rates declined. The two species of insects differed in response to oak and maple grown under enriched CO2. Gypsy moths grew better on high-CO2 Oak, whereas forest tent caterpillars were unaffected; tent caterpillars tended to grow less on high-CO2 maple, whereas gypsy moths were unaffected. Changes in insect performance parameters were related to changes in foliar chemistry. Responses of plants and insects agreed with some, but not all, of the predictions of carbon-nutrient balance theory.
   This study illustrates that tree productivity and chemistry, and the performance of associated insects, will change under CO2 atmospheres predicted for the next century. Changes in higher level ecological processes, such as community structure and nutrient cycling, are also implicated.

AB The collective impact of humans on biodiversity rivals mass extinction events defining Earth's history, but does our large population also present opportunities to document and contend with this crisis? We provide the first quantitative review of biodiversity-related citizen science to determine whether data collected by these projects can be, and are currently being, effectively used in biodiversity research. We find strong evidence of the potential of citizen science: within projects we sampled (n = 388), similar to 1.3 million volunteers participate, contributing up to $2.5 billion in-kind annually. These projects exceed most federally-funded studies in spatial and temporal extent, and collectively they sample a breadth of taxonomic diversity. However, only 12% of the 388 projects surveyed obviously provide data to peer-reviewed scientific articles, despite the fact that a third of these projects have verifiable, standardized data that are accessible online. Factors influencing publication included project spatial scale and longevity and having publically available data, as well as one measure of scientific rigor (taxonomic identification training). Because of the low rate at which citizen science data reach publication, the large and growing citizen science movement is likely only realizing a small portion of its potential impact on the scientific research community. Strengthening connections between professional and non-professional participants in the scientific process will enable this large data resource to be better harnessed to understand and address global change impacts on biodiversity.

AB 1. Many studies of community assembly focus on two mechanisms: environmental filtering and competitive interactions. This focus ignores the importance of other assembly processes such as equalizing fitness processes and facilitation. The contribution of different processes to community assembly can be elucidated by examining functional diversity patterns of traits that differ in their contribution to different assembly processes.
   2. In alpine tundra, we explored trait patterns along a stress-resource gradient that varied in productivity, nitrogen availability and soil moisture. We explore whether functional diversity is low in abiotic stressful environments and increases in more benign environments as competition becomes more important, and if equalizing fitness processes and facilitation affect functional diversity. We calculated community-weighted mean trait values and functional diversity for specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area, stomatal conductance, plant height and chlorophyll content as well as multivariate functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity.
   3. At the community level, functional diversity increased at both ends of the gradient: high resource availability was associated with greater functional diversity in height and leaf area, and lower resource availability was associated with greater functional diversity in SLA, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll content. As a result of this trade-off in functional diversity among traits, multivariate functional diversity did not change across the gradient. Phylogenetic diversity increased with increasing resource availability.
   4. We find evidence for at least three assembly processes along the gradient. Abiotic filtering by wind and cold exposure may reduce functional diversity in height and leaf area at the low resource end of the gradient. Also at low resource availability, increasing functional diversity in the other three traits suggests competition for below-ground resources. At the resource-rich end of the gradient, increased functional diversity in height and leaf area suggests increased competition for light or facilitation.
   5. Synthesis: Our results suggest that multiple assembly processes (abiotic filtering, above-ground competition, and below-ground competition) operate simultaneously to structure plant communities along a stress-resource gradient. These processes would be obscured by a single multivariate trait index or phylogenetic diversity and are only evident by analysing functional diversity patterns of individual traits.

AB The majority of studies on environmental change focus on the response of single species and neglect fundamental biotic interactions, such as mutualism, competition, predation, and parasitism, which complicate patterns of species persistence. Under global warming, disruption of community interactions can arise when species differ in their sensitivity to rising temperature, leading to mismatched phenologies and/or dispersal patterns. To study species persistence under global climate change, it is critical to consider the ecology and evolution of multispecies interactions; however, the sheer number of potential interactions makes a full study of all interactions unfeasible. One mechanistic approach to solving the problem of complicated community context to global change is to (i) define strategy groups of species based on life-history traits, trophic position, or location in the ecosystem, (ii) identify species involved in key interactions within these groups, and (iii) determine from the interactions of these key species which traits to study in order to understand the response to global warming. We review the importance of multispecies interactions looking at two trait categories: thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and associated life-history traits and dispersal traits of species. A survey of published literature shows pronounced and consistent differences among trophic groups in thermal sensitivity of life-history traits and in dispersal distances. Our approach increases the feasibility of unraveling such a large and diverse set of community interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of community responses to global warming.

AB The multidimensional character and inherent conflict with categorisation of interdisciplinarity makes its mapping and evaluation a challenging task. We propose a conceptual framework that aims to capture interdisciplinarity in the wider sense of knowledge integration, by exploring the concepts of diversity and coherence. Disciplinary diversity indicators are developed to describe the heterogeneity of a bibliometric set viewed from predefined categories, i.e. using a top-down approach that locates the set on the global map of science. Network coherence indicators are constructed to measure the intensity of similarity relations within a bibliometric set, i.e. using a bottom-up approach, which reveals the structural consistency of the publications network. We carry out case studies on individual articles in bionanoscience to illustrate how these two perspectives identify different aspects of interdisciplinarity: disciplinary diversity indicates the large-scale breadth of the knowledge base of a publication; network coherence reflects the novelty of its knowledge integration. We suggest that the combination of these two approaches may be useful for comparative studies of emergent scientific and technological fields, where new and controversial categorisations are accompanied by equally contested claims of novelty and interdisciplinarity.

AB Soil microorganisms have numerous functional roles in forest ecosystems, including: serving as sources and sinks of key nutrients and catalysts of nutrient transformations; acting as engineers and maintainers of soil structure; and forming mutualistic relationships with roots that improve plant fitness. Although both prescribed and wildland fires are common in temperate forests of North America, few studies have addressed the long-term influence of such disturbances on the soil microflora in these ecosystems. Fire alters the soil microbial community structure in the short-term primarily through heat-induced microbial mortality. Over the long-term, fire may modify soil communities by altering plant community composition via plant-induced changes in the soil environment. In this review, we summarize and synthesize the various studies that have assessed the effects of fire on forest soil microorganisms, emphasizing the mechanisms by which fire impacts these vital ecosystem engineers. The examples used in this paper are derived primarily from studies of ponderosa pine-dominated forests of the Inland West of the USA; these forests have some of the shortest historical fire-retum intervals of any forest type, and thus the evolutionary role of fire in shaping these forests is likely the strongest. We argue that the short-term effects of fire on soil microflora and the processes they catalyze are transient, and suggest that more research be devoted to linking long-term plant community responses with those of the mutually dependent soil microflora.

AB Domestic ('private') gardens constitute a substantial proportion of 'green space' in urban areas and hence are of potential significance for the maintenance of biodiversity in such areas. However, the size and nature of this resource and its associated features are poorly known. In this study, we provide the first detailed audit, using domestic gardens in the city of Sheffield as a model study system. Domestic gardens, the mean area of which was 151 m(2), cover approximately 33 km(2) or 23% of the predominantly urban area of the city. The smaller gardens contribute disproportionately to this total because, although individually they add little, they are large in number. Conversely, the regions of the city with proportionately more garden area contribute most to the total garden area of the city, although such regions are limited in number. Based on the findings of a telephone based survey, 14.4% of dwellings with gardens were estimated to have ponds, 26% to have nest-boxes, 29% to have compost heaps, 48% to hold trees more than 3 m tall, and 14% of dwellings were estimated to be home to one or more cats. Whilst the absolute frequency of these features is low to moderate, by extrapolation they nonetheless yield estimates for domestic gardens in Sheffield of a total of 25,200 ponds, 45,500 nest boxes, 50,750 compost heaps, 360,000 trees, and a population of 52,000 domestic cats. These results are considered in the context of the role of gardens in urban areas as habitats for wildlife and the implications for housing policy.

The widespread invasive snail Achatina fulica and pondweed Elodea canadensis appear to be characterized by rapid expansion followed by rapid decline. For the former species, disease may be the proximal cause of the collapse, while repeated collapse of the latter species is unexplained. Several other widely cited collapses of introduced species may simply be temporary lows during a more or less regular boom-and-bust cycle. However, on a restricted site (such as a small island), a boom-or-bust cycle may be impossible and recovery may never ensue; local extinction may even occur. In several instances, apparently spontaneous crashes were in fact probably caused by subsequently introduced competitors. Except for the few species in which spontaneous collapse has been repeatedly observed, the possibility of such an event is unwarranted as a potential rationale for a do-nothing approach to management. For such species, even if a crash ultimately occurs, the species may already have caused persistent ecological damage.

AB A species' range limits may shift in space either because of changes in ecological factors (e.g. climate, the abundances of interacting species) or because the traits which influence range limits (e.g. dispersal, niche characteristics) evolve by natural selection. In Geographical Ecology, Robert MacArthur (1972) provided a synthesis of the evolutionary factors that may drive range dynamics. In this paper, I revisit this theme in the light of recent theoretical studies of evolution in heteroueneous environments. These studies suggest that a rich range of evolutionary patterns in species. ranges may occur, including expansions or contractions, leading to dynamism in ranges even in epochs without strong directional environmental change.

AB Observations from islands, small-scale experiments, and mathematical models have generally supported the paradigm that habitats of low plant diversity are more vulnerable to plant invasions than areas of high plant diversity. We summarize two independent data sets to show exactly the opposite pattern at multiple spatial scales. More significant, and alarming, is that hotspots of native plant diversity have been far more heavily invaded than areas of low plant diversity in most parts of the United States when considered at larger spatial scales. Our findings suggest that we cannot expect such hotspots to repel invasions, and that the threat of invasion is significant and predictably greatest in these areas.

AB Recent glaciation covered the full extent of rocky intertidal habitat along the coasts of New England and the Canadian Maritimes. To test whether this glaciation in fact caused wholesale extinction of obligate rocky intertidal invertebrates, and thus required a recolonization from Europe, we compared American and European populations using allelic diversity and techniques adapted from coalescent theory. Mitochondrial DNA sequences were collected from amphi-Atlantic populations of three cold-temperate obligate rocky intertidal species (a barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides. and two gastropods, Nucella lapillus and Littorina obtusata) and three cold-temperate habitat generalist species (a seastar, Asterias rubens; a mussel, Mytilus edulis, and an isopod, Idotea balthica). For many of these species we were able to estimate the lineage-specific mutation rate based on trans-Arctic divergences between Pacific and Atlantic taxa. These data indicate that some obligate rocky intertidal taxa have colonized New England from European populations. However, the patterns of persistence in North America indicate that other life-history traits, including mechanisms of dispersal, may be more important for surviving dramatic environmental and climatic change.

AB A major goal of community ecology is to link biological processes at lower scales with community patterns. Microbial communities are especially powerful model systems for making these links. In this article, we review recent studies of laboratory communities of bacteria and bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria). We focus on the ecology and evolution of bacteriophage-resistance as a case study demonstrating the relationship between specific genes, individual interactions, population dynamics, community structure, and evolutionary change. In laboratory communities of bacteria and bacteriophage, bacteria rapidly evolve resistance to bacteriophage infection. Different resistance mutations produce distinct resistance phenotypes, differing, for example, in whether resistance is partial or complete, in the magnitude of the physiological cost associated with resistance, and in whether the mutation can be countered by a host-range mutation in the bacteriophage. These differences determine whether a mutant can invade, the effect its invasion has on the population dynamics of sensitive bacteria and phage, and the resulting structure of the community. All of these effects, in turn, govern the community's response to environmental change and its subsequent evolution.

AB 1. Bumble bees play a vital role in the pollination of many crops and wild flowers, and plans for their conservation require a knowledge of the dynamics and spatial scale of their foraging flights, which are, at present, poorly understood.
   2. We investigated the foraging range and constancy of two colonies of bumble bees Bombus terrestris L, on a mixed arable farm using harmonic radar, which has a unique capability to record the trajectories of insects flying at low altitude in the field.
   3. Foraging bees were fitted with lightweight radar transponders and tracked as they flew to and from the nest to forage. The resulting tracks gave information on length, direction and straightness of foraging routes. Superimposition onto a map of the foraging landscape allowed interpretation of the bees' destinations in relation to the spatial distribution of forage.
   4. Outward tracks had a mean length of 275.3 +/- 18.5 m (n = 65) and a range of 70-631 m, and were often to forage destinations beyond the nearest available forage. Most bees were constant to compass bearing and destination over successive trips, although one bee was tracked apparently switching between forage patches. Both outward and return tracks had a mean straightness ratio of 0.93 +/- 0.01 (n = 99). The bees' ground speeds ranged from 3.0 m s(-1) to 15.7 m s(-1) (n = 100) in a variety of wind conditions.
   5. The results support the hypothesis that bumble bees do not necessarily forage close to their nest, and illustrate that studies on a landscape scale are required if we are to evaluate bee foraging ranges fully with respect to resource availability. Such evaluations are required to underpin assessments of gene flow in bee-pollinated crops and wild flowers. They are also required when making decisions about the management of bees as pollinators and the conservation of bee and plant biodiversity.

AB 1, To test hypotheses concerning adaptation and acclimation of tree species to shaded habitats wt determined the growth, biomass partitioning and morphology of seedlings of nine near-boreal tree species in high- and low-light greenhouse environment (25 and 5% of full sunlight, respectively), comparable to sunlit gap and shaded microsites in boreal forests. The species differ widely in shade tolerance, seed size and leaf life span.
   2, In low Light, all species allocated proportionally more biomass to stems and less to roots, but the same to foliage, compared with the high-light environment. At a common size, all species had finer leaf morphology (higher specific leaf area, SLA) but coarser root morphology (lower specific root length, SRL) in low than high light. From a whole plant perspective, all species enhanced leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio, LAR) in low light and root length per unit plant mass (root length ratio, RLR) in high light.
   3, Shade-intolerant deciduous species had higher RGR, SLA and SRL than larger seeded evergreens: ranking from Populus, Betula and Larix spp., then to five evergreen Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp., which were generally comparable in these traits, there were no changes in growth rankings of species between high- and low-light environments, nor consistent differences among species in biomass partitioning. Hence, species differences in leaf and root morphology (SLA; SRL) drove whole plant patterns, such as Populus, Betula and Larix had greater total leaf area and root length per unit plant mass (LAR and RLR, respectively) than the evergreens. Interspecific variation in RGR in both high and low light was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with SLA, SRL, LAR and RLR, and negatively correlated (r approximate to -0.9) to seed mass and leaf life span.
   4. These data suggest that SLA, SRL, NAR and RGR are closely associated with variation in life-history traits and that variation in leaf and root structure more strongly influences patterns of RGR among species and light environments than does biomass partitioning.

AB In this study, flood frequency, productivity, and spatial heterogeneity were correlated with plant species richness (SX) among wetlands on a coastal island in southeast Alaska. Studies of 16 sites in or near the Kadashan River basin demonstrated nonlinear, unimodal relations between flood frequency and SR, productivity and SR, and linear relations between SR and the spatial variation of flood frequencies (SVFF) within a site. SVFF is caused by microtopographic variation in elevation. A nonlinear regression model relating SR to flood frequency and SVFF explained much of the variation in SR between wetland communities. Sites with intermediate flood frequencies and high SVFF were species-rich, while sites frequently, rarely, or permanently flooded and with low SVFF were species-poor. The data suggest that small-scale spatial variation can dramatically alter the impact of disturbances.
   The data also support Michael Huston's dynamic-equilibrium model of species diversity, which predicts the effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity patterns. Species-rich sites had low to intermediate levels of productivity and intermediate flood frequencies, and species-poor sites had very low or high flood frequencies and low productivity, supporting the model's predictions. The model was tested at contrasting spatial scales (1000 m(2) and 1 m(2)). At the 1000-m(2)? scale, Huston's model predicted 78% of the variation in SR. At the microplot scale, relationships between SR and flood frequency were weaker, and the dynamic-equilibrium model predicted only 36%; of the variation in SR.

AB There is a voluminous literature on pollination and dispersal, very little of which deals with the consequences of reproductive failure and its most extreme consequence: extinction. The risk of plant extinctions can be assessed by considering the probability of dispersal or pollinator failure, reproductive dependence on the mutualism and demographic dependence on seeds. Traits for ranking species rapidly according to these three criteria are indicated. Analysis of case studies suggests that plants often compensate for high risk in one of the three categories by low risk in another. For example, self-incompatible plants with rare specialist pollinators often propagate vegetatively. Some systems, including elements of the Cape flora and lowland tropical rain forest, lack compensatory traits and the risk of plant extinction from failes mutualism is high.

AB We evaluated the influence of intraguild predation among generalist insect predators on the suppression of an herbivore, the aphid Aphis gossypii, to test the appropriateness of the simple three trophic level model proposed by Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin (1960). We manipulated components of the predator community, including three hemipteran predators and larvae of the predatory green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea, in held enclosure/exclosure experiments to address four questions: (1) Do generalist hemipteran predators feed on C. carnea? (2) Does intraguild predation (IGP) represent a substantial source of mortality for C. carnea? (3) Do predator species act in an independent, additive manner, or do significant interactions occur? (4) Can the experimental addition of some predators result in increased densities of aphids through a trophic cascade effect? Direct observations of predation in the held demonstrated that several generalist predators consume C. carnea and other carnivorous arthropods. Severely reduced survivorship of lacewing larvae in the presence of other predators showed that IGP was a major source of mortality. Decreased survival of lacewing larvae was primarily a result of predation rather than competition. IGP created significant interactions between the influences of lacewings and either Zelus renardii or Nabis predators on aphid population suppression. Despite the fact that the trophic web was too complex to delineate distinct trophic levels within the predatory arthropod community, some trophic links were sufficiently strong to produce cascades from higher-order carnivores to the level of herbivore population dynamics: experimental addition of either Z. renardii or Nabis predators generated sufficient lacewing larval mortality in one experiment to release aphid populations from regulation by lacewing predators. We conclude that intraguild predation in this system is widespread and has potentially important influences on the population dynamics of a key herbivore.

AB The global biodiversity crisis concerns not only unprecedented loss of species within communities, but also related consequences for ecosystem function. Community ecology focuses on patterns of species richness and community composition, whereas ecosystem ecology focuses on fluxes of energy and materials. Food webs provide a quantitative framework to combine these approaches and unify the study of biodiversity and ecosystem function. We summarise the progression of food-web ecology and the challenges in using the food-web approach. We identify five areas of research where these advances can continue, and be applied to global challenges. Finally, we describe what data are needed in the next generation of food-web studies to reconcile the structure and function of biodiversity.

AB Evolutionary novelties have been important in the history of life, but their origins are usually difficult to examine in detail. We previously described the evolution of a novel trait, aerobic citrate utilization (Cit(+)), in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Here we analyse genome sequences to investigate the history and genetic basis of this trait. At least three distinct clades coexisted for more than 10,000 generations before its emergence. The Cit(+) trait originated in one clade by a tandem duplication that captured an aerobically expressed promoter for the expression of a previously silent citrate transporter. The clades varied in their propensity to evolve this novel trait, although genotypes able to do so existed in all three clades, implying that multiple potentiating mutations arose during the population's history. Our findings illustrate the importance of promoter capture and altered gene regulation in mediating the exaptation events that often underlie evolutionary innovations.

AB The duality between "niche'' and "biotope'' proposed by G. Evelyn Hutchinson provides a powerful way to conceptualize and analyze biogeographical distributions in relation to spatial environmental patterns. Both Joseph Grinnell and Charles Elton had attributed niches to environments. Attributing niches, instead, to species, allowed Hutchinson's key innovation: the formal severing of physical place from environment that is expressed by the duality. In biogeography, the physical world ( a spatial extension of what Hutchinson called the biotope) is conceived as a map, each point ( or cell) of which is characterized by its geographical coordinates and the local values of n environmental attributes at a given time. Exactly the same n environmental attributes define the corresponding niche space, as niche axes, allowing reciprocal projections between the geographic distribution of a species, actual or potential, past or future, and its niche. In biogeographical terms, the realized niche has come to express not only the effects of species interactions ( as Hutchinson intended), but also constraints of dispersal limitation and the lack of contemporary environments corresponding to parts of the fundamental niche. Hutchinson's duality has been used to classify and map environments; model potential species distributions under past, present, and future climates; study the distributions of invasive species; discover new species; and simulate increasingly more realistic worlds, leading to spatially explicit, stochastic models that encompass speciation, extinction, range expansion, and evolutionary adaptation to changing environments.

AB In both the wild and the laboratory, animals' preferences for one course of action over another reflect not just reward expectations but also the cost in terms of effort that must be invested in pursuing the course of action. The ventral striatum and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACCd) are implicated in the making of cost-benefit decisions in the rat, but there is little information about how effort costs are processed and influence calculations of expected net value in other mammals including humans. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study to determine whether and where activity in the human brain was available to guide effort-based cost-benefit valuation. Subjects were scanned while they performed a series of effortful actions to obtain secondary reinforcers. At the beginning of each trial, subjects were presented with one of eight different visual cues that they had learned indicated how much effort the course of action would entail and how much reward could be expected at its completion. Cue-locked activity in the ventral striatum and midbrain reflected the net value of the course of action, signaling the expected amount of reward discounted by the amount of effort to be invested. Activity in ACCd also reflected the interaction of both expected reward and effort costs. Posterior orbitofrontal and insular activity, however, only reflected the expected reward magnitude. The ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex may be the substrate of effort-based cost-benefit valuation in primates as well as in rats.

AB We propose research to fill key gaps in the areas of population and community ecology, based on a National Science Foundation workshop identifying funding priorities for the next 5-10 years. Our vision for the near future of ecology focuses on three core areas: predicting the strength and context-dependence of species interactions across multiple scales; identifying the importance of feedbacks from individual interactions to ecosystem dynamics; and linking pattern with process to understand species coexistence. We outline a combination of theory development and explicit, realistic tests of hypotheses needed to advance population and community ecology.

AB 1. Fifteen species richness estimators (three asymptotic based on species accumulation curves, 11 nonparametric, and one based in the species-area relationship) were compared by examining their performance in estimating the total species richness of epigean arthropods in the Azorean Laurisilva forests. Data obtained with standardized sampling of 78 transects in natural forest remnants of five islands were aggregated in seven different grains (i.e. ways of defining a single sample): islands, natural areas, transects, pairs of traps, traps, database records and individuals to assess the effect of using different sampling units on species richness estimations.
   2. Estimated species richness scores depended both on the estimator considered and on the grain size used to aggregate data. However, several estimators (ACE, Chao1, Jackknife1 and 2 and Bootstrap) were precise in spite of grain variations. Weibull and several recent estimators [proposed by Rosenzweig et al. (Conservation Biology, 2003, 17, 864-874), and Ugland et al. (Journal of Animal Ecology, 2003, 72, 888-897)] performed poorly.
   3. Estimations developed using the smaller grain sizes (pair of traps, traps, records and individuals) presented similar scores in a number of estimators (the above-mentioned plus ICE, Chao2, Michaelis-Menten, Negative Exponential and Clench). The estimations from those four sample sizes were also highly correlated.
   4. Contrary to other studies, we conclude that most species richness estimators may be useful in biodiversity studies. Owing to their inherent formulas, several nonparametric and asymptotic estimators present insensitivity to differences in the way the samples are aggregated. Thus, they could be used to compare species richness scores obtained from different sampling strategies. Our results also point out that species richness estimations coming from small grain sizes can be directly compared and other estimators could give more precise results in those cases. We propose a decision framework based on our results and on the literature to assess which estimator should be used to compare species richness scores of different sites, depending on the grain size of the original data, and of the kind of data available (species occurrence or abundance data).

AB Species lists have been compiled for all the major groups of Southern Ocean benthic marine invertebrates, eliminating synonymies where possible and providing a subjective estimate of completeness and reliability for each group. Antarctic marine diversity (pelagic and benthic) is relatively high at the phylum and class level, with the gaps mostly comprising minor, meiofaunal or parasitic groups. Most benthic diversity data come from the continental shelves, with relatively few samples from deeper water. Even for the continental shelves, however, sampling is highly patchy with some areas hardly investigated at all. Over 4100 benthic species have been reported from the Southern Ocean, with the most speciose groups being polychaetes, gastropods and amphipods. Comparison with tropical and temperate regions suggest that decapods, bivalves and teleost fishes are poorly represented in the Southern Ocean benthic marine fauna, whereas pycnogonids, echinoderms and many suspension feeding groups are rich and diverse. Some groups that are currently low in diversity were previously well represented in the Antarctic shallow water marine fauna, notably decapods and many fishes. Other groups have undergone marked radiations in the Southern Ocean, including pycnogonids, amphipods, isopods and teleost fishes; in all cases, however, it is only some lineages that have diversified. This indicates that evolutionary questions concerning the origin, diversification or extinction of the Southern Ocean marine fauna will have no single answer; the evolutionary history of each group appears to reflect a different response to the tectonic, climatic and oceanographic changes to which they have been subject through history. The disposition of southern hemisphere continents makes it difficult to assess whether there is a latitudinal cline in shallow-water marine diversity to mirror that known from the northern hemisphere. Within Antarctica, many species appear to have circumpolar distributions, and the long established biogeographical division into continental Antarctic, Antarctic Peninsula and sub-Antarctic regions have not been challenged by recent sampling. For most groups the frequency distribution of species per genus ratios is typical, though none is well described by the predictions from current evolutionary or null models. Where data are available, size spectra indicate that many Southern Ocean taxa are small, a few spectacular examples of gigantism notwithstanding, and species abundance plots are normal. Knowledge of the Southern Ocean benthic marine fauna has reached a stage where we can now ask powerful evolutionary questions, and the development of new molecular techniques provides the mechanism for answering them.

AB Patterns in the dominance of evergreen vs. deciduous plants have long interested ecologists, biogeographers, and global modellers. But previous models to account for these patterns have significant weaknesses. Bottom-up, mechanistic models - based on physiology, competition, and natural selection - have often been non-quantitative or restricted to a small range of habitats, and almost all have ignored belowground costs and whole-plant integration. Top-down, ecosystem-based models have succeeded in quantitatively reproducing several patterns, but rely partly on empirically derived constants and thresholds that lack a mechanistic explanation. It is generally recognized that seasonal drought can favor deciduous leaves, and that infertile soils can favor long-lived evergreen leaves. But no model has yet explained three great paradoxes, involving dominance by 1) evergreens in highly seasonal, boreal forests, 2) deciduous larch in many nutrient-poor peatlands, and 3) evergreen leaf-exchangers in nutrient-poor subtropical forests, even though they shed their leaves just as frequently as deciduous species. This paper outlines a generalized optimality model to account for these and other patterns in leaf longevity and phenology, based on maximizing whole-plant carbon gain or height growth, and building on recent advances in our understanding of the quantitative relationships of leaf photosynthesis, nitrogen content, and mass per unit area to leaf life-span. Only a whole-plant approach can explain evergreen dominance under realistic ecological conditions, or account for the boreal paradox, the larch paradox, the leaf-exchanger paradox, and expected shifts in shade tolerance associated with leaf phenology. Poor soils favor evergreens not merely by increasing the costs of nutrient acquisition, but also by depressing the maximum rate of photosynthesis and thus the seasonal contrast in photosynthetic return between leaves adapted to favorable vs. unfavorable conditions. The dominance of evergreens in western North America beyond the coastal zone of mild winters and winter rainfall appears related to the unusually long photosynthetic season for evergreen vs. deciduous plants there. Future models for optimal leaf phenology must incorporate differences between evergreen and deciduous plants in allocation to photosynthetic vs. non-photosynthetic tissue, rooting depth, stem allometry, xylem anatomy, and exposure to herbivores and leaching, and analyze how these differences interact with the photosynthetic rate, transpiration, and nutrient demands of leaves with different life-spans to affect rates of height growth in specific microsites.

AB The irregular xylem3 (irx3) mutant of Arabidopsis has a severe deficiency in secondary cell wall cellulose deposition that leads to collapsed xylem cells. The irx3 mutation has been mapped to the top arm of chromosome V near the marker nga106. Expressed sequence tag clone 75G11, which exhibits sequence similarity to cellulose synthase, was found to be tightly linked to irx3, and genomic clones containing the gene corresponding to clone 75G11 complemented the irx3 mutation. Thus, the IRX3 gene encodes a cellulose synthase component that is specifically required for the synthesis of cellulose in the secondary cell wall. The irx3 mutant allele contains a stop codon that truncates the gene product by 168 amino acids, suggesting that this allele is null, Furthermore, in contrast to radial swelling1 (rsw1) plants, irx3 plants show no increase in the accumulation of beta-1,4-linked glucose in the noncrystalline cell wall fraction. IRX3 and RSW1 fall into a distinct subgroup (Csa) of Arabidopsis genes showing homology to bacterial cellulose synthases.

AB As species evolve along a phylogenetic tree, we expect closely related species to retain some phenotypic similarities due to their shared evolutionary histories. The amount of expected similarity depends both on the hierarchical phylogenetic structure, and on the specific magnitude and types of evolutionary changes that accumulate during each generation. In this study, we show how models of microevolutionary change can be translated into the resulting macroevolutionary patterns. We illustrate how the structure of phenotypic covariances expected in interspecific measurements can be derived, and how this structure depends on the microevolutionary forces guiding phenotypic change at each generation. We then explore the covariance structure expected from several simple microevolutionary models of phenotypic evolution, including various combinations of random genetic drift, directional selection, stabilizing selection, and environmental change, as well as models of punctuated or burst-like evolution. We find that stabilizing selection leads to patterns of exponential decrease of between species covariance with phylogenetic distance. This is different from the usual linear patterns of decrease assumed in most comparative and systematic methods. Nevertheless, linear patterns of decrease can result from many processes in addition to random genetic drift, such as directional and fluctuating selection as well as modes of punctuated change. Our framework can be used to develop methods for (1) phylogenetic reconstruction; (2) inference of the evolutionary process from comparative data; and (3) conducting or evaluating statistical analyses of comparative data while taking phylogenetic history into account.

AB Expected values of WRIGHT's F-statistics are functions of probabilities of identity in state. These values may be quite different under an infinite allele model and under stepwise mutation processes such as those occurring at microsatellite loci. However, a relationship between the probability of identity in state in stepwise mutation models and the distribution of coalescence times can be deduced from the relationship between probabilities of identity by descent and the distribution of coalescence times. The values of F-IS and F-ST can be computed using this property. Examination of the conditional probability of identity in state given some coalescence time and of the distribution of coalescence times are also useful for explaining the properties of F-IS and F-ST at high mutation rate loci, as shown here in an island model of population structure.

AB Species tree reconstruction is complicated by effects of incomplete lineage sorting, commonly modeled by the multi-species coalescent model (MSC). While there has been substantial progress in developing methods that estimate a species tree given a collection of gene trees, less attention has been paid to fast and accurate methods of quantifying support. In this article, we propose a fast algorithm to compute quartet-based support for each branch of a given species tree with regard to a given set of gene trees. We then show how the quartet support can be used in the context of the MSC to compute (1) the local posterior probability (PP) that the branch is in the species tree and (2) the length of the branch in coalescent units. We evaluate the precision and recall of the local PP on a wide set of simulated and biological datasets, and show that it has very high precision and improved recall compared with multi-locus bootstrapping. The estimated branch lengths are highly accurate when gene tree estimation error is low, but are underestimated when gene tree estimation error increases. Computation of both the branch length and local PP is implemented as new features in ASTRAL.

AB Aim
   The Hutchinsonian hypervolume is the conceptual foundation for many lines of ecological and evolutionary inquiry, including functional morphology, comparative biology, community ecology and niche theory. However, extant methods to sample from hypervolumes or measure their geometry perform poorly on high-dimensional or holey datasets.
   Innovation
   We first highlight the conceptual and computational issues that have prevented a more direct approach to measuring hypervolumes. Next, we present a new multivariate kernel density estimation method that resolves many of these problems in an arbitrary number of dimensions.
   Main conclusions
   We show that our method (implemented as the 'hypervolume' R package) can match several extant methods for hypervolume geometry and species distribution modelling. Tools to quantify high-dimensional ecological hypervolumes will enable a wide range of fundamental descriptive, inferential and comparative questions to be addressed.

TI Larval Export from Marine Reserves and the Recruitment Benefit for Fish

AB Marine reserves, areas closed to all forms of fishing, continue to be advocated and implemented to supplement fisheries and conserve populations [1-4]. However, although the reproductive potential of important fishery species can dramatically increase inside reserves [5-8], the extent to which larval offspring are exported and the relative contribution of reserves to recruitment in fished and protected populations are unknown [4, 9-11]. Using genetic parentage analyses, we resolve patterns of larval dispersal for two species of exploited coral reef fish within a network of marine reserves on the Great Barrier Reef. In a 1,000 km(2) study area, populations resident in three reserves exported 83% (coral trout, Plectropomus maculatus) and 55% (stripey snapper, Lutjanus carponotatus) of assigned offspring to fished reefs, with the remainder having recruited to natal reserves or other reserves in the region. We estimate that reserves, which account for just 28% of the local reef area, produced approximately half of all juvenile recruitment to both reserve and fished reefs within 30 km. Our results provide compelling evidence that adequately protected reserve networks can make a significant contribution to the replenishment of populations on both reserve and fished reefs at a scale that benefits local stakeholders.

AB Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent and lethal of the malaria parasites infecting humans, yet the origin and evolutionary history of this important pathogen remain controversial. Here we develop a single-genome amplification strategy to identify and characterize Plasmodium spp. DNA sequences in faecal samples from wild-living apes. Among nearly 3,000 specimens collected from field sites throughout central Africa, we found Plasmodium infection in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), but not in eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei) or bonobos (Pan paniscus). Ape plasmodial infections were highly prevalent, widely distributed and almost always made up of mixed parasite species. Analysis of more than 1,100 mitochondrial, apicoplast and nuclear gene sequences from chimpanzees and gorillas revealed that 99% grouped within one of six host-specific lineages representing distinct Plasmodium species within the subgenus Laverania. One of these from western gorillas comprised parasites that were nearly identical to P. falciparum. In phylogenetic analyses of full-length mitochondrial sequences, human P. falciparum formed a monophyletic lineage within the gorilla parasite radiation. These findings indicate that P. falciparum is of gorilla origin and not of chimpanzee, bonobo or ancient human origin.

AB As woody plants encroach into grasslands, grass biomass, density and cover decline as wood plant biomass, density and cover increase. There is also a shift in location of the biomass from mostly belowground in the grasslands to aboveground in the woodlands. In addition, species richness and diversity change as herbaceous species are replaced by woody species. This is not a new phenomenon, but has been going on continually as the climate of the Planet has changed. However, in the past 160 years the changes have been unparalleled. The process is encroachment not invasion because woody species that have been increasing in density are native species and have been present in these communities for thousands of years. These indigenous or native woody species have increased in density, cover and biomass because of changes in one or more abiotic or biotic factors or conditions. Woody species that have increased in density and cover are not the cause of the encroachment, but the result of changes of other factors. Globally, the orbit of the Earth is becoming more circular and less elliptical, causing moderation of the climate. Additional global climate changing factors including elevated levels of CO2 and parallel increases in temperature are background factors and probably not the principal causes directing the current wave of encroachment. There is probably not a single reason for encroachment, but a combination of factors that are difficult to disentangle. The prime cause of the current and recent encroachment appears to be high and constant levels of grass herbivory by domestic animals. This herbivory reduces fine fuel with a concomitant reduction in fire frequency or in some cases a complete elimination of fire from these communities. Conditions would now favor the woody plants over the grasses. Reduced grass competition, woody plant seed dispersal and changes in animal populations seem to modify the rate of encroachment rather than being the cause. High concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are not required to explain current woody plant encroachment. Changes in these grassland communities will continue into the future but the specifics are difficult to predict. Density, cover and species composition will fluctuate and will probably continue to change. Increased levels of anthropogenic soil nitrogen suggest replacement of many legumes by other woody species. Modification and perhaps reversal of the changes in these former grassland communities will be an arduous, continuing and perhaps impossible management task. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We know a great deal about the plastic responses of plant phenotypes to the abiotic and biotic environment, but very little about the consequences of phenotypic plasticity for plant communities. In other words, we know that plant traits can vary widely for a given genotype, but we know little about the importance of trait-mediated interactions (TMI) among plants. Here, we discuss three major factors that affect the expression of phenotypic plasticity: variation in the abiotic environment, variation in the presence or identity of neighbors, and variation in herbivory. We consider how plastic responses to these factors might affect interactions among plants. Plastic responses to the abiotic environment have important consequences for conditionality in competitive effects, to the point of causing shifts from competitive to facilitative interactions. Because plants show a high degree of plasticity in response to neighbors, and even to the specific identify of neighbors, phenotypic plasticity may allow species to adjust to the composition of their communities, promoting coexistence and community diversity. Likewise, plastic responses to consumers may have various and counterintuitive consequences: induction of plant resistance, compensatory growth, and increased resource uptake may affect interactions among plants in ways that cannot be predicted simply by considering biomass lost to consumers. What little we know about TMI among plants suggests that they should not be ignored in plant community theory. Although work to date on the community consequences of phenotypic plasticity has been hampered by experimental constraints, new approaches such as manipulating phenotypes by using signals instead of actual environmental conditions and the use of transgenic plants should allow us to rapidly expand our understanding of the community consequences of plant plasticity.

AB Winter soil respiration can represent a significant fraction of the annual C cycle of arctic tundra, but the temperature response of microbial CO2 production in frozen soils is poorly understood. We used a short-term laboratory incubation to describe temperature effects on aerobic respiration in four organic tundra soils from Northern Alaska. Respiration conformed closely to simple first-order exponential equations with constant temperature dependence (r(2) = 0.81-0.98). Temperature coefficients (Q(10)) increased abruptly with freezing, varying from 4.6 to 9.4 among the thawed soils (+0.5 to +14 degreesC), and from 63 to 237 among the frozen. soils (-10 to -0.5 degreesC). The single abrupt increase in temperature dependence with freezing suggests a shift in the dominant process controlling respiration below 0 degreesC. The Q(10)s of frozen soils are too large to represent the direct kinetic effect of temperature, and more likely reflect extracellular barriers to diffusion and/or intracellular desiccation. In thawed soils, respiration Q10s decreased with increasing soil organic matter quality, as indexed by baseline respiration at 0 degreesC, consistent with the thermodynamic argument that reactions metabolizing structurally complex, aromatic molecules have higher activation energies and temperature dependence than reactions metabolizing structurally simpler molecules. In frozen soils, Q(10)s were unrelated to baseline respiration, suggesting that freezing uncouples the direct link between the C chemistry of microbial substrates and the temperature dependence of respiration. Our results underscore the potential for warming to stimulate microbial activity and the turnover of C and nutrients contained in tundra organic soils. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide was increased by 200 microliters per Liter in a forest plantation, where competition between organisms, resource Limitations, and environmental stresses may modulate biotic responses. After 2 years the growth rate of the dominant pine trees increased by about 26 percent relative to trees under ambient conditions. Carbon dioxide enrichment also increased Litterfall and fine-root increment. These changes increased the total net primary production by 25 percent. Such an increase in forest net primary production globally would fix about 50 percent of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide projected to be released into the atmosphere in the year 2050. The response of this young, rapidly growing forest to carbon dioxide may represent the upper Limit for forest carbon sequestration.

AB The developmental processes through which songbirds acquire their species-typical songs have been well-studied from a proximate perspective, but less attention has been given to the ultimate question of why birds learn to sing. We present a new hypothesis for the adaptive significance of song learning in songbirds, suggesting that this specialized form of vocal development provides an indicator mechanism by which females can accurately assess the quality of potential mates. This hypothesis expands on the established idea that song earn provide an indicator of male quality, but it explicitly links the variation in song expression that females use to choose mates to the developmental processes through which song is acquired. How well a male sings-reflected in repertoire size or in other learned features of a male's singing behavior-provides an honest indicator of quality because the timing of song learning and, more importantly, the timing of the development of brain structures mediating learning corresponds to a period in development during which young songbirds are most likely to undergo nutritional stress. This correspondence means that song learning can provide a sensitive indicator of early developmental history in general, which in turn reflects various aspects of the phenotypic and genotypic quality of a potential mate.

AB Although biologists have long assumed that plant resistance characters evolved under selection exerted by such natural enemies as herbivores and pathogens, experimental evidence for this assumption is sparse. We present evidence that natural enemies exert selection on particular plant resistance characters. Specifically, we demonstrate that elimination of natural enemies from an experimental field population of Arabidopsis thaliana alters the pattern of selection on genetic variation in two characters that have been shown to reduce herbivore damage in the field: total glucosinolate concentration and trichome density. The change in pattern of selection reveals that natural enemies imposed selection favoring increased glucosinolate concentration and increased trichome density, and thus, supports one of the major assumptions of the coevolution hypothesis. We also demonstrate that a pattern of stabilizing selection on glucosinolate concentration results from a balance between the costs and benefits associated with increasing levels of this resistance character. This result provides direct confirmation of the appropriateness of cost-benefit models for characterizing the evolution of plant defenses.

AB We use the terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM), a process-based model, to investigate how interactions between carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics affect predictions of net primary productivity (NPP) for potential vegetation in North America. Data on pool sizes and fluxes of C and N from intensively studied field sites are used to calibrate the model for each of 17 non-wetland vegetation types. We use information on climate, soils, and vegetation to make estimates for each of 11,299 non-wetland, 0.5 degrees latitude x 0.5 degrees longitude, grid cells in North America. The potential annual NPP and net N mineralization (NETNMIN) of North America are estimated to be 7.032 x 10(15) g C yr(-1) and 104.6 x 10(12) g N yr(-1), respectively. Both NPP and NETNMIN increase along gradients of increasing temperature and moisture in northern and temperate regions of the continent, respectively. Nitrogen limitation of productivity is weak in tropical forests, increasingly stronger in temperate and boreal forests, and very strong in tundra ecosystems. The degree to which productivity is limited by the availability of N also varies within ecosystems. Thus spatial resolution in estimating exchanges of C between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere is improved by modeling the linkage between C and N dynamics. We also perform a factorial experiment with TEM on temperate mixed forest in North America to evaluate the importance of considering interactions between C and N dynamics in the response of NPP to an elevated temperature of 2 degrees C. With the C cycle uncoupled from the N cycle, NPP decreases primarily because of higher plant respiration. However, with the C and N cycles coupled, NPP increases because productivity that is due to increased N availability more than offsets the higher costs of plant respiration. Thus, to investigate how global change will affect biosphere atmosphere interactions, process-based models need to consider linkages between the C and N cycles.

AB To maximize net gain of a tree, leaves must be replaced when net gain of a leaf per unit time over the leaf's life span is maximum. A model in which leaf longevity is determined to maximize the net gain of a leaf per unit time is constructed. The model predicts that leaf longevity is short when initial net photosynthetic rate of the leaf is large, long when the construction cost of the leaf is large, and short when the decrease in net photosynthetic rate with time is large. The model describes leaf habit (deciduousness and evergreenness) with the length of the favorable period for photosynthesis within a year and simulates distributional pattern of leaf habit along latitudes. The percentages of evergreenness decrease with decreasing favorable-period length and reach the minimum at an intermediate length of the favorable period but increase again with a decrease in the length of the favorable period. A bimodal distributional pattern with two peaks, one at lower and the other at higher latitudes, is observed for the percentages of evergreenness. Percentages of deciduousness show a unimodal distribution pattern with a peak at midlatitude.

AB Rapid industrial development and human activities have caused a degradation of soil quality and fertility. There is increasing interest in rehabilitating low fertility soils to improve crop yield and sustainability. Biochar, a carbonaceous material intentionally produced from biomass, is widely used as an amendment to improve soil fertility by retaining nutrients and, potentially, enhancing nutrient bioavailability. But, biochar is not a simple carbon material with uniform properties, so appropriate biochar selection must consider soil type and target crop. In this respect, many recent studies have evaluated several modification methods to maximize the effectiveness of biochar such as optimizing the pyrolysis process, mixing with other soil amendments, composting with other additives, activating by physicochemical processes, and coating with other organic materials. However, the economic feasibility of biochar application cannot be neglected. Strategies for reducing biochar losses and its application costs, and increasing its use efficiency need to be developed. This review synthesized current understanding and introduces holistic and practical approaches for biochar application to low fertility soils, with consideration of economic aspects.

AB Emerging vector-borne diseases are an important issue in global health. Many vector-borne pathogens have appeared in new regions in the past two decades, while many endemic diseases have increased in incidence. Although introductions and emergence of endemic pathogens are often considered to be distinct processes, many endemic pathogens are actually spreading at a local scale coincident with habitat change. We draw attention to key differences between dynamics and disease burden that result from increased pathogen transmission after habitat change and after introduction into new regions. Local emergence is commonly driven by changes in human factors as much as by enhanced enzootic cycles, whereas pathogen invasion results from anthropogenic trade and travel where and when conditions (eg, hosts, vectors, and climate) are suitable for a pathogen. Once a pathogen is established, ecological factors related to vector characteristics can shape the evolutionary selective pressure and result in increased use of people as transmission hosts. We describe challenges inherent in the control of vector-borne zoonotic diseases and some emerging non-traditional strategies that could be effective in the long term.

AB P>1. Almost all plants are engaged in symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. These soil fungi can promote plant growth by supplying limiting nutrients to plant roots in return for plant assimilates.
   2. Many mycorrhizal fungi are not host specific and one fungal individual can colonize and interconnect a considerable number of plants. The existence of these so-called mycorrhizal networks implies that fungi have the potential to facilitate growth of other plants and distribute resources among plants irrespective of their size, status or identity. In this paper, we explore the significance of mycorrhizal fungal networks for individual plants and for plant communities.
   3. We address the following questions: (i) are all plant species benefitting from mycorrhizal networks, (ii) is benefit dependent on the size or age of a plant, (iii) is fungal support related to the relative dominance of plants in a community, (iv) are there host dependent barriers and physiological constraints for support and (v) what is the impact of mycorrhizal networks on plant-plant interactions and plant community dynamics? Moreover, using a review of published studies, we test whether mycorrhizal networks facilitate growth of small seedlings that establish between or near larger plants.
   4. We found 60 cases where seedling species were grown together with larger plants with or without mycorrhizal fungal networks. Mycorrhizal networks promoted seedling growth in 48% of the cases (for 21 seedling species), while negative effects (25%) and no effects (27%) were also common. Seedlings associating with ectomycorrhizal fungi benefitted in the majority of the cases while effects on seedlings associating with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were more variable. Thus, the facilitative effects of mycorrhizal fungal networks depend on seedling species identity, mycorrhizal identity, plant species combinations and study system. We present a number of hypothetical scenarios that can explain the results based on cost-benefit relationship of individual members in a network.
   5.Synthesis. Overall, this review shows that mycorrhizal networks play a key role in plant communities by facilitating and influencing seedling establishment, by altering plant-plant interactions and by supplying and recycling nutrients.

AB Climate change disrupts ecological systems in many ways. Many documented responses depend on species' life histories, contributing to the view that climate change effects are important but difficult to characterize generally. However, systematic variation in metabolic effects of temperature across trophic levels suggests that warming may lead to predictable shifts in food web structure and productivity. We experimentally tested the effects of warming on food web structure and productivity under two resource supply scenarios. Consistent with predictions based on universal metabolic responses to temperature, we found that warming strengthened consumer control of primary production when resources were augmented. Warming shifted food web structure and reduced total biomass despite increases in primary productivity in a marine food web. In contrast, at lower resource levels, food web production was constrained at all temperatures. These results demonstrate that small temperature changes could dramatically shift food web dynamics and provide a general, species-independent mechanism for ecological response to environmental temperature change.

AB The role of natural selection in speciation, first described by Darwin, has finally been widely accepted. Yet, the nature and time course of the genetic changes that result in speciation remain mysterious. To date, genetic analyses of speciation have focused almost exclusively on retrospective analyses of reproductive isolation between species or subspecies and on hybrid sterility or inviability rather than on ecologically based barriers to gene flow. However, if we are to fully understand the origin of species, we must analyze the process from additional vantage points. By studying the genetic causes of partial reproductive isolation between specialized ecological races, early barriers to gene flow can be identified before they become confounded with other species differences. This population-level approach can reveal patterns that become invisible over time, such as the mosaic nature of the genome early in speciation. Under divergent selection in sympatry, the genomes of incipient species become temporary genetic mosaics in which ecologically important genomic regions resist gene exchange, even as gene flow continues over most of the genome. Analysis of such mosaic genomes suggests that surprisingly large genomic regions around divergently selected quantitative trait loci can be protected from interrace recombination by "divergence hitchhiking.'' Here, I describe the formation of the genetic mosaic during early ecological speciation, consider the establishment, effects, and transitory nature of divergence hitchhiking around key ecologically important genes, and describe a 2-stage model for genetic divergence during ecological speciation with gene flow.

AB Phenology is the study of recurring life-cycle events, classic examples being the flowering of plants and animal migration. Phenological responses are increasingly relevant for addressing applied environmental issues. Yet, challenges remain with respect to spanning scales of observation, integrating observations across taxa, and modeling phenological sequences to enable ecological forecasts in light of future climate change. Recent advances that are helping to address these questions include refined landscape-scale phenology estimates from satellite data, advanced, instrument-based approaches for field measurements, and new cyberinfrastructure for archiving and distribution of products. These breakthroughs are improving our understanding in diverse areas, including modeling land-surface exchange, evaluating climate-phenology relationships, and making land-management decisions.

AB The use of regression analysis has been instrumental in allowing evolutionary biologists to estimate the strength and mode of natural selection. Although directional and correlational selection gradients are equal to their corresponding regression coefficients, quadratic regression coefficients must be doubled to estimate stabilizing/disruptive selection gradients. Based on a sample of 33 papers published in Evolution between 2002 and 2007, at least 78% of papers have not doubled quadratic regression coefficients, leading to an appreciable underestimate of the strength of stabilizing and disruptive selection. Proper treatment of quadratic regression coefficients is necessary for estimation of fitness surfaces and contour plots, canonical analysis of the gamma matrix, and modeling the evolution of populations on an adaptive landscape.

AB Catchment configuration and the nature of connectivity within and between landscape compartments affect the operation of sediment cascades and geomorphic responses to disturbance events of differing magnitude and frequency. This paper introduces the concept of landform impediments, termed buffers, bangers and blankets, that impede sediment conveyance by limiting the connectivity between landscape compartments. Buffers restrict sediment delivery to channels, barriers inhibit sediment movement along channels, and blankets drape channel or floodplain surfaces affecting the accessibility of sediment to entrainment. These features operate as a series of switches which turn on/off processes of sediment delivery, determining the effective catchment area at any given time. Using previously documented examples, the role of these features in affecting the operation of sediment cascades in a low relief, passive landscape setting such as the Australian landmass is contrasted to examples from high relief, uplifting settings in New Zealand. The Australian examples are further explored by examining how changes to landscape connectivity brought about by human disturbance since European settlement have impacted upon landscape sensitivity and prospects for river recovery. This approach to analysis of impediments to sediment conveyance is generic and can be applied in any environmental setting. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim Biotic homogenization describes the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic or functional similarity of two or more biotas over a specified time interval. The study of biotic homogenization is a young and rapidly emerging research area in the budding field of conservation biogeography, and this paper aims to synthesize our current knowledge of this process and advocate a more systematic approach to its investigation.
   Methods Based on a comprehensive examination of the primary literature this paper reviews the process of biotic homogenization, including its definition, quantification, underlying ecological mechanisms, environmental drivers, the empirical evidence for different taxonomic groups, and the potential ecological and evolutionary implications. Important gaps in our knowledge are then identified, and areas of new research that show the greatest promise for advancing our current thinking on biotic homogenization are highlighted.
   Results Current knowledge of the patterns, mechanisms and implications of biotic homogenization is highly variable across taxonomic groups, but in general is incomplete. Quantitative estimates are almost exclusively limited to freshwater fishes and plants in the United States, and the principal mechanisms and drivers of homogenization remain elusive. To date research has focused on taxonomic homogenization, and genetic and functional homogenization has received inadequate attention. Trends over the past decade, however, suggest that biotic homogenization is emerging as a topic of greater research interest.
   Main conclusions My investigation revealed a number of important knowledge gaps and priority research needs in the science of biotic homogenization. Future studies should examine the homogenization process for different community properties (species occurrence and abundance) at multiple spatial and temporal scales, with careful attention paid to the various biological mechanisms (invasions vs. extinctions) and environmental drivers (environmental alteration vs. biotic interactions) involved. Perhaps most importantly, this research should recognize that there are multiple possible outcomes resulting from the accumulation of species invasions and extinctions, including biotic differentiation whereby genetic, taxonomic or functional similarity of biotas decreases over time.

AB We investigated the independent and combined effects of experimental warming and grazing on plant species diversity on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau, a region highly vulnerable to ongoing climate and land use changes. Experimental warming caused a 26-36% decrease in species richness, a response that was generally dampened by experimental grazing. Higher species losses occurred at the drier sites where N was less available. Moreover, we observed an indirect effect of climate change on species richness as mediated by plant-plant interactions. Heat stress and warming-induced litter accumulation are potential explanations for the species' responses to experimental warming. This is the first reported experimental evidence that climate warming could cause dramatic declines in plant species diversity in high elevation ecosystems over short time frames and supports model predictions of species losses with anthropogenic climate change.

AB In this paper, we analyzed 3 years of carbon flux data from continuous eddy covariance measurements to investigate how soil moisture, rain pulses, and growth alter the response of ecosystem respiration to temperature. The data were acquired over an annual grassland and from the grass understory of an oak/grass savanna ecosystem in California. We observed that ecosystem respiration was an exponential function of soil temperature during the winter wet season and a jump in ecosystem respiration occurred, at comparable temperatures, during the spring growth period. The depletion of the moisture from the soil reservoir, during spring, limited ecosystem respiration after its volumetric water content dropped below a threshold of 0.15 m(3) m(-3). The senescence of grass during the summer switched the source of ecosystem respiration to heterotrophic bacteria and fungi. During the summer, respiration proceeded at a low basal rate (about 0.10 to 0.3 g C m(-2) d(-1)), except when summer rain events stimulated large dynamic pulses in heterotrophic respiration. Peak respiratory pulses were on the order of 60-80 times baseline and could not be explained by functions that depend on mean soil moisture and temperature. We found that the magnitude of the respiratory pulses was inversely related to its prerain value and that the time constant, describing the exponential decay of the respiratory pulses after the rain event, was a function of the amount of rainfall. The amount of carbon lost, in association with a few summer rain events, was greater at the site with higher primary productivity and soil carbon content.

AB This paper develops a spatial hedonic model to explain residential values in a region within a 30-mile radius of Washington DC. Hedonic models of housing or land values are commonplace, but are rarely estimated for non-urban problems and never using the type of spatial data (geographical information system or GIS) available to us. Our approach offers the potential for a richer model, one that allows for spatial heterogeneity in estimation, and one that ties residential land values to features of the landscape. Beyond the traditional variables to explain residential values, such as man-made and ecological features of the parcel and distance to cities and natural amenities, we also hypothesize that the value of a parcel in residential land use is affected by the pattern of surrounding land uses, not just specific features of point locations. We have also created and added these variables to the hedonic model by choosing an appropriate area around an observation, and calculating measures of percent open space, diversity, and fragmentation of land uses, measured at different scales around that observation. These indices have, for the most part, been significant in the models. By including two of the landscape indices developed by landscape ecologists, we have developed a model that explains land and housing values more completely, by capturing how individuals value the diversity and fragmentation of land uses around their homes.

AB Artificial nest experiments have been used in approximately 80 recent studies to identify a wide range of factors influencing reproductive success of birds. Despite the same factors being examined in different studies, few consistent patterns have emerged from these experiments. Analysis of reproductive success at artificial and natural nests reveals that reproductive success measured with use of artificial nests is frequently underestimated, In addition, several studies suggest that different species of predators may be differentially attracted to the two types of nest. These results call the utility of artificial nests into question as a tool for elucidating factors influencing the success of natural nests, Analysis of the methodology used in artificial nest experiments reveals that in general there is poor correspondence between the appearance of experimental setups and the natural systems they attempt to model. If future experiments with artificial nests are to contribute to theory, the quality of experiments must improve and the assumptions underlying the artificial approach must be tested, Collecting this information will be relatively simple compared with the time-consuming task of experimenting with natural nests, Until these data are collected, conclusions about nesting ecology derived from the use of artificial nest experiments should be treated as preliminary.

AB Samples from nine populations belonging to three African (intermissa, scutellata and capensis) and four European (mellifera, ligustica, carnica and cecropia) Apis mellifera subspecies were scored for seven microsatellite loci. A large amount of genetic variation (between seven and 30 alleles per locus) was detected. Average heterozygosity and average number of alleles were significantly higher in African than in European subspecies, in agreement with larger effective population sizes in Africa. Microsatellite analyses confirmed that A, mellifera evolved in three distinct and deeply differentiated lineages previously detected by morphological and mitochondrial DNA studies. Dendrogram analysis of workers from a given population indicated that super-sisters cluster together when using a sufficient number of microsatellite data whereas half-sisters do not. An index of classification was derived to summarize the clustering of different taxonomic levels in large phylogenetic trees based on individual genotypes. Finally, individual population X loci data were used to test the adequacy of the two alternative mutation models, the infinite allele model (IAM) and the stepwise mutation models. The better fit overall of the IAM probably results from the majority of the microsatellites used including repeats of two or three different length motifs (compound microsatellites).

AB The declining health of marine ecosystems around the world is evidence that current piecemeal governance is inadequate to successfully support healthy coastal and ocean ecosystems and sustain human uses of the ocean. One proposed solution to this problem is ecosystem-based marine spatial planning (MSP), which is a process that informs the spatial distribution of activities in the ocean so that existing and emerging uses can be maintained, use conflicts reduced, and ecosystem health and services protected and sustained for future generations. Because a key goal of ecosystem-based MSP is to maintain the delivery of ecosystem services that humans want and need, it must be based on ecological principles that articulate the scientifically recognized attributes of healthy, functioning ecosystems. These principles should be incorporated into a decision-making framework with clearly defined targets for these ecological attributes. This paper identifies ecological principles for MSP based on a synthesis of previously suggested and/or operationalized principles, along with recommendations generated by a group of twenty ecologists and marine scientists with diverse backgrounds and perspectives on MSP. The proposed four main ecological principles to guide MSP maintaining or restoring: native species diversity, habitat diversity and heterogeneity, key species, and connectivity and two additional guidelines, the need to account for context and uncertainty, must be explicitly taken into account in the planning process. When applied in concert with social, economic, and governance principles, these ecological principles can inform the designation and siting of ocean uses and the management of activities in the ocean to maintain or restore healthy ecosystems, allow delivery of marine ecosystem services, and ensure sustainable economic and social benefits.

AB Research over the past several decades has clarified the mechanisms and timescales involved in stabilizing organic matter ill Soils, but We Still lack process-based understanding sufficient for predicting how vulnerable soil carbon (C) is, given climatic or environmental change across a range of soil types and landscapes. Part of the problem is the emphasis oil short-term studies and processes that dominate C balance at the point or soil profile scale, whereas other processes that dominate over longer timescales and larger spatial scales may actually be more important for determining the carbon balance of soils in a region. Radiocarbon is one of the only tools to study the dynamics of C in soils oil decadal to millennial timescales. It provides a means for directly testing models of organic matter dynamics in ecosystems and, when measured in respired CO2 or dissolved organic carbon (DOC), provides evidence of shifts in microbial metabolism. This review explores the application of this underutilized tool, with an emphasis on conceptual advances made using the state-factor approach mid oil detecting processes causing abrupt change in soil C stores.

AB The dramatic increase in human activities all over the world has caused, on an evolutionary time scale, a sudden rise in especially low-pitched noise levels. Ambient noise may be detrimental to birds through direct stress, masking of predator arrival or associated alarm calls, and by interference of acoustic signals in general. Two of the most important functions of avian acoustic signals are territory defence and mate attraction. Both of these functions are hampered when signal efficiency is reduced through rising noise levels, resulting in direct negative fitness consequences. Many bird species are less abundant near highways and studies are becoming available on reduced reproductive success in noisy territories. Urbanization typically leads to homogenization of bird communities over large geographical ranges. We review current evidence for whether and how anthropogenic noise plays a role in these patterns of decline in diversity and density. We also provide details of a case study on great tits (Parus major), a successful urban species. Great tits show features that other species may lack and make them unsuitable for city life. We hypothesize that behavioural plasticity in singing behaviour may allow species more time to adapt to human-altered environments and we address the potential for microevolutionary changes and urban speciation in European blackbirds (Turdus merula). We conclude by providing an overview of mitigating measures available to abate noise levels that are degrading bird breeding areas. Bird conservationists probably gain most by realizing that birds and humans often benefit from the same or only slightly modified measures.

AB The suppression of agricultural pests has often been proposed as an important service of natural enemy diversity, but few experiments have tested this assertion. In this study we present empirical evidence that increasing the richness of a particular guild of natural enemies can reduce the density of a widespread group of herbivorous pests and, in turn, increase the yield of an economically important crop. We performed an experiment in large field enclosures where we manipulated the presence/absence of three of the most important natural enemies (the coccinellid beetle Harmonia axyridis, the damsel bug Nabis sp., and the parasitic wasp Aphidius ervi) of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) that feed on alfalfa (Medicago sativa). When all three enemy species were together, the population density of the pea aphid was suppressed more than could be predicted from the summed impact of each enemy species alone. As crop yield was negatively related to pea aphid density, there was a concomitant non-additive increase in the production of alfalfa in enclosures containing the more diverse enemy guild. This trophic cascade appeared to be influenced by an indirect interaction involving a second herbivore inhabiting the system the cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora. Data suggest that high relative densities of cowpea aphids inhibited parasitism of pea aphids by the specialist parasitoid, A. ervi. Therefore, when natural enemies were together and densities of cowpea aphids were reduced by generalist predators, parasitism of pea aphids increased. This interaction modification is similar to other types of indirect interactions among enemy species ( e. g. predator predator facilitation) that can enhance the suppression of agricultural pests. Results of our study, and those of others performed in agroecosystems, complement the broader debate over how biodiversity influences ecosystem functioning by specifically focusing on systems that produce goods of immediate relevance to human society.

AB This contribution proposes the meta-ecosystem concept as a natural extension of the metapopulation and metacommunity concepts. A meta-ecosystem is defined as a set of ecosystems connected by spatial flows of energy, materials and organisms across ecosystem boundaries. This concept provides a powerful theoretical tool to understand the emergent properties that arise from spatial coupling of local ecosystems, such as global source-sink constraints, diversity-productivity patterns, stabilization of ecosystem processes and indirect interactions at landscape or regional scales. The meta-ecosystem perspective thereby has the potential to integrate the perspectives of community and landscape ecology, to provide novel fundamental insights into the dynamics and functioning of ecosystems from local to global scales, and to increase our ability to predict the consequences of land-use changes on biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services to human societies.

AB Human society has used freshwater from rivers, lakes, groundwater,, and wetlands for many different urban, agricultural, and industrial activities, but in doing so has overlooked its value in supporting ecosystems. Freshwater is vital to human life and societal well-being, and thus its utilization for consumption, irrigation, and transport has long taken precedence over other commodities and services provided by freshwater ecosystems. However, there is growing recognition that functionally intact and biologically complex aquatic ecosystems provide many economically valuable services and long-term benefits to society. The short-term benefits include ecosystem goods and services, such as food supply, flood control, purification of human and industrial wastes, and habitat for plant and animal life-and these are costly, if, not impossible, to replace. Long-term benefits include the sustained provision of those goods and services, as well as the adaptive capacity of aquatic ecosystems to respond to future environmental alterations, such as climate change. Thus, maintenance of the processes and properties that support freshwater ecosystem integrity should be included in debates over sustainable water resource allocation.
   The purpose of this report is to explain how the integrity of freshwater ecosystems depends upon adequate quantity, quality, timing, and temporal variability of water flow. Defining these requirements in a comprehensive but general manner provides a better foundation for their inclusion in current and future debates about allocation of water resources. In this way the needs of freshwater ecosystems can be legitimately recognized and addressed. We also recommend ways in which freshwater ecosystems can be protected, maintained, and restored.
   Freshwater ecosystem structure and function are tightly linked to the watershed or catchment of which they are a part. Because riverine networks, lakes, wetlands, and their connecting groundwaters, are literally the "sinks" into 'Which landscapes drain, they are greatly influenced by terrestrial processes, including many human uses or modifications of land and water. Freshwater ecosystems, whether lakes, wetlands, or rivers, have specific requirements in terms of quantity, quality, and seasonality of their water supplies. Sustainability normally requires these systems to fluctuate within a natural range of variation. Flow regime, sediment and organic matter inputs, thermal and light characteristics, chemical and nutrient characteristics, and biotic assemblages are fundamental defining attributes of freshwater ecosystems. These attributes impart relatively unique characteristics of productivity and biodiversity to each ecosystem. The natural range of variation in each of these attributes is critical to maintaining the integrity and dynamic potential of aquatic ecosystems; therefore, management should allow for dynamic change. Piecemeal approaches cannot solve the problems confronting freshwater ecosystems.
   Scientific definitions of the requirements to protect and maintain aquatic ecosystems are necessary but insufficient for establishing the appropriate distribution between societal and ecosystem water needs. For scientific knowledge to be implemented science must be connected to a political agenda for sustainable development. We offer these recommendations as. a beginning to redress how water is viewed and managed in the United States: (1) Frame national and regional water management policies to explicitly incorporate freshwater ecosystem needs, particularly those related to naturally variable flow regimes and to the linking of water quality with water quantity; (2) Define water resources to include watersheds, so that freshwaters are viewed within a landscape, or systems context; (3) Increase communication and education across disciplines, especially among engineers, hydrologists, economists, and ecologists to facilitate an integrated view of freshwater resources; (4) Increase restoration efforts, using well-grounded ecological principles as guidelines; (5) Maintain and protect the remaining freshwater ecosystems that have high integrity; and (6) Recognize the dependence of human society on naturally functioning ecosystems.

AB Magnaporthe oryzae is described as a new species distinct from M. grisea. Gene trees were inferred for Magnaporthe species using portions of three genes: actin, beta-tubulin, and calmodulin. These gene trees were found to be concordant and distinguished two distinct clades within M. grisea. One clade is associated with the grass genus Digitaria and is therefore nomenclaturally tied to M. grisea. The other clade is associated with Oryza saliva and other cultivated grasses and is described as a new species, M. oryzae. While no morphological characters as yet distinguish them, M. oryzae is distinguished from M. grisea by several base substitutions in each of three loci as well as results from laboratory matings; M. oryzae and M. grisea are not interfertile. Given that M. oryzae is the scientifically correct name for isolates associated with rice blast and grey leaf spot, continued use of M. grisea for such isolates would require formal nomenclatural conservation.

AB Animal reintroductions and translocations are potentially important interventions to save species from extinction, but most are unsuccessful. Mortality due to predation is a principal cause of failure. Animals that have been isolated from predators, either throughout their lifetime or over evolutionary time, may no longer express appropriate antipredator behavior. For this reason, conservation biologists are beginning to include antipredator training in pre-release preparation procedures. We describe the evolutionary and ontogenetic circumstances under which antipredator behavior may degenerate or be lost, and we use principles from learning theory to predict which elements can be enhanced or recovered by training The empirical literature demonstrates that training can improve antipredator skills, but the effectiveness of such interventions is influenced by a number of constraints. We predict that it will be easier to teach animals to cope with predators if they have experienced ontogenetic isolation than if they have undergone evolutionary isolation. Similarly, animals should learn more easily if they have been evolutionarily isolated from some rather than all predators. Training to a novel predator may be more successful ifa species has effective responses to similar predators. In contrast, it may be difficult to teach proper avoidance behavior or to introduce specialized predator-specific responses, if appropriate motor patterns are not already present. We conclude that pre-release training has the potential to enhance the expression of preexisting antipredator behavior. Potential training techniques involve classical conditioning procedures in which animals learn that model predators are predictors of aversive events. However wildlife managers should be aware that problems, such as the emergence of inappropriate responses, may arise during such training.

AB Strong top-down control by consumers has been demonstrated in rocky intertidal communities around the world. In contrast, the role of bottom-up effects (nutrients and productivity), known to have important influences in terrestrial and particularly freshwater ecosystems, is poorly known in marine hard-bottom communities. Recent studies in South Africa, New England, Oregon and New Zealand suggest that bottom-up processes can have important effects on rocky intertidal community structure. A significant aspect of all of these studies was the incorporation of processes varying on larger spatial scales than previously considered (10's to 1000's of km). In all four regions, variation in oceanographic factors (currents, upwelling, nutrients, rates of particle flux) was associated with different magnitudes of algal and/or phytoplankton abundance, availability of particulate food, and rates of recruitment. These processes led to differences in prey abundance and growth, secondary production, consumer growth, and consumer impact on prey resources. Oceanographic conditions therefore may vary on scales that generate ecologically significant variability in populations at the bottom of the food chain, and through upward-flowing food chain effects, lead to variation in top-down trophic effects. I conclude that top-down and bottom-up processes can be important joint determinants of community structure in rocky intertidal habitats, and predict that such effects will occur generally wherever oceanographic 'discontinuities' lie adjacent to rocky coastlines. I further argue that increased attention by researchers and of funding agencies to such benthic-pelagic coupling would dramatically enhance our understanding of the dynamics of marine ecosystems.

AB This paper identifies challenges inherent in addressing multi-scale environmental problems, and outlines tentative guidelines for addressing such challenges and linking science and policy across scales. The study and practice of environmental assessment and management increasingly recognize the importance of scale and cross-scale dynamics in understanding and addressing global environmental change. These ongoing efforts, however, lack a systematic way of thinking about and addressing the challenges involved in integrating science and policy across multiple scales, for example, in the design of policy-relevant, scientific assessments of problems such as climate change. These challenges include matching scales of biogeophysical systems with scales of management systems, avoiding scale discordance (matching the scale of the assessment with the scale of management), and accounting for cross-scale dynamics. In this paper we propose tentative guidelines for meeting such challenges for both assessors and decisionmakers: (1) utilize boundary organizations - institutions which serve to mediate between scientists and decision-makers, and between these actors at different scales; (2) utilize scale-dependent comparative advantages - coordinating the allocation of resources, technical expertise, and decision-making authority to best capitalize on scale-specific capabilities; and (3) employ adaptive assessment and management strategies - constructing long-term, iterative; experiment-based processes of integrated assessment and management.

AB We propose a new method to estimate and correct for phylogenetic inertia in comparative data analysis. The method, called phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) starts by performing a principal coordinate analysis on a pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix between species. Traits under analysis are regressed on eigenvectors retained by a broken-stick model in such a way that estimated values express phylogenetic trends in data and residuals express independent evolution of each species. This partitioning is similar to that realized by the spatial autoregressive method, but the method proposed here overcomes the problem of low statistical performance that occurs with autoregressive method when phylogenetic correlation is low or when sample size is too small to detect it. Also, PVR is easier to perform with large samples because it is based on well-known techniques of multivariate and regression analyses. We evaluated the performance of PVR and compared it with the autoregressive method using real datasets and simulations. A detailed worked example using body size evolution of Carnivora mammals indicated that phylogenetic inertia in this trait is elevated and similarly estimated by both methods. In this example, Type I error at alpha = 0.05 of PVR was equal to 0.048, but an increase in the number of eigenvectors used in the regression increases the error. Also, similarity between PVR and the autoregressive method, defined by correlation between their residuals, decreased by overestimating the number of eigenvalues necessary to express the phylogenetic distance matrix. To evaluate the influence of cladogram topology on the distribution of eigenvalues extracted from the double-centered phylogenetic distance matrix, we analyzed 100 randomly generated cladograms (up Ito 100 species). Multiple linear regression of log transformed variables indicated that the number of eigenvalues extracted by the broken-stick model can be fully explained by cladogram topology. Therefore, the broken-stick model is an adequate criterion for determining the correct number of eigenvectors to be used by PVR. We also simulated distinct levels of phylogenetic inertia by producing a trend across 10, 25, and 50 species arranged in "comblike" cladograms and then adding random vectors with increased residual variances around this trend. In doing so, we provide an evaluation of the performance of both methods with data generated under different evolutionary models than tested previously. The results showed that both PVR and autoregressive method are efficient in detecting inertia in data when sample size is relatively high (more than 25 species) and when phylogenetic inertia is high. However, PVR is more efficient at smaller sample sizes and when level of phylogenetic inertia is low. These conclusions were also supported by the analysis of 10 real datasets regarding body size evolution in different animal clades. We concluded that PVR can be a useful alternative to an autoregressive method in comparative data analysis.

AB Animals and plants often exhibit narrow ranges of thermal preference in variable environments; fitness-enhancing activities such as reproduction and growth tend to be concentrated during times in which body temperature lies within that narrow range. The relation between fitness-associated performance and temperature is modeled by a performance curve defined by two traits: performance breadth (T-br), a measure of thermal specialization, and the critical maximum temperature for performance (T-max). Optimality models are used to define the fitness landscape for these two traits under several different patterns of within- and among-generation variation in temperature. In constant environments and environments in which there is significant within-generation variation, specialists with narrow preference ranges are the favored phenotype. In environments in which there is considerable among-generation but little within-generation variation, generalists with broad preference ranges are favored. Specialists in a constant environment have a mean fitness an order of magnitude higher than any phenotype in more variable environments, demonstrating that homeostatic mechanisms can confer a large fitness advantage. In contrast to previous models of environmental tolerance, these performance models suggest that increasing temporal environmental variation can favor the evolution of thermal specialization.

AB Human activity is causing wild populations to experience rapid trait change and local extirpation. The resulting effects on intraspecific variation could have substantial consequences for ecological processes and ecosystem services. Although researchers have long acknowledged that variation among species influences the surrounding environment, only recently has evidence accumulated for the ecological importance of variation within species. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the ecological effects of variation within a species (intraspecific effects) with the effects of replacement or removal of that species (species effects). We evaluated direct and indirect ecological responses, including changes in abundance (or biomass), rates of ecological processes and changes in community composition. Our results show that intraspecific effects are often comparable to, and sometimes stronger than, species effects. Species effects tend to be larger for direct ecological responses (for example, through consumption), whereas intraspecific effects and species effects tend to be similar for indirect responses (for example, through trophic cascades). Intraspecific effects are especially strong when indirect interactions alter community composition. Our results summarize data from the first generation of studies examining the relative ecological effects of intraspecific variation. Our conclusions can help inform the design of future experiments and the formulation of strategies to quantify and conserve biodiversity.

AB Climate change and anthropogenic activities are two factors that have important effects on the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems, but it is almost impossible to fully separate them at present. This study used process-based terrestrial ecosystem model to stimulate the potential climate-driven alpine grassland net primary production (NPP), and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach based on remote sensing to stimulate actual alpine grassland NPP influenced by both of climate change and anthropogenic activities over the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP) from 1982 to 2011. After the models were systematically calibrated, the simulations were validated with continuous 3-year paired field sample data, which were separately collected in fenced and open grasslands. We then simulated the human-induced NPP, calculated as the difference between potential and actual NPP, to determine the effect of anthropogenic activities on the alpine grassland ecosystem. The simulation results showed that the climate change and anthropogenic activities mainly drove the actual grassland NPP increasing in the first 20-year and the last 10-year respectively, the area percentage of actual grassland NPP change caused by climate change declined from 79.62% in the period of 1982-2001 to 56.59% over the last 10 years; but the percentage change resulting from human activities doubled from 20.16% to 42.98% in the same periods over the QTP. The effect of human activities on the alpine grassland ecosystem obviously intensified in the latter period compared with the former 20 years, so the negative effect caused by climate change to ecosystem could have been relatively mitigated or offset over the QTP in the last ten years.

AB In a time of increasing urbanization, the fundamental value of conserving urban biodiversity remains controversial. How much of a fixed budget should be spent on conservation in urban versus nonurban landscapes? The answer should depend on the goals that drive our conservation actions, yet proponents of urban conservation often fail to specify the motivation for protecting urban biodiversity. This is an important shortcoming on several fronts, including a missed opportunity to make a stronger appeal to those who believe conservation biology should focus exclusively on more natural, wilder landscapes. We argue that urban areas do offer an important venue for conservation biology, but that we must become better at choosing and articulating our goals. We explored seven possible motivations for urban biodiversity conservation: preserving local biodiversity, creating stepping stones to nonurban habitat, understanding and facilitating responses to environmental change, conducting environmental education, providing ecosystem services, fulfilling ethical responsibilities, and improving human well-being. To attain all these goals, challenges must be faced that are common to the urban environment, such as localized pollution, disruption of ecosystem structure, and limited availability of land. There are, however, also challenges specific only to particular goals, meaning that different goals will require different approaches and actions. This highlights the importance of specifying the motivations behind urban biodiversity conservation. If the goals are unknown, progress cannot be assessed.

AB The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has emerged as a major model organism for biomedical research, yet little is known about its natural history. We review the literature pertaining to the geographic range, biotic and abiotic habitats, and life cycle of the zebrafish. We also report our own field study to document several aspects of zebrafish natural history across sites in northeast India. We found zebrafish particularly abundant in silt-bottomed, well-vegetated pools and rice paddies adjacent to slow moving streams at a range of elevations. We further identified co-occurring fishes likely to be zebrafish competitors and predators. Finally, we present observations that indicate substantial habitat degradation and loss, and suggest guidelines for documenting and preserving natural zebrafish populations.

AB Assessments of temporal variation in diets are important for our understanding of the ecology of many vertebrates. Ratios of naturally occurring stable isotopes in animal tissues are a combination of the source elements and tissue specific fractionation processes, and can thus reveal dietary information. We review three different approaches that have been used to resolve temporal diet variation through analysis of stable isotopes. The most straightforward approach is to compare samples from the same type of tissue that has been sampled over time. This approach is suited to address either long or short-term dietary variation, depending on sample regime and which tissue that is sampled. Second, one can compare tissues with different metabolic rates. Since the elements in a given tissue have been assimilating during time spans specific to its metabolic rate, tissues with different metabolic rates will reflect dietary records over different periods. Third, comparisons of sections from tissues with progressive growth, such as hair, feathers, claws and teeth, will reveal temporal variation since these tissues will retain isotopic values in a chronological order. These latter two approaches are mainly suited to address questions regarding intermediate and short-term dietary variation. Knowledge of tissue specific metabolic rates, which determine the molecular turnover for a specific tissue, is of central importance for all these comparisons. Estimates of isotopic fractionation between source and measured target are important if specific hypotheses regarding the source elements are addressed. Estimates of isotopic fractionation, or at least of differences in fractionation between tissues, are necessary if different tissues are compared. We urge for more laboratory experiments aimed at improving our understanding of differential assimilation of dietary components, isotopic fractionation and metabolic routing. We further encourage more studies on reptiles and amphibians, and generally more studies utilizing multiple tissues with different turnover rates.

AB Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly determined by an interplay between the abiotic environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane argued that species' ranges could be set intraspecifically when gene flow from a species' populous center overwhelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldane's process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density-dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwin's ideas, we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific competition and the frequency-dependent selection that it generates, as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model includes local population growth, movements over space, natural selection, and gene now. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirkpatrick and Barton single-species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of environmental gradients or barriers to dispersal, interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However, interspecific competition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single-species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that results from this displacement does nor necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap, which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear, the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest. If productivity gradients are also introduced into the model, then patterns similar to Rapoport's rule emerge. Interacting species respond to climate change, as it affects the optimal phenotype over space, by a combination of range shifts and local evolution in mean phenotype, while solitary species respond solely by range shifts. Finally, we compare empirical estimates for intrinsic growth rates and diffusion coefficients for several species to those needed by the single-species model to produce a stable limited range. These empirical values are generally insufficient to produce limited ranges in the model suggesting a role for interspecific interactions.

AB The phylogenetic relationships of 106 European cyprinid taxa were determined based on the complete nucleotide sequence (1140 bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The molecular phylogeny was used (1) to revise the current systematics of European cyprinids, (2) to establish the phylogenetic utility of traditional morphological characters that are widely used in Cyprinidae systematics, and (3) to discuss alternative hypotheses on the biogeography of the family in Europe. The age of the major lineages within European cyprinids was tentatively estimated with a molecular clock and showed full agreement with the fossil record of the group. Moreover, the results provided unambiguous evidence for a close phylogenetic affinity of some Caucasian and Greek endemic cyprinid taxa (e.g., B. capito and B. brachycephalus and Leuciscus keadicus, Barbus graecus, and B. albanicus, respectively) to Iberian and North African, but not Central European, cyprinids. The existence of such unexpected phylogenetic relationships refutes the classical hypothesis on the biogeography of European cyprinids, which assumes a dispersal of the cyprinid fauna from central Europe to southern Europe and northern Africa during the Miocene (and, hence, predicts a close phylogenetic relationship of all Caucasian, Greek, Iberian, and North African cyprinids to central European taxa). Instead, the existence of a Mediterranean realm independent of the central European route seems plausible based on the molecular evidence. It is likely that the new biogeographical scenario proposed here might apply to other primary freshwater European animals with low dispersal abilities, including fish, amphibians, and invertebrates.

AB The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission used laser altimetry measurements to determine changes in elevations of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as sea ice thickness distribution. These measurements have provided important information on the response of the cryopshere (Earth's frozen surfaces) to changes in atmosphere and ocean condition. ICESat operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided repeat altimetry measurements not only to the cryosphere scientific community but also to the ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric scientific communities. The conclusive assessment of significant ongoing rapid changes in the Earth's ice cover, in part supported by ICESat observations, has strengthened the need for sustained, high accuracy, repeat observations similar to what was provided by the ICESat mission. Following recommendations from the National Research Council for an ICESat follow-on mission, the ICESat-2 mission is now under development for planned launch in 2018. The primary scientific aims of the ICESat-2 mission are to continue measurements of sea ice freeboard and ice sheet elevation to determine their changes at scales from outlet glaciers to the entire ice sheet, and from 105 of meters to the entire polar oceans for sea ice freeboard. ICESat carried a single beam profiling laser altimeter that produced similar to 70 m diameter footprints on the surface of the Earth at similar to 150 m along-track intervals. In contrast, ICESat-2 will operate with three pairs of beams, each pair separated by about 3 km cross-track with a pair spacing of 90 m. Each of the beams will have a nominal 17 m diameter footprint with an along -track sampling interval of 0.7 m. The differences in the ICESat-2 measurement concept are a result of overcoming some limitations associated with the approach used in the ICESat mission. The beam pair configuration of ICESat-2 allows for the determination of local cross -track slope, a significant factor in measuring elevation change for the outlet glaciers surrounding the Greenland and Antarctica coasts. The multiple beam pairs also provide improved spatial coverage. The dense spatial sampling eliminates along -track measurement gaps, and the small footprint diameter is especially useful for sea surface height measurements in the often narrow leads needed for sea ice freeboard and ice thickness retrievals. The ICESat-2 instrumentation concept uses a low energy 532 nm (green) laser in conjunction with single-photon sensitive detectors to measure range. Combining ICESat-2 data with altimetry data collected since the start of the ICESat mission in 2003, such as Operation IceBridge and ESA's CryoSat-2, will yield a 15+ year record of changes in ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness. ICESat-2 will also provide information of mountain glacier and ice cap elevations changes, land and vegetation heights, inland water elevations, sea surface heights, and cloud layering and optical thickness.

AB Bacteria-phage coevolution, the reciprocal evolution between bacterial hosts and the phages that infect them, is an important driver of ecological and evolutionary processes in microbial communities. There is growing evidence from both laboratory and natural populations that coevolution can maintain phenotypic and genetic diversity, increase the rate of bacterial and phage evolution and divergence, affect community structure, and shape the evolution of ecologically relevant bacterial traits. Although the study of bacteria-phage coevolution is still in its infancy, with open questions regarding the specificity of the interaction, the gene networks of coevolving partners, and the relative importance of the coevolving interaction in complex communities and environments, there have recently been major advancements in the field. In this review, we sum up our current understanding of bacteria-phage coevolution both in the laboratory and in nature, discuss recent findings on both the coevolutionary process itself and the impact of coevolution on bacterial phenotype, diversity and interactions with other species (particularly their eukaryotic hosts), and outline future directions for the field.

AB The rate of biodiversity loss is not slowing despite global commitments, and the depletion of animal species can reduce the stability of ecological communities. Despite this continued loss, some substantial progress in reversing defaunation is being achieved through the intentional movement of animals to restore populations. We review the full spectrum of conservation translocations, from reinforcement and reintroduction to controversial conservation introductions that seek to restore populations outside their indigenous range or to introduce ecological replacements for extinct forms. We place the popular, but misunderstood, concept of rewilding within this framework and consider the future role of new technical developments such as de-extinction.

AB Assessing whether the climatic niche of a species may change between different geographic areas or time periods has become increasingly important in the context of ongoing global change. However, approaches and findings have remained largely controversial so far, calling for a unification of methods. Here, we build on a review of empirical studies of invasion to formalize a unifying framework that decomposes niche change into unfilling, stability, and expansion situations, taking both a pooled range and range-specific perspective on the niche, while accounting for climatic availability and climatic analogy. This framework provides new insights into the nature of climate niche shifts and our ability to anticipate invasions, and may help in guiding the design of experiments for assessing causes of niche changes.

AB Aim
   Climate change poses significant threats to biodiversity, including impacts on species distributions, abundance and ecological interactions. At a landscape scale, these impacts, and biotic responses such as adaptation and migration, will be mediated by spatial heterogeneity in climate and climate change. We examine several aspects of the geography of climate change and their significance for biodiversity conservation.
   Location
   California and Nevada, USA.
   Methods
   Using current climate surfaces (PRISM) and two scenarios of future climate (A1b, 2070-2099, warmer-drier and warmer-wetter), we mapped disappearing, declining, expanding and novel climates, and the velocity and direction of climate change in California and Nevada. We also examined fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in protected areas of the San Francisco Bay Area in relation to reserve size, topographic complexity and distance from the ocean.
   Results
   Under the two climate change scenarios, current climates across most of California and Nevada will shrink greatly in extent, and the climates of the highest peaks will disappear from this region. Expanding and novel climates are projected for the Central Valley. Current temperature isoclines are projected to move up to 4.9 km year-1 in flatter regions, but substantially slower in mountainous areas because of steep local topoclimate gradients. In the San Francisco Bay Area, climate diversity within currently protected areas increases with reserve size and proximity to the ocean (the latter because of strong coastal climate gradients). However, by 2100 of almost 500 protected areas (> 100 ha), only eight of the largest are projected to experience temperatures within their currently observed range. Topoclimate variability will further increase the range of conditions experienced and needs to be incorporated in future analyses.
   Main Conclusions
   Spatial heterogeneity in climate, from mesoclimate to topoclimate scales, represents an important spatial buffer in response to climate change, and merits increased attention in conservation planning.

AB The desire to infer the evolutionary history of a group of species should be more viable now that a considerable amount of multilocus molecular data is available. However, the current molecular phylogenetic paradigm still reconstructs gene trees to represent the species tree. Further, commonly used methods of combining data, such as the concatenation method, are known to be inconsistent in some circumstances. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the phylogeny of a group of species using multiple estimated gene tree distributions, such as those that arise in a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data. Our model employs substitution models used in traditional phylogenetics but also uses coalescent theory to explain genealogical signals from species trees to gene trees and from gene trees to sequence data, thereby forming a complete stochastic model to estimate gene trees, species trees, ancestral population sizes, and species divergence times simultaneously. Our model is founded on the assumption that gene trees, even of unlinked loci, are correlated due to being derived from a single species tree and therefore should be estimated jointly. We apply the method to two multilocus data sets of DNA sequences. The estimates of the species tree topology and divergence times appear to be robust to the prior of the population size, whereas the estimates of effective population sizes are sensitive to the prior used in the analysis. These analyses also suggest that the model is superior to the concatenation method in fitting these data sets and thus provides a more realistic assessment of the variability in the distribution of the species tree that may have produced the molecular information at hand. Future improvements of our model and algorithm should include consideration of other factors that can cause discordance of gene trees and species trees, such as horizontal transfer or gene duplication.

AB The rapid expansion of road networks has reduced connectivity among populations of flora and fauna. The resulting isolation is assumed to increase population extinction rates, in part because of the loss of genetic diversity. However, there are few cases where loss of genetic diversity has been linked directly to roads or other barriers. We analysed the effects of such barriers on connectivity and genetic diversity of 27 populations of Ovis canadensis nelsoni (desert bighorn sheep). We used partial Mantel tests, multiple linear regression and coalescent simulations to infer changes in gene flow and diversity of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers. Our findings link a rapid reduction in genetic diversity (up to 15%) to as few as 40 years of anthropogenic isolation. Interstate highways, canals and developed areas, where present, have apparently eliminated gene flow. These results suggest that anthropogenic barriers constitute a severe threat to the persistence of naturally fragmented populations.

AB Trophic cascades have been documented in a diversity of ecological systems and can be important in determining biomass distribution within a community. To date, the literature on trophic cascades has focused on whether and in which systems cascades occur. Many biological (e.g., productivity : biomass ratios) and methodological (e.g., experiment size or duration) factors vary with the ecosystem in which data were collected, but ecosystem type, per se, does not provide mechanistic insights into factors controlling cascade strength. Here, we tested various hypotheses about why trophic cascades occur and what determines their magnitude using data from 114 studies that measured the indirect trophic effects of predators on plant community biomass in seven aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Using meta-analysis, we examined the relationship between the indirect effect of predator manipulation on plants and 18 biological and methodological factors quantified from these studies. We found, in contrast to predictions, that high system productivity and low species diversity do not consistently generate larger trophic cascades. A combination of herbivore and predator metabolic factors and predator taxonomy (vertebrate vs. invertebrate) explained 31% of the variation in cascade strength among all 114 studies. Within systems, 18% of the variation in cascade strength was explained with similar predator and herbivore characteristics. Within and across all systems, the strongest cascades occurred in association with invertebrate herbivores and endothermic vertebrate predators. These associations may result from a combination of true biological differences among species with different physiological requirements and bias among organisms studied in different systems. Thus, although cascade strength can be described by biological characteristics of predators and herbivores, future research on indirect trophic effects must further examine biological and methodological differences among studies and systems.

AB Cyanobacteria are a prolific source of secondary metabolites, including compounds with toxic and enzyme-inhibiting activities. Microcystins and nodularins are the end products of a secondary metabolic pathway comprised of mixed polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Both peptides are potent natural toxins produced by distantly related genera of cyanobacteria. Horizontal gene transfer is thought to play a role in the sporadic distribution of microcystin producers among cyanobacteria. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate a coevolution of housekeeping genes and microcystin synthetase genes for the entire evolutionary history of the toxin. Hence they do not corroborate horizontal transfer of genes for microcystin biosynthesis between the genera. The sporadic distribution of microcystin synthetase genes in modern cyanobacteria suggests that the ability to produce the toxin has been lost repeatedly in the more derived lineages of cyanobacteria. The data we present here strongly suggest that the genes encoding nodularin synthetase are recently derived from those encoding microcystin synthetase.

AB The current rate of biodiversity loss threatens to disrupt greatly the functioning of ecosystems, with potentially significant consequences for humanity. The magnitude of the loss is generally measured with the use of species extinction rates, an approach that understates the severity of the problem and masks some of its most important consequences. Here, we propose a major expansion of this focus to include population diversity: considering changes in the size, number, distribution and genetic composition of populations and the implications of those changes for the functioning of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services. We also outline the key components of population diversity and describe a new approach to delineating a population unit that explicitly links it to the services that it provides.

AB Coral reefs are degrading worldwide at an alarming rate. Nutrient over-enrichment is considered a major cause of this decline because degraded coral reefs generally exhibit a shift from high coral cover (low algal cover) to low coral cover with an accompanying high cover and biomass of fleshy algae. Support for such claims is equivocal at best. Critical examination of both experimental laboratory and field studies of nutrient effects on corals and coral reefs, including the Elevated Nutrient on Coral Reefs Experiment (ENCORE) enrichment experiment conducted on the Great Barrier Reef, does not support the idea that the levels of nutrient enrichment documented at anthropogenically-enriched sites can affect the physiology of corals in a harmful way, or for most cases, be the sole or major cause of shifts in coral-algal abundance. Factors other than nutrient enrichment can be significant causes of coral death and affect algal cover, and include decreased abundance of grazing fishes by fishing, and of grazing sea urchins to disease; grazing preferences of remaining grazers; temperature stress that kills coral (i.e., coral bleaching) and creates more open substrate for algal colonization; sedimentation stress that can weaken adult corals and prevent coral recruitment; coral diseases that may be secondary to coral bleaching; and outbreaks of coral predators and sea urchins that may be secondary effects of overfishing. Any factor that leads to coral death or reduces levels of herbivory will leave more substrate open for algal colonization or make the effects of even low-level enrichment more severe. Factors that contribute to an imbalance between production and consumption will result in community structure changes similar to those expected from over-enrichment. Over-enrichment can be and has been the cause of localized coral reef degradation, but the case for widespread effects is not substantiated.

ID BOTTOM-UP; PRODUCTIVITY; DISTURBANCE; COMPETITION; CONSEQUENCES;
   PREDATION; RICHNESS
AB A key question in ecology is which factors control species diversity in a community(1-3). Two largely separate groups of ecologists have emphasized the importance of productivity or resource supply, and consumers or physical disturbance, respectively. These variables show unimodal relationships with diversity when manipulated in isolation(4-8). Recent multivariate models(9-10), however, predict that these factors interact, such that the disturbance-diversity relationship depends on productivity, and vice versa. We tested these models in marine food webs, using field manipulations of nutrient resources and consumer pressure on rocky shores of contrasting productivity. Here we show that the effects of consumers and nutrients on diversity consistently depend on each other, and that the direction of their effects and peak diversity shift between sites of low and high productivity. Factorial meta-analysis of published experiments confirms these results across widely varying aquatic communities. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that these patterns extend to important ecosystem functions such as carbon storage and nitrogen retention. This suggests that human impacts on nutrient supply(11) and food-web structure(12,13) have strong and interdependent effects on species diversity and ecosystem functioning, and must therefore be managed together.

AB The rice genus, Oryza, which comprises 23 species and 9 recognized genome types, represents an enormous gene pool for genetic improvement of rice cultivars. Clarification of phylogenetic relationships of rice genomes is critical for effective utilization of the wild rice germ plasm. By generating and comparing two nuclear gene (Adh1 and Adh2) trees and a chloroplast gene (matK) tree of all rice species, phylogenetic relationships among the rice genomes were inferred. Origins of the allotetraploid species, which constitute more than one-third of rice species diversity, were reconstructed based on the Adh gene phylogenies. Genome types of the maternal parents of allotetraploid species were determined based on the matK gene tree. The phylogenetic reconstruction largely supports the previous recognition of rife genomes. It further revealed that the EE genome species is most closely related to the DD genome progenitor that gave rise to the CCDD genome. Three species of the CCDD genome may have originated through a single hybridization event, and their maternal parent had the CC genome. The BBCC genome species had different origins, and their maternal parents had either a BE or CC genome. An additional genome type, HHKK, was recognized for Oryza schlechteri and Porteresia coarctata, suggesting that P, coarctata is an Oryza species. The AA genome lineage, which contains cultivated rice, is a recently diverged and rapidly radiated lineage within the rice genus.

AB We investigated the relationship between plant nitrogen limitation and water availability in dryland ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that at lower levels of annual precipitation, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is limited primarily by water whereas at higher levels of precipitation, it is limited primarily by nitrogen. Using a literature survey of fertilization experiments in arid, semi-arid, and subhumid ecosystems, we investigated the response of ANPP to nitrogen addition as a function of variation in precipitation across geographic gradients, as well as across year-to-year variation in precipitation within sites. We used four different indices to assess the degree of N limitation: (1) Absolute Increase of plant production in response to fertilization (the slope of ANPP vs. amount of added N at different levels of annual precipitation); (2) Relative Response (the percent increase in fertilized over control ANPP at different levels of N addition); (3) Fertilizer Use Efficiency (FUE, the absolute gain in productivity per amount of fertilizer N), and (4) Maximum Response (the greatest absolute increase in ANPP at saturating levels of N addition). Relative Response to fertilization did not significantly increase with increasing precipitation either across the geographic gradient or across year-to-year variation within sites. Nor did the Maximum Response to fertilization increase with increasing precipitation across the geographic gradient. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the Absolute Increase and FUE indices with both geographical and temporal variation in precipitation. Together, these results indicate that there is not necessarily a shift of primary limitation from water to N across the geographic water availability gradient. Instead, our results support the hypothesis of co-limitation. The apparently contradictory results from the four indices of N limitation can best be explained by an integration of plant ecophysiological, community, and ecosystem mechanisms whereby plants are co-limited by multiple resources, species shifts occur in response to changing resource levels, and nitrogen and water availability are tightly linked through biogeochemical feedbacks.

SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION BIOLOGY; HOST; SELECTION; DISEASES; MODEL
AB While for pathogen clones singly occupying a host it may pay to adopt a relatively avirulent host exploitation strategy, clones sharing a host have a conflict of interest that favors more virulent strategies. As the number of infections per host depends on the force of infection and the force of infection, in turn, depends on prevailing virulence, evolutionary analysis needs to be integrated with population dynamics. A full-fledged approach requires exceedingly large capacities for bookkeeping of the infection events and is therefore difficult to establish. In this article the host-pathogen interaction is studied for the simple case in which hosts may become at most doubly infected. It appears that evolution and population dynamics give rise to a feedback mechanism. When double infections are frequent, increased virulence is favored; but when pathogens become more virulent, the force of infection will decrease, favoring lower virulence again. Thus, evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) virulence depends on the interaction within hosts as well as on the interaction at the population level. As current models of host-microparasite interactions take only first infections into account, they may be inappropriate for evolutionary analyses, which would require modeling of within-host competition between strains and thus of multiple infections.

The variation in mass-loss rate was analyzed using 39 experimental sites spanning climatic regions from the subarctic to subtropical and Mediterranean: the latitudinal gradient ranged from 31-degrees-N to 70-degrees-N and may represent the the largest geographical area that has ever been sampled and observed for the purpose of studying biogeochemical processes. Because of unified site design and uniform laboratory procedures, data from all sites were directly comparable and permitted a determination of the relative influence of climate versus substrate quality viewed from the perspective of broad regional scales.
   Simple correlation applied to the entire data set indicated that annual actual evapotranspiration (AET) should be the leading climatic constraint on mass-loss rates (R(adj)2 = 0.496). The combination of AET, average July temp. and average annual temp. could explain about 70% of the sites' variability on litter mass-loss. In an analysis of 23 Scots pine sites north of the Alps and Carpatians AET alone could account for about 65% of the variation and the addition of a substrate-quality variable was sufficiently significant to be used in a model.
   The influence of litter quality was introduced into a model, using data from 11 sites at which litter of different quality had been incubated. These sites are found in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland. At any one site most (> 90%) of the variation in mass-loss rates could be explained by one of the litter-quality variables giving concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus or water solubles. However, even when these models included nitrogen or phosphorus even small changes in potential evapotranspiration resulted in large changes in early-phase decay rates.
   Further regional subdivision of the data set, resulted in a range of strength in the relationship between loss rate and climatic variables, from very weak in Central Europe to strong for the Scandinavian and Atlantic coast sites (R(adj)2 = 0.912; AET versus litter mass loss). Much of the variation in observed loss rates could be related to continental versus marine/Atlantic influences. Inland locations had mass-loss rates lower than should be expected on the basis of for example AET alone. Attempts to include seasonality variables were not successful. It is clear that either unknown errors and biases, or, unknown variables are causing these regional differences in response to climatic variables. Nevertheless these results show the powerful influence of climate as a control of the broad-scale geography of mass-loss rates and substrate quality at the stand level.
   Some of these relationships between mass-loss rate and climatic variables are among the highest ever reported, probably because of the care taken to select uniform sites and experimental methods. This suggest that superior, base line maps of predicted mass-loss rates could be produced using climatic data. These models should be useful to predict the changing equilibrium litter dynamics resulting from climatic change.

AB In New England salt marshes the boundary between frequently flooded low marsh habitats and less frequently flooded high marsh habitats is characterized by striking plant zonation. Spartina alterniflora monocultures dominate low marsh habitats while the seaward border of high marsh habitats is generally dominated by Spartina patens. In this paper I examine the role of interspecific competition in maintaining this zonation pattern.
   Spartina patens turfs and tillers transplanted into the low marsh were severely stunted with or without S. alterniflora neighbors, and low marsh bare patches bordering S. patens monocultures were not significantly colonized by S. patens in three growing seasons. The limited ability of S. patens to oxygenate its rhizosphere in anoxic soils appears to limit S. patens to high marsh habitats.
   In contrast, S. alterniflora transplants grew vigorously in the high and low marsh when buffered from neighbors, but were excluded from the high marsh in 2-3 yr when S. patens was present. S. alterniflora also rapidly invaded the high marsh in the absence of S. patens. These results support the hypothesis that S. alterniflora is restricted to low marsh habitats by competitive displacement. S. alterniflora thrives in anoxic low marsh habitats due to its ability to oxygenate its roots and rhizosphere. Rhizosphere oxidation by S. alterniflora, however, is not evident in seedlings and small colonizing patches and both seedlings and small colonizing patches of S. alterniflora are stunted in anoxic low marsh substrates. This suggests that the success of S. alterniflora in anoxic habitats is size dependent and may be driven by group benefits of rhizosphere oxidation.
   These results suggest that the maintenance of intertidal zonation in rocky beach and marsh plant communities is very similar. In both assemblages, competitive dominants monopolize physically benign habitats and displace competitive subordinates to physically stressful habitats.

AB Botanists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists are familiar with the astonishing species richness and endemism of the fynbos of the Cape Floristic Region and the ancient and unique flora of the kwongkan of south-western Australia. These regions represent old climatically-buffered infertile landscapes (OCBILs) that are the basis of a general hypothesis to explain their richness and endemism. However, few ecologists are familiar with the campo rupestre of central and eastern Brazil, an extremely old mountaintop ecosystem that is both a museum of ancient lineages and a cradle of continuing diversification of endemic lineages.
   Diversification of some lineages of campo rupestre pre-dates diversification of lowland cerrado, suggesting it may be the most ancient open vegetation in eastern South America. This vegetation comprises more than 5000 plant species, nearly 15 % of Brazil's plant diversity, in an area corresponding to 0.78 % of its surface. Reviewing empirical data, we scrutinise five predictions of the OCBIL theory, and show that campo rupestre is fully comparable to and remarkably convergent with both fynbos and kwongkan, and fulfills the criteria for a classic OCBIL.
   The increasing threats to campo rupestre are compromising ecosystem services and we argue for the implementation of more effective conservation and restoration strategies.

AB Behavioral economic studies involving limited numbers of choices have provided key insights into neural decision-making mechanisms. By contrast, animals' foraging choices arise in the context of sequences of encounters with prey or food. On each encounter, the animal chooses whether to engage or, if the environment is sufficiently rich, to search elsewhere. The cost of foraging is also critical. We demonstrate that humans can alternate between two modes of choice, comparative decision-making and foraging, depending on distinct neural mechanisms in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using distinct reference frames; in ACC, choice variables are represented in invariant reference to foraging or searching for alternatives. Whereas vmPFC encodes values of specific well-defined options, ACC encodes the average value of the foraging environment and cost of foraging.

AB Climate change in the coming centuries will be characterized by interannual, decadal, and multidecadal fluctuations superimposed on anthropogenic trends. Predicting ecological and biogeographic responses to these changes constitutes an immense challenge for ecologists. Perspectives from climatic and ecological history indicate that responses will be laden with contingencies, resulting from episodic climatic events interacting with demographic and colonization events. This effect is compounded by the dependency of environmental sensitivity upon life-stage for many species. Climate variables often used in empirical niche models may become decoupled from the proximal variables that directly influence individuals and populations. Greater predictive capacity, and more-fundamental ecological and biogeographic understanding, will come from integration of correlational niche modeling with mechanistic niche modeling, dynamic ecological modeling, targeted experiments, and systematic observations of past and present patterns and dynamics.

AB Landscape ecology is in a position to become the scientific basis for sustainable landscape development. When spatial planning policy is decentralised, local actors need to collaborate to decide on the changes that have to be made in the landscape to better accommodate their perceptions of value. This paper addresses two prerequisites that landscape ecological science has to meet for it to be effective in producing appropriate knowledge for such bottom-up landscape-development processes-it must include a valuation component, and it must be suitable for use in collaborative decision-making on a local scale. We argue that landscape ecological research needs to focus more on these issues and propose the concept of landscape services as a unifying common ground where scientists from various disciplines are encouraged to cooperate in producing a common knowledge base that can be integrated into multifunctional, actor-led landscape development. We elaborate this concept into a knowledge framework, the structure-function-value chain, and expand the current pattern-process paradigm in landscape ecology with value in this way. Subsequently, we analyse how the framework could be applied and facilitate interdisciplinary research that is applicable in transdisciplinary landscape-development processes.

AB Extinction risk in natural populations depends on stochastic factors that affect individuals, and is estimated by incorporating such factors into stochastic models(1-9). Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals ( demographic stochasticity(2)), variation in population- level birth and death rates among times or locations ( environmental stochasticity(1,3)), the sex of individuals(6,8) and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population ( demographic heterogeneity(7,9)). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum ( red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.

AB To estimate how tree photosynthesis modulates soil respiration, we simultaneously and continuously measured soil respiration and canopy photosynthesis over an oak-grass savanna during the summer, when the annual grass between trees was dead. Soil respiration measured under a tree crown reflected the sum of rhizosphere respiration and heterotrophic respiration; soil respiration measured in an open area represented heterotrophic respiration. Soil respiration was measured using solid-state CO2 sensors buried in soils and the flux-gradient method. Canopy photosynthesis was obtained from overstory and understory flux measurements using the eddy covariance method. We found that the diurnal pattern of soil respiration in the open was driven by soil temperature, while soil respiration under the tree was decoupled with soil temperature. Although soil moisture controlled the seasonal pattern of soil respiration, it did not influence the diurnal pattern of soil respiration. Soil respiration under the tree controlled by the root component was strongly correlated with tree photosynthesis, but with a time lag of 7-12 h. These results indicate that photosynthesis drives soil respiration in addition to soil temperature and moisture.

AB A multitude of endocrine mechanisms are involved in coping with challenges. Front-line hormones to overcome stressful situations are glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines (CAs). These hormones are usually determined in plasma samples as parameters of adrenal activity and thus of disturbance. GCs (and CAs) are extensively metabolized and excreted afterwards. Therefore, the concentration of GCs (or their metabolites) can be measured in various body fluids or excreta. Above all, fecal samples offer the advantages of easy collection and a feedback-free sampling procedure. However, large differences exist among species regarding the route and time course of excretion, as well as the types of metabolites formed. Based on information gained from radiometabolism studies (reviewed in this paper), we recently developed and successfully validated different enzyme immunoassays that enable the noninvasive measurement of groups of cortisol or corticosterone metabolites in animal feces. The determination of these metabolites in fecal samples can be used as a powerful tool to monitor GC production in various species of domestic, wildlife, and laboratory animals.

AB 1 We mapped and identified all trees greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter in 25 ha of lowland wet forest in Amazonian Ecuador, and found 1104 morphospecies among 152 353 individuals. The largest number of species was mid-sized canopy trees with maximum height 10-20 m and understorey treelets with maximum height of 5-10 m.
   2 Several species of understorey treelets in the genera Matisia and Rinorea dominated the forest numerically, while important canopy species were Iriartea deltoidea and Eschweilera coriacea.
   3 We examined how species partition local topographic variation into niches, and how much this partitioning contributes to forest diversity. Evidence in favour of topographic niche-partitioning was found: similarity in species composition between ridge and valley quadrats was lower than similarity between two valley (or two ridge) quadrats, and 25% of the species had large abundance differences between valley and ridge-top. On the other hand, 25% of the species were generalists, with similar abundance on both valley and ridges, and half the species had only moderate abundance differences between valley and ridge.
   4 Topographic niche-partitioning was not finely grained. There were no more than three distinct vegetation zones: valley, mid-slope, and upper-ridge, and the latter two differed only slightly in species composition.
   5 Similarity in species composition declined with distance even within a topographic habitat, to about the same degree as it declined between habitats. This suggests patchiness not related to topographic variation, and possibly due to dispersal limitation.
   6 We conclude that partitioning of topographic niches does make a contribution to the alpha-diversity of Amazonian trees, but only a minor one. It provides no explanation for the co-occurrence of hundreds of topographic generalists, nor for the hundreds of species with similar life-form appearing on a single ridge-top.

AB Recently, much attention has been focused on insecticides as a group of chemicals combining high toxicity to invertebrates and fishes with low application rates, which complicates detection in the field. Assessment of these chemicals is greatly facilitated by the description and understanding of exposure, resulting biological effects, and risk mitigation strategies in natural surface waters under field conditions due to normal farming practice. More than 60 reports of insecticide-compound detection in surface waters due to agricultural nonpoint-source pollution have been published in the open literature during the past 20 years, about one-third of them having been undertaken in the past 3.5 years. Recent reports tend to concentrate on specific routes of pesticide entry, such as runoff, but there are very few studies on spray drift-borne contamination. Reported aqueous-phase insecticide concentrations are negatively correlated with the catchment size and all concentrations of >10 mug/L (19 out of 133) were found in smaller-scale catchments (<100 km(2)). Field studies on effects of insecticide contamination often lack appropriate exposure characterization. About 15 of the 42 effect studies reviewed here revealed a clear relationship between quantified, non-experimental exposure and observed effects in situ, on abundance, drift, community structure, or dynamics. Azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos, and endosulfan were frequently detected at levels above those reported to reveal effects in the field; however, knowledge about effects of insecticides in the field is still sparse. Following a short overview of various risk mitigation or best management practices, constructed wetlands and vegetated ditches are described as a risk mitigation strategy that have only recently been established for agricultural insecticides. Although only 11 studies are available, the results in terms of pesticide retention and toxicity reduction are very promising. Based on the reviewed literature, recommendations are made for future research activities.

AB Current natural resource management seldom takes the ecosystem functions performed by organisms that move between systems into consideration. Organisms that actively move in the landscape and connect habitats in space and time are here termed mobile links." They are essential components in the dynamics of ecosystem development and ecosystem resilience (that is, buffer capacity and opportunity for reorganization) that provide ecological memory (that is, sources for reorganization after disturbance). We investigated the effects of such mobile links on ecosystem functions in aquatic as well as terrestrial environments. We identify three main functional categories: resource, genetic, and process linkers and suggest that the diversity within functional groups of mobile links is a central component of ecosystem resilience. As the planet becomes increasingly dominated by humans, the magnitude, frequency, timing, spatial extent, rate, and quality of such organism-mediated linkages are being altered. We argue that global environmental change can lead to (a) the decline of essential links in functional groups providing pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control; (b) the linking of previously disconnected areas, for example, the spread of vector-borne diseases and invasive species; and (c) the potential for existing links to become carriers of toxic substances, such as persistent organic compounds. We conclude that knowledge of interspatial exchange via mobile links needs to be incorporated into management and policy-making decisions in order to maintain ecosystem resilience and hence secure the capacity of ecosystems to supply the goods and services essential to society.

AB The spatial distribution of genetic markers can be useful both in estimating patterns of gene flow and in reconstructing biogeographic history, particularly when gene genealogies can be estimated. Genealogies based on nonrecombining genetic units such as mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA often consist of geographically separated clades that come into contact in narrow regions. Such phylogeographic breaks are usually assumed to be the result of long-term barriers to gene flow. Here I show that deep phylogeographic breaks can form within a continuously distributed species even when there are no barriers to gene flow. The likelihood of observing phylogeographic breaks increases as the average individual dispersal distance and population size decrease. Those molecular markers that are most likely to show evidence of real geographic barriers are also most likely to show phylogeographic breaks that formed without any barrier to gene flow. These results might provide an explanation as to why some species, such as the greenish warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides), have phylogeographic breaks in mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA that do not coincide with sudden changes in other traits.

AB The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere is rising rapidly(1), with the potential to alter many ecosystem processes. Elevated CO2 often stimulates photosynthesis(2), creating the possibility that the terrestrial biosphere will sequester carbon in response to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, partly offsetting emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, cement manufacture, and deforestation(3,4). However, the responses of intact ecosystems to elevated CO2 concentration, particularly the below-ground responses, are not well understood. Here we present an annual budget focusing on below-ground carbon cycling for two grassland ecosystems exposed to elevated CO2 concentrations. Three years of experimental CO2 doubling increased ecosystem carbon uptake, but greatly increased carbon partitioning to rapidly cycling carbon pools below ground, This provides an explanation for the imbalance observed in numerous CO2 experiments, where the carbon increment from increased photosynthesis is greater than the increments in ecosystem carbon stocks. The shift in ecosystem carbon partitioning suggests that elevated CO2 concentration causes a greater increase in carbon cycling than in carbon storage in grasslands.

AB Phylogenetic signal is the tendency for closely related species to display similar trait values due to their common ancestry. Several methods have been developed for quantifying phylogenetic signal in univariate traits and for sets of traits treated simultaneously, and the statistical properties of these approaches have been extensively studied. However, methods for assessing phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional multivariate traits like shape are less well developed, and their statistical performance is not well characterized. In this article, I describe a generalization of the K statistic of Blomberg et al. that is useful for quantifying and evaluating phylogenetic signal in highly dimensional multivariate data. The method (K-mult) is found from the equivalency between statistical methods based on covariance matrices and those based on distance matrices. Using computer simulations based on Brownian motion, I demonstrate that the expected value of K-mult remains at 1.0 as trait variation among species is increased or decreased, and as the number of trait dimensions is increased. By contrast, estimates of phylogenetic signal found with a squared-change parsimony procedure for multivariate data change with increasing trait variation among species and with increasing numbers of trait dimensions, confounding biological interpretations. I also evaluate the statistical performance of hypothesis testing procedures based on K-mult and find that the method displays appropriate Type I error and high statistical power for detecting phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional data. Statistical properties of K-mult were consistent for simulations using bifurcating and random phylogenies, for simulations using different numbers of species, for simulations that varied the number of trait dimensions, and for different underlying models of trait covariance structure. Overall these findings demonstrate that K-mult provides a useful means of evaluating phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional multivariate traits. Finally, I illustrate the utility of the new approach by evaluating the strength of phylogenetic signal for head shape in a lineage of Plethodon salamanders.

AB Humans have altered the Earth's land surface since the Paleolithic mainly by clearing woody vegetation first to improve hunting and gathering opportunities, and later to provide agricultural cropland. In the Holocene, agriculture was established on nearly all continents and led to widespread modification of terrestrial ecosystems. To quantify the role that humans played in the global carbon cycle over the Holocene, we developed a new, annually resolved inventory of anthropogenic land cover change from 8000 years ago to the beginning of large-scale industrialization (ad 1850). This inventory is based on a simple relationship between population and land use observed in several European countries over preindustrial time. Using this data set, and an alternative scenario based on the HYDE 3.1 land use data base, we forced the LPJ dynamic global vegetation model in a series of continuous simulations to evaluate the impacts of humans on terrestrial carbon storage during the preindustrial Holocene. Our model setup allowed us to quantify the importance of land degradation caused by repeated episodes of land use followed by abandonment. By 3 ka BP, cumulative carbon emissions caused by anthropogenic land cover change in our new scenario ranged between 84 and 102 Pg, translating to c. 7 ppm of atmospheric CO2. By ad 1850, emissions were 325-357 Pg in the new scenario, in contrast to 137-189 Pg when driven by HYDE. Regional events that resulted in local emissions or uptake of carbon were often balanced by contrasting patterns in other parts of the world. While we cannot close the carbon budget in the current study, simulated cumulative anthropogenic emissions over the preindustrial Holocene are consistent with the ice core record of atmospheric delta 13CO2 and support the hypothesis that anthropogenic activities led to the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at a level that made the world substantially warmer than it otherwise would be.

AB P>1. Several theories have provided a framework for understanding variation in plant defence against herbivores. Among them, the plant apparency theory and the resource availability hypothesis (RAH) have aimed to explain the patterns of defence investment and the selective pressures that have led to the variety of defensive strategies across species. Here we provide a historical review of both theories, present evidence that shaped their development and contrast their predictions.
   2. We present the results of a meta-analysis of the utility of the RAH 25 years after it was proposed and compare it to apparency theory. We performed a meta-analysis of 50 studies that have examined plant growth, defences and herbivory in relation to resource availability across latitude and ontogeny. Specifically, we tested four predictions that follow the RAH: (i) species adapted to resource-rich environments have intrinsically faster growth rates than species adapted to resource-poor environments; (ii) fast-growing species have shorter leaf lifetimes than slow-growing species; (iii) fast-growing species have lower amounts of constitutive defences than slow-growing species; and (iv) fast-growing species support higher herbivory rates than slow-growing species.
   3. Our results confirm the predictions that species adapted to resource-poor environments grow inherently more slowly, invest more in constitutive defences and support lower herbivory than species from more productive habitats. Our data also showed that variation in growth rate among species better explains the differences in herbivory than variation in apparency, suggesting that the evolution of different defensive strategies across species is resource, rather than herbivore driven. We also found that the application of this theory appears robust across latitude and ontogeny, as the magnitude of the effect sizes for most of the predictions did not vary significantly between ecosystems or across ontogenic stages.
   4. We conclude that the RAH has served as a valid framework for investigating the patterns of plant defences and that its applicability is quite general.

AB Members of the order Coleoptera are sometimes referred to as 'living jewels', in allusion to the strikingly diverse array of iridescence mechanisms and optical effects that have arisen in beetles. A number of novel and sophisticated reflectance mechanisms have been discovered in recent years, including three-dimensional photonic crystals and quasi-ordered coherent scattering arrays. However, the literature on beetle structural coloration is often redundant and lacks synthesis, with little interchange between the entomological and optical research communities. Here, an overview is provided for all iridescence mechanisms observed in Coleoptera. Types of iridescence are illustrated and classified into three mechanistic groups: multilayer reflectors, three-dimensional photonic crystals and diffraction gratings. Taxonomic and phylogenetic distributions are provided, along with discussion of the putative functions and evolutionary pathways by which iridescence has repeatedly arisen in beetles.

AB Over the past 30 years, Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses have been responsible for large hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreaks with case fatalities ranging from 53% to 90%, while a third species, Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus, caused a single non-fatal HF case. In November 2007, HF cases were reported in Bundibugyo District, Western Uganda. Laboratory investigation of the initial 29 suspect-case blood specimens by classic methods (antigen capture, IgM and IgG ELISA) and a recently developed randomprimed pyrosequencing approach quickly identified this to be an Ebola HF outbreak associated with a newly discovered ebolavirus species ( Bundibugyo ebolavirus) distantly related to the Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus found in western Africa. Due to the sequence divergence of this new virus relative to all previously recognized ebolaviruses, these findings have important implications for design of future diagnostic assays to monitor Ebola HF disease in humans and animals, and ongoing efforts to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.

AB The likelihood of speciation in the face of homogenizing gene flow (i.e. without complete geographical isolation) is one of the most debated topics in evolutionary biology. Demonstrating this phenonemon is hampered by the difficulty of isolating the effects of time since population divergence vs. gene flow on levels of molecular genetic differentiation. For example, weak genetic differentiation between taxa could be due to recent divergence, gene flow, or a combination of these factors. Nonetheless, a number of convincing examples of speciation with gene flow have recently emerged, owing in part to the development of new analytical methods designed to estimate gene flow specifically. A recent example of speciation with gene flow in salamanders (Niemiller et al. 2008) further advances our understanding of this phenonemon, by showing that gene flow between cave and spring salamanders was ongoing during speciation, rather than having occurred after a long period of allopatric divergence. Future work on the ecological and genetic factors reducing gene flow will likely increase our understanding of the conditions that faciliate divergence in the face of gene flow.

AB Comparative studies of quantitative genetic and neutral marker differentiation have provided means for assessing the relative roles of natural selection and random genetic drift in explaining among-population divergence. This information can be useful for our fundamental understanding of population differentiation, as well as for identifying management units in conservation biology. Here, we provide comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the empirical studies that have compared quantitative genetic (Q(ST)) and neutral marker (F-ST) differentiation among natural populations. Our analyses confirm the conclusion from previous reviews - based on ca. 100% more data - that the Q(ST) values are on average higher than F-ST values [mean difference 0.12 (SD 0.27)] suggesting a predominant role for natural selection as a cause of differentiation in quantitative traits. However, although the influence of trait (life history, morphological and behavioural) and marker type (e.g. microsatellites and allozymes) on the variance of the difference between Q(ST) and F-ST is small, there is much heterogeneity in the data attributable to variation between specific studies and traits. The latter is understandable as there is no reason to expect that natural selection would be acting in similar fashion on all populations and traits (except for fitness itself). We also found evidence to suggest that Q(ST) and F-ST values across studies are positively correlated, but the significance of this finding remains unclear. We discuss these results in the context of utility of the Q(ST)-F-ST comparisons as a tool for inferring natural selection, as well as associated methodological and interpretational problems involved with individual and meta-analytic studies.

AB This experiment was designed to study three determinant factors in decomposition patterns of soil organic matter (SOM): temperature, water and carbon (C) inputs. The study combined field measurements with soil lab incubations and ends with a modelling framework based on the results obtained. Soil respiration was periodically measured at an oak savanna woodland and a ponderosa pine plantation. Intact soils cores were collected at both ecosystems, including soils with most labile C burnt off, soils with some labile C gone and soils with fresh inputs of labile C. Two treatments, dry-field condition and field capacity, were applied to an incubation that lasted 111 days. Short-term temperature changes were applied to the soils periodically to quantify temperature responses. This was done to prevent confounding results associated with different pools of C that would result by exposing treatments chronically to different temperature regimes. This paper discusses the role of the above-defined environmental factors on the variability of soil C dynamics. At the seasonal scale, temperature and water were, respectively, the main limiting factors controlling soil CO2 efflux for the ponderosa pine and the oak savanna ecosystems. Spatial and seasonal variations in plant activity (root respiration and exudates production) exerted a strong influence over the seasonal and spatial variation of soil metabolic activity. Mean residence times of bulk SOM were significantly lower at the Nitrogen (N)-rich deciduous savanna than at the N-limited evergreen dominated pine ecosystem. At shorter time scales (daily), SOM decomposition was controlled primarily by temperature during wet periods and by the combined effect of water and temperature during dry periods. Secondary control was provided by the presence/absence of plant derived C inputs (exudation). Further analyses of SOM decomposition suggest that factors such as changes in the decomposer community, stress-induced changes in the metabolic activity of decomposers or SOM stabilization patterns remain unresolved, but should also be considered in future SOM decomposition studies. Observations and confounding factors associated with SOM decomposition patterns and its temperature sensitivity are summarized in the modeling framework.

AB Species extinctions and the deterioration of other biodiversity features worldwide have led to the adoption of systematic conservation planning in many regions of the world. As a consequence, various software tools for conservation planning have been developed over the past twenty years. These, tools implement algorithms designed to identify conservation area networks for the representation and persistence of biodiversity features. Budgetary, ethical, and other sociopolitical constraints dictate that the prioritized sites represent biodiversity with minimum impact on human interests. Planning tools are typically also used to satisfy these criteria. This chapter reviews both the concepts and technical choices that underlie the development of these tools. Conservation planning problems can be formulated as optimization problems, and we evaluate the suitability of different algorithms for their solution. Finally, we also review some key issues associated with the use of these tools, such as computational efficiency, the effectiveness of taxa and abiotic parameters at choosing surrogates for biodiversity, the process of setting explicit targets of representation for biodiversity surrogates, and

AB The latitudinal diversity gradient is the largest scale, and longest known, pattern in ecology. We examined the applicability of three versions of the energy hypothesis, the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis, and historical contingency to the gradient of terrestrial birds. The productivity version of the energy hypothesis, tested using actual evapotranspiration, a water-energy variable closely associated with plant productivity, accounted for 72% of the variance in a model of global extent. An historical contingency model based on biogeographic region explained 58% of the variance. A combined climate-region model accounted for 78% of the variance, but 52% comprised the overlap between these effects. This suggests that further resolution of contemporary vs. historical processes at the global level will require the inclusion of phylogenetic information.
   Regional-extent regression models suggest a latitudinal shift in constraints on diversity; measures of ambient energy (potential evapotranspiration and mean annual temperature) best predicted the diversity gradient at high latitudes, whereas water-related variables (actual evapotranspiration and annual rainfall) best predicted richness in low-latitude, high-energy regions. Intraregional spatial autocorrelation analysis confirmed that climatic models adequately describe geographic richness patterns at all but the smallest spatial scales resolved by the analysis. We conclude that the "water-energy dynamics" hypothesis, originally developed for plant diversity gradients, offers a parsimonious explanation for bird diversity patterns as well, presumably operating via plant productivity. However, more refined tests of historical factors are needed to fully resolve their influences on the gradient.

AB Fertilization experiments in plant communities are often interpreted in the context of a hump-shaped relationship between species richness and productivity. We analyze results of fertilization experiments from seven terrestrial plant communities representing a productivity gradient (arctic and alpine tundra, two old-field habitats, desert, short- and tall-grass prairie) to determine if the response of species richness to experimentally increased productivity is consistent with the hump-shaped curve. In this analysis, we compared ratios of the mean response in nitrogen-fertilized plots to the mean in control plots for aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and species density (D; number of species per plot of fixed unit area). In general, ANPP increased and plant species density decreased following nitrogen addition, although considerable variation characterized the magnitude of response. We also analyzed a subset of the data limited to the longest running studies at each site (greater than or equal to 4 yr), and found that adding 9 to 13 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (the consistent amount used at all sites) increased ANPP in all communities by approximately 50% over control levels and reduced species density by approximately 30%. The magnitude of response of ANPP and species density to fertilization was independent of initial community productivity. There was as much variation in the magnitude of response among communities within sites as among sites, suggesting community-specific mechanisms of response. Based on these results, we argue that even long-term fertilization experiments are not good predictors of the relationship between species richness and productivity because they are relatively small-scale perturbations whereas the pattern of species richness over natural productivity gradients is influenced by long-term ecological and evolutionary processes.

AB Although most temperate forests are actively managed for timber production, few data exist regarding the long-term effects of forest management on understory plant communities. We investigated the responses of understory communities to a factorial combination of silvicultural-thinning and nutrient-addition treatments maintained for 12-16 yr in a ret of 21-27 yr old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plantations. The four thinning levels span those used operationally (final stem densities of 494-1680 trees/ha); the two fertilization levels included a control and N addition in the form of urea at similar to 60 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1), about twice the dosage used operationally.
   Understory vegetation cover showed significant effects of thinning, with the highest thinning level resulting in the highest observed cover values. However, in some cases low levels of thinning resulted in a reduction in understory cover compared to unthinned controls. Understory vegetation declined dramatically in response to urea fertilization, with up to a 10-fold drop in herb-layer cover in unthinned stands. Species richness showed a simpler response to treatments, increasing in response to thinning, but decreasing in response to fertilization. Examination of species-area relationships indicated that effects of thinning and fertilization on species richness were similar across the range of spatial scales examined. Tree canopy cover, assessed by means of hemispherical photograph analysis, increased with fertilization, and estimated understory light levels decreased with fertilization, but neither showed a significant response to thinning at the time of measurement (12-16 yr after tree removal). Thus, treatment effects on understory cover and species richness were not a simple function of canopy cover or estimated light availability. Rather, there was a weak positive relationship between estimated understory light flux and vascular plant cover and diversity in nonfertilized plots, and no such relationship in fertilized plots. The lack of correspondence between treatment effects on canopy cover and understory vegetation may be due to time lags in understory response to changes in canopy cover or to treatment effects not mediated by light availability, such as physical disturbance during thinning operations and toxicity responses following application of urea fertilizer.
   Species-specific responses to treatments were in part predictable as a function of plant life-form and edaphic association: species affinity for high soil moisture was the best predictor of fertilization responses, while life-form was the best predictor of thinning responses, with ferns and graminoids showing the largest positive responses to thinning. The successional status and stature of understory plant species were not significantly related to treatment responses. In sum, our results indicate that silvicultural thinning and fertilization can have large effects on understory plant diversity and community composition. However, such effects were not a simple function of understory light levels, and conventional "functional types" were of only limited value in predicting species-specific responses to silvicultural treatments.

AB Removal of important predators by fishing can result in trophic cascades and indirect effects on marine benthic communities. Indirect effects are especially evident when prey populations released from predation by fishing have the ability to modify entire benthic communities, as do sea urchins. Sea urchins have been shown to dramatically alter the underwater landscape by grazing, by converting stands of large erect algae into coralline barrens. In the western Mediterranean, a recent extension of coralline barrens into areas formerly dominated by erect algal assemblages has been attributed to release of predation on sea urchins by overfishing. Most suggestions concerning the transition from erect algal assemblages to coralline barrens, however, have been speculative, and little descriptive and experimental work has been carried out to verify the hypothesis that fish predation on sea urchins land its subsequent release by overfishing) drives this transition. Here we critically review the literature concerning the effect of fishing on sea urchin populations and its subsequent maintenance of different algal assemblages in the Mediterranean. The extant data cannot refute the "fishes as important predators" model, but we argue that other processes (recruitment, pollution, disease, large-scale oceanographic events, sea urchin harvesting, food subsidies, and availability of shelters) may also be important in regulating the structure of Mediterranean algal assemblages.

AB Our study developed an approach to biological assessment that would document effects of pollution on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in Florida streams. The primary objectives were: (1) to classify streams for assessment of benthic assemblages and (2) to develop biological metrics and aggregated indices for biocriteria and assessment. Reference sites were selected throughout Florida (with the exception of the southernmost area, known as the Southern Florida Coastal Plain ecoregion) and sampled by biologists from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. These sites were sampled during a summer index period (1 July through 30 September) from 1992 through 1994. Streams were classified using invertebrate species composition. Three geographic stream classes (bioregions) that were based on aggregations of subecoregions were determined from this analysis: the panhandle, peninsular Florida, and the northeastern portion of Florida. Stream types based on water source (i.e., calcareous or non-calcareous) were not useful as stream classes. From an initial suite of 32 macroinvertebrate metrics, 8 metrics were useful in composing the Stream Condition Index (SCI) for Florida for all 3 bioregions. Scores (5, 3, or 1) were developed for these metrics to allow for aggregation into an index. Aggregating the metrics into the SCT provided a biocriterion that improved discrimination between impaired and unimpaired sites over use of individual metrics.

AB We examine the relationships between ocean ventilation, primary production, water column anoxia, and benthic regeneration of phosphorus using a mass balance model of the coupled marine biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). The elemental cycles are coupled via the Redfield C/P ratio of marine phytoplankton and the C/P ratio of organic matter preserved in marine sediments. The model assumes that on geologic timescales, net primary production in the oceans is limited by the upwelling of dissolved phosphorus to the photic zone. The model incorporates the dependence on bottom water oxygenation of the regeneration of nutrient phosphorus from particulate matter deposited at the water-sediment interface. Evidence from marine and lacustrine settings, modem and ancient, demonstrates that sedimentary burial of phosphorus associated with organic matter and ferric oxyhydroxides decreases when bottom water anoxia-dysoxia expands. Steady state simulations show that a reduction in the rate of thermohaline circulation, or a decrease of the oxygen content of downwelling water masses, intensifies water column anoxia-dysoxia and at the same time increases surface water productivity. The first effect reflects the declining supply of oxygen to the deeper parts of the ocean. The second effect is caused by the enhanced benthic regeneration of phosphorus from organic matter and ferric oxyhydroxides. Sedimentary burial of organic carbon and authigenic calcium phosphate mineral (francolite), on the other hand, is promoted by reduced ocean ventilation. According to the model, global-scale anoxia-dysoxia leads to a more efficient recycling of reactive phosphorus within the ocean system. Consequently, higher rates of primary production and organic carbon burial can be achieved, even when the continental supply of reactive phosphorus to the oceans remains unchanged.

AB The role of chromosomal inversions in adaptation and speciation is controversial. Historically, inversions were thought to contribute to these processes either by directly causing hybrid sterility or by facilitating the maintenance of co-adapted gene complexes. Because inversions suppress recombination when heterozygous, a recently proposed local adaptation mechanism predicts that they will spread if they capture alleles at multiple loci involved in divergent adaptation to contrasting environments. Many empirical studies have found inversion polymorphisms linked to putatively adaptive phenotypes or distributed along environmental clines. However, direct involvement of an inversion in local adaptation and consequent ecological reproductive isolation has not to our knowledge been demonstrated in nature. In this study, we discovered that a chromosomal inversion polymorphism is geographically widespread, and we test the extent to which it contributes to adaptation and reproductive isolation under natural field conditions. Replicated crosses between the prezygotically reproductively isolated annual and perennial ecotypes of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus, revealed that alternative chromosomal inversion arrangements are associated with life-history divergence over thousands of kilometers across North America. The inversion polymorphism affected adaptive flowering time divergence and other morphological traits in all replicated crosses between four pairs of annual and perennial populations. To determine if the inversion contributes to adaptation and reproductive isolation in natural populations, we conducted a novel reciprocal transplant experiment involving outbred lines, where alternative arrangements of the inversion were reciprocally introgressed into the genetic backgrounds of each ecotype. Our results demonstrate for the first time in nature the contribution of an inversion to adaptation, an annual/perennial life-history shift, and multiple reproductive isolating barriers. These results are consistent with the local adaptation mechanism being responsible for the distribution of the two inversion arrangements across the geographic range of M. guttatus and that locally adaptive inversion effects contribute directly to reproductive isolation. Such a mechanism may be partially responsible for the observation that closely related species often differ by multiple chromosomal rearrangements.

DE urban green space; scaling; human population density
ID BIODIVERSITY; BENEFITS; GROWTH; HEALTH
AB Most people on the planet live in dense aggregations, and policy directives emphasize green areas within cities to ameliorate some of the problems of urban living. Benefits of urban green spaces range from physical and psychological health to social cohesion, ecosystem service provision and biodiversity conservation. Green space coverage differs enormously among cities, yet little is known about the correlates or geography of this variation. This is important because urbanization is accelerating and the consequences for green space are unclear. Here, we use standardized major axis regression to explore the relationships between urban green space coverage, city area and population size across 386 European cities. We show that green space coverage increases more rapidly than city area, yet declines only weakly as human population density increases. Thus, green space provision within a city is primarily related to city area rather than the number of inhabitants that it serves, or a simple space-filling effect. Thus, compact cities (small size and high density) show very low per capita green space allocation. However, at high levels of urbanicity, the green space network is robust to further city compaction. As cities grow, interactions between people and nature depend increasingly on landscape quality outside formal green space networks, such as street plantings, or the size, composition and management of backyards and gardens.

AB In the past 20 years the use of stable isotope analysis has become increasingly common in ecological studies. In fact, in some instances these techniques have yielded remarkable insights into the foraging preferences and migrations of birds. Despite these advances and the potential of the approach, it is possibly still not as widely used as might be expected. In this paper we aim to illustrate the potential of the approach in the hope of encouraging more avian ecologists to think again about how these techniques might provide insights in the systems on which they work. We discuss some of the principles behind the approach, and review some of the more recent ornithological studies that have used stable isotope techniques to trace trophic pathways or infer migratory origins. We follow this by discussing some of the latest ideas on how stable isotopes may be used to generate community metrics and close by detailing the important assumptions and caveats that should be considered before undertaking any studies using this technique.

ID LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; SPATIAL SCALE; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; AREA;
   BIODIVERSITY
AB Despite two centuries of effort in characterizing environmental gradients of species richness in search of universal patterns, surprisingly few of these patterns have been widely acknowledged(1-3). Species richness along altitudinal gradients was previously assumed to increase universally from cool highlands to warm lowlands, mirroring the latitudinal increase in species richness from cool to warm latitudes(1,4,5). However, since the more recent general acceptance of altitudinal gradients as model templates for testing hypotheses behind large- scale patterns of diversity(5-9), these gradients have been used in support of all the main diversity hypotheses, although little consensus has been achieved. Here we show that when resampling a data set comprising 400,000 records for 3,046 Pyrenean floristic species at different scales of analysis ( achieved by varying grain size and the extent of the gradients sampled), the derived species richness pattern changed progressively from hump- shaped to a monotonic pattern as the scale of extent diminished. Scale effects alone gave rise to as many conflicting patterns of species richness as had previously been reported in the literature, and scale effects lent significantly different statistical support to competing diversity hypotheses. Effects of scale on current studies may be affected by human activities, because montane ecosystems and human activities are intimately connected(10). This interdependence has led to a global reduction in natural lowland habitats, hampering our ability to detect universal patterns and impeding the search for universal diversity gradients to discover the mechanisms determining the distribution of biological diversity on Earth.

AB The relationship between species and functional diversity remains poorly understood for nearly all ecosystem types, yet determining this relationship is critically important for developing both a mechanistic understanding of community assembly and appropriate expectations and approaches to protecting and restoring biological communities. Here we use two distinct data sets, one from kelp forests in the Channel Islands, California, and one from a global synthesis of marine reserves, to directly test how variation in species diversity translates into changes in functional diversity. We find strong positive relationships between species and functional diversity, and increased functional diversity of fish assemblages coinciding with recovery of species diversity in marine reserves, independent of the method used for classifying species in functional groups. These results indicate that low levels of redundancy in functional species traits exist across a suite of marine systems, and that fishing tends to remove whole functional groups from coastal marine ecosystems.

AB Intraguild predation (IGP), defined as killing and eating among potential competitors, seems to be a ubiquitous interaction, differing from competition or predation. In the present study we assess the frequency of IGP among 763 potential intraguild prey and 599 potential intraguild predators. Our results indicate that IGP is common in nature, reaching frequencies between 58.4 and 86.7%. A null model suggests that IGP in different groups of predators and prey (i.e. carnivores, omnivores, herbivores, detritivores, or top and intermediate species) have different deviations from a chance expectation, indicating these attributes of species biology as main determinants of IGP persistence. We suggest that IGP satisfies two basic requirements to be considered as important to the trophic structuring of communities. First, its occurrence is not random, rather it is associated with well-defined attributes of species biology, and secondly, it is a widespread interaction.

AB During flight, many insect wings undergo dramatic deformations that are controlled largely by the architecture of the wing. The pattern of supporting veins in wings varies widely among insect orders and families, but the functional significance of phylogenetic trends in wing venation remains unknown, and measurements of the mechanical properties of wings are rare. In this study, we address the relationship between venation pattern and wing flexibility by measuring the flexural stiffness of wings (in both the spanwise and chordwise directions) and quantifying wing venation in 16 insect species from six orders. These measurements show that spanwise flexural stiffness scales strongly with the cube of wing span, whereas chordwise flexural stiffness scales with the square of chord length. Wing size accounts for over 95% of the variability in measured flexural stiffness; the residuals of this relationship are small and uncorrelated with standardized independent contrasts of wing venation characters. In all species tested, spanwise flexural stiffness is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than chordwise flexural stiffness. A finite element model of an insect wing demonstrates that leading edge veins are crucial in generating this spanwise-chordwise anisotropy.

AB We give suggestions for the presentation of research results fi om frequentist, information-theoretic, and Bayesian analysis paradigms, followed by several general suggestions. The information-theoretic and Bayesian methods offer alternative approaches to data analysis and inference compared to traditionally used methods. Guidance is lacking on the presentation of results under these alternative procedures and on nontesting aspects of classical frequentist methods of statistical analysis. Null hypothesis testing has come under intense criticism. We recommend less reporting of the results of statistical tests of null hypothesis in casts where the null is surely false anyway, or where the null hypothesis is of little interest to science or management.

AB Interactions between insect herbivores and plants grown under conditions of ambient and elevated CO2 were investigated by analysing data on 43 herbivores, representing 61 plant-herbivore interactions. Changes in herbivore performance in enhanced CO2 environments were correlated with changes in the quality of the host plants, measured as nitrogen content, water content, carbohydrate content and secondary plant compounds. The data were analysed to determine whether CO2 mediated effects on insect performance differed between feeding guilds (leaf-chewers, leaf miners, phloem-feeders (root and shoot), xylem-feeders, whole-cell-feeders and seed-eaters) or instar stage.
   Host-plant quality changed in elevated CO2; leaf nitrogen content decreased, on average, by 15% while carbohydrates increased by 47% and secondary plant compounds (phenolics) by 31%. Water content did not change. Of the variables measured, changes in nitrogen and carbohydrate levels only were found to be correlated with changes in food consumption. No differences were found in CO2-mediated herbivore responses on woody plant compared with non-woody plants. Insects from different feeding guilds respond to CO2 mediated changes in host-plant quality in various ways. Leaf-chewers generally seem able to compensate for the decreased nitrogen levels in the plant tissues by increasing their food consumption (by 30%) and with no adverse effects on pupal weights. Leaf-miners only slightly increase their food consumption. The negative effect on pupal weight suggests that their population dynamics may change over several generations. Limited data on seed-eaters suggest that enhanced CO2 conditions have no effect on these insects. Phloem-feeders and whole-cell-feeders are the only insects to show a positive CO2 response. Population sizes generally increased in elevated CO2 and development lime of phloem-feeders was reduced by 17%.
   Early instar larvae are restricted more by CO2 enhancement than late instars. Although changes in food consumption are similar, changes in development times are much more pronounced in young instars (18% vs 6%).

TI The light:nutrient ratio in lakes: The balance of energy and materials
   affects ecosystem structure and process

AB The amounts of solar energy and materials are two of the chief factors determining ecosystem structure and process. Here, we examine the relative balance of light and phosphorus in a set of freshwater pelagic ecosystems. We calculated a ratio of light:phosphorus by putting mixed-layer mean light in the numerator and total P concentration in the denominator. This light: phosphorus ratio was a good predictor of the C:P ratio of particulate matter (seston), with a positive correlation demonstrated between these two ratios. We argue that the balance between light and nutrients controls ''nutrient use efficiency'' at the base of the food web in lakes. Thus, when light energy is high relative to nutrient availability, the base of the food web is carbon rich and phosphorus poor. In the opposite case, where light is relatively less available compared to nutrients, the base of the food web is relatively P rich. The significance of this relationship lies in the fact that the composition of sestonic material is known to influence a large number of ecosystem processes such as secondary production, nutrient cycling, and (we hypothesize) the relative strength of microbial versus grazing processes. Using the central result of increased C:P ratio with an increased light:phosphorus ratio, we make specific predictions of how ecosystem structure and process should vary with light and nutrient balance. Among these predictions, we suggest that lake ecosystems with low light:phosphorus ratios should have several trophic levels simultaneously carbon or energy limited, while ecosystems with high light:phosphorus ratios should have several trophic levels simultaneously limited by phosphorus. Our results provide an alternative perspective to the question of what determines nutrient use efficiency in ecosystems.

AB Forests in seasonally dry areas of eastern Amazonia near Paragominas, Para, Brazil, maintain an evergreen forest canopy through an extended dry season by taking up soil water through deep (>1 m) roots. Belowground allocation of C in these deep-rooting forests is very large (1900 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) relative to litterfall (460 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The presence of live roots drives an active carbon cycle deeper than 1 m in the soil. Although bulk C concentrations and C-14 contents of soil organic matter at >1-m depths are low, estimates of turnover from fine-root inputs, CO2 production, and the C-14 content of CO2 produced at depth show that up to 15% of the carbon inventory in the deep soil has turnover times of decades or less. Thus the amount of fast-cycling soil carbon between land 8-m depths (2-3 kg C m(-2), out of 17-18 kg C m(-2)) is significant compared to the amount present in the upper meter of soil (3-4 kg C m(-2) out of 10-11 kg C m(-2)). A model of belowground carbon cycling derived from measurements of carbon stocks and fluxes, and constrained using carbon isotopes, is used to predict C fluxes associated with conversion of deep-rooting forests to pasture and subsequent pasture management, The relative proportions and turnover times of active (including detrital plant material; 1-3 year turnover), slow (decadal and shorter turnover), and passive (centennial to millennial turnover) soil organic matter pools are determined by depth for the forest soil, using constraints from measurements of C stocks, fluxes, and isotopic content. Reduced carbon inputs to the soil in degraded pastures, which are less productive than the forests they replace, lead to a reduction in soil carbon inventory and Delta(14)C, in accord with observations. Managed pastures, which have been fertilized with phosphorous and planted with more productive grasses, show increases in C and C-14 over forest values. Carbon inventory increases in the upper meter of managed pasture soils are partially offset by predicted carbon losses due to death and decomposition of fine forest roots at depths >1 m in the soil. The major adjustments in soil carbon inventory in response to land management changes occur within the first decade after conversion. Carbon isotopes are shown to be more sensitive indicators of recent accumulation or loss of soil organic matter than direct measurement of soil C inventories.

AB A study of one of the simplest systems incorporating both dispersal and local dynamics, coupling two discrete time logistic equations, demonstrates several surprising features. Passive dispersal can cause chaotic dynamics to be replaced by simple periodic dynamics. Thus passive movement can be stabilizing, even in a deterministic model without underlying spatial variation in the dynamics. The boundary between initial conditions leading to qualitatively different dynamics can be a fractal, so it is essentially impossible to specify the asymptotic behavior in terms of the initial conditions. In accord with several recent studies of arthropods and earlier theoretical work, density dependence may only be detectable at a small enough spatial scale, so efforts to uncover density dependence must include investigations of movement.

ID NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCES; BOOTSTRAP; DISTANCE
AB A package of programs (run by a management program called TREECON) was developed for the construction and drawing of evolutionary trees. The program MATRIX calculates dissimilarity values and can perform bootstrap analysis on nucleic acid sequences. TREE implements different evolutionary tree constructing methods based on distance matrices. Because some of these methods produce unrooted evolutionary trees, a program ROOT places a root on the tree. Finally, the program DRAW draws the evolutionary tree, changes its size or topology, and produces drawings suitable for publication. Whereas MATRIX is suited only for nucleic acids, the modules TREE, ROOT and DRAW are applicable to any kind of dissimilarity matrix. The programs run on IBM-compatible microcomputers using the DOS operating system.

AB Selfing, the fusion of male and female gametes from a single genetic individual or colony, is possible in many plants and also in hermaphrodite animals. We review the occurrence of selfing and mechanisms for its avoidance, in functionally hermaphrodite animal and plants. We discuss means by which selfing can be detected and briefly review techniques for estimation of selfing frequencies in natural populations. Although many functionally hemaphrodite species are probably almost complete outcrossers or inbreeders, mixed mating systems are also found in both plant and animal populations. We review theories for the advantages and disadvantages of selfing, and for the maintenance of mixed mating systems, together with empirical data showing that at least some of the factors involved in the theories (for instance, reproductive assurance, cost of mating, and inbreeding depression) are detectable in actually or potentially selfing organisms. More work is still needed on animal selfing and selfing avoidance and, for both animals and plants, on the evolutionary origins of selfing and on the effects of selfing on genetic diversity.

AB Hill numbers or the effective number of species are increasingly used to quantify species diversity of an assemblage. Hill numbers were recently extended to phylogenetic diversity, which incorporates species evolutionary history, as well as to functional diversity, which considers the differences among species traits. We review these extensions and integrate them into a framework of attribute diversity (the effective number of entities or total attribute value) based on Hill numbers of taxonomic entities (species), phylogenetic entities (branches of unit-length), or functional entities (species-pairs with unit-distance between species). This framework unifies ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and distance-based functional diversity. It also provides a unified method of decomposing these diversities and constructing normalized taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional similarity and differentiation measures, including N-assemblage phylogenetic or functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indexes. A real example shows how this framework extracts ecological meaning from complex data.

AB We assembled a dataset of 192 carefully selected species-51 extinct and 191 extant-and 976 apomorphies distributed among 610 phenotypic characters to investigate the phylogeny of Squamata ("lizards," including snakes and amphisbaenians). These data enabled us to infer a tree much like those derived from previous morphological analyses, but with better support for some key clades. There are also several novel elements, some of which pose striking departures from traditional ideas about lizard evolution (e.g., that mosasaurs and polyglyphanodontians are on the scleroglossan stem, rather than parts of the crown, and related to varanoids and teiids, respectively). Long-bodied, limb-reduced, "snake-like" fossorial lizards-most notably dibamids, amphisbaenians and snakes-have been and continue to be the chief source of character conflict in squamate morphological phylogenetics. Carnivorous lizards (especially snakes, mosasaurs and varanoids) have proven a close second. Genetic data, presumably less burdened by the potential for adaptive convergence related to fossoriality, were expected to resolve these conflicts. Although recent gene phylogenies seem to do so, they also differ radically from any phylogeny based-on the phenotype, especially for the most ancient crown squamate divergences that occured during the latter half of the Mesozoic. Our study relied on traditionally prepared specimens as well as high-resolution computed tomography scans that afforded unprecendented access to the cranial anatomy of Squamata. This, along with the inclusion of stem fossils, provided an unparalleled sample of the phenotype enabling us to more fully explore the extreme incongruences between molecular and morphological topologies for the squamate tree of life. Despite this extensive new database, we were unable to find morphological support for the major rearrangement of the deep divergences in Squamata proposed by recent molecular studies. Instead, our data strongly support the same fundamental topology suggested by most previous morphological studies-an Iguania-Scleroglossa basal split, a sister-group relationship between Gekkota and Autarchoglossa, and the divergence between Anguimorpha and Scincomorpha-and documents the extreme degree of morphological homoplasy required by those molecular topologies.

AB In this review, our current understanding of the species Escherichia coli and its persistence in the open environment is examined. E. coli consists of six different subgroups, which are separable by genomic analyses. Strains within each subgroup occupy various ecological niches, and can be broadly characterized by either commensalistic or different pathogenic behaviour. In relevant cases, genomic islands can be pinpointed that underpin the behaviour. Thus, genomic islands of, on the one hand, broad environmental significance, and, on the other hand, virulence, are highlighted in the context of E. coli survival in its niches. A focus is further placed on experimental studies on the survival of the different types of E. coli in soil, manure and water. Overall, the data suggest that E. coli can persist, for varying periods of time, in such terrestrial and aquatic habitats. In particular, the considerable persistence of the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 is of importance, as its acid tolerance may be expected to confer a fitness asset in the more acidic environments. In this context, the extent to which E. coli interacts with its human/animal host and the organism's survivability in natural environments are compared. In addition, the effect of the diversity and community structure of the indigenous microbiota on the fate of invading E. coli populations in the open environment is discussed. Such a relationship is of importance to our knowledge of both public and environmental health. The ISME Journal (2011) 5, 173-183; doi:10.1038/ismej.2010.80; published online 24 June 2010

AB A total of 52 SNPs reported to be polymorphic in European, Asian and African populations were selected. Of these, 42 were from the distal regions of each autosome (except chromosome 19). Nearly all selected SNPs were located at least 100 kb distant from known genes and commonly used STRs. We established a highly sensitive and reproducible SNP-typing method with amplification of all 52 DNA fragments in one PCR reaction followed by detection of the SNPs with two single base extension reactions analysed using CE. The amplicons ranged from 59 to 115 bp in length. Complete SNP profiles were obtained from 500 pg DNA. The 52 loci were efficiently amplified from degraded samples where previously only partial STR profiles had been obtained. A total of 700 individuals from Denmark, Greenland, Somalia, Turkey, China, Germany, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan were typed, and the allele frequencies estimated. All 52 SNPs were polymorphic in the three major population groups. The mean match probability was at least 5.0 x 10(-19) in the populations studied. Typical paternity indices ranged from 336 000 in Asians to 549 000 in Europeans.

AB 1. We present a model that yields ecosystem-level predictions of the flux, storage and turnover of carbon in three important pools (autotrophs, decomposers, labile soil C) based on the constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate.
   2. The model predicts a 10 000-fold increase in C turnover rates moving from tree- to phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems due to the size dependence of photosynthetic rates.
   3. The model predicts a 16-fold increase in rates controlled by respiration (e.g. decomposition, turnover of labile soil C and microbial biomass) over the temperature range 0-30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of ATP synthesis in respiratory complexes.
   4. The model predicts only a fourfold increase in rates controlled by photosynthesis (e.g. net primary production, litter fall, fine root turnover) over the temperature range 0-30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of Rubisco carboxylation in chloroplasts.
   5. The difference between the temperature dependence of respiration and photosynthesis yields quantitative predictions for distinct phenomena that include acclimation of plant respiration, geographic gradients in labile C storage, and differences between the short- and long-term temperature dependence of whole-ecosystem CO2 flux.
   6. These four sets of model predictions were tested using global compilations of data on C flux, storage and turnover in ecosystems.
   7. Results support the hypothesis that the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate impose important constraints on the global C cycle. The model thus provides a synthetic, mechanistic framework for linking global biogeochemical cycles to cellular-, individual- and community-level processes.

AB Comparative genomics gives us a new window into phage-host interactions and their evolutionary implications. Here we report the presence of genes central to oxygenic photosynthesis in the genomes of three phages from two viral families (Myoviridae and Podoviridae) that infect the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. The genes that encode the photosystem II core reaction center protein D1 (psbA), and a high-light-inducible protein (HLIP) (hli) are present in all three genomes. Both myoviruses contain additional hli gene types, and one of them encodes the second photosystem II core reaction center protein D2 (psbD), whereas the other encodes the photosynthetic electron transport proteins plastocyanin (petE) and ferredoxin (petF). These uninterrupted, full-length genes are conserved in their amino acid sequence, suggesting that they encode functional proteins that may help maintain photosynthetic activity during infection. Phylogenetic analyses show that phage D1, D2, and HLIP proteins cluster with those from Prochlorococcus, indicating that they are of cyanobacterial origin. Their distribution among several Prochlorococcus clades further suggests that the genes encoding these proteins were transferred from host to phage multiple times. Phage HLIPs cluster with multicopy types found exclusively in Prochlorocococus, suggesting that phage may be mediating the expansion of the hli gene family by transferring these genes back to their hosts after a period of evolution in the phage. These gene transfers are likely to play a role in the fitness landscape of hosts and phages in the surface oceans.

AB It is only in the past five years that studies of speciation have truly entered the molecular era. Recent molecular analyses of a handful of genes that are involved in maintaining reproductive isolation between species ( speciation genes) have provided some striking insights. In particular, it seems that despite being strongly influenced by positive selection, speciation genes are often non-essential, having functions that are only loosely coupled to reproductive isolation. Molecular studies might also resolve the long-running debate on the relative importance of allopatric and parapatric modes of speciation.

AB Bergmann's rule is currently defined as a within-species tendency for increasing body size with increasing latitude or decreasing environmental temperature. This well-known ecogeographic pattern has been considered a general trend for all animals, yet support for Bergmann's rule has only been demonstrated for mammals and birds. Here we evaluate Bergmann's rule in two groups of reptiles: chelonians (turtles) and squamates (lizards and snakes). We perform both nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic analyses and show that chelonians follow Bergmann's rule (19 of 23 species increase in size with latitude; 14 of 15 species decrease in size with temperature), whereas squamates follow the converse to Bergmann's rule (61 of 83 species decrease in size with latitude; 40 of 56 species increase in size with temperature). Size patterns of chelonians are significant using both nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic methods, whereas only the nonphylogenetic analyses are significant for squamates. These trends are consistent among major groups of chelonians and squamates for which data are available. This is the first study to document the converse to Bergmann's rule in any major animal group as well as the first to show Bergmann's rule in a major group of ectotherms. The traditional explanation for Bergmann's rule is that larger endothermic individuals conserve heat better in cooler areas. However, our finding that at least one ectothermic group also follows Bergmann's rule suggests that additional factors may be important. Several alternative processes, such as selection for rapid heat gain in cooler areas, may be responsible for the converse to Bergmann's rule in squamates.

AB Global warming is expected to have a major impact on plant distributions, an issue of key importance in biological conservation. However, very few models are able to predict species distribution accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power when tested against present distributions of two North American species - quaking aspen and sugar maple - indicating that on a broad scale, the fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche. Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.

AB A better understanding of the reasons for variation in tropical rain forest (TRF) structure is important for quantifying global above-ground biomass (AGBM). We used three data sets to estimate stem number, basal area, and AGBM over a 600-ha old-growth TRF landscape (La Selva, N.E. Costa Rica). We analyzed the effects of soil type, slope angle, topographic position, and different sample designs and measurement techniques on these estimates. All three data sets were for woody stems greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter. Estimated AGBM was determined from stand-level measurements using Brown's (Brown, 1997) allometric equation for Tropical Wet: Forest trees. One data set was from three subjectively-sited 4-ha plots (the 'OTS plots'), another was based on 1170 0.01 ha plots spaced on a regular grid (the 'Vegetation map plots'), and the third was from 18 0.5 ha plots (the 'Carbono plots') sited to provide unbiased samples of three edaphic conditions: hat inceptisol old alluvial terraces; Rat ultisol hill-tops; and steep ultisol slopes. Basal area, estimated AGBM and the contributions of major life forms were similar among studies, in spite of the differences in sampling design and measurement techniques. Although the Carbono plots on Rat inceptisols had significantly larger and fewer trees than those on ultisols, AGBM did not vary over the relatively small edaphic gradient in upland areas at La Selva. On residual soils, the largest trees were on the flattest topographic positions. Slope angle per se was not correlated with basal area or AGBM within the residual soils. Errors introduced by palm and liana lift: forms, as well as hollow trees, did not significantly affect AGBM estimates. In contrast, the methods used to measure buttressed trees had a large impact. Plot sizes of 0.35-0.5 ha were sufficient to achieve coefficients of variation of <12% for basal area with only six replicates in a given edaphic type. AGBM estimates ranged from 161 to 186 Mg/ha. These low values appear to be mainly due to the Tropical Wet Forest allometry equation used. This in turn may be indicative of a real and substantially lower ratio of biomass/basal area in Tropical Wet Forest than in Tropical Moist, as previously noted by Brown (1996).
   Our results indicate that for upland TRF landscapes with levels of environmental variation similar to La Selva, AGBM will be relatively insensitive to soil type and topography. However, because topography and soil type had much stronger effects on stem size, stand density, and spatial heterogeneity of sterns, stand dynamics may be more sensitive than AGBM to this range of conditions. We recommend that future studies of landscape-scale forest structure employ stratified sampling designs across major environmental gradients. Unbiased sampling with replication, combined with consistent and well-documented measurement techniques, will lead to a greatly improved understanding of the magnitude of and reasons for variation in forest structure and AGBM within TRF landscapes.

AB There is some evidence that traits of fresh leaves that provide structural or chemical protection ('defence') remain operational in the leaf litter and control interspecific Variation in decomposition rate in or on the soil. We tested experimentally whether the negative relationship between foliar defence and litter decomposition rate is fundamental, i.e. whether it is seen consistently across higher plant species and life forms, and whether it is repeated in the floras of geographically and climatically distinct areas separated by an ocean. We employed the published results of two outdoor litter bag experiments, in which we simultaneously compared the relative mass losses ('decomposibility') of leaf litters of a wide range of plant species. One experiment was in Cordoba, Argentina, and included 48 Argentine species typical of the dry, subtropical landscapes along a steep altitudinal gradient. The other was in Sheffield, UK, and hosted 72 British species typical of the temperate-Atlantic landscape there. We linked the two experiments through a similar experiment in Sheffield that hosted litters of subsets of both the Argentine and British species. We also tested fresh leaves of all species from the same areas for tensile strength ('toughness') and relative palatability to generalist herbivorous snails in multi-species 'cafeteria' experiments. Both in Argentina and in Great Britain there were highly significant correlations between leaf palatability (r = 0.61; 0.73) or leaf tensile strength (r = -0.60; -0.60) and litter mass loss across all species. These relationships could be explained by variation both between and within broad life-form groups. Specific leaf area (area:dry mass) of fresh leaves was consistently correlated only with litter mass loss within British life form groups. We illustrated the possible ecosystem consequences of these relationships by comparing functional traits of British species differing in leaf habit. In comparison with deciduous species, evergreens generally had innately slow growth, which corresponded to their longer-lived leaves of lower specific leaf area, higher tensile strength and lower palatability to generalist invertebrate herbivores. Correspondingly, evergreens produced more resistant leaf litter. Thus, slow-growing evergreens might maintain their position in infertile ecosystems through leaf traits that help them to conserve their nutrients efficiently and to keep nutrient mineralization low, thereby not allowing potentially fast-growing deciduous species to outcompete them.

AB Empirical research has not supported the prediction that populations of terrestrial herbivorous arthropods are regulated solely by their natural enemies. Instead, both natural enemies (top-down effects) and resources (bottom-up effects) may play important regulatory roles. This review evaluates the hypothesis that higher-order predators may constrain the top-down control of herbivore populations. Natural enemies of herbivorous arthropods generally are not top predators within terrestrial food webs. Insect pathogens and entomopathogenic nematodes inhabiting the soil may be attacked by diverse micro- and mesofauna. Predatory and parasitic insects are attacked by their own suite of predators, parasitoids, and pathogens. The view of natural enemy ecology that has emerged from laboratory studies, where natural enemies are often isolated from all elements of the biotic community except for their hosts or prey, may be an unreliable guide to field dynamics.
   Experimental work suggests that interactions of biological control agents with their own natural enemies can disrupt the effective control of herbivore populations. Disruption has been observed experimentally in interactions of bacteria with bacteriophages, nematodes with nematophagous fungi, parasitoids with predators, parasitoids with hyperparasitoids, and predators with other predators. Higher-order predators have been little studied; manipulative field experiments will be especially valuable in furthering our understanding of their roles in arthropod communities.

AB Fifty years ago David Lack put forward a key hypothesis in life-history theory: that avian clutch size is ultimately determined by the number of young that parents can provide with food. Since then, a plethora of brood manipulations has shown that birds can rear more young than the number of eggs they lay, and prompted a search for negative effects of increased effort on future reproduction. However, recent studies have shown that the demands of laying and incubating eggs, generally omitted from experiments, could affect parental fitness. Lack's hypothesis, and the tests of its validity, need to be extended to encompass the full demands of producing and rearing the brood.

AB The avian W chromosome shares many features with the mammalian Y chromosome: it is small, mostly heterochromatic, and filled with large repetitive arrays. No gene has so far been assigned to the W chromosome in any bird species and, as a practical consequence, a general tag for avian gender identification on the molecular level is lacking. Here I describe the isolation of a chicken homologue to the mouse chromo-helicase-DNA binding (CHD) gene which encodes a protein involved in global regulation of transcriptional activation on the chromatin level. The avian CHD gene exists in two genomic copies, one of which (termed CHD-W) was located on the W chromosome in all non-ratite species investigated. The gene displays extreme levels of sequence conservation since chicken CHD-W and mouse CHD are 82.9% and 95.6% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid level respectively. Molecular sexing can be accomplished in probably all non-ratite birds by hybridizing Southern blots with CHD probes. pea-based gender identification is also demonstrated. A general system for avian sexing should facilitate many studies of behaviour, evolutionary ecology, genetics, and evolution.

AB Although biological invasions ale clearly one of the most important impacts humans have had on the Earth's ecosystems, we still do not have reliable tools which can help us to predict which species are potential invaders. At present, several limited generalizations are available for seed plants: (1) invasiveness of woody species in disturbed landscapes is significantly associated with small seed mass, short juvenile period, and short mean interval between large seed crops; (2) vertebrate dispersal is responsible for the success of many woody invaders in disturbed as well as 'undisturbed' habitats; (3) primary (native) latitudinal range of herbaceous Gramineae, Compositae, and Fabaceae seems to be the best predictor of their invasiveness, at least for species introduced from Eurasia to North America; (4) low nuclear DNA content (genome size) seems to be a result of selection for short minimum generation time and, therefore, may be associated with plant invasiveness in disturbed landscapes; (5) analysis of exotic Gramineae and Compositae introduced from Europe to California supports Darwin's suggestion that alien species belonging to exotic genera are move likely to be invasive than alien species from genera represented in the native flora. Fortunately, these seemingly disparate stories can be brought together and provide a foundation for building a general theory of seed plant invasiveness. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited

AB A major role of facilitation between higher plant species, particularly in stressful environments, has recently been reported in several papers that suggest that beneficial interactions could be more important in the dynamics of plant communities than has been recognized to date. In a semiarid region in southeastern Spain we determined the effect of a leguminous shrub, Retama sphaerocarpa, on its environment, testing the hypothesis that facilitation by the shrub of one species of its understory, Marrubium vulgare, is reciprocal and that the shrub benefits from sheltering herbs beneath its canopy.
   Marrubium plants under Retama had greater specific leaf area, leaf mass, shoot mass, leaf area, more flowers, a higher nitrogen (N) concentration in leaf tissue, and more N per plant than isolated plants, suggesting a facilitative effect of Retama on Marrubium including increased availability of resources. Biomass of 1-yr-old cladodes, total biomass, total nitrogen content of 3-yr-old branches, and shoot water potential at midday were higher for Retama shrubs with Marrubium beneath them than in shrubs without Marrubium.
   Retama strongly improved its own environment, facilitated the growth of Marrubium and other species underneath its canopy, and at the same time obtained benefits from sheltering herbs underneath. The interaction between these two species was indirect, associated with differences in soil properties and with improved nutrient availability under shrubs compared with plants growing on their own.
   We propose that the mutual benefit of the association between Retama and Marrubium is best termed a facultative mutualism. Each partner benefits from greater availability of resources in the ''island of fertility'' that results from their association. If beneficial plant-plant interactions as described here are widespread, positive relationships may have a major role in determining the pattern and structure of plant communities.

AB Plant competition for space is studied using analytical and simulation models. Here, the interaction is viewed as a local competition between juveniles of different species for environmentally variable sites vacated by the random deaths of adults. Because plants are sedentary and have finite fecundity, often only a subset of species will compete for an available site. When a dominant species is recruitment limited, inferior competitors will win some site's by forfeit. It is shown that recruitment limitation allows ''winning-by-forfeit'' which lessens the effect of competitive asymmetries and slows population and community dynamics. Moreover, since recruitment limitation is likely to be most pronounced in highly diverse communities because of the rarity of many species, it is suggested that there is no conflict between the hypothesis that species-rich plant communities are more influenced by chance and history than regulated by competition, and observations of strong interspecific differences among plants.

AB The net value of any plant trait can be assessed by measuring the costs and benefits associated with that trait. While the other contributors to this issue examine the possible benefits of terpenoids to plants, this article explores the metabolic costs of terpenoid accumulation in plants in the light of recent advances in terpenoid biochemistry. Terpenoids are more expensive to manufacture per gram than most other primary and secondary metabolites due to their extensive chemical reduction, The enzyme costs of making terpenoids are also high since terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes are apparently not shared with other metabolic pathways. In fact, plant cells may even possess mom than one set of enzymes for catalyzing the basic steps of terpenoid formation. Terpenoids are usually sequestered in complex, multicellular secretory structures, and so storage costs for these substances are also likely to be substantial. However, not all of the processes involved in terpenoid accumulation require large investments of resources. For instance, the maintenance of terpenoid pools is probably inexpensive because there is no evidence that substantial quantities of terpenes are lost as a result of metabolic turnover, volatilization, or leaching. Moreover, plants may reduce their net terpenoid costs by employing individual compounds in more than one role or by catabolizing substances that are no longer needed, although it is still unclear if such practices are widespread. These findings (and other facets of terpenoid biochemistry and physiology) are discussed in relation to the assumptions and predictions of several current theories of plant defense, including the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis, the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, and the resource availability hypothesis.

AB Mitochondrial DNA sequences are often used to construct molecular phylogenetic trees among closely related animals. In order to examine the usefulness of mtDNA sequences for deep-branch phylogenetics, genes in previously reported mtDNA sequences were analyzed among several animals that diverged 20-600 million years ago. Unambiguous alignment was achieved for stem-forming regions of mitochondrial tRNA genes by virtue of their conservative secondary structures. Sequences derived from stem parts of the mitochondrial tRNA genes appeared to accumulate much variation linearly for a long period of time: nearly 100 Myr for transition differences and more than 350 Myr for transversion differences. This characteristic could be attributed, in part, to the structural variability of mitochondrial tRNAs, which have fewer restrictions on their tertiary structure than do nonmitochondrial tRNAs. The tRNA sequence data served to reconstruct a well-established phylogeny of the animals with 100% bootstrap probabilities by both maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods. By contrast, mitochondrial protein genes coding for cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase subunit I did not reconstruct the established phylogeny or did so only weakly, although a variety of fractions of the protein gene sequences were subjected to tree-building. This discouraging phylogenetic performance of mitochondrial protein genes, especially with respect to branches originating over 300 Myr ago, was not simply due to high randomness in the data. It may have been due to the relative susceptibility of the protein genes to natural selection as compared with the stem parts of mitochondrial tRNA genes. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that mitochondrial tRNA genes may be useful in resolving deep branches in animal phylogenies with divergences that occurred some hundreds of Myr ago. For this purpose, we designed a set of primers with which mtDNA fragments encompassing clustered tRNA genes were successfully amplified from various vertebrates by the polymerase chain reaction.

AB We conducted an 8-yr study of flower and acorn production in three species of oak in east-central Missouri: white oak (Quercus alba), red oak (Q. rubra), and black oak (Q. velutina). The goal was to evaluate whether mast-fruiting, the synchronous production of large seed crops followed by small seed crops, is simply a response to weather conditions or is actually an evolved reproductive strategy. In this paper, we address four specific questions: (1) Are annual fluctuations in acorn crop size the result of synchronous production of acorns by individuals? (2) Are large acorn crops the result of large flower crops and/or high survival of those flowers to mature fruit? (3) To what extent do weather variables account for variation in acorn production among years? (4) Does acorn crop size correlate negatively with prior acorn production?
   Red oak and white oak showed a greater degree of mast-fruiting than did black oak. Within a species, individuals tended to produce large acorn crops in the same years, but each species differed in which years they produced large crops. The size of a given acorn crop was determined by both flower abundance and survival of flowers to fruit. Principal components and multiple-regression analyses were used to describe the relationship between weather variables and acorn production. The first principal component explained the largest amount of the variation in black oak (R2 = 0.55) and red oak (R2 = 0.89). In white oak, two principal components combined to explain 77% of the variation in acorn production. The weather variables that were associated with these principal components included spring temperature (positive effect) and summer drought (negative effect).
   Past acorn production had a major impact on the size of the current acorn crop, with each species showing a different pattern. In black oak, the current acorn crop was negatively correlated with the crop 3 yr prior but positively correlated with the crop 2 yr prior. In red oak, acorn crop size 1, 2, and 3 yr prior had negative correlations with current acorn crop, while acorn crop size 4 yr prior was positively correlated. In white oak, there were negative correlations between acorn crop size and crop size 1, 2, and 4 yr prior but a positive correlation with the acorn crop size 3 yr prior. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mast-fruiting species must store resources during some years in order to produce a mast crop. We discuss the possibility that these three species may have inherent cycles of reproduction that are modified by the impact of weather conditions, black oak with 2-yr cycles, white oak with 3-yr cycles, and red oak with 4-yr cycles. We conclude that the patterns of acorn production for black oak, red oak, and white oak are not simply responses to weather events but are also a function of prior reproductive events. This suggests that masting is an evolved reproductive strategy.

AB Evolutionary theory has gained tremendous insight from studies of adaptive radiations. High rates of speciation, morphological divergence, and hybridization, combined with low sequence variability, however, have prevented phylogenetic reconstruction for many radiations. The Hawaiian honeycreepers are an exceptional adaptive radiation, with high phenotypic diversity and speciation that occurred within the geologically constrained setting of the Hawaiian Islands. Here we analyze a new data set of 13 nuclear loci and pyrosequencing of mitochondrial genomes that resolves the Hawaiian honeycreeper phylogeny. We show that they are a sister taxon to Eurasian rosefinches (Carpodacus) and probably came to Hawaii from Asia. We use island ages to calibrate DNA substitution rates, which vary substantially among gene regions, and calculate divergence times, showing that the radiation began roughly when the oldest of the current large Hawaiian Islands (Kauai and Niihau) formed, similar to 5.7 million years ago (mya). We show that most of the lineages that gave rise to distinctive morphologies diverged after Oahu emerged (4.0-3.7 mya) but before the formation of Maui and adjacent islands (2.4-1.9 mya). Thus, the formation of Oahu, and subsequent cycles of colonization and speciation between Kauai and Oahu, played key roles in generating the morphological diversity of the extant honeycreepers.

AB Antibiotics were one of the great discoveries of the 20th century. However, resistance appeared even in the earliest years of the antibiotic era. Antibiotic resistance continues to become worse, despite the ever-increasing resources devoted to combat the problem. One of the most important factors in the development of resistance to antibiotics is the remarkable ability of bacteria to share genetic resources via Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT). LGT occurs on a global scale, such that in theory, any gene in any organism anywhere in the microbial biosphere might be mobilized and spread. With sufficiently strong selection, any gene may spread to a point where it establishes a global presence. From an antibiotic resistance perspective, this means that a resistance phenotype can appear in a diverse range of infections around the globe nearly simultaneously. We discuss the forces and agents that make this LGT possible and argue that the problem of resistance can ultimately only be managed by understanding the problem from a broad ecological and evolutionary perspective. We also argue that human activities are exacerbating the problem by increasing the tempo of LGT and bacterial evolution for many traits that are important to humans.

AB Many ecologically important traits have a complex genetic basis, with the potential formutations at many different genes to shape the phenotype. Even so, studies of local adaptation in heterogeneous environments sometimes find that just a few quantitative trait loci (QTL) of large effect can explain a large percentage of observed differences between phenotypically divergent populations. As high levels of gene flow can swamp divergence at weakly selected alleles, migration-selection-drift balance may play an important role in shaping the genetic architecture of local adaptation. Here, we use analytical approximations and individual-based simulations to explore how genetic architecture evolves when two populations connected by migration experience stabilizing selection toward different optima. In contrast to the exponential distribution of allele effect sizes expected under adaptation without migration (Orr 1998), we find that adaptation with migration tends to result in concentrated genetic architectures with fewer, larger, and more tightly linked divergent alleles. Even if many small alleles contribute to adaptation at the outset, they tend to be replaced by a few large alleles under prolonged bouts of stabilizing selection with migration. All else being equal, we also find that stronger selection can maintain linked clusters of locally adapted alleles over much greater map distances than weaker selection. The common empirical finding of QTL of large effect is shown to be expected with migration in a heterogeneous landscape, and these QTL may often be composed of several tightly linked alleles of smaller effect.

AB 1. Classic evolutionary models interpret ageing as a cost of reproduction, but evolutionary research has thus far largely neglected the conceptual links between the evolution of ageing and a key mode of selection on male and female reproductive strategies - sexual selection and sexual conflict.
   2. We synthesize ideas and evidence linking sex and ageing, and make the case that a focus on this fascinating problem will ultimately lead to a more complete understanding of both the evolution of ageing and the evolution of sexual strategies.
   3. The primary and secondary differentiation of male and female reproductive strategies is expected to produce sex-specific optima for traits that affect longevity and ageing rate, often favouring a 'live fast, die young' strategy in males, relative to females, although numerous exceptions to this pattern are observed and sex-differences in ageing rate, in particular, remain poorly understood.
   4. Conversely, environmental factors that influence life expectancy or ageing rate can thereby determine the magnitude or even sign of sexual selection.
   5. Sexual conflict is expected to displace the sexes from their sex-specific life-history optima through sexually antagonistic interactions, as well as sex-specific selection on loci expressed in both sexes.
   6. Despite the availability of interesting and testable hypotheses linking sexual selection and ageing, relevant empirical studies are remarkably sparse, and the complex relation between sex, mortality rate and ageing remains poorly understood.

AB We analysed the dynamics of a plant-pollinator interaction network of a scrub community surveyed over four consecutive years. Species composition within the annual networks showed high temporal variation. Temporal dynamics were also evident in the topology of the network, as interactions among plants and pollinators did not remain constant through time. This change involved both the number and the identity of interacting partners. Strikingly, few species and interactions were consistently present in all four annual plant-pollinator networks (53% of the plant species, 21% of the pollinator species and 4.9% of the interactions). The high turnover in species-to-species interactions was mainly the effect of species turnover (c. 70% in pairwise comparisons among years), and less the effect of species flexibility to interact with new partners (c. 30%). We conclude that specialization in plant-pollinator interactions might be highly overestimated when measured over short periods of time. This is because many plant or pollinator species appear as specialists in 1 year, but tend to be generalists or to interact with different partner species when observed in other years. The high temporal plasticity in species composition and interaction identity coupled with the low variation in network structure properties (e.g. degree centralization, connectance, nestedness, average distance and network diameter) imply (i) that tight and specialized coevolution might not be as important as previously suggested and (ii) that plant-pollinator interaction networks might be less prone to detrimental effects of disturbance than previously thought. We suggest that this may be due to the opportunistic nature of plant and animal species regarding the available partner resources they depend upon at any particular time.

AB Although insects are crucial for maintaining ecosystem function, our understanding of their overall response to human activity remains limited. This is no less true of dung-burying beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae), which provide a suite of critical ecosystem functions and services, yet but face multiple conservation threats, particularly from landscape conversion. Here we use a review and meta-analysis to synthesize the current knowledge concerning response to tropical forest modification and fragmentation of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae). For every modified habitat type and individual forest fragment across 33 studies, we calculated six dung beetle community parameters, standardized relative to intact tropical forest. We organized modified habitats along an approximate disturbance gradient ranging from selectively logged, late and early secondary forest, through agroforestry, tree plantations, to annual crops, cattle pastures and clear-cuts. Secondary forests, selectively logged forest and agroforests supported rich communities with many intact forest species, while cattle pastures and clear-cuts contained fewer species overall with few forest-dwelling species. Abundance generally declined with increasing modification, but was quite variable. Communities in open habitats were often characterized by hyper-abundance of a small number of small-bodied species, leading to low evenness. Across fragmentation studies, dung beetle species richness, abundance and evenness declined in smaller forest fragments. Richness and abundance sometimes declined in more isolated fragments, although this response appeared to depend on matrix quality. Across both habitat modification and fragmentation studies, geographic location and landscape context appeared to modify dung beetle response by influencing the available pool of colonists. We discuss potential underlying mechanisms and conclude with recommendations for management and conservation and for future research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many species comprise multiple cytotypes that represent autopolyploids, or presumed autopolyploids, of the basic diploid cytotype. However, rarely has an autopolyploid been formally named and considered to represent a species distinct from its diploid progenitor (Zea diploperennis and Z. perennis represent a rare example). The major reasons why autopolyploids have not been named as distinct species are: (1) tradition of including multiple cytotypes in a single named species; and (2) tradition and convenience of adhering to a broad morphology-based taxonomic (or phenetic) species concept. As a result, plant biologists have underrepresented the distinct biological entities that actually exist in nature. Although it may seem "practical" to include morphologically highly similar cytotypes in one species, this practice obscures insights into evolution and speciation and hinders conservation. However, we do not suggest that all cytotypes should be named; each case must be carefully considered. A number of species comprising multiple cytotypes have been thoroughly investigated. Drawing on the literature, as well as our own experience with several autopolyploids (Tolmiea menziesii, Galax urceolota, Chamerion angustifolium, Heuchera grossulariifolia, Vaccinium corymbosum), we reassess the traditional view of plant autopolyploids as mere cytotypes. When considered carefully, many "unnamed" autopolyploids fulfill the requirements of multiple species concepts, including the biological, taxonomic, diagnosability, apomorphic, and evolutionary species concepts. Compared to the diploid parent, the autopolyploids noted above possess distinct geographic ranges, can be distinguished morphologically, and are largely reproductively isolated (via a diversity of mechanisms including reproductive and ecological isolation). These five autopolyploids (and probably many others) represent distinct evolutionary lineages; we therefore suggest that they be considered distinct species and also provide a system for naming them.

AB Agricultural landscapes are mosaics of different land uses. Their vast extent throughout the world means that they have a key role in the conservation of biodiversity. To provide a sound basis for management, it is important to recognise the emergent properties of land mosaics and understand how they influence components of biodiversity in most studies in agricultural landscapes, inference is restricted to single sites or patches because this is the unit used for sampling and analysis. For mosaic-level inference, sampling must encompass multiple land uses and elements within a mosaic, be aggregated to represent the 'whole' mosaic, and be replicated across multiple mosaics. This paper reviews studies in which land mosaics are the unit of replication, to identify the influence on biota of three categories of emergent properties of mosaic structure: the extent of habitat, composition of the mosaic and spatial configuration of elements. The extent of habitat is usually a dominant influence on the occurrence of single species or the richness of assemblages defined by habitat type (e.g., forest birds). The composition of the mosaic, based on the proportions of elements present, strongly influences the species composition of faunal assemblages. Heterogeneity or diversity of elements is often positively correlated with the richness of taxonomic assemblages. In studies that separate the independent effects of emergent properties, spatial configuration generally exerts less influence on biota than extent or composition. A fourth property, the geographic position or environmental variation among land mosaics, also significantly affects the status of the fauna in many studies. Temporal persistence of species and turnover in assemblages in agricultural landscapes are also influenced by the structure of the land mosaic, but there are few long-term data sets that allow comparison of temporal changes with mosaic properties. There is great scope for further investigation of the properties of mosaics and the mechanisms by which they affect the conservation of biodiversity. This includes studies of responses from a wider range of biota (in addition to birds), investigation of spatial scale effects on faunal responses, temporal responses of the fauna to change in mosaic structure (and potential time-lags in response), and the effects of variation in mosaic structure on population demography and ecological processes.

AB Tremendous strides have been made regarding our understanding of how host plant chemistry influences the interactions between herbivores and their natural enemies. While most work has focused on plant chemistry effects on host location by natural enemies, an increasing number of studies examine negative effects. The tritrophic role of plant chemistry is central to several aspects of trophic phenomena including top-down versus bottom-up control of herbivores, enemy-free space and host choice, and theories of plant defense. Furthermore, tritrophic effects of plant chemistry are important in assessing the degree of compatibility between biological control and plant resistance approaches to pest control. Additional research is needed to understand the physiological effects of plant chemistry on parasitoids. Explicit tests are required to determine whether natural enemies can act as selective forces on plant defense. Finally, further studies of natural systems are crucial to understanding the evolution of multitrophic relationships.

AB An essential requirement to determine a population's potential for evolutionary change is to quantify the amount of genetic variability expressed for traits under selection. Early investigations in laboratory conditions showed that the magnitude of the genetic and environmental components of phenotypic variation can change with environmental conditions. However, there is no consensus as to how the expression of genetic variation is sensitive to different environmental conditions. Recently, the study of quantitative genetics in the wild has been revitalized by new pedigree analyses based on restricted maximum likelihood, resulting in a number of studies investigating these questions in wild populations. Experimental manipulation of environmental quality in the wild, as well as the use of naturally occurring favourable or stressful environments, has broadened the treatment of different taxa and traits. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis on recent studies comparing heritability in favourable versus unfavourable conditions in non-domestic and non-laboratory animals. The results provide evidence for increased heritability in more favourable conditions, significantly so for morphometric traits but not for traits more closely related to fitness. We discuss how these results are explained by underlying changes in variance components, and how they represent a major step in our understanding of evolutionary processes in wild populations. We also show how these trends contrast with the prevailing view resulting mainly from laboratory experiments on Drosophila. Finally, we underline the importance of taking into account the environmental variation in models predicting quantitative trait evolution.

AB When predicting the effects of climate change, global carbon circulation models that include a positive feedback effect of climate warming on the carbon cycle often assume that ( 1) plant respiration increases exponentially with temperature ( with a constant Q(10)) and ( 2) that there is no acclimation of respiration to long-term changes in temperature. In this review, we show that these two assumptions are incorrect. While Q(10) does not respond systematically to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, other factors such as temperature, light, and water availability all have the potential to influence the temperature sensitivity of respiratory CO2 efflux. Roots and leaves can also differ in their Q(10) values, as can upper and lower canopy leaves. The consequences of such variable Q(10) values need to be fully explored in carbon modelling. Here, we consider the extent of variability in the degree of thermal acclimation of respiration, and discuss in detail the biochemical mechanisms underpinning this variability; the response of respiration to long-term changes in temperature is highly dependent on the effect of temperature on plant development, and on interactive effects of temperature and other abiotic factors ( e. g. irradiance, drought and nutrient availability). Rather than acclimating to the daily mean temperature, recent studies suggest that other components of the daily temperature regime can be important ( e. g. daily minimum and / or night temperature). In some cases, acclimation may simply reflect a passive response to changes in respiratory substrate availability, whereas in others acclimation may be critical in helping plants grow and survive at contrasting temperatures. We also consider the impact of acclimation on the balance between respiration and photosynthesis; although environmental factors such as water availability can alter the balance between these two processes, the available data suggests that temperature-mediated differences in dark leaf respiration are closely linked to concomitant differences in leaf photosynthesis. We conclude by highlighting the need for a greater process-based understanding of thermal acclimation of respiration if we are to successfully predict future ecosystem CO2 fluxes and potential feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

AB Vocal learning, the substrate for human language, is a rare trait found to date in only three distantly related groups of mammals (humans, bats, and cetaceans) and three distantly related groups of birds (parrots, hummingbirds, and songbirds). Brain pathways for vocal learning have been studied in the three bird groups and in humans. Here I present a hypothesis on the relationships and evolution of brain pathways for vocal learning among birds and humans. The three vocal learning bird groups each appear to have seven similar but not identical cerebral vocal nuclei distributed into two vocal pathways, one posterior and one anterior. Humans also appear to have a posterior vocal pathway, which includes projections from the face motor cortex to brainstem vocal lower motor neurons, and an anterior vocal pathway, which includes a strip of premotor cortex, the anterior basal ganglia, and the anterior thalamus. These vocal pathways are not found in vocal non-learning birds or mammals, but are similar to brain pathways used for other types of learning. Thus, I argue that if vocal learning evolved independently among birds and humans, then it did so under strong genetic constraints of a pre-existing basic neural network of the vertebrate brain.

AB Local Community structure and interactions have been shown to depend partly oil landscape context. In this paper we tested the hypothesis that the spatial scale experienced by all organism depends on its trophic level. We analyzed plant-herbivore and herbivore-parasitoid interactions in 15 agricultural landscapes differing in structural complexity using the rape pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), an important pest on oilseed rape (Brassica napus). and its parasitoids. In the very center of each landscape a patch of potted rape plants was placed in a grassy field margin strip for standardized measurement. Percent non-crop area of landscapes was negatively related to plant damage caused by herbivory and positively to the herbivores' larval mortality resulting from parasitism. In a geographic scale analysis, we quantified the structure of the 15 landscapes for eight circular sectors ranging from 0.5 to 6 kill diameter. Correlations between parasitism and non-crop areas as well as between herbivory and non-crop area were strongest at a scale of 1.5 kill, thereby not supporting the view that higher trophic levels experience the world at a larger spatial scale. However, the predictive power of non-crop area changed only slightly for herbivory, but greatly with respect to parasitism as scales from 0.5 to 1.5 kin and from 1.5 to 6 kill diameter increased. Furthermore, the effect of non-crop area tended to be stronger in parasitism than herbivory suggesting a greater effect of changes in landscape context oil parasitoids. This is in Support of the general idea that higher trophic levels Should be more Susceptible to disturbance.

AB The role of tropospheric ozone in altering plant growth and development has been the subject of thousands of publications over the last several decades. Still, there is limited understanding regarding the possible effects of ozone on soil processes. In this review, the effects of ozone are discussed using the flow of carbon from the atmosphere, through the plant to soils, and back to the atmosphere as a framework. A conceptual model based on carbohydrate signaling is used to illustrate physiological changes in response to ozone, and to discuss possible feedbacks that may occur. Despite past emphasis on above-ground effects, ozone has the potential to alter below-ground processes and hence ecosystem characteristics in ways that are not currently being considered.

AB Evolutionary ecology has developed along two major conceptual avenues, starting from the observation that hosts vary in their immune defence against parasites The first avenue, rooted in life-history theory, assumes fitness costs of immune defence and tradeoffs in the face of limited resources, rather than specific host-parasite interactions. The second avenue focuses on specific responses, especially those generated by genotype-genotype interaction between and within host and parasite species. Specificity in the interactions between hosts and parasites play a crucial role in the field but analysis is difficult. Here, we classify concepts about host-parasite interactions into these two families and discuss their reconciliation with the help of a defence component model and two-dimensional classification scheme of the individual components. This helps to clarify some of the confusing terminology and might guide further research in the field.

AB Costs of sexual traits are of central importance to the theory of sexual selection. To qualify as a cost in line with theoretical models, empirical studies must demonstrate that sexual traits cause negative effects on one component of fitness of the trait bearer. Moreover, it must be demonstrated that the costs are differential such that negative effects on fitness are more severe for individuals in poor condition than for individuals in good condition. However, in the current literature, there is confusion over what qualifies as a cost, and costs are often anticipated based on findings of increased expenditure. Consequently, it seems that the generally accepted notion that sexual traits are costly is in fact based almost exclusively on indirect evidence and that direct empirical evidence is very scarce.

AB Natural hybridization threatens a substantial number of plant and animal species with extinction, but extinction risk bas been difficult to evaluate in the absence of a quantitative assessment of risk factors. We investigated a number of ecological parameters likely to affect extinction risk, through an individual-based model simulating the life cycle of two hybridizing annual plant species. All parameters tested, ranging from population size to variance in pollen-tube growth rates, affected extinction risk. The sensitivity of each parameter varied dramatically across parameter sets, but, overall, the competitive ability, initial frequency, and selfing rate of the native taxon had the strongest effect on extinction. In addition, prezygotic reproductive barriers bad a stronger influence on extinction rates than did postzygotic barriers. A stable hybrid zone was possible only when habitat differentiation was included In the model. When there was no habitat differentiation, either one of the parental species or the hybrids eventually displaced the other two taxa. Tbe simulations demonstrated that hybridization is perhaps the most rapidly acting genetic threat to endangered species, with extinction often taking place in less than five generations. The simulation model was also applied to naturally hybridizing species pairs for which considerable genetic and ecological information is available. The predictions from these "worked examples" are in close agreement with observed outcomes and further suggest that an endemic coragrass species is threatened by hybridization. These simulations provide guidance concerning the kinds of data required to evaluate extinction risk and possible conservation strategies.

AB The host specificity, taxonomic composition and feeding guild of rare species were studied in communities of herbivorous insects in New Guinea. Leaf-chewing and sap-sucking insects (Orthoptera, Phasmatodea, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Hemiptera-Auchenorrhyncha) were sampled from 30 species of trees and shrubs (15 spp. of Ficus, Moraceae, six spp. of Macaranga and nine species of other Euphorbiaceae) in a lowland rain forest. Feeding trials were performed with all leaf-chewers in order to exclude transient species. Overall, the sampling produced 80062 individuals of 1050 species. The species accumulation curve did not attain an asymptote, despite 950 person-days of sampling. Rare species, defined as those found as single individuals, remained numerous even in large samples and after the exclusion of transient: non-feeding species. There was no difference among plant species in the proportion of rare species in their herbivore communities, which was, on average, 45%. Likewise, various herbivore guilds and laxa had ail very similar proportions of rare and common species. There was also no difference between rare and common species in their host specificity. Both highly specialised species and generalists, feeding on numerous plants, contributed to the singleton records on particular plant species. predominantly, a species was rare on a particular host whilst more common on other, often related, host species, or relatively rare on numerous other host plants, so that its aggregate population was high. Both cases are an example of the "mass effect", since it is probable that such rare species were dependent on a constant influx of immigrants from the other host plants. These other plants were found particularly often among congeneric plants, less so among confamilial plants from different genera and least frequently among plants from different families. There were also 278 very rare species, found as one individual on a single plant species, only. Their host specificity could not be assessed; they might have been either very rare specialists, or species feeding also on other plants, those that were not studied. The former possibility is unlikely since monophagous species, collected as singletons at the present sampling effort, would have existed at an extremely low population density less than 1 individual per 10 ha of the forest.

AB Because the quantity, quality, and heterogeneity of resources should affect the diversity of consumers, plant productivity, plant composition, and plant diversity may influence the diversity of trophic levels higher up the food chain ("bottom-up" control of diversity). Increasing plant productivity may increase herbivore diversity by: increasing the abundance of rare resources ("resource rarity hypothesis"), increasing herbivore abundance and local persistence ("consumer rarity hypothesis") or increasing intraspecific density dependence ("density dependence hypothesis"). Increasing plant diversity may increase the diversity of herbivores because herbivores specialized on these new plant species can persist locally. Increasing the diversity of herbivores could likewise increase the diversity of predators and parasites, although parasite and predator diversity may also respond directly to changes in vegetation. Here I use data from a well-replicated grassland experiment at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, to analyze the responses of arthropod diversity to independent manipulations of (1) plant productivity and (2) plant diversity and composition. Long-term nitrogen addition ("historical treatment") decreased plant diversity and favored C-3 grasses. Short-term nitrogen addition ("modern treatment") increased plant productivity without appreciably changing plant diversity or plant composition. Arthropods were sampled using both sweep nets and vacuum samplers.
   Total arthropod species richness and abundance, as well as species richness and abundance of every trophic group (detritivores, herbivores, parasites, and predators), were significantly greater in plots with higher levels of modern fertilization and greater plant productivity. Path analysis supported the consumer rarity hypothesis, because modern fertilization increased herbivore species richness only indirectly by increasing herbivore abundance. Surprisingly, higher levels of historical fertilization that lowered plant species richness (but did not change plant productivity) significantly increased total arthropod species richness, did not affect detritivore or herbivore species richness, and significantly increased parasite and predator species richness. Direct and indirect effects of historical fertilization on the species richness of trophic groups were separated statistically using block regression chain modeling. Herbivore species richness was decreased through the direct pathway, but this was offset through indirect effects so that there was no overall response to historical fertilization. In plots with low plant diversity, similar numbers of herbivore species supported a greater diversity of parasites and predators. These results suggest that the diversity and composition of plants control the diversity of consumers not only directly by determining available resources, but also indirectly by influencing the interactions between herbivores and their parasites and predators.

AB The "Weak Garden of Eden" model for the origin and dispersal of modern humans (Harpending et al., 1993) posits that modern humans spread into separate regions from a restricted source, around 100 ka (thousand years ago), then passed through population bottlenecks. Around 50 ka, dramatic growth occurred within dispersed populations that were genetically isolated from each other. Population growth began earliest in Africa and later in Eurasia and is hypothesized to have been caused by the invention and spread of a more efficient Later Stone Age/Upper Paleolithic technology, which developed in equatorial Africa.
   Climatic and geological evidence suggest an alternative hypothesis for Late Pleistocene population bottlenecks and releases. The last glacial period was preceded by one thousand years of the coldest temperatures of the Later Pleistocene (similar to 71-70 ka), apparently caused by the eruption of Toba, Sumatra. Toba was the largest known explosive eruption of the Quaternary. Toba's volcanic winter could have decimated most modern human populations, especially outside of isolated tropical refugia. Release from the bottleneck could have occurred either at the end of this hypercold phase, or 10,000 years later, at the transition from cold oxygen isotope stage 4 to warmer stage 3. The largest populations surviving through the bottleneck should have been found in the largest tropical refugia, and thus in equatorial Africa. High genetic diversity in modern Africans may thus reflect a less severe bottleneck rather than earlier population growth.
   Volcanic winter may have reduced populations to levels low enough for founder effects, genetic draft and local adaptations to produce rapid population differentiation. If Toba caused the bottle necks, then modem human races may have differentiated abruptly, only 70 thousand years ago. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB To evaluate which qualities of dead wood have the highest conservational value for invertebrates, substrate requirements were recorded for all 542 saproxylic (wood-living) red-listed invertebrates in Sweden. Preferred qualities of dead trees were described for each species in seven category variables: tree species, stage of decay, type of main stem, coarseness of stem, part of tree, light preference and microhabitat. For each duality we quantified the number of red-listed insect species using it and the number that are specific to the quality. The number of species associated with different tree genera ranged from five to 202. Species-rich genera had a higher proportion of monophagous species. To what extent different tree genera have faunas complementary to each other was also analysed. As the wood decays, the host range broadens and the flora of decay fungi will probably take over as the most important factor determining the saproxylic fauna. Because there are many different types of rot required by different invertebrates, an abundance of similar looking dead trees, logs and snags are probably needed. Some 59% of the invertebrate species can live in sun-exposed sites. Most of these are favoured when the forest burns and at least 29 of them are more strongly associated with fires. For the former category, leaving dead wood on clear cuts should be an effective way to increase the amount of breeding substrate. However, some species, especially those living in the last successional stages, are dependent on shaded sites. Hollow tree trunks are another important microhabitat; 64 of the 107 species living there are specialists. To maintain all saproxylic species we need a diversity of substrate types and management methods. Our data can help to decide how to optimize the conservation measures taken during forest operations.

AB Interest in the evolution of female mating preferences has increased greatly in recent years, and numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain how mating preferences evolve. Despite this interest, little is known about how selection acts on mating preferences in natural populations. One reason for this lack of information may be that experimental designs commonly used for testing female preferences make it difficult to quantify the preferences of individual females. Most commonly used designs share three features: they examine the preferences of populations of females, they test female responses when they are presented simultaneously with two stimuli, and they infer information on female preferences by observing female choices between alternative stimuli. Population-level choice tests, in which each female is tested only once with a set of stimuli, do not evaluate within-female variation in preference, which is necessary to document between-female variation in I,reference. Two-stimulus designs test only for directional preferences if female responses are tested with only a single pair of stimuli. In addition, dichotomous scoring of female responses makes detection of between-female variation in preference difficult. Simultaneous stimulus presentations can confound female preference and female sampling behaviour. An alternative method to assess female preferences is to measure repeatedly the preference functions of individual females using a single-stimulus design. The shape of a female's preference function indicates how a female's mating response varies with male trait value, and repeated measures of individual preference functions allow measurement of within-and between-female variation in preferences.

AB The interrelationships among development time, growth rate, and adult size are investigated using simple optimization models of a seasonal life history in which larger adults have greater reproductive output. Unlike most previous studies, our models assume that growth rate is an adaptively flexible character that can be increased at the expense of a greater juvenile mortality rate. Three components of fitness are considered: the cost of developing at a suboptimal time of the year, the reproductive advantage of larger adult size, and the increased mortality from rapid juvenile growth. The study focuses on the optimal responses of size, development time, and growth rate to changes in the amount of time available for completion of the life cycle. The models show that the optimal growth rate and size at maturity may respond in several different ways. Perhaps the most likely effect is that growth becomes faster and size smaller with less time available. It is also possible, however, for either growth rate or size (but not both) to stay constant; in other cases, less time available leads to slower growth or larger size. The effects of increased mortality on the juvenile stage are also explored; here, the optimal size is likely to decrease, but growth rate and development time may increase or decrease.

AB A direct algorithm is described to reconstruct on a phylogenetic tree the ancestral states of a continuous-valued character, using a parsimony criterion that minimizes the sum of squared changes along the branches.  It is shown that when the squared changes are inversely weighted by the lengths of the branches, the squared-change parsimony reconstruction is that which has maximum posterior probability under a Brownian motion model of evolution.  The squared-change parsimony estimates are also closely related to the contrasts in Felsenstein's test of character correlation.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) anchors global terrestrial productivity and food and fiber supply. SOM retains water and soil nutrients and stores more global carbon than do plants and the atmosphere combined. SOM is also decomposed by microbes, returning CO2, a greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, soil carbon stocks have been widely lost or degraded through land use changes and unsustainable forest and agricultural practices. To understand its structure and function and to maintain and restore SOM, we need a better appreciation of soil organic carbon (SOC) saturation capacity and the retention of above-and belowground inputs in SOM. Our analysis suggests root inputs are approximately five times more likely than an equivalent mass of aboveground litter to be stabilized as SOM. Microbes, particularly fungi and bacteria, and soil faunal food webs strongly influence SOM decomposition at shallower depths, whereas mineral associations drive stabilization at depths greater than similar to 30 cm. Global uncertainties in the amounts and locations of SOM include the extent of wetland, peatland, and permafrost systems and factors that constrain soil depths, such as shallow bedrock. In consideration of these uncertainties, we estimate global SOC stocks at depths of 2 and 3 m to be between 2,270 and 2,770 Pg, respectively, but could be as much as 700 Pg smaller. Sedimentary deposits deeper than 3 m likely contain >500 Pg of additional SOC. Soils hold the largest biogeochemically active terrestrial carbon pool on Earth and are critical for stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Nonetheless, global pressures on soils continue from changes in land management, including the need for increasing bioenergy and food production.

AB The symbiosis between reef-building corals and their algal endosymbionts (zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium) is highly sensitive to temperature stress, which makes coral reefs vulnerable to climate change. Thermal tolerance in corals is known to be substantially linked to the type of zooxanthellae they harbour and, when multiple types are present, the relative abundance of types can be experimentally manipulated to increase the thermal limits of individual corals. Although the potential exists for this to translate into substantial thermal acclimatization of coral communities, to date there is no evidence to show that this takes place under natural conditions. In this study, we show field evidence of a dramatic change in the symbiont community of Acropora millepora, a common and widespread Indo-Pacific hard coral species, after a natural bleaching event in early 2006 in the Keppel Islands (Great Barrier Reef). Before bleaching, 93.5% (n=460) of the randomly sampled and tagged colonies predominantly harboured the thermally sensitive Symbiodinium type C2, while the remainder harboured a tolerant Symbiodinium type belonging to clade D or mixtures of C2 and D. After bleaching, 71% of the surviving tagged colonies that were initially C2 predominant changed to D or C1 predominance. Colonies that were originally C2 predominant suffered high mortality (37%) compared with D-predominant colonies (8%). We estimate that just over 18% of the original A. millepora population survived unchanged leaving 29% of the population C2 and 71% D or C1 predominant six months after the bleaching event. This change in the symbiont community structure, while it persists, is likely to have substantially increased the thermal tolerance of this coral population. Understanding the processes that underpin the temporal changes in symbiont communities is key to assessing the acclimatization potential of reef corals.

AB Understanding the mechanisms by which normative species successfully invade new regions and the consequences for native fauna is a pressing ecological issue, and one for which niche theory can play an important role. In this paper, we quantify a comprehensive suite of morphological, behavioral, physiological, trophic, and life-history traits for the entire fish species pool in the Colorado River Basin to explore a number of hypotheses regarding linkages between human-induced environmental change, the creation and modification of ecological niche opportunities, and subsequent invasion and extirpation of species over the past 150 years. Specifically, we use the fish life-history model of. K. O. Winemiller and K. A. Rose to quantitatively evaluate how the rates of normative species spread and native species range contraction reflect the interplay between overlapping life-history strategies and an anthropogenically altered adaptive landscape. Our results reveal a number of intriguing findings. First, normative species are located throughout the adaptive surface defined by the life-history attributes, and they surround the ecological niche volume represented by the native fish species pool. Second, native species that show the greatest distributional declines are separated into those exhibiting strong life-history overlap with normative species (evidence for biotic interactions) and those having a periodic strategy that is not well adapted to present-day modified environmental conditions. Third, rapidly spreading normative fishes generally occupy "vacant" niche positions in life-history space, which is associated either with "niche opportunities" provided by human-created environmental conditions (consistent with the environmental-resistance hypothesis of invasion) or with minimal overlap with. native life-history strategies (consistent with the biotic-resistance hypothesis). This study is the first to identify specific life-history strategies that are associated with extensive range reduction of native species and expansion of normative species, and it highlights the utility of using niche and life-history perspectives to evaluate different mechanisms that contribute to the patterns of fish invasions and extirpations in the American Southwest.

AB The peptides of the tachykinin family are widely distributed within the mammalian peripheral and central nervous systems and play a well-recognized role as excitatory neurotransmitters. Currently, the concept that tachykinins act exclusively as neuropeptides is being challenged, since the best known members of the family, substance P, neurokinin A and neurokinin B, are also present in non-neuronal cells and in non-innervated tissues. Moreover, the recently cloned mammalian tachykinins hemokinin-1 and endokinins are primarily expressed in non-neuronal cells, suggesting a widespread distribution and important role for these peptides as intercellular signaling molecules. The biological actions of tachykinins are mediated through three types of receptors denoted NK1, NK2 and NK3 that belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. The identification of additional tachykinins. has reopened the debate of whether more tachykinin receptors exist. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of tachykinins and their receptors. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic studies in endangered species have become widespread in the past decade, and with new information from various genome projects, new applications and insights are forthcoming. Generally, neutral variants are used for conservation applications, and when combined with highly variable loci and/or many more markers, these approaches should become much more informative. Conservation genetics is also concerned with detrimental and adaptive variation, which are more difficult to identify and characterize; however, the ability to predict the extent of such variation might become more successful and applied in future conservation efforts. Neutral variants might be used to identify adaptive variants, but the overlay of different mutational processes and selective regimes suggests that extreme caution should be used in making such identifications.

AB The relationship between photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and leaf nitrogen concentration (N) among all C-3 species can be described roughly with one general equation, yet within that overall pattern species groups or individual species may have markedly different A(max)-N relationships. To determine whether one or several predictive, fundamental A(max)-N relationships exist for temperate trees we measured A(max) specific leaf area (SLA) and N in 22 broad-leaved deciduous and 9 needle-leaved evergreen tree species in Wisconsin, United States. For broad-leaved deciduous trees, mass-based A(max) was highly correlated with leaf N (r(2)=0.75, P<0.001). For evergreen conifers, mass-based A(max) was also correlated with leaf N (r(2)=0.59, P<0.001) and the slope of the regression (rate of increase of A(max) per unit increase in N) was lower (P<0.001) by two-thirds than in the broad-leaved species (1.9 vs. 6.4 mu mol CO2 g(-1) N s(-1)), consistent with predictions based on tropical rain forest trees of short vs. long leaf Life-span. On an area basis, there was a strong A(max)-N correlation among de ciduous species (r(2)=0.78, P<0.001) and no correlation (r(2)=0.03, P>0.25) in the evergreen conifers. Compared to deciduous trees at a common leaf N (mass or area basis), evergreen trees had lower A(max) and SLA. For all data pooled, both leaf N and A(max) on a mass basis were correlated (r(2)=0.6) with SLA; in contrast, area-based leaf N scaled tightly with SLA (r(2)=0.81), but area-based A(max) did not (r(2)=0.06) because of low A(max) per unit N in the evergreen conifers. Multiple regression analysis of all data pooled showed that both N (mass or area basis) and SLA were significantly (P<0.001) related to A(max) on mass (r(2)=0.80) and area (r(2)=0.55) bases, respectively. These results provide further evidence that A(max)-N relationships are fundamentally different for ecologically distinct species groups with differing suites of foliage characteristics: species with long leaf life-spans and low SLA, whether broad-leaved or needle-leaved, tend to have lower A(max) per unit leaf N and a lower slope and higher intercept of the A(max)-N relation than do species with shorter leaf life-span and higher SLA. A single global A(max)-N equation overestimates and underestimates A(max) for temperate trees at the upper and lower end of their leaf N range, respectively. Users of A(max)-N relationships in modeling photosynthesis in different ecosystems should appreciate the strengths and limitations of regression equations based on different species groupings.

AB Our aim was to study the phylogenetic relationships of all known papillomaviruses (PVs) and the possibility of establishing a supratype taxonomic classification based on this information. Of the many detectably homologous segments present in PV genomes, a 291-bp segment of the L1 gene is notable because it is flanked by the MY09 and MY11 consensus primers and contains highly conserved amino acid residues which simplify sequence alignment. We determined the MY09-MY11 sequences of human PV type 20 (HPV-20), HPV-21, HPV-22, HPV-23, HPV-24, HPV-36, HPV-37, HPV-38, HPV-48, HPV-50, HPV-60, HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, ovine (sheep) PV, bovine PV type 3 (BPV-3), BPV-5, and BPV-6 and created a database which now encompasses HPV-1 to HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, seven yet untyped HPV genomes, and 15 animal PV types. Three additional animal PVs were analyzed on the basis of other sequence data. We constructed phylogenies based on partial L1 and E6 gene sequences and distinguished five major clades that we call supergroups. One of them unites 54 genital PV types, which can be further divided into eleven groups. The second supergroup has 24 types and unites most PVs that are typically found in epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients but also includes several types typical of other cutaneous lesions, like HPV-4. The third supergroup unites the six known ungulate fibropapillomaviruses, the fourth includes the cutaneous ungulate PVs BPV-3, BPV-4, and BPV-6 and the fifth includes HPV-1, HPV-41, HPV-63, the canine oral PV, and the cottontail rabbit PV. The chaffinch PV and two rodent PVs, Micromys minutus PV and Mastomys natalensis PV, are left ungrouped because of the relative isolation of each of their lineages. Within most supergroups, groups formed on the basis of cladistic principles unite phenotypically similar PV types. We discuss the basis of our classification, the concept of the PV type, speciation, PV-host evolution, and estimates of their rates of evolution.

AB Taxonomic congruence and total evidence are competing paradigms in phylogenetic inference. Taxonomic congruence focuses on deriving a consensus from the results obtained from separately analyzed data sets, whereas total evidence uses character congruence in the search for the best-fitting hypothesis for all of the available character evidence. Explicit or implicit use of taxonomic congruence is usually employed when an investigator either has both molecular and morphological data sets or has different gene-, rRNA-, or protein-sequence data sets available. Indeed, a taxonomic congruence rationale is frequently used as the basis for exploring classes of data, thus allowing comparison between the phylogenetic signal emerging from a particular data set and those of other such classes. Problematic aspects of employing the taxonomic congruence approach include the potentially misleading and arbitrary choices of both a consensus method and the division of characters into subsets. If the goal of an analysis is to provide the best estimate of genealogy afforded by the available character evidence, then taxonomic congruence is substantially more arbitrary than a total evidence approach. The theoretical advantages of phylogenetic estimates based on total evidence are argued in the present study and are illustrated with an example of amniote relationships. We report conflicting results from total evidence and taxonomic congruence approaches, with analyses of previously reported data from both fossil and living amniotes and from bath morphology and molecules, the latter including available 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and protein sequences. We conclude that a more highly resolved and robust phylogenetic hypothesis of amniotes, the traditional one, emerges when a total evidence approach is employed.

AB We conducted two experiments to determine the relative effects of herbivory and nutrients on an algal community in Walker Branch, a stream having effectively two trophic levels: primary producers and herbivorous snails. The first study (I 989), performed in streamside channels, tested the effects of three factors: (1) stream water nitrogen (N), (2) phosphorus (P), and (3) snail grazing, on periphyton biomass, productivity, and community composition. The second study (I 990), conducted in situ, tested the effects of snail grazing and nutrients (N + P). In the 1989 study, nutrients had positive effects, and herbivores had negative effects, on algal biomass (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass, total algal biovolume) and primary productivity (area- and chlorophyll-specific). Likewise, both nutrients and snail grazing exerted effects (+ and -, respectively) on biomass measured in the 1990 study (chlorophyll a, algal biovolume). Grazed communities were dominated by chlorophytes and cyanophytes, which were overgrown by diatoms when herbivores were removed. Algal species that were reduced most by herbivores were increased most by nutrient addition, and vice versa, suggesting a trade-off between resistance to herbivory and nutrient-saturated growth rates. Increases in algal biomass and productivity were slight with the addition of either N or P compared to responses observed when both nutrients were added together, suggesting that both nutrients were at growth-limiting levels. The greatest changes in periphyton structure or function were observed when both nutrients were added and simultaneously, grazers were removed, in contrast to lesser effects when nutrients were added under grazed conditions or grazers were removed at low nutrient levels, indicating dual control by both factors. Nutrient addition also positively affected snail growth in both experiments, indicating tight coupling between herbivore and algal growth (top-down effects) and that bottom-up factors that directly affected plant growth could also indirectly affect consumers belonging to higher trophic levels. Indices quantifying the direct effects of top-down factors relative to bottom-up factors (top-down index, TDI) and the importance of interactions between these factors (interaction coefficient, IC) were computed. These indices showed that the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up factors varied among biomass and productivity parameters and that top-down and bottom-up effects, alone, were less important than their combined effects.

AB (1) Competitive ability can be compared between species in two ways: effect of different neighbour species on performance of a single target species or response of different target species to a single neighbour species. In a 5-week glasshouse experiment, an additive design was used for all combinations of seven species as both target and neighbour species to determine if there were consistent hierarchies in competitive effect and/or response, what traits of individuals determined position in these hierarchies, and whether or not effect and response competitive ability were related during the early stages of competition. (2) Five weeks after sowing, significant non-linear regressions of target biomass on neighbour density were found for 59% of the forty-nine species combinations and significant linear regressions on neighbour biomass were found for 51% of the species combinations. The slopes of these regressions represent per-plant and per-gram competition coefficients, respectively. (3) Neighbour species differed strongly in competitive effect per plant. Differences in effect per gram, response per plant, and response per gram were much weaker. Nevertheless, consistent competitive hierarchies were found for both effect and response on both a per-plant and per-gram basis. (4) Different traits determined position in the effect and response hierarchies. Neighbour species with larger seed mass and larger maximum potential mass had stronger per-plant competitive effects, whilst neighbour species with higher maximum relative growth rates had stronger per-gram competitive effects. The reverse of this latter pattern was seen for competitive response: target species with lower maximum relative growth rates were better response competitors. Mean effect and response competitive ability of the seven species were uncorrelated with each other. (5) These differences in traits associated with strong effect and strong response competitive ability emphasize the importance of distinguishing between them in experimental studies, at least during the early stages of competition.

AB Abstract
   To manage and conserve biodiversity, one must know what is being lost, where, and why, as well as which remedies are likely to be most effective. Metabarcoding technology can characterise the species compositions of mass samples of eukaryotes or of environmental DNA. Here, we validate metabarcoding by testing it against three high-quality standard data sets that were collected in Malaysia (tropical), China (subtropical) and the United Kingdom (temperate) and that comprised 55,813 arthropod and bird specimens identified to species level with the expenditure of 2,505 person-hours of taxonomic expertise. The metabarcode and standard data sets exhibit statistically correlated alpha- and beta-diversities, and the two data sets produce similar policy conclusions for two conservation applications: restoration ecology and systematic conservation planning. Compared with standard biodiversity data sets, metabarcoded samples are taxonomically more comprehensive, many times quicker to produce, less reliant on taxonomic expertise and auditable by third parties, which is essential for dispute resolution.

AB Despite decades of work on climate change biology, the scientific community remains uncertain about where and when most species distributions will respond to altered climates. A major barrier is the spatial mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected and modeled. Using a meta-analysis of published literature, we show that grid lengths in species distribution models are, on average, ca. 10000-fold larger than the animals they study, and ca. 1000-fold larger than the plants they study. And the gap is even worse than these ratios indicate, as most work has focused on organisms that are significantly biased toward large size. This mismatch is problematic because organisms do not experience climate on coarse scales. Rather, they live in microclimates, which can be highly heterogeneous and strongly divergent from surrounding macroclimates. Bridging the spatial gap should be a high priority for research and will require gathering climate data at finer scales, developing better methods for downscaling environmental data to microclimates, and improving our statistical understanding of variation at finer scales. Interdisciplinary collaborations (including ecologists, engineers, climatologists, meteorologists, statisticians, and geographers) will be key to bridging the gap, and ultimately to providing scientifically grounded data and recommendations to conservation biologists and policy makers.

AB Genetic diversity provides the basic substrate for evolution, yet few studies assess the impacts of global climate change (GCC) on intraspecific genetic variation. In this review, we highlight the importance of incorporating neutral and non-neutral genetic diversity when assessing the impacts of GCC, for example, in studies that aim to predict the future distribution and fate of a species or ecological community. Specifically, we address the following questions: Why study the effects of GCC on intraspecific genetic diversity? How does GCC affect genetic diversity? How is the effect of GCC on genetic diversity currently studied? Where is potential for future research? For each of these questions, we provide a general background and highlight case studies across the animal, plant and microbial kingdoms. We further discuss how cryptic diversity can affect GCC assessments, how genetic diversity can be integrated into studies that aim to predict species' responses on GCC and how conservation efforts related to GCC can incorporate and profit from inclusion of genetic diversity assessments. We argue that studying the fate of intraspecifc genetic diversity is an indispensable and logical venture if we are to fully understand the consequences of GCC on biodiversity on all levels.

AB The extraordinary species richness and endemism of the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) exists in one of the most geologically dynamic regions of the planet. The provenance of its biota has been debated, particularly in the area known as Wallacea. Application of molecular genetic approaches and a better understanding of the region's complex geology have stimulated much recent biogeographic work in the IAA. We review molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in light of current geological evidence. Present distribution patterns of species have been shaped largely by pre-Pleistocene dispersal and vicariance events, whereas more recent changes in the connectivity of islands within the Archipelago have influenced the partitioning of intraspecific variation. Many genetic studies have uncovered cryptic species with restricted distributions. We discuss the conservation significance of the region and highlight the need for cross-taxon comparative studies using newly developed analytical approaches well suited to the challenges of historical inference in this region.

AB Species diversity and genetic diversity remain the nearly exclusive domains of community ecology and population genetics, respectively, despite repeated recognition in the literature over the past 30 years of close parallels between these two levels of diversity. Species diversity within communities and genetic diversity within populations are hypothesized to co-vary in space or time because of locality characteristics that influence the two levels of diversity via parallel processes, or because of direct effects of one level of diversity on the other via several different mechanisms. Here, we draw on a wide range of studies in ecology and evolution to examine the theoretical underpinnings of these hypotheses, review relevant empirical literature, and outline an agenda for future research. The plausibility of species diversity-genetic diversity relationships is supported by a variety of theoretical and empirical studies, and several recent studies provide direct, though preliminary support. Focusing on potential connections between species diversity and genetic diversity complements other approaches to synthesis at the ecology-evolution interface, and should contribute to conceptual unification of biodiversity research at the levels of genes and species.

AB The usefulness and relevance of size-based indicators (SBIs) to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are assessed through a review of empirical and modelling studies. SBIs are tabulated along with their definitions, data requirements, potential biases, availability of time-series, and expected directions of change in response to fishing pressure. They include mean length in a population, mean length in a community, mean maximum length in a community, and the slope and intercept of size spectra. Most SBIs can be derived from fairly standard survey data on length frequencies, without the need for elaborate models. Possible fishing- and environment-induced effects are analysed to distinguish between the two causes, and hypothetical cases of reference directions of change are tabulated. We conclude that no single SBI can serve as an effective overall indicator of heavy fishing pressure. Rather, suites of SBI should be selected, and reference directions may be more useful than reference points. Further modelling and worldwide comparative studies are needed to provide better understanding of SBIs and the factors affecting them. The slow response to fishing pressure reflects the complexity of community interactions and ecosystem responses, and prohibits their application in the context of short-term (annual) tactical fisheries management. However, movement towards longer-term (5-10 years) strategic management in EAF should facilitate their use. (c) 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Given the prevalence of duplicate genes and genomes in plant species, the study of their evolutionary dynamics has been a focus of study in plant evolutionary genetics over the past two decades. The past few years have been a particularly exciting time because recent theoretical and experimental investigations have led to a rethinking of the classic paradigm of duplicate gene evolution. By combining recent advances in genomic analysis with a new conceptual framework, researchers are determining the contributions of single-gene and whole-genome duplications to the diversification of plant species. This research provides insights into the roles that gene and genome duplications play in plant evolution.

AB There are approximately 25 000 species in the division Teleostei and most arc believed to have arisen during a relatively short period of time ca. 200 Myr ago. The discovery of 'extra' Hox gene clusters in zebrafish (Danio rerio), medaka (Oryzias latipes), and pufferfish (Fugu rubripes), has led to the hypothesis that genome duplication provided the genetic raw material necessary for the telcost radiation. We identified 27 groups of orthologous genes which included one gene from man, mouse and chicken, one or two genes from tetraploid Xenopus and two genes from zebrafish. A genome duplication in the ancestor of teleost fishes is the most parsimonious explanation for the observations that for 15 of these genes, the two zebrafish orthologues are sister sequences in phylogenies that otherwise match the expected organismal tree, the zebrafish gene pairs appear to have been formed at approximately the same time, and are unlinked. Phylogenies of nine genes differ a little from the tree predicted by the fish-specific genome duplication hypothesis: one tree shows a sister sequence relationship for the zebrafish genes but differs slightly from the expected organismal tree and in eight trees, one zebrafish gene is the sister sequence to a clade which includes the second zebrafish gene and orthologues from Xenopus, chicken, mouse and man. For these nine gene trees, deviations from the predictions of the fish-specific genome duplication hypothesis are poorly supported. The two zebrafish orthologues for each of the three remaining genes are tightly linked and are, therefore, unlikely to have been formed during a genome duplication event. We estimated that the unlinked duplicated zebrafish genes are between 300 and 450 Myr. Thus, genome duplication could have provided the genetic raw material for teleost radiation. Alternatively, the loss of different duplicates in different populations (i.e. 'divergent resolution') may have promoted speciation in ancient teleost populations.

AB 1. Range management is based on the response of plant species and communities to grazing intensity. The identification of easily measured plant functional traits that consistently predict grazing response in a wide spectrum of rangelands would be a major advance.
   2. Sets of species from temperate subhumid upland grasslands of Argentina and Israel, grazed by cattle, were analysed to find out whether: (i) plants with contrasting grazing responses differed in terms of easily measured vegetative and life-history traits; (ii) their grazing response could be predicted from those traits; (iii) these patterns differed between the two countries. Leaf mass, area, specific area (SLA) and toughness were measured on 83 Argentine and 19 Israeli species. Species were classified by grazing response (grazing-susceptible or grazing-resistant) and plant height (< or > 40 cm) as well as by life history (annual or perennial) and taxonomy (monocotyledon or dicotyledon).
   3. Similar plant traits were associated with a specific response to grazing in both Argentina and Israel. Grazing-resistant species were shorter in height, and had smaller, more tender, leaves, with higher SLA than grazing-susceptible species. Grazing resistance was associated with both avoidance traits (small height and leaf size) and tolerance traits (high SLA). Leaf toughness did not contribute to grazing resistance and may be related to selection for canopy dominance.
   4. Plant height was the best single predictor of grazing response, followed by leaf mass. The best prediction of species grazing response was achieved by combining plant height, life history and leaf mass. SLA was a comparatively poor predictor of grazing response.
   5. The ranges of plant traits, and some correlation patterns between them, differed markedly between species sets from Argentina and Israel. However, the significant relationships between plant traits and grazing response were maintained.
   6. The results of this exploratory study suggest that prediction of grazing responses on the basis of easily measured plant traits is feasible and consistent between similar grazing systems in different regions. The results challenge the precept that intense cattle grazing necessarily favours species with tough, unpalatable, leaves.

AB The single-copy RAG-1 gene is found throughout higher vertebrates and consists of a single 3.1-kb exon without intervening introns, A 2.9-kb region of the RAG-1 locus was sequenced for 14 basal taxa of birds plus the crocodylian outgroups Alligator and Gavialis. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences supported the hypothesis that the deepest evolutionary split in extant birds separates paleognaths from neognaths. A deep division among neognaths separates the chicken- and duck-like birds ("galloanserines") from a clade consisting of all other birds ("plethornithines"). The relationships of these three basal clades in Aves were supported by high bootstrap (98 to 100%) and large decay index values (above 14). Additionally, the plethornithine clade is characterized by a 15-bp (five-codon) synapomorphic deletion relative to all other birds, RAG-1 evolves slowly, with a number of properties favoring its phylogenetic utility, including rarity of indels, minimal saturation of transition changes at 3rd positions of codons, nearly constant base composition across taxa, and no asymmetry in directional patterns of reconstructed change. However, RAG-1 does not evolve in a clocklike manner, suggesting that this gene cannot easily be used for estimating ages of ancient lineages. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB 1 CO2 emissions in boreal peatlands were measured during two seasons on various mire site types representing different nutrient statuses and water tables. In order to examine the long term effects of water table draw-down on the CO2 fluxes, the sites also included 25-50-year-old drainages.
   2 On virgin sites the lowest CO2 fluxes were measured at ombrotrophic sites dominated by Sphagnum fuscum (78-127 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C, 60-200 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)) and the highest CO2 fluxes were at ombrotrophic sites with abundant understorey vegetation (183-259 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C, 290-340 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)).
   3 Lowering of the water table by 1 cm increased CO2 fluxes by an average of 7.1 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C and 9.5g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1). In some cases the effect of ditches on the water table, and correspondingly on CO2 fluxes, was small. However, effective draining caused approximate to 100% increase in CO2 fluxes. Drainages had higher CO2 fluxes compared with virgin subsites at the same temperature and water table.
   4 The effect of temperature on CO2 fluxes depended on the water table, the average Q(10) value being 2.9 with water tables of 0-20 cm and 2.0 with water tables below 20 cm.
   5 CO2 fluxes are compared with primary production figures, and peat carbon stores and the carbon balance in changing climate are discussed.

AB This article discusses two types of proposed relationships between resource productivity and the diversity of coexisting Consumer species. Monotonically increasing curves have recently been dismissed on both empirical and theoretical grounds, while unimodal (''hump-shaped'') curves have been supported. Unimodal curves have been attributed to increased competitive exclusion, usually as the result of decreased heterogeneity in limiting resources at high productivities. This article argues that: (1) there are many viable mechanisms that can produce monotonic curves in the presence of competition; (2) there is little empirical support for any of the major variants of the hypothesis that productivity decreases heterogeneity, which increases competitive exclusion; and (3) there are alternative reasons for unimodal curves, some or all of which are consistent with previously observed productivity-diversity relationships. Additional theoretical and empirical work is required to understand what relationships follow from different mechanisms of competition, and what relationships are most frequently observed under different observational protocols.

AB This article discusses how the presence of dynamic change in traits affecting interspecific interactions changes the ways in which interactions between species are distinguished, classified, and measured. The prevalence of models lacking any trait dynamics has led to methods of identifying and measuring indirect effects that are not valid when phenotypically or evolutionarily plastic traits affect interspecific interactions. When traits are dynamic, the number of links in a dynamic model can no longer be used to distinguish direct and indirect effects, and classifying interactions by a single sign denoting effect on equilibrium density becomes problematic. The presence of trait dynamics also changes the interpretation of manipulative experiments that have been used to measure indirect effects. Because both traits and population densities can transmit indirect effects, a given ordered series of species will often transmit several indirect effects, which may have opposite signs. Because some traits can change very rapidly, dynamic equations describing population growth rates may often include the densities of species that interact indirectly with the given species. Some of the conceptual problems in comparing magnitudes of direct and indirect effects are illustrated by simple models of a three-species food chain. Different methods of measuring effect magnitudes can give different conditions for when direct effects are larger than indirect effects. Other terminology related to indirect effects, including interaction modification and higher-order interaction, is critically discussed. Given the present paucity of information about trait dynamics, it may be premature to attempt to compare magnitudes of direct and indirect effects.

AB Spatially explicit population models are becoming increasingly useful tools for population ecologists, conservation biologists, and land managers. Models are spatially explicit when they combine a population simulator with a landscape map that describes the spatial distribution of landscape features. With this map, the locations of habitat patches, individuals, and other items of interest are explicitly incorporated into the model, and the effect of changing landscape features on population dynamics can be studied. In this paper we describe the structure of some spatially explicit models under development and provide examples of current and future research using these models. Spatially explicit models are important tools for investigating scale-related questions in population ecology, especially the response of organisms to habitat change occurring at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Simulation models that incorporate real-world landscapes, as portrayed by landscape maps created with geographic information systems, are also proving to be crucial in the development of management strategies in response to regional land-use and other global change processes. Spatially explicit population models will increase our ability to accurately model complex landscapes, and therefore should improve both basic ecological knowledge of landscape phenomena and applications of landscape ecology to conservation and management.

AB Connectivity is classically considered an emergent property of landscapes encapsulating individuals' flows across space. However, its operational use requires a precise understanding of why and how organisms disperse. Such movements, and hence landscape connectivity, will obviously vary according to both organism properties and landscape features. We review whether landscape connectivity estimates could gain in both precision and generality by incorporating three fundamental outcomes of dispersal theory. Firstly, dispersal is a multi-causal process; its restriction to an escape reaction' to environmental unsuitability is an oversimplification, as dispersing individuals can leave excellent quality habitat patches or stay in poor-quality habitats according to the relative costs and benefits of dispersal and philopatry. Secondly, species, populations and individuals do not always react similarly to those cues that trigger dispersal, which sometimes results in contrasting dispersal strategies. Finally, dispersal is a major component of fitness and is thus under strong selective pressures, which could generate rapid adaptations of dispersal strategies. Such evolutionary responses will entail spatiotemporal variation in landscape connectivity. We thus strongly recommend the use of genetic tools to: (i) assess gene flow intensity and direction among populations in a given landscape; and (ii) accurately estimate landscape features impacting gene flow, and hence landscape connectivity. Such approaches will provide the basic data for planning corridors or stepping stones aiming at (re)connecting local populations of a given species in a given landscape. This strategy is clearly species- and landscape-specific. But we suggest that the ecological network in a given landscape could be designed by stacking up such linkages designed for several species living in different ecosystems. This procedure relies on the use of umbrella species that are representative of other species living in the same ecosystem.

AB Community structure and ecosystem processes often vary along elevational gradients. Their responses to elevation are commonly driven by changes in temperature, and many community- and ecosystem-level variables therefore frequently respond similarly to elevation across contrasting gradients. There are also many exceptions, sometimes because other factors such as precipitation can also vary with elevation. Given this complexity, our capacity to predict when and why the same variable responds differently among disparate elevational gradients is often limited. Furthermore, there is utility in using elevational gradients for understanding community and ecosystem responses to global climate change at much larger spatial and temporal scales than is possible through conventional ecological experiments. However, future studies that integrate elevational gradient approaches with experimental manipulations will provide powerful information that can improve predictions of climate change impacts within and across ecosystems.

AB Most ecosystems are now sufficiently altered in structure and function to qualify as novel systems, and this recognition should be the starting point for ecosystem management efforts. Under the emerging biogeochemical configurations, management activities are experiments, blurring the line between basic and applied research. Responses to specific management manipulations are context specific, influenced by the current status or structure of the system, and this necessitates reference areas for management or restoration activities. Attempts to return systems to within their historical range of biotic and abiotic characteristics and processes may not be possible, and management activities directed at removing undesirable features of novel ecosystems may perpetuate or create such ecosystems. Management actions should attempt to maintain genetic and species diversity and encourage the biogeochemical characteristics that favor desirable species. Few resources currently exist to support the addition of proactive measures and rigorous experimental designs to current management activities. The necessary changes will not occur without strong input from stakeholders and policy makers, so rapid information transfer and proactive research-management activities by the scientific community are needed.

AB Genetic surveys reveal the diversity of bacteria and lead to the questioning of species concepts used to categorize bacteria. One difficulty in defining bacterial species arises from the high rates of recombination that results in the transfer of DNA between relatively distantly related bacteria. Barriers to this process, which could be used to define species naturally, are not apparent. Here, we review conceptual models of bacterial speciation and describe our computer simulations of speciation. Our findings suggest that the rate of recombination and its relation to genetic divergence have a strong influence on outcomes. We propose that a distinction be made between clonal divergence and sexual speciation. Hence, to make sense of bacterial diversity, we need data not only from genetic surveys but also from experimental determination of selection pressures and recombination rates and from theoretical models.

AB Data on the occurrence of species are widely used to inform the design of reserve networks. These data contain commission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be present) and omission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be absent), and the rates of the two types of error are inversely related. Point locality data can minimize commission errors, but those obtained from museum collections are generally sparse, suffer from substantial spatial bias and contain large omission errors. Geographic ranges generate large commission errors because they assume homogenous species distributions. Predicted distribution data make explicit inferences on species occurrence and their commission and omission errors depend on model structure, on the omission of variables that determine species distribution and on data resolution. Omission errors lead to identifying networks of areas for conservation action that are smaller than required and centred on known species occurrences, thus affecting the comprehensiveness, representativeness and efficiency of selected areas. Commission errors lead to selecting areas not relevant to conservation, thus affecting the representativeness and adequacy of reserve networks. Conservation plans should include an estimation of commission and omission errors in underlying species data and explicitly use this information to influence conservation planning outcomes.

AB 1 Root competition is defined as a reduction in the availability of a soil resource to roots that is caused by other roots. Resource availability to competitors can be affected through resource depletion (scramble competition) and by mechanisms that inhibit access of other roots to resources (contest competition, such as allelopathy).
   2 It has been proposed that soil heterogeneity can cause size-asymmetric root competition. Support for this hypothesis is limited and contradictory, possibly because resource uptake is affected more by the amount and spatial distribution of resource-acquiring organs, relative to the spatial distribution of resources, than by root system size per se.
   3 Root competition intensity between individual plants generally decreases as resource availability (but not necessarily habitat productivity) increases, but the importance of root competition relative to other factors that structure communities may increase with resource availability.
   4 Soil organisms play important, and often species-specific, roles in root interactions.
   5 The findings that some roots can detect other roots, or inert objects, before they are contacted and can distinguish between self and non-self roots create experimental challenges for those attempting to untangle the effects of self/non-self root recognition, self-inhibition and root segregation or proliferation in response to competition. Recent studies suggesting that root competition may represent a 'tragedy-of-the-commons' may have failed to account for this complexity.
   6 Theories about potential effects of root competition on plant diversity (and vice versa) appear to be ahead of the experimental evidence, with only one study documenting different effects of root competition on plant diversity under different levels of resource availability.
   7 Roots can interact with their biotic and abiotic environments using a large variety of often species-specific mechanisms, far beyond the traditional view that plants interact mainly through resource depletion. Research on root interactions between exotic invasives and native species holds great promise for a better understanding of the way in which root competition may affect community structure and plant diversity, and may create new insights into coevolution of plants, their competitors and the soil community.

   TROPICAL FOREST; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; CHALLENGES; BIRDS
AB Biodiversity conservation in forestry and agricultural landscapes is important because (1) reserves alone will not protect biodiversity; (2) commodity production relies on vital services provided by biodiversity; and (3) biodiversity enhances resilience, or a system's capacity to recover from external pressures such as droughts or management mistakes. We suggest ten guiding principles to help maintain biodiversity, ecosystem function, and resilience in production landscapes. Landscapes should include structurally characteristic patches of native vegetation, corridors and stepping stones between them, a structurally complex matrix, and buffers around sensitive areas. Management should maintain a diversity of species within and across functional groups. Highly focused management actions may be required to maintain keystone species and threatened species, and to control invasive species. These guiding principles provide a scientifically defensible starting point for the integration of conservation and production, which is urgently required from both an ecological and a long-term economic perspective.

AB At the Harvard Forest Long-term Ecological Research Site Chronic Nitrogen Amendment Study, a red pine and a mixed deciduous stand showed immediate changes in soil respiration following nitrogen additions (low N: 5 g N m(-2) per year; high N: 15 g N m(-2) per year) during the initial year (1988) of the study. In the hardwood stand, soil respiration rates increased after N additions in the first year (control: 482.0 g C m(-2) per year; high N: 596.5 g C m(-2) per year). This increase is attributed to increased productivity in the hardwood stand compared to the pine stand; N additions are hypothesized to have increased either root or microbial activity, or perhaps both. In the second year, however, respiration in the fertilized hardwood plots was not different from the control plot. In the pine stand, annual soil respiration was 21 and 25% lower, respectively, in low N and high N plots than the control (429.9 g C m(-2) per year), with further reductions in the second year.
   Weekly measures of soil respiration during summer 2001 showed that after 13 years of continuous nitrogen fertilization, soil respiration in the high N plots during growing season months was suppressed by 41% in both stands. To investigate the possibility that reduced microbial activity contributed to decreased total soil respiration, we incubated root-free soil and measured CO2 fluxes. The pattern in average respiration for incubated soils was similar to that observed from total soil respiration measured in the field. Laboratory respiration rates from the hardwood high N and pine high N soils were 43 and 64%, respectively, lower than rates from control soils. This indicates that nitrogen additions have reduced microbial activity and thus CO2 production in the field. Declines in forest productivity measured at both sites, as well as substantial tree mortality observed at the high N sites, may also lower root activity and rhizodeposition, and are also likely to reduce microbial decomposition by reducing organic matter available to soil microbes.

AB The potential effects of increased ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-320 nm) simulating stratospheric ozone depletion in field studies with vascular plants have previously been summarized only in narrative literature reviews. In this quantitative synthesis, we have assessed the significance of solar UV-B enhancement for ten commonly measured variables involving leaf pigmentation, plant growth and morphology, and photosynthesis using meta-analytic statistical methods. Of 103 papers published between 1976 and mid-1999 from field studies, more than 450 reports from 62 papers were included in the database. Effects of UV-B were most apparent for the case of UV-B-absorbing compounds with an average increase of approximately 10% across all studies when comparing the ambient solar UV-B control to the treatment (involving ambient UV-B plus a UV-B supplement from special UV lamps). Some morphological parameters such as plant height and leaf mass per area showed little or no response to enhanced UV-B. Leaf photosynthetic processes (leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence) and the concentration of photosynthetic pigments (total chlorophylls and carotenoids) were also not affected. Shoot biomass and leaf area showed modest decreases under UV-B enhancement. The reduction in shoot biomass occurred only under very high levels of simulated ozone depletion and leaf area was affected only when studies inappropriately used the plant (i.e., the subreplicate) rather than the plot as the experimental replicate. To the best of our knowledge, this review provides the first quantitative estimates of UV-B effects in field-based studies using all suitable published studies as a database.

AB The Rab/Ypt/Sec4 family forms the largest branch of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, acting as essential regulators of vesicular transport pathways. We used the large amount of information in the databases to analyse the mammalian Rab family. We defined Rab-conserved sequences that we designate Rab family (RabF) motifs using the conserved PM and G motifs as "landmarks". The Rab-specific regions were used to identify new Rab proteins in the databases and suggest rules for nomenclature. Surprisingly, we find that RabF regions cluster in and around switch I and switch II regions, i.e. the regions that change conformation upon GDP or GTP binding. This finding suggests that specificity of Rab-effector interaction cannot be conferred solely through the switch regions as is usually inferred. Instead, we propose a model whereby an effector binds to RabF (switch) regions to discriminate between nucleotide-bound states and simultaneously to other regions that confer specificity to the interaction, possibly Rab subfamily (RabSF) specific regions that we also define here. We discuss structural and functional data that support this model and its general applicability to the Ras superfamily of proteins. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB In this paper, we review the role of fish populations in generating ecosystem services based on documented ecological functions and human demands of fish. The ongoing overexploitation of global fish resources concerns our societies, not only in terms of decreasing fish populations important for consumption and recreational activities. Rather, a number of ecosystem services generated by fish populations are also at risk, with consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and ultimately human welfare. Examples are provided from marine and freshwater ecosystems, in various parts of the world, and include all life-stages of fish. Ecosystem services are here defined as fundamental services for maintaining ecosystem functioning and resilience, or demand-derived services based on human values. To secure the generation of ecosystem services from fish populations, management approaches need to address the fact that fish are embedded in ecosystems and that substitutions for declining populations and habitat losses, such as fish stocking and nature reserves, rarely replace losses of all services.

AB Interspecific competition in natural plant communities is highly dependent on nutrient availability. At high levels of nutrient availability, competition is mainly for light, As light is a unidirectional resource, high-nutrient habitats are dominated by fast-growing perennials with a tall stature and a rather uniform vertical distribution of leaf area. Moreover, these species have high turnover rates of leaves and roots and a high morphological plasticity during the differentiation of leaves. There is less consensus, however, about the importance and intensity of interspecific competition in nutrient-poor environments. It is argued that selection in nutrient-poor habitats is not necessarily on a high competitive ability for nutrients and a high growth rate, but rather on traits which reduce nutrient losses (low tissue nutrient concentrations, slow tissue turnover rates, high nutrient resorption efficiency), Due to evolutionary trade-offs plants can not maximize both growth rate and nutrient retention. Thus, the low growth rate of species from nutrient-poor habitats should be considered as the consequence of nutrient retention rather than as a feature on which direct selection takes place. The contrasting traits of species from nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich habitats mutually exclude them from each others' habitats. Moreover, these traits have severe consequences for litter decomposability and thereby also for nutrient cycling. This leads both in nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich habitats to a positive feedback between plant species dominance and nutrient availability, thereby promoting ecosystem stability.

AB The identification and risk assessment of potential biological invaders would provide valuable criteria for the allocation of resources toward the detection and control of invasion threats. Yet, freshwater biologists have made few attempts at predicting potential invaders, apparently because such efforts are perceived to be costly and futile. We describe some simple, low-cost empirical approaches that would facilitate prediction and demonstrate their use in identifying high-risk species from an important donor region: the Ponto-Caspian (Black, Caspian, and Azov seas) basin. This region is the source of several freshwater organisms already invading North America, including the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis), ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Based on a thorough literature review, we identify 17 additional Ponto-Caspian animals that have recent invasion histories and are likely to be transported overseas in ship ballast water; moreover, their broad salinity tolerance could allow them to survive an incomplete ballast-water exchange. These results suggest that, unless current vectors are more effectively controlled, the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River system and other North American inland waterways will continue to receive and be impacted by invasive Eurasian species.

   HISTORY; AREA
AB Restoration ecologists use reference information to define restoration goals, determine the restoration potential of sites, and evaluate the success of restoration efforts. Basic to the selection and use of reference information is the need to understand temporal and spatial variation in nature. This is a challenging task: variation is likely to be scale dependent; ecosystems vary in complex ways at several spatial and temporal scales; and there is an important interaction between spatial and temporal variation. The two most common forms of reference information are historical data from the site to be restored and contemporary data from reference sites (sites chosen as good analogs of the site to be restored). Among the problems of historical data are unmeasured factors that confound the interpretation of historical changes observed. Among the problems of individual reference sites is the difficulty of finding or proving a close match in all relevant ecological dimensions. Approximating and understanding ecological variation will require multiple sources of information. Restoration, by its inherently experimental nature, can further the understanding of the distribution, causes, and functions of nature's variation.

AB Tree turnover rates were assessed at 40 tropical forest sites. Averaged across inventoried forests, turnover, as measured by tree mortality and recruitment, has increased since the 1950s, with an apparent pantropical acceleration since 1980. Among 22 mature forest sites with two or more inventory periods, forest turnover also increased. The trend in forest dynamics may have profound effects on biological diversity.

AB OUR understanding of the biology and origins of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) derives from studies of cultured isolates from urban populations experiencing epidemic infection and disease1-8. To test the hypothesis that such isolates might represent only a subset of a larger, genetically more diverse group of viruses, we used nested polymerase chain reactions to characterize HIV-2 sequences in uncultured mononuclear blood cells of two healthy Liberian agricultural workers, from whom virus isolation was repeatedly unsuccessful, and from a culture-positive symptomatic urban dweller. Analysis of pol, env and long terminal repeat regions revealed the presence of three highly divergent HIV-2 strains, one of which (from one of the healthy subjects) was significantly more closely related to simian immunodeficiency viruses infecting sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques (SIV(SM)/SIV(MAC)) than to any virus of human derivation. This subject also harboured multiply defective viral genotypes that resulted from hypermutation of G to A bases. Our results indicate that HIV-2, SIV(SM) and SIV(MAC) comprise a single, highly diverse group of lentiviruses which cannot be separated into distinct phylogenetic lineages according to species of origin.

AB Natural disturbances like wildfire, windthrow and insect outbreaks are critical drivers of composition, structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They are strongly climate-sensitive, and are thus likely to be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest structure and composition associated with management activities such as promoting conifers and increasing standing timber volume (i.e. 'forest change') also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here, we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed in the same order of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance damage in Europe's forests. Climate change was the main driver of the increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe's forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management.

AB Nestedness has been one of the most reported patterns of species distribution in metacommunities as well as of species interactions in bipartite networks. We propose here a straightforward approach for quantifying nestedness using quantitative instead of presence-absence data. We named our estimator WNODF because it is a simple modification of the nestedness index called NODE. We also introduce the NODF-Program that calculates the above described nestedness metrics as well as metrics for idiosyncratic species and sites. Statistical inference is done through a null model approach, in which the user can choose among five null models commonly used for presence-absence matrices as well as three randomization algorithms for matrices that contain quantitative data. The program performs multiple analyses using many matrices. Finally, the NODF-Program provides four sorting options that, together with the null algorithms, cover a range of possibilities to test hypotheses on the possible mechanisms producing nested patterns. By using a set of model matrices, we showed that WNODF differentiates nested matrices with distinct structures and correctly identifies matrices with no nested pattern as having zero degree of nestedness.

AB Lignins are amongst the most studied macromolecules in natural environments. During the last decades, lignins were considered as important components for the carbon cycle in soils, and particularly for the carbon storage. Thus, they are an important variable in many soil plant models such as CENTURY and RothC, and appeared determinant for the estimation of the soil organic matter (SOM) pool-size and its stabilization. Recent studies challenged this point of view. The aim of this paper was to synthesise the current knowledge and recent progress about quantity, composition and turnover of lignins in soils and to identify variables determining lignin residence time. In soils, lignins evolve under the influence of various variables and processes such as their degradation or mineralization, as well as their incorporation into SOM. Lignin-derived products obtained after CuO oxidation can be used as environmental biomarkers, and also vary with the degree of degradation of the molecule. The lignin degradation is related to the nature of vegetation and land-use, but also to the climate and soil characteristics. Lignin content of SOM decreases with decreasing size of the granulometric fractions, whereas its level of degradation increases concomitantly. Many studies and our results suggest the accumulation and potential stabilization of a part of lignins in soils, by interaction with the clay minerals, although the mechanisms remain unclear. Lignin turnover in soils could be faster than that of the total SOM. Different kinetic pools of lignins were suggested, which sizes seem to be variable for different soil types. The mechanisms behind different degradation kinetics as well as their potential stabilization behaviour still need to be elucidated. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the model SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes), which is a vertical (1-D) integrated radiative transfer and energy balance model. The model links visible to thermal infrared radiance spectra (0.4 to 50 mu m) as observed above the canopy to the fluxes of water, heat and carbon dioxide, as a function of vegetation structure, and the vertical profiles of temperature. Output of the model is the spectrum of outgoing radiation in the viewing direction and the turbulent heat fluxes, photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. A special routine is dedicated to the calculation of photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll fluorescence at the leaf level as a function of net radiation and leaf temperature. The fluorescence contributions from individual leaves are integrated over the canopy layer to calculate top-of-canopy fluorescence. The calculation of radiative transfer and the energy balance is fully integrated, allowing for feedback between leaf temperatures, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and radiative fluxes. Leaf temperatures are calculated on the basis of energy balance closure. Model simulations were evaluated against observations reported in the literature and against data collected during field campaigns. These evaluations showed that SCOPE is able to reproduce realistic radiance spectra, directional radiance and energy balance fluxes. The model may be applied for the design of algorithms for the retrieval of evapotranspiration from optical and thermal earth observation data, for validation of existing methods to monitor vegetation functioning, to help interpret canopy fluorescence measurements, and to study the relationships between synoptic observations with diurnally integrated quantities. The model has been implemented in Matlab and has a modular design, thus allowing for great flexibility and scalability.

AB The growth of metacommunity ecology as a subdiscipline has increased interest in how processes at different spatial scales structure communities. However, there is still a significant knowledge gap with respect to relating the action of niche- and dispersal-assembly mechanisms to observed species distributions across gradients. Surveys of the larval dragonfly community (Odonata: Anisoptera) in 57 lakes and ponds in southeast Michigan were used to evaluate hypotheses about the processes regulating community structure in this system. We considered the roles of both niche- and dispersal-assembly processes in determining patterns of species richness and composition across a habitat gradient involving changes in the extent of habitat permanence, canopy cover, area, and top predator type. We compared observed richness patterns and species distributions in this system to patterns predicted by four general community models: species sorting related to adaptive trade-offs, a developmental constraints hypothesis, dispersal assembly, and a neutral community assemblage. Our results supported neither the developmental constraints nor the neutral-assemblage models. Observed patterns of richness and species distributions were consistent with patterns expected when adaptive tradeoffs and dispersal-assembly mechanisms affect community structure. Adaptive trade-offs appeared to be important in limiting the distributions of species which segregate across the habitat gradient. However, dispersal was important in shaping the distributions of species that utilize habitats with a broad range of hydroperiods and alternative top predator types. Our results also suggest that the relative importance of these mechanisms may change across this habitat gradient and that a metacommunity perspective which incorporates both niche- and dispersal-assembly processes is necessary to understand how communities are organized.

AB Marine ecosystems provide essential services to humans, yet these services have been diminished, and their future sustainability endangered, by human patterns of exploitation that threaten system robustness and resilience. Marine ecosystems arc complex adaptive systems composed of individual agents that interact with one another to produce collective effects, integrating scales from individual behaviors to the dynamics of whole systems. In such systems, small changes can be magnified through nonlinear interactions, facilitating regime shifts and collapses. Protection of the services these ecosystems provide must therefore maintain the adaptive capacities of these systems by preserving a balance among heterogeneity, modularity, and redundancy, tightening feedback loops to provide incentives for sound stewardship. The challenge for management is to increase incentives to individuals, and tighten reward loops, in ways that will strengthen the robustness and resilience of these systems and preserve their ability to provide ecosystem services for generations to come.

AB We examine the relative importance of processes that underlie plant population abundance and distribution. Two opposing views dominate the field. One posits that the ability to establish at a site is determined by the availability of suitable microsites (establishment limitation), while the second asserts that recruitment is limited by the availability of seeds (seed limitation). An underlying problem is that establishment and seed limitation are typically viewed as mutually exclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis of seed addition experiments to assess the relative strength of establishment and seed limitation to seedling recruitment. We asked (1) To what degree are populations seed and establishment limited? (2) Under what conditions (e. g., habitats and life- history traits) are species more or less limited by each? (3) How can seed addition studies be better designed to enhance our understanding of plant recruitment? We found that, in keeping with previous studies, most species are seed limited. However, the effects of seed addition are typically small, and most added seeds fail to recruit to the seedling stage. As a result, establishment limitation is stronger than seed limitation. Seed limitation was greater for large-seeded species, species in disturbed microsites, and species with relatively short-lived seed banks. Most seed addition experiments cannot assess the relationship between number of seeds added and number of subsequent recruits. This shortcoming can be overcome by increasing the number and range of seed addition treatments.

AB In spite of increasing application of presence-only models in ecology and conservation and the growing number of such models, little is known about the relative performance of different modelling methods, and some of the leading models (e.g. GARP and ENFA) have never been compared with one another. Here we compare the performance of six presence-only models that have been selected to represent an increasing level of model complexity [BIOCLIM, HABITAT, Mahalanobis distance (MD), DOMAIN, ENFA, and GARP] using data on the distribution of 42 species of land snails, nesting birds, and insectivorous bats in Israel. The models were calibrated using data from museum collections and observation databases, and their predictions were evaluated using Cohen's Kappa based on field data collected in a standardized sampling design covering most parts of Israel. Predictive accuracy varied between modelling methods with GARP and MD showing the highest accuracy, BIOCLIM and ENFA showing the lowest accuracy, and HABITAT and DOMAIN showing intermediate accuracy levels. Yet, differences between the various models were relatively small except for GARP and MD that were significantly more accurate than BIOCLIM and ENFA. In spite of large differences among species in prevalence and niche width, neither prevalence nor niche width interacted with the modelling method in determining predictive accuracy. However, species with relatively narrow niches were modelled more accurately than species with wider niches. Differences among species in predictive accuracy were highly consistent over all modelling methods, indicating the need for a better understanding of the ecological and geographical factors that influence the performance of species distribution models.

AB The assumption that species are most abundant in the center of their range and decline in abundance toward the range edges has a long history in the ecological literature. This assumption has driven basic and applied ecological and evolutionary hypotheses about the causes of species range limits and their responses to climate change. Here, we review recent studies that are taking biogeographical ecology beyond previously held assumptions by observing populations in the field across large parts of the species range. When these studies combine data on abundance, demographics organismal physiology, genetics and physical factors they provide a promising approach for teasing out ecological and evolutionary mechanisms of the patterns and processes underlying species ranges.

AB Marine organisms exhibit great variation in reproductive modes, larval types, and other life-history traits that may have major evolutionary consequences. We measured local and regional patterns of genetic variation in corals along Australia's Great Barrier Reef to determine the relative contributions of sexual and asexual reproduction to recruitment and to infer levels of gene flow both locally (among adjacent sites, < 5 km apart) and regionally (among reefs separated by 500-1200 km). We selected five common brooding species (Acropora cuneata, A. palifera, Pocillopora damicornis, Seriatopora hystrix, and Stylophora pistillata) and four broadcast spawners (Acropora hyacinthus, A. cytherea, A. millepora, and A. valida), which encompassed a wide range of larval types and potential dispersal capabilities. We found substantial genotypic diversity at local scales in six of the nine species (four brooders, two spawners). For these six, each local population displayed approximately the levels of multilocus genotypic diversity (G(o)) expected for outcrossed sexual reproduction (mean values of G(o):G(e) ranged from 0.85 to 1.02), although consistent single-locus heterozygous deficits indicate that inbreeding occurs at the scale of whole reefs. The remaining three species, the brooder S. hystrix and the spawners A. valida and A. millepora displayed significantly less multilocus genotypic diversity (G(o)) than was expected for outcrossed sexual reproduction (G(e)) within each of several sites. Acropora valida and A. millepora showed evidence of extensive localized asexual replication: (1) a small number of multilocus (clonal) genotypes were numerically dominant within some sites (G(o):G(e) values were as low as 0.17 and 0.20): (2) single-locus genotype frequencies were characterized by both excesses and deficits of heterozygotes (cf. Hardy-Weinberg expectations), and (3) significant linkage disequilibria occurred. For the brooding S. hystrix G(o):G(e) values were also low within each of four sites (<(x)over bar> = 0.48). However, this result most likely reflects the highly restricted dispersal of gametes or larvae, because levels of genetic variation among sites within reefs were extremely high (F-SR = 0.28)
   For all species, we detected considerable genetic subdivision among sites within each reef (high F-SR-values), and we infer that larval dispersal is surprisingly limited (i.e,. N(e)m among sites ranging from 0.6 to 3.3 migrants per generation),even in species that have relatively long planktonic durations. Nevertheless, our estimates of allelic variation among reefs (F-RT) also imply that for all four broadcast spawning species and three of the brooders, larval dispersal is sufficient to maintain moderate to high levels of gene flow along the entire Great Barrier Reef (i.e., N(e)m among reefs ranged from 5 to 31). In contrast, widespread populations of S. hystrix and S. pistilata (the two remaining brooders) are relatively weakly connected (N(e)m among reefs was 1.4 and 2.5, respectively). We conclude that most recruitment by corals is very local, particularly in brooders, but that enough propagules are widely dispersed to ensure that both broadcast spawning and brooding species form vast effectively panmictic populations on the Great Barrier Reef.

AB Clusters Of range boundaries in coastal marine species often occur at shoreline locations where major nearshore ocean currents collide. Observing that these currents are typically composed of waters with quite different physical characteristics, biologists have traditionally assumed that high local densities of marine range limits result primarily from the strong water property gradients (particularly in temperature) that arise at oceanographic discontinuities. However, this view may overlook the potential for ocean flows themselves to generate distributional pattern. Here we explore this possibility in more detail using an extension of a coupled population dispersal model developed previously for benthic marine species with dispersing larvae. Results suggest that simple, common flow fields often observed in association with biogeographic boundaries worldwide may have the potential to constrain a species' geographic range, even when suitable habitat outside that range is abundant. Model predictions suggest that these boundaries can function as one- or two-way barriers to range expansion and may be differentially permeable, with boundary leakiness depending on life-history characteristics and the degree of temporal variability in the nearshore flow field.

AB We investigated the roles of habitat fragmentation and the invasion of an exotic species on the structure of ground-foraging ant communities in 40 scrub habitat fragments in coastal southern California. In particular, we asked: how do fragment age, fragment size, amount of urban edge, percentage of native vegetation, degree of isolation, and the relative abundance of an exotic species, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) affect native ants? Within these fragments, Argentine ants were more abundant near developed edges and in areas dominated by exotic vegetation. The number of native ground-foraging ant species at any point declined from an average of >7 to <2 species in the presence of the Argentine ant. Among fragments, a stepwise multiple regression revealed that the abundance of Argentine ants, the size of the fragment, and the number of years since it was isolated from larger continuous areas of scrub habitat best predict the number of remaining native ant species. The Argentine ant was found in every fragment surveyed as well as around the edges of larger unfragmented areas. Fragments had fewer native ant species than similar-sized plots within large unfragmented areas, and fragments with Argentine ant-free refugia had more native ant species than those without refugia. The relative vulnerability of native ants to habitat fragmentation and the subsequent presence of Argentine ants vary among species. The most sensitive species include army ants (Neivamyrmex spp.) and harvester ants (genera Messor and Pogonomyrmex), both of which are important to ecosystem-level processes. Our surveys suggest that the Argentine ant is widespread in fragmented coastal scrub habitats in southern California and strongly affects native ant communities.

AB This article, which focuses on hormones and the diverse effects they have on behavior and physiology, raises evolutionary questions that hormonal studies appear especially well suited to address. These include the endocrine basis for life-history trade-offs, the role of hormones in adaptive alterations in social organization and mating systems, and whether natural selection acts on traits or organisms. The article also shows how phenotypic engineering by hormonal manipulations can reveal the evolutionary significance of phenotypic variation. By generating rare or novel phenotypes, we can attempt to determine the shape of fitness profiles in nature. To illustrate phenotypic engineering, we manipulated plasma testosterone in a free-living bird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), and measured the effects of the treatment on behavior, including allocation of time to mate attraction and parental behavior as well as use of space, and on physiology, including regulation of body mass. corticosterone, and molt. We compared treated males to controls for various correlates of fitness, including territory acquisition, mate acquisition, mate retention, physical condition of the mate, apparent reproductive success, extrapair fertilizations, and survival. The results to date appear to indicate that selection is relatively indifferent to a broad range of phenotypes, while extreme deviations from the norm are selected against.

AB We assess climate impacts of global warming using ongoing observations and paleoclimate data. We use Earth's measured energy imbalance, paleoclimate data, and simple representations of the global carbon cycle and temperature to define emission reductions needed to stabilize climate and avoid potentially disastrous impacts on today's young people, future generations, and nature. A cumulative industrial-era limit of similar to 500 GtC fossil fuel emissions and 100 GtC storage in the biosphere and soil would keep climate close to the Holocene range to which humanity and other species are adapted. Cumulative emissions of similar to 1000 GtC, sometimes associated with 2 degrees C global warming, would spur "slow" feedbacks and eventual warming of 3-4 degrees C with disastrous consequences. Rapid emissions reduction is required to restore Earth's energy balance and avoid ocean heat uptake that would practically guarantee irreversible effects. Continuation of high fossil fuel emissions, given current knowledge of the consequences, would be an act of extraordinary witting intergenerational injustice. Responsible policymaking requires a rising price on carbon emissions that would preclude emissions from most remaining coal and unconventional fossil fuels and phase down emissions from conventional fossil fuels.

AB The application of biochar to soil has been shown to cause an apparent increase in soil respiration. In this study we investigated the mechanistic basis of this response. We hypothesized that increased CO2 efflux could occur by: (1) Biochar-induced changes in soil physical properties ( bulk density, porosity, moisture content); (2) The biological breakdown of organic carbon (C) released from the biochar; (3) The abiotic release of inorganic C contained in the biochar; (4) A biochar-induced stimulation of decomposition of native soil organic matter (SOM) which could occur both biotically or abiotically; (5) The intrinsic biological activity of the biochar results in the liberation of CO2. Our results show that most of the extra CO2 produced after biochar addition to soil came from the equal breakdown of organic C and the release of inorganic C contained in the biochar. Using long-term C-14-labelled SOM, we show that biochar repressed native SOM breakdown, counteracting the release of CO2 from the biochar. A range of mechanisms to describe this negative priming response is presented. Although biochar-induced significant changes in the physical characteristics of the soil, overall this made no contribution to changes in soil respiration. Similarly, the evidence from our study suggests that changes in soluble polyphenols do not help explain the respiration response. In summary, biochar induced a net release of CO2 from the soil: however, this C loss was very small relative to the amount of C stored within the biochar itself (ca. 0.1%). This short-term C release should therefore not compromise its ability to contribute to long-term C sequestration in soil environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a multivariate classification technique frequently applied to morphometric data in various biomedical disciplines. Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices, which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population. Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically offer no interpretation as biological factors.

AB P>Predicting changes in community composition and ecosystem function in a rapidly changing world is a major research challenge in ecology. Traits-based approaches have elicited much recent interest, yet individual studies are not advancing a more general, predictive ecology. Significant progress will be facilitated by adopting a coherent theoretical framework comprised of three elements: an underlying trait distribution, a performance filter defining the fitness of traits in different environments, and a dynamic projection of the performance filter along some environmental gradient. This framework allows changes in the trait distribution and associated modifications to community composition or ecosystem function to be predicted across time or space. The structure and dynamics of the performance filter specify two key criteria by which we judge appropriate quantitative methods for testing traits-based hypotheses. Bayesian multilevel models, dynamical systems models and hybrid approaches meet both these criteria and have the potential to meaningfully advance traits-based ecology.

AB [ 1] Water-limited environments occupy about half of the Earth's land surface and contain some of the fastest growing population centers in the world. Scarcity or variable distributions of water and nutrients make these environments highly sensitive to change. Given the importance of water-limited environments and the impacts of increasing demands on water supplies and other natural resources, this paper highlights important societal problems and scientific challenges germane to these environments and presents a vision on how to accelerate progress. We argue that improvements in our fundamental understanding of the links between hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes are needed, and the way to accomplish this is by fostering integrated, interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving and hypothesis testing through place-based science. Such an ecohydrological approach will create opportunities to develop new methodologies and ways of thinking about these complex environmental systems and help us improve forecasts of environmental change.

AB Understanding how plant recovery from herbivory interacts with the resource environment is necessary to predict under what resource conditions plants are most affected by herbivory, and ultimately how herbivory impacts plant population dynamics. It has been commonly assumed that plants are generally best able to recover from herbivory when growing in high resource conditions, an assumption which is supported by some models (e.g., the continuum of responses model) but opposed by others (e.g., the growth rate model). The validity and generality of any effects of resources (light, nutrients, and water) on plant recovery from herbivory were tested with mixed-model, factorial meta-analyses using a log response ratio metric applied to plant growth and reproduction data from the ecological literature. In total. 81 records from 45 studies were included in the growth meta-analysis, and 24 records from 14 studies in the reproduction meta-analysis. High resource levels and the absence of herbivory both strongly increased plant growth and reproduction. There was no significant overall interaction between growth or reproduction after herbivory and resource conditions, but the interaction terms were significant for each plant functional group in the growth meta-analysis. Basal meristem monocots grew significantly more after herbivory in high resources, while both dicot herbs and woody plants grew significantly more after herbivory in low resources. A similar result was found in the 34.6% of growth records where exact- or overcompensation occurred. Overcompensation was more likely in high resources for monocots and in low resources for dicot herbs. The reproduction data set was too small to subdivide. These qualitative differences between monocot and dicot herbs and woody plants explain many of the contradictory results in the literature and show that no single current model can account for the responses of all plants to herbivory.

AB 1. A broadened concept of biodiversity, encompassing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, functional processes and species diversity, could provide a unifying theme for river ecology.
   2. The theoretical foundations of stream ecology often do not reflect fully the crucial roles of spatial complexity and fluvial dynamics in natural river ecosystems, which has hindered conceptual advances and the effectiveness of efforts at conservation and restoration.
   3. Inclusion of surface waters (lotic and lentic), subsurface waters (hyporheic and phreatic), riparian systems (in both constrained and floodplain reaches), and the ecotones between them (e.g. springs) as interacting components contributing to total biodiversity, is crucial for developing a holistic framework of rivers as ecosystems.
   4. Measures of species diversity, including alpha, beta and gamma diversity, are a result of disturbance history, resource partitioning, habitat fragmentation and successional phenomena across the riverine landscape. A hierarchical approach to diversity in natural and altered river-floodplain ecosystems will enhance understanding of ecological phenomena operating at different scales along multidimensional environmental gradients.
   5. Re-establishing functional diversity (e.g. hydrologic and successional processes) across the active corridor could serve as the focus of river conservation initiatives. Once functional processes have been reconstituted, habitat heterogeneity will increase, followed by corresponding increases in species diversity of aquatic and riparian biota.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important in a wide variety of chemical, physical, and biological processes in surface waters. We examined the relationship between DOC flux and soil C:N ratio on a biome basis. DOC fluxes for 164 rivers were subdivided into 15 biome types including tropical rain forest, coniferous forests, peatland, deciduous forests, mixed forests, and grasslands. A database of soil C:N ratios was constructed and subdivided into biome types. At a global scale, mean soil C:N ratio of a biome accounts for 99.2% of the variance in annual riverine DOC flux among biomes, The relationship between soil C:N ratio and DOC flux at the biome scale was used to predict annual riverine DOC flux at the watershed scale for three test watersheds not included in the original model. Predicted flux of each watershed was within 4.5% of the actual DOC flux. Using the C:N model, we estimated the total export of carbon from land to the oceans to be 3.6 x 10(14) g yr(-1). This empirical model should be useful in predicting changes in DOC flux under changing climatic conditions.

AB Ecological flows and biological diversity trace broad patterns across the landscape, whereas transportation planning for human mobility traditionally focuses on a narrow strip close to a road or highway. To help, close this gap, we examined the "road-effect zone" over which significant ecological effects extend outward from a road. Nine ecological factors-involving wetlands, streams, road salt, exotic plants, moose, deer, amphibians, forest birds, and grassland birds-were measured or estimated near 25 km of a busy four-lane highway west of Boston, Massachusetts. The effects of all factors extended >100 m from the road, and moose corridors, road avoidance by grassland birds, and perhaps road salt in a shallow reservoir extended out-wards >1 km. Most factors had effects at 2-5 specific locations, whereas traffic noise apparently exerted effects along most of the road length. Creating a map, of these effects indicates that the road-effect zone averages approximately 600 m in width and is asymmetric, with convoluted boundaries and a few long fingers. We conclude that busy roads and nature reserves should be well separated, and that future transportation systems across landscapes can provide ecological flows and biological diversity in addition to safe and efficient human mobility.

AB Quantitative synthesis across studies requires consistent measures of effect size among studies. In community ecology, these measures of effect size will often be some measure of the strength of interactions between taxa. However, indices of interaction strength vary greatly among both theoretical and empirical studies, and the connection between hypotheses about interaction strength and the metrics that are used to test these hypotheses are often not explicit. We describe criteria for choosing appropriate metrics and methods for comparing them among studies at three stages of designing a meta-analysis to test hypotheses about variation in interaction intensity: (1) the choice of response variable; (2) how effect size is calculated using the response in two treatments; and (3) whether there is a consistent quantitative effect across all taxa and systems studied or only qualitatively similar effects within each taxon-system combination. The consequences of different choices at each of these stages are illustrated with a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between competition/facilitation intensity and productivity in plants. The analysis used a database of 296 cases in 14 studies.
   The results were unexpected and largely inconsistent with existing theory: competition intensity often significantly declined (rather than increased) with productivity, and facilitation was sometimes restricted to more productive (rather than less productive) sites. However, there was considerable variation in the pattern among response variables and measures of effect size. For example, on average, competitive effects on final biomass and survival decreased with standing crop, but competitive effects on growth rate did not. On the other hand, facilitative interactions were more common at low standing crop for final biomass and growth rate, but more common at high standing crop for survival. Results were more likely to be significant using the log response ratio (In[removal/control]) as the effect size than using the relative competition intensity ([removal - control]/removal), although the trends for these conceptually similar indices did not differ. When all studies were grouped in a single meta-regression of interaction intensity on standing crop to test quantitative similarity among studies, survival showed the dearest negative relationship. However, when the same regressions were done for each unique combination of taxon and site within each study to test for qualitative similarity among studies, the slopes averaged over studies tended to be negative for biomass and growth rate, but not different from zero for survival. These results are subject to a number of caveats because of the limitations of the available data-most notably, the extension of effects of interactions on individual growth or survival to effects on population distribution and abundance or community structure is highly problematic. Nevertheless, the fact that none of the meta-analyses demonstrated a significant positive relationship between competition and standing crop but that we frequently found negative relationships is an important pattern that has not been apparent from qualitative surveys of individual studies, and it demonstrates the potential power of meta-analysis in ecology. We conclude with recommendations to overcome some of the limitations of the currently available data and meta-analytical procedures.

AB Over the past 15 years the endangered eastern timber wolf (Canis lupus lycaon) has been slowly recolonizing northern Wisconsin and, more recently, upper Michigan, largely by dispersing from Minnesota (where it is listed as threatened).  We have used geographic information systems (GISs) and spatial radiocollar data on recolonizing wolves in northern Wisconsin to assess the importance of landscape-scale factors in defining favorable wolf habitat.  We built a multiple logistic regression model applied to the northern Great Lakes states to estimate the amount and spatial distribution of favorable wolf habitat at the regional landscape scale.  Our results suggest that areas with high probability of favorable habitat are more extensive than previously estimated in the northern Great Lake States.  Several variables were significant in comparing new pack areas in Wisconsin to nonpack areas, including land ownership class, land cover type, road density, human population, and spatial landscape indices such as fractal dimension (land cover patch boundary complexity), land cover type contagion, landscape diversity, and landscape dominance.  Road density and fractal dimension were the most important predictor variables in the logistic regression models.  The results indicate that public forest land and private industrial forest land are both important in managing for a broad-ranging animal such as the wolf.  Our data portray favorable habitat that is highly fragmented along development corridors in northern Wisconsin, which may be responsible for the slow growth of the wolf population.  Upper Michigan, which is just beginning to be colonized by wolves, has very large, contiguous areas of likely habitat approaching the importance of those in northeastern Minnesota.  If continuing development or wolf control restrict dispersing wolves from moving from Minnesota to Wisconsin, and Wisconsin habitat becomes more marginal through further fragmentation, Michigan has the potential to maintain a significant wolf population independent of Minnesota and serve as a source population for Wisconsin.  However, a simple island/corridor model of wolf habitat in Wisconsin does not seem to apply.  Wolves apparently move throughout the landscape, across many unfavorable areas, but establishment success is restricted to higher quality habitat.  Source-sink dynamics may be operating here, and they suggest that reduction of the Minnesota population in the near term may affect recovery in Wisconsin and Michigan.  Our analysis is an example of use of long-term monitoring data and large-scale cross-boundary regional analysis that must be done to solve complex spatial questions in resource management and conservation.

AB Invertebrate data from rivers in the Tennessee Valley were used to: (1) evaluate the utility of 18 characteristics of invertebrate assemblages (attributes) to assess the biological condition of streams and (2) develop a comprehensive benthic invertebrate index that reflects important aspects of stream biology and responds to the effects of human society in detectable ways. We used data from the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) fixed-station monitoring program established in 1986 to evaluate water resources in the Tennessee Valley. The streams covered sites with various types and levels of human disturbance. TVA biologists sampled riffles and pools using quantitative methods. To evaluate attributes we determined (1) the ability of each attribute to distinguish among sites (analyses of variance), (2) the associations among attributes (correlation coefficients), (3) the concordance of assessments of sites using each attribute with two independent site assessments (water quality and analysis of fish assemblages based on the index of biotic integrity), and (4) the variability of each attribute across habitats (riffles and pools) and ecoregions.
   Thirteen attributes (total taxa richness and taxa richnesses of intolerant snails and mussels, mayflies, caddisflies, and stoneflies; relative abundances of Corbicula, oligochaetes, omnivores, filterers, grazers, and predators; dominance; total abundance) were valuable in discriminating sites, exhibited concordance with other methods of assessment, and were relatively uncorrelated among themselves. Five attributes (sediment-surface taxa richness; relative abundances of shredders, gatherers, detritivores, and chironomids) were not acceptable for inclusion in the index because they either were not in concordance with other methods of assessment or were strongly correlated with other attributes.
   Based on the results of this evaluation, 13 attributes were included in a benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI). The B-IBI was evaluated using a more extensive fixed-station data set and was tested using an independent data set where samples were taken above and below the release of an industrial effluent to the North Fork Holston River. The fixed-station sites were correctly ranked, although rankings were not always consistent for pool and riffle habitats. B-IBI also distinguished the industrial impact. The B-IBI has potential as an assessment tool for streams, although more testing and evaluation of both the attributes and the index are warranted.

AB Environmental filtering, where the environment selects against certain species, is thought to be a major mechanism structuring communities. However, recent criticisms cast doubt on our ability to accurately infer filtering because competition can give rise to patterns identical to those caused by environmental filtering. While experiments can distinguish mechanisms, observational patterns are especially problematic. The environment determines community composition not only directly via survival, but also by influencing competition. If species population growth rates covary with environmental gradients, then outcomes of competitive exclusion will also vary with the environment. Here, we argue that observational studies remain valuable, but inferences about the importance of the environment cannot rely on compositional data alone, and that species abundances, population growth, or traits must be correlated with the environment.

AB The value of big old fat fecund female fish (BOFFFFs) in fostering stock productivity and stability has long been underappreciated by conventional fisheries science and management, although Hjort (1914) indirectly alluded to the importance of maternal effects. Compared with smaller mature females, BOFFFFs in a broad variety of marine and freshwater teleosts produce far more and often larger eggs that may develop into larvae that grow faster and withstand starvation better. As (if not more) importantly, BOFFFFs in batch-spawning species tend to have earlier and longer spawning seasons and may spawn in different locations than smaller females. Such features indicate that BOFFFFs are major agents of bet-hedging strategies that help to ensure individual reproductive success in environments that vary tremendously in time and space. Even if all else were equal, BOFFFFs can outlive periods that are unfavourable for successful reproduction and be ready to spawn profusely and enhance recruitment when favourable conditions return (the storage effect). Fishing differentially removes BOFFFFs, typically resulting in severe truncation of the size and age structure of the population. In the worst cases, fishing mortality acts as a powerful selective agent that inhibits reversal of size and age truncation, even if fishing intensity is later reduced. Age truncation is now known to destabilize fished populations, increasing their susceptibility to collapse. Although some fisheries models are beginning to incorporate maternal and other old-growth effects, most continue to treat all spawning-stock biomass as identical: many small young females are assumed to contribute the same to stock productivity as an equivalent mass of BOFFFFs. A growing body of knowledge dictates that fisheries productivity and stability would be enhanced if management conserved old-growth age structure in fished stocks, be it by limiting exploitation rates, by implementing slot limits, or by establishing marine reserves, which are now known to seed surrounding fished areas via larval dispersal. Networks of marine reserves are likely to be the most effective means of ensuring that pockets of old-growth age structure survive throughout the geographic range of demersal species.

AB Despite the growing appreciation for the functional diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, our understanding of the causes and consequences of this diversity is still poor. In this opinion article, we review published data on AM fungal functional traits and attempt to identify major axes of life history variation. We propose that a life history classification system based on the grouping of functional traits, such as Grime's C-S-R (competitor, stress tolerator, ruderal) framework, can help to explain life history diversification in AM fungi, successional dynamics, and the spatial structure of AM fungal assemblages. Using a common. life history classification framework for both plants and AM fungi could also help in predicting probable species associations in natural communities and increase our fundamental understanding of the interaction between land plants and AM fungi.

AB Sewage sludge was pyrolyzed in order to assess the effect of pyrolysis temperature, residence time and biomass chemical impregnation on the yield of biochar production. The pyrolysis temperature was a key factor affecting biochar yield, while the highest yield was obtained at a temperature of 300 C. Biochar surface area increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature and was maximized (90 m(2)/g) by impregnating biochar with K2CO3. Raw sewage sludge, as well as biochar samples, were subjected to leaching tests in order to investigate the potential release of heavy metals. Pyrolysis suppressed heavy metal release for the non-impregnated biochars, indicating that there is no environmental risk using sludge-derived biochars as soil amendments. Although K2CO3 and H3PO4 impregnation enhanced the solubility of specific heavy metals, the concentrations in the leachates were low. Biochar impregnated with K2CO3 released 85.7% of its potassium content, whereas orthophosphates were bound strongly in the biochar matrix impregnated with H3PO4. The non impregnated biochar was subjected to batch kinetic experiments in order to examine its ability to adsorb As(V) and Cr(III). Biochar removed approximately 70% of Cr(III) at equilibrium time, whereas only 30% of As(V) was adsorbed onto biochar surface, implying that biochar is more efficient in removing cations than anions from aqueous solutions.

AB Fire occurrence, which results from the presence of an ignition source and the conditions for a fire to spread, is an essential component of fire risk assessment. In this paper, we present and compare the results of the application of two different methods to identify the main structural factors that explain the likelihood of fire occurrence at European scale.
   Data on the number of fires for the countries of the European Mediterranean region during the main fire season (June-September) were obtained from the European Fire Database of the European Forest Fire Information System. Fire density (number of fires/km(2)) was estimated based on interpolation techniques and was used as the dependent variable in the model. As predictors, different physical, socio-economic and demographic variables were selected based on their potential influence in fire occurrence and on their availability at the European level. Two different methods were applied for the analysis: traditional Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest, the latter being a non-parametric alternative based on an ensemble of classification and regression trees. The predictive ability of the two models, the variables selected by each method and their level of importance were compared and the potential implications to forest management and fire prevention were discussed.
   The Random Forest model showed a higher predictive ability than Multiple Linear Regression. Furthermore, the analysis of the residuals also indicated a better performance of the Random Forest model, showing that this method has potentiality to be applied in the assessment of fire-related phenomena at a broad scale. Some of the variables selected are common to both models; precipitation and soil moisture seem to influence fire occurrence to a large extent. Unemployment rate, livestock density and density of local roads were also found significant by both methods. Maps of the likelihood of fire occurrence were obtained from each method at 10 km resolution, based on the selected variables. Both models show that the spatial distribution of fire occurrence likelihood is highly variable in this region: highest fire likelihood is prevalent in the northwest region of the Iberian Peninsula and southern Italy, whereas it is low in northern France, northeast Italy and north of Greece. In the most fire-prone areas, preventive measures could be implemented, associated to the factors identified by both models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB P>1. Although secondary metabolites are recognized as fundamental to the defence of plants against insect and mammalian herbivores, their relative importance compared to other potential defensive plant traits (e.g. physical resistance, gross morphology, life-history, primary chemistry and physiology) are not well understood.
   2. We conducted a meta-analysis to answer the question: What types of genetically variable plant traits most strongly predict resistance against herbivores? We performed a comprehensive literature search and obtained 499 separate measurements of the strength of covariation (measured as genetic correlations) between plant traits and herbivore susceptibility - these were extracted from 72 studies involving 19 plant families.
   3. Surprisingly, we found no overall association between the concentrations of secondary metabolites and herbivore susceptibility - plant traits other than secondary metabolites most strongly predicted herbivore susceptibility. Specifically, genetic variation in life-history traits (e.g. flowering time, growth rate) consistently exhibited the strongest genetic correlations with susceptibility. Genetic variation in gross morphological traits (e.g. no. branches, plant size) and physical resistance traits (e.g. latex, trichomes) were also frequently correlated with variation in herbivore susceptibility, but these relationships depended on attributes of the herbivores (e.g. feeding guild) and plants (e.g. longevity).
   4. These results call into question the conventional wisdom that secondary metabolites are the most important anti-herbivore defence of plants. We propose the hypothesis that herbivores select most strongly on genetic variation in life-history, morphological and physical resistance traits, but the greater pleiotropic effects of genes controlling these traits impose strong constraints on their evolution. Meanwhile, secondary metabolites could have evolved to be important defensive mechanisms not because they have the largest effect on herbivores, but because the constraints on their evolution are the weakest.

AB Island biogeography theory (IBT) provides a basic conceptual model for understanding habitat fragmentation. Empirical studies of fragmented landscapes often reveal strong effects of fragment area and isolation on species richness, although other predictions of the theory, such as accelerated species turnover in fragments, have been tested less frequently. As predicted by IBT, biota in fragments typically 'relax' over time towards lower species richness. Beyond these broad generalizations, however, the relevance of IBT for understanding fragmented ecosystems is limited. First, IBT provides few predictions about how community composition in fragments should change over time, and which species should be most vulnerable. Second, edge effects can be an important driver of local species extinctions and ecosystem change, but are not considered by IBT. Third, the matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments-also ignored by IBT-can strongly influence fragment connectivity, which in turn affects the demography, genetics, and survival of local populations. Fourth, most fragmented landscapes are also altered by other anthropogenic changes, such as hunting, logging, fires, and pollution, which can interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation. Finally, fragmentation often has diverse impacts on ecosystem properties such as canopy-gap dynamics, carbon storage, and the trophic structure of communities that are not considered by IBT. I highlight these phenomena with findings from fragmented ecosystems around the world. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Theories of tropical tree diversity emphasize dispersal limitation as a potential mechanism for separating species in space and reducing competitive exclusion. We compared the dispersal morphologies, fruit sizes, and spatial distributions of 561 tree species within a fully mapped, 50-hectare plot of primary tropical forest in peninsular Malaysia. We demonstrate here that the extent and scale of conspecific spatial aggregation is correlated with the mode of seed dispersal. This relationship holds for saplings as well as for mature trees. Phylogenetically independent contrasts confirm that the relationship between dispersal and spatial pattern is significant even after controlling for common ancestry among species. We found the same qualitative results for a 50-hectare tropical forest plot in Panama. Our results provide broad empirical evidence for the importance of dispersal mode in establishing the long-term community structure of tropical forests.

Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAk(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.

AB The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (ICHH) of Folstad and Karter has inspired a large number of studies that have tried to understand the causal basis of parasite-mediated sexual selection. Even though this hypothesis is based on the double function of testosterone, a hormone restricted to vertebrates, studies of invertebrates have tended to provide central support for specific predictions of the ICHH. I propose an alternative hypothesis that explains many of the findings without relying on testosterone or other biochemical feedback loops. This alternative is based on Bateman's principle, that males gain fitness by increasing their mating success whilst females increase fitness through longevity because their reproductive effort is much higher. Consequently, I predict that females should invest more in immunity than males. The extent of this dimorphism is determined by the mating system and the genetic correlation between males and females in immune traits. In support of my arguments, I mainly use studies on insects that share innate immunity with vertebrates and have the advantage that they are easier to study.

AB The relative importance of allelopathy and resource competition in plant-plant interactions has been vigorously debated but seldom tested. We used activated carbon to manipulate the effects of root exudates of Centaurea maculosa, a noxious weed in much of western North America, on root elongation rates and growth of the native bunchgrass Festuca idahoensis in order to investigate the relative importance of allelopathy in the total interference of Centaurea. In root observation chambers, Festuca root elongation rates decreased to approximate to 50% of the control, beginning 4 days before contacting Centaurea roots in silica sand. However, when activated carbon, which has a high affinity for adsorbing to organic compounds, was added to the sand the effects of Centaurea roots on Festuca root elongation were reduced. In other experiments, Festuca plants were 50% smaller when grown with Centaurea than with conspecifics in pure silica sand. However, Festuca grown with Centaurea in mixtures of sand and activated carbon were 85% larger than Festuca grown with Centaurea in silica sand without carbon. These results suggest that allelopathy accounts for a substantial proportion of the total interference of Centaurea on Festuca, shifting the balance of competition in favor of Centaurea. However, Centaurea outperformed Festuca even in the presence of activated carbon, demonstrating the importance of the combined roles of resource competition and allelopathy.

AB Coastal marine ecology is, quite properly, increasingly focussed on experimental tests of hypotheses about processes. These are, however, done to explain observations and patterns. It is therefore appropriate to be able to publish quantitative observations to provide the context and basis for studying mechanisms and processes. Ecologists are concerned about very different types of observations. Some areas of study are still totally dependent on observational, descriptive evidence; some depend on mensurative tests of hypotheses about patterns. Tests of hypotheses about patterns are also needed to validate casual or qualitative observations. Guide-lines for what constitutes appropriate or publishable ecological descriptions are discussed here. These recognize the experimental, hypothesis-testing nature of many descriptive studies and consider the relevance of sound logic and experimental design in the planning, collection and interpretation of observations.

AB Restoration ecology is undergoing rapid growth as an academic discipline, similar to that experienced by conservation biology over the last 15 years. Restoration ecology and conservation biology share many underlying biodiversity goals, but differ in striking ways. Using data from published literature in these two fields, I document that conservation biology has been more zoological, more descriptive and theoretical, and more focused on population and genetic studies than restoration ecology, which has been more botanical, more experimental, and more focused on population, community and ecosystem studies. I also use documented trends in population, land use, and biodiversity awareness to suggest that in the future ecological restoration will play an increasing role in biodiversity conservation. The conservation mind set is one of loss on a relatively short time horizon, whereas the restoration mind set is one of long-term recovery. I suggest that a restoration mind set can provide useful insights into problems of conservation today, illustrated with examples examining edge effects and integrated conservation and development projects.

AB 1. Intra-brood competition and parental feeding effort are considered important determinants of survival of offspring in altricial bird species because they affect accumulation of fat reserves by nestlings. However, the causal relationship between rearing conditions and post-fledging survival might also be mediated by other mechanisms; for example, the amount and quality of food provided by parents to each nestling might affect development of immune system organs and functions and, hence, the ability of offspring to cope with parasites and pathogens.
   2. The hypothesis that parental feeding effort, food quality and brood size affect immunocompetence of nestlings was tested for the first time in the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, Linnaeus.
   3. The intensity of T-lymphocyte cell-mediated immune responsiveness was evaluated after intradermal inoculation of a lectin (phytohaemagglutinin) in a large sample of nestlings from unmanipulated broods and broods whose size had been manipulated immediately after hatching.
   4. In unmanipulated broods, immune response, body mass and body condition were correlated negatively with brood size and positively with the rate of parental feeding to each offspring. Nestlings in enlarged broods had smaller immune response and body mass, and received less food per capita than those in reduced broods.
   5. Broods artificially provisioned with a food rich in proteins showed larger immune response, but not larger body mass, as compared to unprovisioned controls.
   6. We conclude that T-lymphocyte cell-mediated immune response as well as body mass is influenced by the level of parental investment and brood size, perhaps via its effect on competition for food, Since T-lymphocytes are fundamental components of avian immunity, and parasites are known to affect survival of their avian hosts, our results suggest a new pathway through which rearing conditions might influence offspring survival.

AB Apomicts that produce unreduced parthenogenetic eggs are generally polyploid and occur in at least 33 of 460 families of angiosperms. Embryo sacs of these apomicts form precociously from ameiotic megaspore mother cells (diplospory) or adjacent somatic cells (apospory). Polysporic species (bisporic and tetrasporic) are sexual and occur in at least 88 families. Their embryo sacs also form precociously, but only non-critical portions of meiosis are affected. It is hypothesized that (i) the partial to complete replacement of meiosis by embryo sac formation in apomictic and polysporic species results from asynchronously-expressed duplicate genes that control female development, (ii) duplicate genes result from polyploidy or paleopolyploidy (diploidized polyploidy with chromatin from multiple genomes), (iii) apomixis results from competition between nearly complete sets of asynchronously-expressed duplicate genes, and (iv) polyspory and polyembryony result from competition between incomplete sets of asynchronously-expressed duplicate genes. Phylogenetic and genomic studies were conducted to evaluate this hypothesis. Apomictic, polysporic, and polyembryonic species tended to occur together in cosmopolitan families in which temporal variation in female development is expected, apomicts were generally polyploid with few chromosomes per genome ((x) over bar = 9.6 +/- 0.4 SE), and polysporic and polyembryonic species were paleopolyploid with many chromosomes per genome ((x) over bar = 15.7 +/- 0.6 and 13.2 +/- 0.4, respectively). These findings support the proposed duplicate-gene asynchrony hypothesis and further suggest asexual reproduction in apomicts preserves primary genomes, sexual reproduction in polysporic and polyembryonic polyploids accelerates paleopolyploidization, and paleopolyploidization may sometimes eliminate gene duplications required for apomixis while retaining duplications required for polyspory or polyembryony. Hence, apomixis, with its long-term reproductive stability, may occasionally serve as an evolutionary springboard in the evolution of normal and developmentally-novel paleopolyploid sexual species and genera.

AB Variation in the intensities of above- and belowground competition is proposed to underlie changes in community structure associated with variable fertility and disturbance. Here we report measurements of light, soil nitrogen, and above- and belowground competition in vegetation that had received four combinations of fertilization and disturbance for 3 yr. Two levels of nitrogen addition (none and 17 g. m-2 . yr-1) and two of soil disturbance (none and annual tilling to remove all vegetation) were applied in a factorial design to 5 x 5 m plots (10 replicates) in a 31-yr-old field in southeastern Minnesota. During the 3rd yr of the experiment, community standing crop, light penetration, and soil ammonium and nitrate concentrations were measured every 3-4 wk. Fertilization significantly increased productivity and tilling significantly decreased community biomass at the start of the growing season, indicating that the experimental treatments created variation in stress and disturbance.
   Transplants of Schizachyrium scoparium, a native perennial grass, were grown with no neighbors, or with the roots of neighbors, or with all neighbors in each combination of fertility and disturbance in order to examine competition intensity. In both undisturbed and tilled plots, belowground competition was the dominant interaction in unfertilized plots, whereas both below- and aboveground competition controlled growth in fertilized plots. The intensity of aboveground competition was greatest in plots with the lowest light penetration and declined significantly with increasing light supply. Similarly, belowground competition was most intense in plots with the lowest nitrogen availability and decreased significantly with increasing nitrogen availability. The intensities of above- and belowground competition were significantly negatively correlated. The total (above- and belowground) intensity of competition did not vary with fertility, but was significantly reduced by disturbance. Similarly, the effect of neighbor mass on transplant growth was significantly reduced by disturbance.

AB Independent species fluctuations are commonly used as a null hypothesis to test the role of competition and niche differences between species in community stability. This hypothesis, however, is unrealistic because it ignores the forces that contribute to synchronization of population dynamics. Here we present a mechanistic neutral model that describes the dynamics of a community of equivalent species under the joint influence of density dependence, environmental forcing, and demographic stochasticity. We also introduce a new standardized measure of species synchrony in multispecies communities. We show that the per capita population growth rates of equivalent species are strongly synchronized, especially when endogenous population dynamics are cyclic or chaotic, while their long-term fluctuations in population sizes are desynchronized by ecological drift. We then generalize our model to non-neutral dynamics by incorporating temporal and nontemporal forms of niche differentiation. Niche differentiation consistently decreases the synchrony of species per capita population growth rates, while its effects on the synchrony of population sizes are more complex. Comparing the observed synchrony of species per capita population growth rates with that predicted by the neutral model potentially provides a simple test of deterministic asynchrony in a community.

AB Avian biologists routinely estimate sampling variance for parameter estimates such as daily nest survival, fecundity, annual survival, and density. However, many biologists are not certain of methods to derive sampling variance for parameters when survival rates change temporal scales. Similar methods are needed to obtain sampling variance when biologists combine parameter estimates to calculate an indirect demographic parameter, such as population growth rate. The delta method is a useful technique for approximating sampling variance when the desired demographic parameter is a function of at least one other demographic parameter. However, the delta method is rarely taught in most graduate-level biology or ecology courses, and application of this method may be discouraged by seemingly daunting formulas in reference books. Here, I provide five examples of sampling variance approximations for common situations encountered by avian ecologists, with step-by-step explanations of the equations involved.

AB The topology of ecological interaction webs holds important information for theories of coevolution, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability [1-6]. However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels [7-9]. We applied a recently developed [10] quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating significantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were significantly more specialized than seed-dispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions.

AB Tropical forests include a diversity of habitats, which has led to specialization in plants. Near Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, nutrient-rich clay forests surround nutrient-poor white-sand forests, each harboring a unique composition of habitat specialist trees. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of impoverished soils and herbivory creates strong natural selection for plant defenses in white-sand forest, while rapid growth is favored in clay forests. Recently, we reported evidence from a reciprocal-transplant experiment that manipulated the presence of herbivores and involved 20 species from six genera including phylogenetically independent pairs of closely related white-sand and clay specialists. When protected from herbivores, clay specialists exhibited faster growth rates than white-sand specialists in both habitats. But, when unprotected, white-sand specialists outperformed clay specialists in white-sand habitat, and clay specialists outperformed white-sand specialists in clay habitat.
   Here we test further the hypothesis that the growth-defense trade-off contributes to habitat specialization by comparing patterns of growth, herbivory, and defensive traits in these same six genera of white-sand and clay specialists. While the probability of herbivore attack did not differ between the two habitats, an artificial defoliation experiment showed that the impact of herbivory on plant mortality was significantly greater in white-sand forests. We quantified the amount of terpenes, phenolics, leaf toughness, and available foliar protein for the plants in the experiment. Different genera invested in different defensive strategies, and we found strong evidence for phylogenetic constraint in defense type. Overall, however, we found significantly higher total defense investment for white-sand specialists, relative to their clay specialist congeners. Furthermore, herbivore resistance consistently exhibited a significant trade-off against growth rate in each of the six phylogenetically independent species-pairs.
   These results confirm theoretical predictions that a trade-off exists between growth rate and defense investment, causing white-sand and clay specialists to evolve divergent strategies. We propose that the growth-defense trade-off is universal and provides an important mechanism by which herbivores govern plant distribution patterns across resource gradients.

AB Commercial fishing has repeatedly been identified as a major causal factor for global declines in fish stocks. Recently, recreational fisheries have also been considered as having the potential to contribute to fisheries declines. Here, we take a global focus, contrasting the characteristics of commercial and recreational fisheries relevant to conservation and sustainability of exploited fishes in both marine and freshwater environments. We provide evidence to support our assertion that the same issues that have led to global fisheries concerns regarding commercial fishing can have equivalent, and in some cases, magnified effects in recreational fisheries. Contrasts revealed that the issues of bycatch and catch-and-release, fisheries-induced selection, trophic changes, habitat degradation, gear technology, fishing effort, and production regimes are remarkably similar among fishery sectors. In recognition of this conclusion, we present a new vision for recreational fishing that positions it on the same scale and urgency as commercial fisheries. Efforts to manage and conserve fisheries must recognise that issues and threats are similar in these fundamentally and philosophically different fisheries, as may be the solutions. Failure to recognise the similarities will further polarise these sectors and retard efforts to conserve aquatic resources. Fishing activity of any kind, whether commercial or recreational, has the potential to affect negatively fish and fisheries, as well as aquatic environments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Plant invasions have dramatic aboveground effects on plant community composition, but their belowground effects remain largely uncharacterized. Soil microorganisms directly interact with plants and mediate many nutrient transformations in soil. We hypothesized that belowground changes to the soil microbial community provide a mechanistic link between exotic plant invasion and changes to ecosystem nutrient cycling. To examine this possible link, monocultures and mixtures of exotic and native species were maintained for 4 years in a California grassland. Gross rates of nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification were quantified with N-15 pool dilution and soil microbial communities were characterized with DNA-based methods. Exotic grasses doubled gross nitrification rates, in part by increasing the abundance and changing the composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in soil. These changes may translate into altered ecosystem N budgets after invasion. Altered soil microbial communities and their resulting effects on ecosystem processes may be an invisible legacy of exotic plant invasions.

AB Squamate reptiles (snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenians) serve as model systems for evolutionary studies of a variety of morphological and behavioral traits, and phylogeny is crucial to many generalizations derived from such studies. Specifically, the traditional dichotomy between Iguania ( anoles, iguanas, chameleons, etc.) and Scleroglossa ( skinks, geckos, snakes, etc.) has been correlated with major evolutionary shifts within Squamata. We present a molecular phylogenetic study of 69 squamate species using approximately 4600 ( 2876 parsimony-informative) base pairs ( bp) of DNA sequence data from the nuclear genes RAG-1 (-2750 bp) and c-mos (-360 bp) and the mitochondrial ND2 region (-1500 bp), sampling all major clades and most major subclades. Under our hypothesis, species previously placed in Iguania, Anguimorpha, and almost all recognized squamate families form strongly supported monophyletic groups. However, species previously placed in Scleroglossa, Varanoidea, and several other higher taxa do not form monophyletic groups. Iguania, the traditional sister group of Scleroglossa, is actually highly nested within Scleroglossa. This unconventional rooting does not seem to be due to long-branch attraction, base composition biases among taxa, or convergence caused by similar selective forces acting on nonsister taxa. Studies of functional tongue morphology and feeding mode have contrasted the similar states found in Sphenodon ( the nearest outgroup to squamates) and Iguania with those of Scleroglossa, but our findings suggest that similar states in Sphenodon and Iguania result from homoplasy. Snakes, amphisbaenians, and dibamid lizards, limbless forms whose phylogenetic positions historically have been impossible to place with confidence, are not grouped together and appear to have evolved this condition independently. Amphisbaenians are the sister group of lacertids, and dibamid lizards diverged early in squamate evolutionary history. Snakes are grouped with iguanians, lacertiforms, and anguimorphs, but are not nested within anguimorphs.

AB Prior research has demonstrated a strong association between the species of predators that co-occur with guppies and the evolution of guppy life histories. The evolution of these differences in life histories has been attributed to the higher mortality rates experienced by guppies in high-predation environments. Here, we evaluate whether there might be indirect effects of predation on the evolution of life-history patterns and whether there are environmental differences that are correlated with predation. To do so, we quantified features of the physical and chemical environment and the population biology of guppies from seven high-and low-predation localities. We found that high-predation environments tend to be larger streams with higher light levels and higher primary productivity, which should enhance food availability for guppies. We also found that guppy populations from high-predation environments have many more small individuals and fewer large individuals than those from low-predation environments, which is caused by their higher birth rates and death rates. Because of these differences in size distribution, guppies from high-predation environments have only one-fourth of the biomass per unit area, which should also enhance food availability for guppies in these localities. Guppies from high-predation sites allocate more resources to reproduction, grow faster, and attain larger asymptotic sizes, all of which are consistent with higher levels of resource availability. We conclude that guppies from high-predation environments experience higher levels of resource availability in part because of correlated differences in the environment (light levels, primary productivity) and in part as an indirect consequence of predation (death rates and biomass density). These differences in resource availability can, in turn, augment the effect of predator-induced mortality as factors that shape the evolution of guppy life-history patterns. We found no differences in the invertebrate communities from high- and low-predation localities, so we conclude that there do not appear to be multitrophic, indirect effects associated with these differences in predation.

AB During the past few years Archaea have been recognized as a widespread and significant component of marine picoplankton assemblages and, more recently, the presence of novel archaeal phylogenetic lineages has been reported in coastal marine benthic environments. We investigated the relative abundance, vertical distribution, phylogenetic composition, and spatial variability of Archaea in deep-sea sediments collected from several stations in the Atlantic Ocean. Quantitative oligonucleotide hybridization experiments indicated that the relative abundance of archaeal 16S rRNA in deep-sea sediments (1500 m deep) ranged from about 2.5 to 8% of the total prokaryotic rRNA. Clone libraries of PCR-amplified archaeal rRNA genes (rDNA) were constructed from 10 depth intervals obtained from sediment cores collected at depths of 1,500, 2,600, and 4,500 m. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences revealed the presence of a complex archaeal population structure, whose members could be grouped into discrete phylogenetic lineages within the two kingdoms, Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. Comparative denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile analysis of archaeal 16S rDNA V3 fragments revealed a significant depth-related variability in the composition of the archaeal population.

AB Global climate change is expected to affect temperature and precipitation patterns, oceanic and atmospheric circulation, rate of rising sea level, and the frequency, intensity, timing, and distribution of hurricanes and tropical storms. The magnitude of these projected physical changes and their subsequent impacts on coastal wetlands will vary regionally. Coastal wetlands in the southeastern United States have naturally evolved under a regime of rising sea level and specific patterns of hurricane frequency, intensity, and timing. A review of known ecological effects of tropical storms and hurricanes indicates that storm timing, frequency, and intensity can alter coastal wetland hydrology, geomorphology, biotic structure, energetics, and nutrient cycling. Research conducted to examine the impacts of Hurricane Hugo on colonial waterbirds highlights the importance of longterm studies for identifying complex interactions that may otherwise be dismissed as stochastic processes.
   Rising sea level and even modest changes in the frequency, intensity, timing, and distribution of tropical storms and hurricanes are expected to have substantial impacts on coastal wetland patterns and processes. Persistence of coastal wetlands will be determined by the interactions of climate and anthropogenic effects, especially how humans respond to rising sea level and how further human encroachment on coastal wetlands affects resource exploitation, pollution, and water use. Long-term changes in the frequency, intensity, timing, and distribution of hurricanes and tropical storms will likely affect biotic functions (e.g., community structure, natural selection, extinction rates, and biodiversity) as well as underlying processes such as nutrient cycling and primary and secondary productivity.
   Reliable predictions of global-change impacts on coastal wetlands will require better understanding of the linkages among terrestrial, aquatic, wetland, atmospheric, oceanic, and human components. Developing this comprehensive understanding of the ecological ramifications of global change will necessitate close coordination among scientists from multiple disciplines and a balanced mixture of appropriate scientific approaches. For example, insights may be gained through the careful design and implementation of broad-scale comparative studies that incorporate salient patterns and processes, including treatment of anthropogenic influences. Well-designed, broad-scale comparative studies could serve as the scientific framework for developing relevant and focused long-term ecological research, monitoring programs, experiments, and modeling studies. Two conceptual models of broad-scale comparative research for assessing ecological responses to climate change are presented: utilizing space-for-time substitution coupled with long-term studies to assess impacts of rising sea level and disturbance on coastal wetlands, and utilizing the moisture-continuum model for assessing the effects of global change and associated shifts in moisture regimes on wetland ecosystems. Increased understanding of climate change will require concerted scientific efforts aimed at facilitating interdisciplinary research, enhancing data and information management, and developing new funding strategies.

AB History shows that Caribbean coastal ecosystems were severely degraded long before ecologists began to study them. Large vertebrates such as the green turtle, hawksbill turtle, manatee and extinct Caribbean monk seal were decimated by about 1800 in the central and northern Caribbean, and by 1990 elsewhere. Subsistence over-fishing subsequently decimated reef fish populations. Local fisheries accounted for a small fraction of the fish consumed on Caribbean islands by about the mid nineteenth century when human populations were less than one fifth their numbers today. Herbivores and predators were reduced to very small fishes and sea urchins by the 1950s when intensive scientific investigations began. These small consumers, most notably Diadema antillarum, were apparently always very abundant; contrary to speculation that their abundance had increased many-fold due to overfishing. Studying grazing and predation on reefs today is like trying to understand the ecology of the Serengeti by studying the termites and the locusts while ignoring the elephants and the wildebeeste. Green turtles, hawksbill turtles and manatees were almost certainly comparably important keystone species on reefs and seagrass beds. Small fishes and invertebrates feed very differently from turtles and manatees and could and can not compensate for their loss, despite their great abundance long before overfishing began. Loss of megavertebrates dramatically reduced and qualitatively changed grazing and excavation of seagrasses, predation on sponges, loss of production to adjacent ecosystems, and the structure of food chains. Megavertebrates are critical for reef conservation and, unlike land, there are no coral reef livestock to take their place.

AB Two common features of biological communities are (a) complex interactions among species, which make community dynamics sensitive to initial conditions, and (b) spatial heterogeneity, which fragments large-scale ecological systems into a mosaic of patches, hereafter termed a "metacommunity." This computer simulation study examines the effect of complex interactions on the global and local dynamics of metacommunities. Patches are physically identical and differ only in the initial proportion of species that colonize the patches. The random variation is then magnified by deterministic interactions that cause patches to follow different trajectories based on initial conditions. After a period of interaction, individuals from all patches join a global pool of dispersers that colonize a new "generation" of patches.
   Complex interactions can have at least two important effects on metacommunity dynamics. First, the number of species coexisting in the metacommunity can greatly exceed the number of species coexisting in any single patch, despite the fact that the patches are physically identical, the species do not differ in colonization ability, and stochastic effects are absent after the colonization stage. Second, complex interactions provide a new source of variation upon which natural selection can operate at the patch level, providing a mechanism for the evolution of functionally organized communities.

AB The ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) enzymes are secreted, multi-domain matrix-associated zinc metalloendopeptidases that have diverse roles in tissue morphogenesis and patho-physiological remodeling, in inflammation and in vascular biology. The human family includes 19 members that can be sub-grouped on the basis of their known substrates, namely the aggrecanases or proteoglycanases (ADAMTS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 15 and 20), the procollagen N-propeptidases (ADAMTS2, 3 and 14), the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-cleaving enzymes (ADAMTS7 and 12), the von-Willebrand Factor proteinase (ADAMTS13) and a group of orphan enzymes (ADAMTS6, 10, 16, 17, 18 and 19). Control of the structure and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a central theme of the biology of the ADAMTS, as exemplified by the actions of the procollagen-N-propeptidases in collagen fibril assembly and of the aggrecanases in the cleavage or modification of ECM proteoglycans. Defects in certain family members give rise to inherited genetic disorders, while the aberrant expression or function of others is associated with arthritis, cancer and cardiovascular disease. In particular, ADAMTS4 and 5 have emerged as therapeutic targets in arthritis. Multiple ADAMTSs from different sub-groupings exert either positive or negative effects on tumorigenesis and metastasis, with both metalloproteinase-dependent and -independent actions known to occur. The basic ADAMTS structure comprises a metalloproteinase catalytic domain and a carboxy-terminal ancillary domain, the latter determining substrate specificity and the localization of the protease and its interaction partners; ancillary domains probably also have independent biological functions. Focusing primarily on the aggrecanases and proteoglycanases, this review provides a perspective on the evolution of the ADAMTS family, their links with developmental and disease mechanisms, and key questions for the future.

AB Soils are the product of the activities of plants, which supply organic matter and play a pivotal role in weathering rocks and minerals. Many plant species have a distinct ecological amplitude that shows restriction to specific soil types. In the numerous interactions between plants and soil, microorganisms also play a key role. Here we review the existing literature on interactions between plants, microorganisms and soils, and include considerations of evolutionary time scales, where possible. Some of these interactions involve intricate systems of communication, which in the case of symbioses such as the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis are several hundreds of millions years old; others involve the release of exudates from roots, and other products of rhizodeposition that are used as substrates for soil microorganisms. The possible reasons for the survival value of this loss of carbon over tens or hundreds of millions of years of evolution of higher plants are discussed, taking a cost-benefit approach. Co-evolution of plants and rhizosphere microorganisms is discussed, in the light of known ecological interactions between various partners in terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, the role of higher plants, especially deep-rooted plants and associated microorganisms in the weathering of rocks and minerals, ultimately contributing to pedogenesis, is addressed. We show that rhizosphere processes in the long run are central to biogeochemical cycles, soil formation and Earth history. Major anticipated discoveries will enhance our basic understanding and allow applications of new knowledge to deal with nutrient deficiencies, pests and diseases, and the challenges of increasing global food production and agroecosystem productivity in an environmentally responsible manner.

AB The application of molecular systematics to the anisakid nematodes of the genera Anisokis, Pseudoterranova and Contracoecum, parasites of aquatic organisms, over the last two decades, has advanced the understanding of their systematics, taxonomy, ecology and phylogeny substantially. Here the results of this effort on this group of species from the early genetic works to the current status of their revised taxonomy, ecology and evolutionary aspects are reviewed for each of three parasitic groups. It has been shown that many anisakid morphospecies of Anisakis, Contracaecum and Pseudoterranova include a certain number of sibling species. Molecular genetic markers provided a rapid, precise means to screen and identify several species that serve as definitive and intermediate and or/paratenic hosts of the so far genetically characterized species. Patterns of differential distribution of anisakid nematodes in various definitive and intermediate hosts are presented. Differences in the life history of related species can be due both to differential host-parasite co-adaptation and co-evolution, and/or to interspecific competition, that can reduce the range of potential hosts in sympatric conditions. Phylogenetic hypotheses attempted for anisakid nematodes and the possible evolutionary scenarios that have been proposed inferred from molecular data, also with respect to the phylogeny of their hosts are presented for the parasite-host associations Anisakis-cetaceans and Controcaecum-pinnipeds, showing that codivergence and host-switching events could have accompanied the evolution of these groups of parasites.
   Finally, examples in which anisakid nematodes recognized genetically at the species level in definitive and intermediate/paratenic hosts from various geographical areas of the Boreal and Austral regions and their infection levels have been used as biological indicators of fish stocks and food-web integrity in areas at high versus low levels of habitat disturbance (pollution, overfishing, by-catch) are presented.

AB The coupled carbon-climate models reported in the literature all demonstrate a positive feedback between terrestrial carbon cycles and climate warming. A primary mechanism underlying the modeled positive feedback is the kinetic sensitivity of photosynthesis and respiration to temperature. Field experiments, however, suggest much richer mechanisms driving ecosystem responses to climate warming, including extended growing seasons, enhanced nutrient availability, shifted species composition, and altered ecosystem-water dynamics. The diverse mechanisms likely define more possibilities of carbon-climate feedbacks than projected by the kinetics-based models. Nonetheless, experimental results are so variable that we have not generated the necessary insights on ecosystem responses to effectively improve global models. To constrain model projections of carbon-climate feedbacks, we need more empirical data from whole-ecosystem warming experiments across a wide range of biomes, particularly in tropic regions, and closer interactions between models and experiments.

AB Top predators often have powerful direct effects on prey populations, but whether these direct effects propagate to the base of terrestrial food webs is debated. There are few examples of trophic cascades strong enough to alter the abundance and composition of entire plant communities. We show that the introduction of arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) to the Aleutian archipelago induced strong shifts in plant productivity and community structure via a previously unknown pathway. By preying on seabirds, foxes reduced nutrient transport from ocean to land, affecting soil fertility and transforming grasslands to dwarf shrub/forb-dominated ecosystems.

Here we describe the foraging patterns of free-ranging spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) in the forest of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico and find that these patterns closely resemble what physicists know as Levy walks. First, the length of a trajectory's constituent steps, or continuous moves in the same direction, is best described by a power-law distribution in which the frequency of ever larger steps decreases as a negative power function of their length. The rate of this decrease is very close to that predicted by a previous analytical Levy walk model to be an optimal strategy to search for scarce resources distributed at random. Second, the frequency distribution of the duration of stops or waiting times also approximates to a power-law function. Finally, the mean square displacement during the monkeys' first foraging trip increases more rapidly than would be expected from a random walk with constant step length, but within the range predicted for Levy walks. In view of these results, we analyze the different exponents characterizing the trajectories described by females and males, and by monkeys on their own and when part of a subgroup. We discuss the origin of these patterns and their implications for the foraging ecology of spider monkeys.

AB The sustainable use of resources requires that management practices and institutions take into account the dynamics of the ecosystem. In this paper, we explore the role of local ecological knowledge and show how it is used in management practices by a local fishing association in a contemporary rural Swedish community. We focus on the local management of crapfish, a common-pool resource, and also address the way crapfish management is linked to institutions at different levels of Swedish society, Methods from the social sciences were used for information gathering, and the results were analyzed within the framework of esosystem management. We found that the practices of local fishing association resemble an ecosystem approach to crayfish management. Our results indicate that local users have substantial knowledge of resource and ecosystem dynamics from the level of the individual crayfish to that of the watershed, as reflected in a variety of interrelated management practices embedded in and influenced by institutions at several levels. We propose that this policy of monitoring at several levels simultaneously, together with the interpretation of a bundle of indicators and associated management responses, enhances the possibility of building ecological resilience into the watershed. Furthermore, we found that flexibility and adaptation are required to avoid command-and-control pathways of resource management. We were able to trace the development of the local fishing association as a response to crisis, followed by the creation of an opportunity for reorganization and the recognition of slow ecosystem structuring variables, and also to define the role of knowledgeable individuals in the whole process. We discuss the key roles of adaptive capacity, institutional learning, and institutional memory for successful ecosystem management and conclude that scientific adaptive management could benefit from a more explicit collaboration with flexible community-based systems of resource management for the implementation of policies as experiments.

AB One of the greatest challenges for evolutionary biology is explaining the widespread occurrence of sexual reproduction and the associated process of genetic recombination. A large number of theories have been developed that provide a sufficient short-term advantage for sex to offset its two-fold cost. These theories can be broadly classified into environmental (or ecological) and mutation-based models. Traditionally, the different theories have been viewed as competing, and empirical work has attempted to distinguish between them. Here we highlight the advantages that may be gained from considering that multiple mechanisms (environmental and mutational) may be at work, and that interactions between the theories may be very important.

AB The fixation of new deleterious mutations is analyzed for a randomly mating population of constant size with no environmental or demographic stochasticity. Mildly deleterious mutations are far more important in causing loss of fitness and eventual extinction than are lethal and semilethal mutations in populations with effective sizes, N-e, larger than a few individuals. If all mildly deleterious mutations have the same selection coefficient, s against heterozygotes and 2s against homozygotes, the mean time to extinction, (t) over bar, is asympototically proportional to e(4Nes)/N-e for 4N(e)s > 1. Nearly neutral mutations pose the greatest risk of extinction for stable populations, because the magnitude of selection coefficient that minimizes (t) over bar is about (s) over cap = 0.4/N-e. The influence of variance in selection coefficients among mutations is analyzed assuming a gamma distribution of s, with mean (s) over bar and variance sigma(s)(2). The mean time to extinction increases with variance in selection coefficients if (s) over bar is near (s) over cap, but can decrease greatly if (s) over bar is much larger than (s) over cap. For a given coefficient of variation of s, c = sigma(s)/(s) over bar, the mean time to extinction is asymptotically proportional to N-e(1+/c2) for 4N(e) (s) over bar > 1. When s is exponentially distributed, (c = 1) (t) over bar is asymptotically proportional to N-e(2). These results in conjunction with data on the rate and magnitude of mildly deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster indicate that even moderately large populations, with effective sizes on the order of N-e = 10(3), may incur a substantial risk of extinction from the fixation of new mutations.

AB The net effects of interspecific species interactions on individuals and populations vary in both sign (-, 0, +) and magnitude (strong to weak). Interaction outcomes are context-dependent when the sign and/or magnitude change as a function of the biotic or abiotic context. While context dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature is poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify variation in species interaction outcomes (competition, mutualism, or predation) for 247 published articles. Contrary to our expectations, variation in the magnitude of effect sizes did not differ among species interactions, and while mutualism was most likely to change sign across contexts (and predation least likely), mutualism did not strongly differ from competition. Both the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied the most along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a function of the presence/absence of a third species. However, the degree of context dependency across these context types was not consistent among mutualism, competition and predation studies. Surprisingly, study location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context dependency, with laboratory studies showing the highest variation in outcomes. We urge that studying context dependency per se, rather than focusing only on mean outcomes, can provide a general method for describing patterns of variation in nature.

AB We report a new web server, aLeaves (http://aleaves.cdb.riken.jp/), for homologue collection from diverse animal genomes. In molecular comparative studies involving multiple species, orthology identification is the basis on which most subsequent biological analyses rely. It can be achieved most accurately by explicit phylogenetic inference. More and more species are subjected to large-scale sequencing, but the resultant resources are scattered in independent project-based, and multi-species, but separate, web sites. This complicates data access and is becoming a serious barrier to the comprehensiveness of molecular phylogenetic analysis. aLeaves, launched to overcome this difficulty, collects sequences similar to an input query sequence from various data sources. The collected sequences can be passed on to the MAFFT sequence alignment server (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/), which has been significantly improved in interactivity. This update enables to switch between (i) sequence selection using the Archaeopteryx tree viewer, (ii) multiple sequence alignment and (iii) tree inference. This can be performed as a loop until one reaches a sensible data set, which minimizes redundancy for better visibility and handling in phylogenetic inference while covering relevant taxa. The work flow achieved by the seamless link between aLeaves and MAFFT provides a convenient online platform to address various questions in zoology and evolutionary biology.

AB Increasing evidence has emerged for non-random spatial distributions of microbes, but knowledge of the processes that cause variation in microbial assemblage among ecosystems is lacking. For instance, some studies showed that deterministic processes such as habitat specialization are important, while other studies hold that bacterial communities are assembled by stochastic forces. Here we examine the relative influence of deterministic and stochastic processes for bacterial communities from subsurface environments, stream biofilm, lake water, lake sediment and soil using pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. We show that there is a general pattern in phylogenetic signal in species ecological niches across recent evolutionary time for all studied habitats, enabling us to infer the influences of community assembly processes from patterns of phylogenetic turnover in community composition. The phylogenetic dissimilarities among-habitat types were significantly higher than within them, and the communities were clustered according to their original habitat types. For communities within-habitat types, the highest phylogenetic turnover rate through space was observed in subsurface environments, followed by stream biofilm on mountainsides, whereas the sediment assemblages across regional scales showed the lowest turnover rate. Quantifying phylogenetic turnover as the deviation from a null expectation suggested that measured environmental variables imposed strong selection on bacterial communities for nearly all sample groups. For three sample groups, spatial distance reflected unmeasured environmental variables that impose selection, as opposed to spatial isolation. Such characterization of spatial and environmental variables proved essential for proper interpretation of partial Mantel results based on observed beta diversity metrics. In summary, our results clearly indicate a dominant role of deterministic processes on bacterial assemblages and highlight that bacteria show strong habitat associations that have likely emerged through evolutionary adaptation.

In particular, SNPs are dense throughout the genome of most organisms and are commonly observed in functional genes making them ideal markers to study adaptive molecular variation. This approach has become commonly employed in ecological and population genetics studies to detect outlier loci that are putatively under selection. However, there are several challenges to address with outlier approaches including genotyping errors, underlying population structure and false positives, variation in mutation rate and limited sensitivity (false negatives). In this study, we evaluated multiple outlier tests and their type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) error rates in a series of simulated data sets. Comparisons included simulation procedures (FDIST2, arlequin v.3.5 and BAYESCAN) as well as more conventional tools such as global F-ST histograms. Of the three simulation methods, FDIST2 and BAYESCAN typically had the lowest type II error, BAYESCAN had the least type I error and Arlequin had highest type I and II error. High error rates in Arlequin with a hierarchical approach were partially because of confounding scenarios where patterns of adaptive variation were contrary to neutral structure; however, Arlequin consistently had highest type I and type II error in all four simulation scenarios tested in this study. Given the results provided here, it is important that outlier loci are interpreted cautiously and error rates of various methods are taken into consideration in studies of adaptive molecular variation, especially when hierarchical structure is included.

AB Peatlands, soils and the ocean floor are well-recognized as sites of organic carbonaccumulation andrepresentimportant global carbon sinks(1,2). Although the annual burial of organic carbon in lakes and reservoirs exceeds that of ocean sediments(3), these inland waters are components of the global carbon cycle that receive only limited attention(4-6). Of the organic carbon that is being deposited onto the sediments, a certain proportion will be mineralized and the remainder will be buried over geological timescales. Here we assess the relationship between sediment organic carbon mineralization and temperature in a cross-system survey of boreal lakes in Sweden, and with input froma compilation of published data from awide range of lakes that differ with respect to climate, productivity and organic carbon source. We find that the mineralization of organic carbon in lake sediments exhibits a strongly positive relationship with temperature, which suggests that warmer water temperatures lead to more mineralization and less organic carbon burial. Assuming that future organic carbon delivery to the lake sediments will be similar to that under present-day conditions, we estimate that temperature increases following the latest scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7) could result in a 4-27 per cent (0.9-6.4 Tg Cyr(-1)) decrease in annual organic carbon burial in boreal lakes.

AB Aim
   Shifts in species ranges are a predicted and realized effect of global climate change; however, few studies have addressed the rates and consequence of such shifts, particularly in marine systems. Given ecological similarities between shifting and introduced species, we examined how our understanding of range shifts may be informed by the more established study of non-native species introductions.
   Location
   Marine systems world-wide.
   Methods
   Database and citation searches were used to identify 129 marine species experiencing range shifts and to determine spread rates and impacts on recipient communities. Analyses of spread rates were based on studies for which post-establishment spread was reported in linear distance. The sizes of the effects of community impacts of shifting species were compared with those of functionally similar introduced species having ecologically similar impacts.
   Results
   Our review and meta-analyses revealed that: (1) 75% of the range shifts found through the database search were in the poleward direction, consistent with climate change scenarios, (2) spread rates of range shifts were lower than those of introductions, (3) shifting species spread over an order of magnitude faster in marine than in terrestrial systems, and (4) directions of community effects were largely negative and magnitudes were often similar for shifters and introduced species; however, this comparison was limited by few data for range-shifting species.
   Main conclusions
   Although marine range shifts are likely to proceed more slowly than marine introductions, the community-level effects could be as great, and in the same direction, as those of introduced species. Because it is well-established that introduced species are a primary threat to global biodiversity, it follows that, just like introductions, range shifts have the potential to seriously affect biological systems. In addition, given that ranges shift faster in marine than terrestrial environments, marine communities might be affected faster than terrestrial ones as species shift with climate change. Regardless of habitat, consideration of range shifts in the context of invasion biology can improve our understanding of what to expect from climate change-driven shifts as well as provide tools for formal assessment of risks to community structure and function.

AB Soil respiration - R-S, the flux of CO2 from the soil to the atmosphere - is probably the least well constrained component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Here we introduce the SRDB database, a near-universal compendium of published R-S data, and make it available to the scientific community both as a traditional static archive and as a dynamic community database that may be updated over time by interested users. The database encompasses all published studies that report one of the following data measured in the field (not laboratory): annual R-S, mean seasonal R-S, a seasonal or annual partitioning of R-S into its sources fluxes, R-S temperature response (Q(10)), or R-S at 10 A degrees C. Its orientation is thus to seasonal and annual fluxes, not shorter-term or chamber-specific measurements. To date, data from 818 studies have been entered into the database, constituting 3379 records. The data span the measurement years 1961-2007 and are dominated by temperate, well-drained forests. We briefly examine some aspects of the SRDB data - its climate space coverage, mean annual R-S fluxes and their correlation with other carbon fluxes, R-S variability, temperature sensitivities, and the partitioning of R-S source flux - and suggest some potential lines of research that could be explored using these data. The SRDB database is available online in a permanent archive as well as via a project-hosting repository; the latter source leverages open-source software technologies to encourage wider participation in the database's future development. Ultimately, we hope that the updating of, and corrections to, the SRDB will become a shared project, managed by the users of these data in the scientific community.

AB Climate change will impact coral-reef fishes through effects on individual performance, trophic linkages, recruitment dynamics, population connectivity and other ecosystem processes. The most immediate impacts will be a loss of diversity and changes to fish community composition as a result of coral bleaching. Coral-dependent fishes suffer the most rapid population declines as coral is lost; however, many other species will exhibit long-term declines due to loss of settlement habitat and erosion of habitat structural complexity. Increased ocean temperature will affect the physiological performance and behaviour of coral reef fishes, especially during their early life history. Small temperature increases might favour larval development, but this could be counteracted by negative effects on adult reproduction. Already variable recruitment will become even more unpredictable. This will make optimal harvest strategies for coral reef fisheries more difficult to determine and populations more susceptible to overfishing. A substantial number of species could exhibit range shifts, with implications for extinction risk of small-range species near the margins of reef development. There are critical gaps in our knowledge of how climate change will affect tropical marine fishes. Predictions are often based on temperate examples, which may be inappropriate for tropical species. Improved projections of how ocean currents and primary productivity will change are needed to better predict how reef fish population dynamics and connectivity patterns will change. Finally, the potential for adaptation to climate change needs more attention. Many coral reef fishes have geographical ranges spanning a wide temperature gradient and some have short generation times. These characteristics are conducive to acclimation or local adaptation to climate change and provide hope that the more resilient species will persist if immediate action is taken to stabilize Earth's climate.

AB The effects of elevated carbon dioxide on plant-herbivore interactions have been summarized in a number of narrative reviews and metaanalyses, while accompanying elevation of temperature has not received sufficient attention. The goal of our study is to search, by means of metaanalysis, for a general pattern in responses of herbivores, and plant characteristics important for herbivores, to simultaneous experimental increase of carbon dioxide and temperature (ECET) in comparison with both ambient conditions and responses to elevated CO2 (EC) and temperature (ET) applied separately. Our database includes 42 papers describing studies of 31 plant species and seven herbivore species. Nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio in plants decreased under both EC and ECET treatments, whereas ET had no significant effect. Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates and phenolics increased in EC, decreased in ET and did not change in ECET treatments, whereas terpenes did not respond to EC but increased in both ET and ECET; leaf toughness increased in both EC and ECET. Responses of defensive secondary compounds to treatments differed between woody and green tissues as well as between gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Insect herbivore performance was adversely affected by EC, favoured by ET, and not modified by ECET. Our analysis allowed to distinguish three types of relationships between CO2 and temperature elevation: (1) responses to EC do not depend on temperature (nitrogen, C/N, leaf toughness, phenolics in angiosperm leaves), (2) responses to EC are mitigated by ET (sugars and starch, terpenes in needles of gymnosperms, insect performance) and (3) effects emerge only under ECET (nitrogen in gymnosperms, and phenolics and terpenes in woody tissues). This result indicates that conclusions of CO2 elevation studies cannot be directly extrapolated to a more realistic climate change scenario. The predicted negative effects of CO2 elevation on herbivores are likely to be mitigated by temperature increase.

AB Temperature affects everything that an organism does. Although we have an increasingly sophisticated understanding of evolutionary adaptation to temperature at the molecular level for some cellular processes, we still know little about evolutionary temperature adaptation in gene expression, cell-cycle control or growth, all of which influence organism performance and fitness. Recent studies have shown that the physiological costs of evolutionary temperature adaptation vary with body temperature. Here, I argue that this macroecological pattern has powerful consequences for life-history theory, and probably also for food-web dynamics, biological diversity and biotic response to climate change. The relationships among evolution, temperature and ecology are multivariate, hierarchical and complex making evolutionary physiology at the macroecological scale an exciting and challenging agenda for the next decade.

AB A food web customarily describes the qualitative feeding relationships in a community. Descriptors have been used to extract ecologically meaningful information from such data. e.g., the proportion of top species (the proportion of taxa without consumers) or vulnerability (the average number of consumers per taxon). Analyses of collections of food webs based on these properties have revealed regularities that fostered the formulation of models of food-web structure. However, it has been shown that most of these qualitative descriptors are highly sensitive to the varying levels of sampling effort used to document a food web. The principal problem is that webs described extensively include trophic links of highly uneven magnitude, with typically few strong/important links and a wealth of weak ones; with qualitative descriptors, the same weight is given to all trophic interactions. To overcome this problem, food webs should be described and analyzed quantitatively. Consequently, we propose here a suite of food-web descriptors, which are built on information-theory indices and take the magnitude of the trophic interactions into account. We define descriptors having a similar meaning as the classical qualitative indices. Two versions of each quantitative descriptor are proposed, one giving the same weight to each taxon, and one weighting each taxon by the total amount of its incoming and outgoing biomass flows. We use a published quantitative food web to exemplify the computation of the new descriptors, and discuss their potential and limitations.

AB Fishing affects the seabed habitat worldwide on the continental shelf. These impacts are patchily distributed according to the spatial and temporal variation in fishing effort that results from fishers' behaviour. As a consequence, the frequency and intensity of fishing disturbance varies among different habitat types. Different fishing methodologies vary in the degree to which they affect the seabed. Structurally complex habitats (e.g. seagrass meadows, biogenic reefs) and those that are relatively undisturbed by natural perturbations (e.g. deep-water mud substrata) are more adversely affected by fishing than unconsolidated sediment habitats that occur in shallow coastal waters. These habitats also have the longest recovery trajectories in terms of the recolonization of the habitat by the associated fauna. Comparative studies of areas of the seabed that have experienced different levels of fishing activity demonstrate that chronic fishing disturbance leads to the removal of high-biomass species that are composed mostly of emergent seabed organisms. Contrary to the belief of fishers that fishing enhances seabed production and generates food for target fish species, productivity is actually lowered as fishing intensity increases and high-biomass species are removed from the benthic habitat. These organisms also increase the topographic complexity of the seabed which has been shown to provide shelter for juvenile fishes, reducing their vulnerability to predation. Conversely, scavengers and small-bodied organisms, such as polychaete worms, dominate heavily fished areas. Major changes in habitat can lead to changes in the composition of the resident fish fauna. Fishing has indirect effects on habitat through the removal of predators that control bio-engineering organisms such as algal-grazing urchins. Fishing gear resuspend the upper layers of sedimentary seabed habitats and hence remobilize contaminants and fine particulate matter into the water column. The ecological significance of these fishing effects has not yet been determined but could have implications for eutrophication and biogeochemical cycling. Simulation results suggest that the effects of low levels of trawling disturbance will be similar to those of natural bioturbators. In contrast, high levels of trawling disturbance cause sediment systems to become unstable due to large carbon fluxes between oxic and anoxic carbon compartments. In low energy habitats, intensive trawling disturbance may destabilize benthic system chemical fluxes, which has the potential to propagate more widely through the marine ecosystem. Management regimes that aim to incorporate both fisheries and habitat conservation objectives can be achieved through the appropriate use of a number of approaches, including total and partial exclusion of towed bottom fishing gears, and seasonal and rotational closure techniques. However, the inappropriate use of closed areas may displace fishing activities into habitats that are more vulnerable to disturbance than those currently trawled by fishers. In many cases, the behaviour of fishers constrains the extent of the impact of their fishing activities. Management actions that force them to redistribute their effort may be more damaging in the longer term.

AB Our objective was to infer the controls of spatial variation in historical fire regimes. We reconstructed a multicentury history of fire frequency, size, season, and severity from fire scars and establishment dates of 1426 trees sampled on grids in four watersheds (similar to 64 plots, over similar to 1620 ha each) representative of the Blue Mountains, Oregon and Washington, USA. The influence of regional climate, a top-down control, was inferred from among-watershed variation in fire regimes, while the influence of local topography, a bottom-up control, was inferred from within-watershed variation. Before about 1900, fire regimes varied among and within watersheds, suggesting that both top-down and bottom-up controls were important. At the regional scale, dry forests (dominated by ponderosa pine), burned twice as frequently and earlier in the growing season in southern watersheds than in northern watersheds, consistent with longer and drier fire seasons to the south. Mesic forests (dominated by subalpine fir or grand fir) probably also burned more frequently to the south. At the local scale, fire frequency varied with different parameters of topography in watersheds with steep terrain, but not in the watershed with gentle terrain. Frequency varied with aspect in watersheds where topographic facets are separated by significant barriers to fire spread, but not in watersheds where such facets interfinger without fire barriers. Frequency varied with elevation where elevation and aspect interact to create gradients in snow-cover duration and also where steep talus interrupts fuel continuity. Frequency did not vary with slope within any watershed. The presence of both regional-scale and local-scale variation in the Blue Mountains suggests that top-down and bottom-up controls were both important and acted simultaneously to influence fire regimes in the past. However, an abrupt decline in fire frequency around 1900 was much greater than any regional or local variation in the previous several centuries and indicates that 20th-century fire regimes in these watersheds were dramatically affected by additional controls such as livestock grazing and fire suppression. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of examining spatial variation in historical fire regimes across scales as a means for inferring their controls.

AB The ability to recognize and repair abnormal DNA structures is common to all forms of life. Studies in a variety of species have identified an incredible diversity of DNA repair pathways. Documenting and characterizing the similarities and differences in repair between species has important value for understanding the origin and evolution of repair pathways as well as for improving our understanding of phenotypes affected by repair (e.g., mutation rates, lifespan, tumorigenesis, survival in extreme environments). Unfortunately, while repair processes have been studied in quite a few species. the ecological and evolutionary diversity of such studies has been limited. Complete genome sequences can provide potential sources of new information about repair in different species. Ln this paper, we present a global comparative analysis of DNA repair proteins and processes based upon the analysis of available complete genome sequences. We use a new form of analysis that combines genome sequence information and phylogenetic studies into a composite analysis we refer to as phylogenomics. We use this phylogenomic analysis to study the evolution of repair proteins and processes and to predict the repair phenotypes of those species for which we now know the complete genome sequence.

AB 1. We analysed the relationships between species richness, island area, and habitat diversity for birds, bats, butterflies, and reptiles and amphibians on 19 islands in the Lesser Antilles. Habitat diversity was quantified by Simpson's index based on the total areas of five vegetation types on each island. Island area varied over two orders of magnitude (13-1510 km(2)) and habitat diversity varied between 1 and 3.7 equivalents of equally abundant habitat types.
   2. Because the Lesser Antilles consist of an inner are of high, volcanic islands and an outer are of low-lying islands formed of uplifted marine sediments, correlations between area and elevation (r(2) = 0.32) and between area and habitat diversity (r(2) = 0.40) were weak. Habitat diversity was, however, strongly correlated with maximum island elevation (r(2) = 0.85).
   3. Simple correlations of species richness with island area were significant for all four faunal groups, and simple correlations of species richness with elevation and habitat were significant for all groups except bats. In multiple regressions of species richness on area and habitat diversity together, area was a significant effect for birds and bats, and habitat diversity was a significant effect for birds, butterflies, and reptiles and amphibians.
   4. These results suggest that the four Lesser Antillean taxonomic groups differ in their responses to area and habitat diversity. For butterflies and for reptiles and amphibians, the relationship of species richness to area is probably a fortuitous consequence of a relationship between habitat diversity and area. Bird species richness responds independently to both habitat diversity and area, and bat species richness is influenced by area but not by habitat diversity.
   5. We suggest that this variation is related to differences in several biological traits of the different faunal groups. Strong habitat-diversity effects are likely in taxa with high degrees of habitat specialization, populations large enough to have a low probability of stochastic extinction, life-cycles that include a resistant resting stage that reduces vulnerability to catastrophic extinction, or a combination of these traits. In contrast, strong: area effects are likely in taxa with weak habitat specialization, low population density, or both.
   6. At least in Lesser Antillean birds, it is unlikely that immigration depends on island size. Therefore, the species-area relationship for birds is probably generated by island-size-dependent extinction. Among the four taxonomic groups we studied, only butterflies are likely to show a 'rescue effect' stemming from frequent between-island movement of individuals, as only butterflies exhibited low levels of endemism and lacked a unique area effect for species richness.
   7. Considered in concert, these taxon-specific differences demonstrate that both biological characteristics of organisms and geographical features of island groups mediate the relative contribution of island area and habitat diversity to variation in species richness.

AB Quantitative reconstruction of the area cleared of forest in the past is essential to assess the possible indirect anthropogenic impacts on the past environment of Europe, including past climate. We apply a simulation model of pollen dispersal and deposition (1) to re-examine the relationship between pollen and landscape openness, often uncritically inferred from non-arboreal pollen (NAP) percentages done, and (2) to predict the relevant source area of pollen, the smallest spatial scale of vegetation that can be reconstructed from pollen records. The simulations use landscapes simplified from the modem open agricultural and semi-open forested regions in southern Sweden where traditional cultural landscapes still remain. The model is appropriate, because the simulated pollen assemblages resemble the pollen assemblages observed in each of the two landscape types, and because the simulated relationships between NAP percentages and percentage cover of open land within 1000 m agree with the empirical relationships. The simulated relevant source area of pollen is the area within 800-1000 m from both small hollows and 3-ha ponds. NAP percentages give only a rough first approximation of the percentage cover of open land. More comprehensive methods will be required to obtain quantitative estimates of open land from fossil pollen.

AB Human agency is considered a key factor in determining how individuals and society respond to environmental change. This article synthesizes knowledge on agency, capacity, and resilience across human development, well-being, and disasters literature to provide insights to support more integrated and human-centered approaches to understanding environmental change. It draws out the key areas of agreement across these diverse fields and identifies the main points of contestation and uncertainty. This highlights the need to consider subjective and relational factors in addition to objective measures of capacity and to view these as reflexive and dynamic, as well as differentiated socially and temporally. These findings can help distinguish between coping, adaptation, and transformation as responses to environmental and other stressors.

AB P>1. Functional traits have been extensively used to describe, group and rank species according to their functions. There is now growing evidence that intraspecific functional variability, as well as interspecific variability, can have significant effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. A core hypothesis for the use of functional traits expressed as species means, that their intraspecific variability is negligible compared with their interspecific variability, has however been too rarely tested empirically. We then addressed four questions: Is intraspecific functional variability across species ranges negligible compared with interspecific variability? Are the major resource economics trade-off and functional strategies robust to individual trait variability? Are species rankings or ordination robust across species ranges once considering intraspecific variability? Can species be discriminated by their leaf traits?
   2. Using an environmentally stratified sampling design within an alpine catchment, we collected five functional traits for 13 common plant species with contrasting life histories and traits. Several populations from a range of environmental conditions were then sampled for each species across their ranges.
   3. With an original combination of single-trait and multi-trait analyses, we highlighted a non-negligible contribution of intraspecific variability to overall functional trait variability (similar to 30%). Although not affecting general and well-known functional trade-offs and strategies, intraspecific functional variability had the potential to alter species ordination and produced a functional continuum rather than a clear-cut species classification.
   4. Deciding whether intraspecific functional variability can be considered as negligible - species being represented by mean trait values -, or not - species being represented by multivariate trait distributions -, is an essential question for multiple ecological issues. However, this decision cannot be generic, but will depend on the studied system and selected traits and species, as well as on study objectives.

AB Biodiversity and its responses to environmental changes are central issues in ecology and for society. Almost all microbial biodiversity research focuses on "species" richness and abundance but not on their interactions. Although a network approach is powerful in describing ecological interactions among species, defining the network structure in a microbial community is a great challenge. Also, although the stimulating effects of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on plant growth and primary productivity are well established, its influences on belowground microbial communities, especially microbial interactions, are poorly understood. Here, a random matrix theory (RMT)-based conceptual framework for identifying functional molecular ecological networks was developed with the high-throughput functional gene array hybridization data of soil microbial communities in a long-term grassland FACE (free air, CO2 enrichment) experiment. Our results indicate that RMT is powerful in identifying functional molecular ecological networks in microbial communities. Both functional molecular ecological networks under eCO(2) and ambient CO2 (aCO(2)) possessed the general characteristics of complex systems such as scale free, small world, modular, and hierarchical. However, the topological structures of the functional molecular ecological networks are distinctly different between eCO(2) and aCO(2), at the levels of the entire communities, individual functional gene categories/groups, and functional genes/sequences, suggesting that eCO(2) dramatically altered the network interactions among different microbial functional genes/populations. Such a shift in network structure is also significantly correlated with soil geochemical variables. In short, elucidating network interactions in microbial communities and their responses to environmental changes is fundamentally important for research in microbial ecology, systems microbiology, and global change.
   IMPORTANCE Microorganisms are the foundation of the Earth's biosphere and play integral and unique roles in various ecosystem processes and functions. In an ecosystem, various microorganisms interact with each other to form complicated networks. Elucidating network interactions and their responses to environmental changes is difficult due to the lack of appropriate experimental data and an appropriate theoretical framework. This study provides a conceptual framework to construct interaction networks in microbial communities based on high-throughput functional gene array hybridization data. It also first documents that elevated carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dramatically alters the network interactions in soil microbial communities, which could have important implications in assessing the responses of ecosystems to climate change. The conceptual framework developed allows microbiologists to address research questions unapproachable previously by focusing on network interactions beyond the listing of, e.g., the number and abundance of species. Thus, this study could represent transformative research and a paradigm shift in microbial ecology.

AB Speciation is characterized by the evolution of reproductive isolation between two groups of organisms. Understanding the process of speciation requires the quantification of barriers to reproductive isolation, dissection of the genetic mechanisms that contribute to those barriers and determination of the forces driving the evolution of those barriers. Through a comprehensive analysis involving 19 pairs of plant taxa, we assessed the strength and patterns of asymmetry of multiple prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolating barriers. We then reviewed contemporary knowledge of the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and the relative role of chromosomal and genic factors in intrinsic postzygotic isolation. On average, we found that prezygotic isolation is approximately twice as strong as postzygotic isolation, and that postmating barriers are approximately three times more asymmetrical in their action than premating barriers. Barriers involve a variable number of loci, and chromosomal rearrangements may have a limited direct role in reproductive isolation in plants. Future research should aim to understand the relationship between particular genetic loci and the magnitude of their effect on reproductive isolation in nature, the geographical scale at which plant speciation occurs, and the role of different evolutionary forces in the speciation process.

AB The assumption that the acute response to stress is adaptive is pervasive in the literature, but there is little direct evidence regarding potential positive fitness consequences of an acute stress response. If acute glucocorticoid (CC) elevation increases lifetime reproductive success (fitness) in what contexts, does this occur, and through what combination of effects on annual reproductive output and interannual survival? Here we examine the framework under which most comparative acute CC studies fall, evaluate the commonalities of those studies in the light of expected fitness effects, and suggest methods to better examine the potentially beneficial effects of the acute CC response for free living animals. An overwhelming majority of papers from this area examine environmental-physiological-social effects on CC reactivity. Fewer evaluate intermediate performance measures (fitness proxies). We could only find 11 that directly examine CC effects on reproductive output and survival. The environment-CC-performance papers suggest that greater CC reactivity favors self-maintenance behavior (survival) at the expense of current reproduction. However, the two studies that directly address CC reactivity and fitness (2 of the 11) find the opposite effect (greater CC reactivity predicts lower annual survival). We suggest that it is time to move past simple evaluation of factors regulating CC secretion. These studies will be much richer and informative if researchers include performance and fitness measures. We especially support incorporating and testing ideas of context dependency, coping strategies, and possible fluctuating selection pressures when considering the fitness benefits of the acute CC response.

AB It is almost certainly the case that many populations have always existed as metapopulations, leading to the conclusion that local extinctions are common and normally balanced by migrations. This conclusion has major consequences for biodiversity conservation in fragmented tropical forests and the agricultural matrices in which they are embedded. Here we make the argument that the conservation paradigm that focuses on setting aside pristine forests while ignoring the agricultural landscape is a failed strategy in light of what is now conventional wisdom in ecology. Given the fragmented nature of most tropical ecosystems, agricultural landscapes should be an essential component of any conservation strategy. We review the literature on biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes and present evidence that many tropical agricultural systems have high levels of biodiversity (planned and associated). These systems represent, not only habitat for biodiversity, but also a high-quality matrix that permits the movement of forest organisms among patches of natural vegetation. We review a variety of agroecosystern types and conclude that diverse, low-input systems using agroecological principles are probably the best option for a high-quality matrix. Such systems are most likely to be constructed by small farmers with land titles, who, in turn, are normally the consequence of grassroots social movements. Therefore, the new conservation paradigm should incorporate a landscape approach in which small farmers, through their social organizations, work with conservationists to create a landscape matrix dominated by productive agroecological systems that facilitate interpatch migration while promoting a sustainable and dignified livelihood for rural communities.

AB The problem of fit is about the interplay between the human and ecosystem dimensions in social-ecological systems that are not just linked but truly integrated. This interplay takes place across temporal and spatial scales and institutional and organizational levels in systems that are increasingly being interpreted as complex adaptive systems. In 1997, we were invited to produce one of three background papers related to a, at that time, new initiative called Institutional Dimensions of Global Environmental Change (IDEG), a research activity of the International Human Dimensions Program of Global Environmental Change (IHDP). The paper, which exists as a discussion paper of the IHDP, has generated considerable interest. Here we publish the original paper 10 years later with an extended introduction and with reflections on some of the issues raised in the original paper concerning problems of fit.

AB Wood density is an important trait in trees indicative of their life history and mechanical and physiological strategies. The following examines the evolutionary ecology of wood density using a large database for seed plants. In particular, we focused on the geographic and phylogenetic variation in wood density for both gymnosperms and angiosperms. A phylogenetic supertree was constructed for over 4600 taxa, allowing for comprehensive analyses of divergences across the seed plant phylogeny. Community-wide means and variances for wood densities were quantified for 171 standardized forest communities. Wood density was generally highly conserved across the entire seed plant phylogeny, yet large divergences were found within the rosid clade. Geographic and community variation in wood density, however, was significantly lower in temperate and high elevation communities, dominated by gymnosperms, than in tropical lowland communities, dominated by angiosperms, suggesting an increase in trait and, to some extent, clade filtering with latitude and elevation. Together, our results support the notion that both biotic and abiotic forces have been important in the evolution of wood density as well as in controlling the observed trait mean and variance across geographic gradients.

AB Measured surface-atmosphere fluxes of energy (sensible heat, H, and latent heat, LE) and CO2 (FCO2) represent the "true" flux plus or minus potential random and systematic measurement errors. Here, we use data from seven sites in the AmeriFlux network, including five forested sites (two of which include "tall tower" instrumentation), one grassland site, and one agricultural site, to conduct a cross-site analysis of random flux error. Quantification of this uncertainty is a prerequisite to model-data synthesis (data assimilation) and for defining confidence intervals on annual sums of net ecosystem exchange or making statistically valid comparisons between measurements and model predictions.
   We differenced paired observations (separated by exactly 24 h, under similar environmental conditions) to infer the characteristics of the random error in measured fluxes. Random flux error more closely follows a double-exponential (Laplace), rather than a normal (Gaussian), distribution, and increase as a linear function of the magnitude of the flux for all three scalar fluxes. Across sites, variation in the random error follows consistent and robust patterns in relation to environmental variables. For example, seasonal differences in the random error for H are small, in contrast to both LE and FCO2, for which the random errors are roughly three-fold larger at the peak of the growing season compared to the dormant season. Random errors also generally scale with R-n (H and LE) and PPFD (FCO2). For FCO2 (but not H or LE), the random error decreases with increasing wind speed. Data from two sites suggest that FCO2 random error may be slightly smaller when a closed-path, rather than open-path, gas analyzer is used. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conservative estimates suggest that 50-90% of the existing insect species on Earth have still to be discovered, yet the named insects alone comprise more than half of all known species of organism. With such poor baseline knowledge, monitoring change in insect diversity poses a formidable challenge to scientists and most attempts to generalize involve large extrapolations from a few well-studied taxa. Butterflies are often the only group for which accurate measures of change can be obtained. Four schemes, used successfully to assess change in British butterflies, that are increasingly being applied across the world are described: Red Data Books (RDB) list the best judgements of experts of the conservation status of species in their field of expertise; mapping schemes plot the changing distributions of species at scales of 1-100 km(2); transect monitoring schemes generate time series of changes in abundance in sample populations of species on fixed sites across the UK; and occasional surveys measure the number, boundaries and size of all populations of a (usually RDB) species at intervals of 10-30 years. All schemes describe consistent patterns of change, but if they are to be more generally useful, it is important to understand how well butterflies are representative of other taxa. Comparisons with similarly measured changes in native bird and plant species suggest that butterflies have declined more rapidly that these other groups in Britain; it should soon be possible to test whether this pattern exists elsewhere. It is also demonstrated that extinction rates in British butterflies are similar to those in a range of other insect groups over 100 years once recording bias is accounted for, although probably lower than in aquatic or parasitic taxa. It is concluded that butterflies represent adequate indicators of change for many terrestrial insect groups, but recommended that similar schemes be extended to other popular groups, especially dragonflies, bumblebees, hoverflies and ants. Given institutional backing, similar projects could be employed internationally and standardized. Finally, a range of schemes designed to monitor change in communities of aquatic macro-invertebrates is described. Although designed to use invertebrates as a bio-indicator of water quality for human use, these programmes could be extended to monitor the 20 10 biodiversity targets of the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

AB The causes of speciation in the sea are rarely obvious, because geographical barriers are not conspicuous and dispersal abilities or marine organisms, particularly those of species with planktonic larvae, are hard to determine. The phylogenetic relations of species in cosmopolitan genera can provide information on the likely mode of their formation. We reconstructed the phylogeny of the pantropical and subtropical sea urchin genus Diadema, using sequences of mitochondrial DNA from 482 individuals collected around the world, to determine the efficacy of barriers to gene flow and to ascertain the history of possible dispersal and vicariance events that led to speciation. We also compared 22 isozyme loci between all described species except D. palmeri. The mitochondrial DNA data show that the two deepest lineages are found in the Indian and West Pacific Oceans. (Indo-Pacific) Diadema setosum diverged first from all other extant Diadema, probably during the initiation of wide fluctuations in global sea levels in the Miocene. The D. setosum clade then split 3-5 million years ago into two clades, one found around the Arabian Peninsula and the other in the Indo-West. Pacific. On the lineage leading to the other species of Diadema, the deepest branch is composed of D. palmeri. apparently separated when the climate of New Zealand became colder and other tropical echinoids at these islands went extinct. The next lineage to separate is composed of a currently unrecognized species of Diadema that is found at Japan and the Marshall Islands. Diadema mexicanum in the eastern Pacific separated next, whereas D. paucispinum. D. savignyi, and D. antillarum from the western and central Atlantic, and (as a separate clade) D. antillarum from the eastern Atlantic form a shallow polytomy. Apparently, Indo-Pacific populations of Diadema maintained genetic contact with Atlantic ones around the southern tip of Africa for some time after the Isthmus of Panama was complete. Diadema paucispinum contains two lineages: D. paucispinum sensu stricto is not limited to Hawaii as previously thought, but extends to Easter Island, Pitcairn, and Okinawa; A second mitochondrial clade of D. paucispinum extends from East Africa and Arabia to the Philippines and New Guinea. A more recent separation between West Indian Ocean and West Pacific populations was detected in D. setosum. Presumably, these genetic discontinuities are the result of water flow restrictions in the straits between northern Australia and Southeast Asia during Pleistocene episodes of low sea level. Diadema savignyi is characterized by high rates of gene how from Kiribati in the central Pacific all the way to the East African Coast. In the Atlantic, there is a biogeographic barrier between the Caribbean and Brazil, possibly caused by fresh water outflow from the Amazon and the Orinoco Rivers. Diadema antillarum populations of the central Atlantic islands of Ascension and St. Helena are genetically isolated and phylogenetically derived from Brazil. Except for its genetic separation by the mid-atlantic barrier, Diadema seems to have maintained connections through potential barriers to dispersal (including the Isthmus of Panama) more recently than did Eucidaris or Echinometra, two other genera of sea urchins in which phylogeography has been studied. Nevertheless, the mtDNA phylogeography of Diadema includes all stages expected from models of allopatric differentiation.
   There are anciently separated clades that now overlap in their geographic distribution, clades isolated in the periphery of the genus range that have remained in the periphery, clades that may have been isolated in the periphery but have since spread towards the center, closely related clades on either side of an existing barrier, and closely related monophyletic entities on either side of an historical barrier that have crossed the former barrier line, but have not attained genetic equilibrium. Except for D. paucispinum and D. savignyi, in which known hybridization may have lodged mtDNA from one species into the genome of the other, closely related clades are always allopatric, and only distantly related ones overlap geographically. Thus, the phylogenetic history and distribution of extant species of Diadema is by and large consistent with allopatric speciation.

AB This paper evaluates the multiple factors that determine the production of plant biomass and its distribution among producers and various trophic groups of consumers. In rough order of their importance, water and nutrient availability, factors that deter herbivores (plant defenses, environmental heterogeneity and disturbance, nutrient stoichiometry), and consumption by herbivores appear to be the most universal determinants of the production and distribution of plant biomass. In some times and places, indirect effects from enemies of herbivores (predators, parasites, parasitoids and pathogens) propagate through the food web to influence plant biomass, in a manner somewhat consistent with green world and exploitation ecosystem mechanisms. I discuss why such food web dynamics appear to be much more important in water than on land. The only demonstrated cases of community-level trophic cascades occur in water. Although species-level cascades are moderately frequent on land, community-level cascades rarely or never occur.

AB Fish and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition, instream habitat features and surrounding land use were assessed in an agriculturally developed watershed to relate overall biotic condition to patterns of land use and channel structure. Six 100-m reaches were sampled on each of three first-order warm-water tributaries of the River Raisin in southeastern Michigan. Comparisons among sites and tributaries showed considerable variability in fish assemblages measured with the index of biotic integrity, macroinvertebrate assemblages characterized with several diversity indexes, and both quantitative and qualitative measurements of instream habitat structure. Land use immediate to the tributaries predicted biotic condition better than regional land use, but was less important than local habitat variables in explaining the variability observed in fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Fish and macroinvertebrates appeared to respond differently to landscape configuration and habitat variables as well. Fish showed a stronger relationship to flow variability and immediate land use, while macroinvertebrates correlated most strongly with dominant substrate. Although significant, the relationships between instream habitat variables and immediate land use explained only a modest amount of the variability observed. A prior study of this watershed ascribed greater predictive power to land use. In comparison to our study design, this study covered a larger area, providing greater contrast among subcatchments. Differences in outcomes suggests that the scale of investigation influences the strength of predictive variables. Thus, we concluded that the importance of local habitat conditions is best revealed by comparisons at the within-subcatchment scale.

ID CONSERVATION; MECHANISMS; ARTIFACTS; RANGE; CORE
AB The experimental fragmentation of landscapes of a natural ecosystem resulted in declines in the abundance and distribution of most species in the multispecies animal community inhabiting the landscapes and the extinction of many species. These declines caused the deterioration of the positive interspecific relation between local population abundance and distributional extent in this community. However, when patches were connected by habitat corridors, an immigration "rescue effect" arrested declines in both abundance and distribution and maintained the observed positive relation between them. These results demonstrate the importance of metapopulation dynamics and landscape connectivity for the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes.

AB Large carnivores need large areas of relatively wild habitat, which makes their conservation challenging. These species play important ecological roles and in some cases may qualify as keystone species. Although the ability of carnivores to control prey numbers varies according to many factors and often is effective only in the short term, the indirect effects of carnivores on community structure and diversity can be great. perhaps just as important is the role of carnivores as umbrella species (i.e., species whose habitat area requirements encompass the habitats of many other species). Conservation areas large enough to support populations of large carnivores are likely to include many other species and natural communities, especially in regions such as the Rocky Mountains of Canada and the United States that have relatively low endemism. For example, a plan for recovery of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) proposed by Shaffer (1992) covers, in part, 34% of the state of Idabo (compared to 8% covered by a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposal) and would capture 10% or more of the statewide ranges of 71% of the mammal species, (67%) of the vegetation types in Idabo would have 10% or more of their statewide area included in the Shaffer plan. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recovery zones provide a much poorer umbrella. The umbrella functions of large carnivores are expected to be poorer in regions with high endemism. The application of metapopulation concepts to large carnivore conservation has led to proposals for regional reserve networks composed of wilderness core areas, multiple-use buffer zones, and some form of connectivity. The exceptional vagility of most large carnivores makes such networks feasible in a region with low human population density, such as the Rocky Mountains, but mortality risks still need to be addressed. Roads are a major threat to carnivore recovery because of barrier effects, vehicle collisions, and increased accessibility of wild areas to poachers. Development, especially for tourism, is also becoming a threat in many parts of the region.

AB The phylogenetic diversity of oligotrophic bacterioplankton communities was compared with 168 ribosomal RNA genes cloned from natural populations. The data reported here extend a previous analysis of a bacterioplankton 16S rRNA clone library with 15 additional nucleic acid clone sequences, to provide information on 60 168 rDNA clones from hydrostation S in the Sargasso Sea. The data were compared to partial sequences of 37 Bacterial 168 rDNA clones reported from a surface picoplankton population collected at the Aloha station in the North Pacific gyre, and partial sequences of 29 Bacterial 168 rRNA clones obtained from sites near Bermuda and the western California Current. The results support reports of diverse groups of previously unknown alpha-proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria, and cyanobacteria in oceanic surface samples. Three novel lineages (SAR 121, 125, 145) of proteobacteria were found. Several genes cloned from the Sargasso Sea were nearly identical to genes cloned from the Pacific samples, suggesting that these previously unrecognized bacteria groups (SAR11, SAR122, SAR86) are distributed widely in the surface waters of subtropical oceans. Two gene clones closely matched nucleotide sequences from the cultivated bacterial species Photo-bacterium phasphoreum and Alteromonas haloplanktis.

AB Body temperature influences the performance and fitness of ectotherms. How thermal sensitivity responds to selection for resistance to high temperature is broadly relevant in evolutionary physiology and also has practical implications. We review several complementary approaches to studying the evolution of thermal sensitivity. First, we analyze comparative data that illustrate the historical evolution of thermal sensitivity of locomotion in iguanid lizards. Taxa that experience high body temperatures in nature have evolved high optimal temperatures for sprinting. Critical thermal maxima are coadapted with optimal temperatures but not with critical thermal minima. Thus some but not all aspects of thermal sensitivity are coadapted. Second, we describe selection experiments that help reveal potential genetic constraints on the future evolution of thermal sensitivity in Drosophila. Thermal sensitivity responds rapidly both to laboratory natural selection and artificial selection, and tolerance of extreme high temperature appears genetically correlated with performance at intermediate temperature. Third, applying a recent model by Lynch and Lande, we describe how the shape of thermal performance curves may affect evolutionary responses of thermal sensitivity to a gradual shift in the thermal environment. Our theoretical predictions depend crucially on the relationship-between the genetic variation in optimal temperature and the performance breadth. If genetic variation is independent of breadth, then populations with an intermediate value of performance breadth will tolerate the greatest rate of environmental change. Moreover, if a trade-off exists between maximum performance and breadth of performance, then thermal specialists will be favored over thermal generalists in a rapidly changing environment. On the other hand, if genetic variation increases with increasing breadth, then populations of thermal generalists will tolerate the greatest rates of environmental change.

AB Low levels of allozyme heterozygosity in populations are often attributed to previous population bottlenecks; however, few experiments have examined the relationship between heterozygosity and bottlenecks under natural conditions. The composition and number of founders of 55 experimental populations of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), maintained under simulated field conditions, were manipulated to examine the effects of bottlenecks on three components of allozyme diversity. Correlations between observed and expected values of allozyme heterozygosity, proportions of polymorphic loci, and numbers of alleles per locus were 0.423, 0.602, and 0.772, respectively. The numbers of polymorphic loci and of alleles per locus were more sensitive indicators of differences in genetic diversity between the pre-bottleneck and post-bottleneck populations than was multiple-locus heterozygosity. In many populations, single- and multiple-locus heterozygosity actually increased as a result of the founder event. The weak relationship between a population's heterozygosity and the number and composition of its founders resulted from an increase in the variance of heterozygosity due to drift of allele frequencies. There was little evidence that selection influenced the loss of allozyme variation. When it is not possible to estimate heterozygosity at a large number of polymorphic loci, allozyme surveys attempting to detect founder events and other types of bottlenecks should focus on levels of locus polymorphism and allelic diversity rather than on heterozygosity.

AB Until recently, small continental waters have been completely ignored in virtually all global processes and cycles. This has resulted from the neglect of these systems and processes by ecologists and the assumption that ecosystems with a small areal extent cannot play a major role in global processes. Recent inventories based on modern geographical and mathematical approaches have shown that continental waters occupy nearly twice as much area as was previously believed. Further, these inventories have shown that small lakes and ponds dominate the areal extent of continental waters, correcting a century-long misconception that large lakes are most important. The global importance of any ecosystem type in a process or cycle is the product of the areal extent and the intensity of the process in those ecosystems. Several analyses have shown the disproportionately great intensity of many processes in small aquatic ecosystems, indicating that they play an unexpectedly major role in global cycles. Assessments of the global carbon cycle underscore the need for aquatic scientists to view their work on a global scale in order to respond to the Earth's most pressing environmental problems.

AB Understanding what structures ecological communities is vital to answering questions about extinctions, environmental change, trophic cascades, and ecosystem functioning. Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65% of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction. The model results support the hypothesis that individual behavior, subject to natural selection, determines individual diets and that food web structure is the sum of these individual decisions.

AB Quorum sensing faces evolutionary problems from non-producing or over-producing cheaters. Such problems are circumvented in diffusion sensing, an alternative explanation for quorum sensing. However, both explanations face the problems of signalling in complex environments such as the rhizosphere where, for example, the spatial distribution of cells can be more important for sensing than cell density, which we show by mathematical modelling. We argue that these conflicting concepts can be unified by a new hypothesis, efficiency sensing, and that some of the problems associated with signalling in complex environments, as well as the problem of maintaining honesty in signalling, can be avoided when the signalling cells grow in microcolonies.

AB Correlations between foliar nutrient concentrations and soil nutrient availability have been found in multiple ecosystems. These relationships have led to the use of foliar nutrients as an index of nutrient status and to the prediction of broadscale patterns in ecosystem processes. More recently, a growing interest in ecological stoichiometry has fueled multiple analyses of foliar nitrogen : phosphorus ( N: P) ratios within and across ecosystems. These studies have observed that N: P values are generally elevated in tropical forests when compared to higher latitude ecosystems, adding weight to a common belief that tropical forests are generally N rich and P poor. However, while these broad generalizations may have merit, their simplicity masks the enormous environmental heterogeneity that exists within the tropics; such variation includes large ranges in soil fertility and climate, as well as the highest plant species diversity of any biome. Here we present original data on foliar N and P concentrations from 150 mature canopy tree species in Costa Rica and Brazil, and combine those data with a comprehensive new literature synthesis to explore the major sources of variation in foliar N: P values within the tropics. We found no relationship between N: P ratios and either latitude or mean annual precipitation within the tropics alone. There is, however, evidence of seasonal controls; in our Costa Rica sites, foliar N: P values differed by 25% between wet and dry seasons. The N: P ratios do vary with soil P availability and/or soil order, but there is substantial overlap across coarse divisions in soil type, and perhaps the most striking feature of the data set is variation at the species level. Taken as a whole, our results imply that the dominant influence on foliar N: P ratios in the tropics is species variability and that, unlike marine systems and perhaps many other terrestrial biomes, the N: P stoichiometry of tropical forests is not well constrained. Thus any use of N: P ratios in the tropics to infer larger-scale ecosystem processes must comprehensively account for the diversity of any given site and recognize the broad range in nutrient requirements, even at the local scale.

AB Oysters have been introduced worldwide to 73 countries, but the ecological consequences of the introductions are not fully understood. Economically, introduced oysters compose a majority of oyster harvests in many areas. Oysters are ecosystem engineers that influence many ecological processes, such as maintenance of biodiversity, population and food web dynamics, and nutrient cycling. Consequently, both their loss, through interaction of overharvest, habitat degradation, disease, poor water quality, and detrimental species interactions, and their gain, through introductions, can cause complex changes in coastal ecosystems. Introductions can greatly enhance oyster population abundance and production, as well as populations of associated native species. However, introduced oysters are also vectors for non-native species, including disease-causing organisms. Thus, substantial population, community, and habitat changes have accompanied new oysters. In contrast, ecosystem-level consequences of oyster introductions, such as impacts on flow patterns, sediment and nutrient dynamics, and native bioengineering species, are not well understood. Ecological risk assessments for future introductions must emphasize probabilities of establishment, spread, and impacts on vulnerable species, communities, and ecosystem properties. Many characteristics of oysters lead to predictions that they would be successful, high-impact members of recipient ecosystems. This conclusion leaves open the discussion of whether such impacts are desirable in terms of restoration of coastal ecosystems, especially where restoration of native oysters is possible.

AB We propose measuring vulnerability of selected outcome variables of concern (e.g. agricultural yield) to identified stressors (e.g. climate change) as a function of the state of the variables of concern relative to a threshold of damage, the sensitivity of the variables to the stressors, and the magnitude and frequency of the stressors to which the system is exposed. In addition, we provide a framework for assessing the extent adaptive capacity can reduce vulnerable conditions. We illustrate the utility of this approach by evaluating the vulnerability of wheat yields to climate change and market fluctuations in the Yaqui Valley, Mexico. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Estuaries and coastal wetlands are critical transition zones (CTZs) that link land, freshwater habitats, and the sea. CTZs provide essential ecological functions, including decomposition, nutrient cycling, and nutrient production, as well as regulation of fluxes of nutrients, water, particles, and organisms to and from land, rivers, and the ocean. Sediment-associated biota are integral to these functions. Functional groups considered essential to CTZ processes include heterotrophic bacteria and fungi, as well as many benthic invertebrates. Key invertebrate functions include shredding, which breaks down and recycles organic matter; suspension feeding, which collects and transports sediments across the sediment-water interface; and bioturbating, which moves sediment into or out of the seabed. In addition, macrophytes regulate many aspects of nutrient, particle, and organism dynamics above- and belowground. Animals moving within or through CTZs are vectors that transport nutrients and organic matter across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine interfaces. Significant threats to biodiversity within CTZs are posed by anthropogenic influences; eutrophication, nonnutrient pollutants, species invasions, overfishing, habitat alteration, and climate change affect species richness or composition in many coastal environments. Because biotic diversity in marine CTZ sediments is inherently low whereas their functional significance is great, shifts in diversity are likely to be particularly important. Species introductions (from invasion) or loss (from overfishing or habitat alteration) provide evidence that single-species changes can have overt, sweeping effects on CTZ structure and function. Certain species may be critically important to the maintenance of ecosystem functions in CTZs even though at present there is limited empirical evidence that the number of species in CTZ sediments is critical. We hypothesized that diversity is indeed important to ecosystem function in marine CTZs because high diversity maintains positive interactions among species (facilitation and mutualism), promoting stability and resistance to invasion or other forms of disturbance. The complexity of interactions among species and feedbacks with ecosystem functions suggests that comparative (mensurative) and manipulative approaches will be required to elucidate the role of diversity in sustaining CTZ functions.

AB Sophisticated computational methods have been developed to help us to identify sets of nature reserves that maximize the representation of regional diversity, but, until recently, the methods have not dealt explicitly and directly with the main goal of reserve networks, that of the tong-term maintenance of biodiversity. Furthermore,the successful application of current methods requires reliable information about species distributions, which is not always available. Recent results show that data quality, as well as the choice of surrogates for biodiversity. could he critical for successful reserve design. Because of these problems and a lack of communication between scientists and managers, the impact of computational site-selection tools in applied conservation planning has been minimal.

AB Trophic cascades are the time-honored focal point of food-web dynamics. They are the best loved example of indirect effects in undergraduate ecology textbooks and they represent a potentially useful application of theory. Researchers have found them from the Arctic to the tropics. But, can we agree on what they are? Here, we seek to clarify the terminology of trophic cascades and call for a consensus on how to quantify cascading effects in the future.

AB Chromosome organization and evolution in the Brassicaceae family was studied using comparative linkage mapping. A total of 160 mapped Arabidopsis thaliana DNA fragments identified 284 homologous loci covering 751 cM in Brassica nigra. The data support that modern diploid Brassica species are descended from a hexaploid ancestor, and that the A. thaliana genome is similar in structure and complexity to those of each of the hypothetical diploid progenitors of the proposed hexaploid. Thus, the Brassica lineage probably went through a triplication after the divergence of die lineages leading to A. thaliana and B. nigra. These duplications were also accompanied by an exceptionally high rate of chromosomal rearrangements. The average length of conserved segments between A. thaliana and B. nigra was estimated at 8 cM. This estimate corresponds to similar to 90 rearrangements since the divergence of the two species. The estimated rate of chromosomal rearrangements is higher than any previously reported data based on comparative mapping. Despite the large number of rearrangements, fine-scale comparative mapping between model plant A. thaliana and Brassica crops is likely to result in the identification of a large number of genes that affect important traits in Brassica crops.

AB We use an approach based on phylogenetic comparisons to identify life history correlates of abundance trends in 18 intensively exploited fish stocks from the north-east Atlantic. After accounting for differences in fishing mortality, we show that those fishes that have decreased in abundance compared with their nearest relatives mature later, attain a larger maximum size, and exhibit significantly lower potential rates of population increase. Such trends were not evident in a more traditional cross-species analysis. This is the first phylogenetically independent evidence to link life histories with abundance trends, and provides a quantitative basis for assessing vulnerability of fish populations to exploitation. Our approach can be applied to the conservation and management of other exploited taxa.

AB The response of trees to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) is of concern to forest ecologists and global carbon modellers and is the focus of an increasing body of research work, I review studies published up to May 1994, and several unpublished works, which reported at least one of the following: net CO2 assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), leaf dark respiration (R(d)), leaf nitrogen or specific leaf area (SLA) in woody plants grown at <400 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 or at 600-800 mu mol mol(-1) CO2, The resulting data from 41 species were categorized according to growth conditions (unstressed versus stressed), length of CO2 exposure, pot size and exposure facility [growth chamber (GC), greenhouse (GH), or open-top chamber (OTC)] and interpreted using meta-analytic methods, Overall, A showed a large and signifcant increase at elevated [CO2] but length of CO2 exposure and the exposure facility were important modifiers of this response, Plants exposed for <50 d had a significantly greater response, and those from GCs had a significantly lower response than plants from longer exposures or from OTC studies, Negative acclimation of A was significant and general among stressed plants, but in unstressed plants was influenced by length of CO2 exposure, the exposure facility and/or pot size, Growth at elevated [CO2] resulted in moderate reductions in g(s) in unstressed plants, but there was no significant effect of CO2 on g(s) in stressed plants, Leaf dark respiration (mass or area basis) was reduced strongly by growth at high [CO2], while leaf N was reduced only when expressed on a mass basis, This review is the first meta-analysis of elevated CO2 studies and provides statistical confirmation of several general responses of trees to elevated [CO2]. It also highlights important areas of continued uncertainty in our understanding of these responses.

AB Determining the strengths of interactions among species in natural communities presents a major challenge to ecology. Using an approach combining experimental perturbations and path analysis, I examined the mechanisms by which birds directly and indirectly affected other members of an intertidal community, evaluated alternative causal hypotheses, and predicted whether interactions among other unmanipulated species would be strong or weak. Comparing treatments with t tests indicated that excluding bird predators with cages caused increases in Pollicipes polymerus, and declines in Nucella spp., Mytilus californianus, and Semibalanus cariosus. However, these conclusions provided no insight into the underlying mechanisms causing the differences. Path analysis permitted insight into the causal mechanisms by making a variety of predictions about the strength of direct interactions: (a) Bird predation negatively affects Pollicipes, but not Nucella, Leptasterias, or Mytilus; (b) Pollicipes reduces Semibalanus and Mytilus abundance because of space competition; (c) Mytilus reduces Semibalanus cover through competition for space; and (d) as prey species, Semibalanus and Pollicipes enhance Nucella density, but Nucella predation does not have important effects on Semibalanus or Pollicipes. Based on the estimated strength of direct interactions, the importance of indirect effects among species could also be predicted. In experiments manipulating Nucella, Pollicipes, Semibalanus, and birds independently of one another, I tested 11 of the interactions predicted by the path analysis; all were supported. Path analysis in conjunction with limited experiments may provide an efficient means to predict important direct and indirect interactions among unmanipulated species within ecological communities.

AB Objective: To determine the extent of genetic variation among internationally collected HIV-1 isolates, to analyse phylogenetic relationships and the geographic distribution of different variants.
   Design: Phylogenetic comparison of 70 HIV-1 isolates collected in 15 countries on four continents.
   Methods: To sequence the complete gag genome of HIV-1 isolates, build multiple sequence alignments and construct phylogenetic trees using distance matrix methods and maximum parsimony algorithms.
   Results: Phylogenetic tree analysis identified seven distinct genotypes. The seven genotypes were evident by both distance matrix methods and maximum parsimony analysis, and were strongly supported by bootstrap resampling of the data. The intra-genotypic gag distances averaged 7%, whereas the inter-genotypic distances averaged 14%. The geographic distribution of variants was complex. Some genotypes have apparently migrated to several continents and many areas harbor a mixture of genotypes. Related variants may cluster in certain areas, particularly isolates from a single city collected over a short time.
   Conclusions: The genetic variation among HIV-1 isolates is more extensive than previously appreciated. At least seven distinct HIV-1 genotypes can be identified. Diversification, migration and establishment of local, temporal 'blooms' of particular variants may all occur concomitantly.

AB European grassland-based livestock production systems face the challenge of producing more meat and milk to meet increasing world demands and to achieve this using fewer resources. Legumes offer great potential for achieving these objectives. They have numerous features that can act together at different stages in the soil-plant-animal-atmosphere system, and these are most effective in mixed swards with a legume proportion of 30-50%. The resulting benefits include reduced dependence on fossil energy and industrial N-fertilizer, lower quantities of harmful emissions to the environment (greenhouse gases and nitrate), lower production costs, higher productivity and increased protein self-sufficiency. Some legume species offer opportunities for improving animal health with less medication, due to the presence of bioactive secondary metabolites. In addition, legumes may offer an adaptation option to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate change. Legumes generate these benefits at the level of the managed land-area unit and also at the level of the final product unit. However, legumes suffer from some limitations, and suggestions are made for future research to exploit more fully the opportunities that legumes can offer. In conclusion, the development of legume-based grassland-livestock systems undoubtedly constitutes one of the pillars for more sustainable and competitive ruminant production systems, and it can be expected that forage legumes will become more important in the future.

AB Identifying the ecological processes that structure communities and the consequences for ecosystem function is a central goal of ecology. The recognition that fungi, bacteria, and viruses control key ecosystem functions has made microbial communities a major focus of this field. Because many ecological processes are apparent only at particular spatial or temporal scales, a complete understanding of the linkages between microbial community, environment, and function requires analysis across a wide range of scales. Here, we map the biological and functional geography of soil fungi from local to continental scales and show that the principal ecological processes controlling community structure and function operate at different scales. Similar to plants or animals, most soil fungi are endemic to particular bioregions, suggesting that factors operating at large spatial scales, like dispersal limitation or climate, are the first-order determinants of fungal community structure in nature. By contrast, soil extracellular enzyme activity is highly convergent across bioregions and widely differing fungal communities. Instead, soil enzyme activity is correlated with local soil environment and distribution of fungal traits within the community. The lack of structure-function relationships for soil fungal communities at continental scales indicates a high degree of functional redundancy among fungal communities in global biogeochemical cycles.

AB Solid waste management (SWM) has become an issue of increasing global concern as urban populations continue to rise and consumption patterns change. The health and environmental implications associated with SWM are mounting in urgency, particularly in the context of developing countries. While systems analyses largely targeting well-defined, engineered systems have been used to help SWM agencies in industrialized countries since the 1960s, collection and removal dominate the SWM sector in developing countries. This review contrasts the history and current paradigms of SWM practices and policies in industrialized countries with the current challenges and complexities faced in developing country SWM. In industrialized countries, public health, environment, resource scarcity, climate change, and public awareness and participation have acted as SWM drivers towards the current paradigm of integrated SWM. However, urbanization, inequality, and economic growth; cultural and socio-economic aspects; policy, governance, and institutional issues; and international influences have complicated SWM in developing countries. This has limited the applicability of approaches that were successful along the SWM development trajectories of industrialized countries. This review demonstrates the importance of founding new SWM approaches for developing country contexts in post-normal science and complex, adaptive systems thinking. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Global wetlands are believed to be climate sensitive, and are the largest natural emitters of methane (CH4). Increased wetland CH4 emissions could act as a positive feedback to future warming. The Wetland and Wetland CH4 Inter-comparison of Models Project (WETCHIMP) investigated our present ability to simulate large-scale wetland characteristics and corresponding CH4 emissions. To ensure inter-comparability, we used a common experimental protocol driving all models with the same climate and carbon dioxide (CO2) forcing datasets. The WETCHIMP experiments were conducted for model equilibrium states as well as transient simulations covering the last century. Sensitivity experiments investigated model response to changes in selected forcing inputs (precipitation, temperature, and atmospheric CO2 concentration). Ten models participated, covering the spectrum from simple to relatively complex, including models tailored either for regional or global simulations. The models also varied in methods to calculate wetland size and location, with some models simulating wetland area prognostically, while other models relied on remotely sensed inundation datasets, or an approach intermediate between the two.
   Four major conclusions emerged from the project. First, the suite of models demonstrate extensive disagreement in their simulations of wetland areal extent and CH4 emissions, in both space and time. Simple metrics of wetland area, such as the latitudinal gradient, show large variability, principally between models that use inundation dataset information and those that independently determine wetland area. Agreement between the models improves for zonally summed CH4 emissions, but large variation between the models remains. For annual global CH4 emissions, the models vary by +/- 40% of the all-model mean (190 Tg CH4 yr(-1)). Second, all models show a strong positive response to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations (857 ppm) in both CH4 emissions and wetland area. In response to increasing global temperatures (+3.4 degrees C globally spatially uniform), on average, the models decreased wetland area and CH4 fluxes, primarily in the tropics, but the magnitude and sign of the response varied greatly. Models were least sensitive to increased global precipitation (+3.9% globally spatially uniform) with a consistent small positive response in CH4 fluxes and wetland area. Results from the 20th century transient simulation show that interactions between climate forcings could have strong non-linear effects. Third, we presently do not have sufficient wetland methane observation datasets adequate to evaluate model fluxes at a spatial scale comparable to model grid cells (commonly 0.5 degrees). This limitation severely restricts our ability to model global wetland CH4 emissions with confidence. Our simulated wetland extents are also difficult to evaluate due to extensive disagreements between wetland mapping and remotely sensed inundation datasets. Fourth, the large range in predicted CH4 emission rates leads to the conclusion that there is both substantial parameter and structural uncertainty in large-scale CH4 emission models, even after uncertainties in wetland areas are accounted for.

AB 1. Evidence-based policy requires researchers to provide the answers to ecological questions that are of interest to policy makers. To find out what those questions are in the UK, representatives from 28 organizations involved in policy, together with scientists from 10 academic institutions, were asked to generate a list of questions from their organizations.
   2. During a 2-day workshop the initial list of 1003 questions generated from consulting at least 654 policy makers and academics was used as a basis for generating a short list of 100 questions of significant policy relevance. Short-listing was decided on the basis of the preferences of the representatives from the policy-led organizations.
   3. The areas covered included most major issues of environmental concern in the UK, including agriculture, marine fisheries, climate change, ecosystem function and land management.
   4. The most striking outcome was the preference for general questions rather than narrow ones. The reason is that policy is driven by broad issues rather than specific ones. In contrast, scientists are frequently best equipped to answer specific questions. This means that it may be necessary to extract the underpinning specific question before researchers can proceed.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Greater communication between policy makers and scientists is required in order to ensure that applied ecologists are dealing with issues in a way that can feed into policy. It is particularly important that applied ecologists emphasize the generic value of their work wherever possible.

AB (.)Here, we tested hypothesized relationships among leaf and fine root traits of grass, forb, legume, and woody plant species of a savannah community.
   (CO2)-C-. exchange rates, structural traits, chemistry, and longevity were measured in tissues of 39 species grown in long-term monocultures.
   (.)Across species, respiration rates of leaves and fine roots exhibited a common regression relationship with tissue nitrogen (N) concentration, although legumes had lower rates at comparable N concentrations. Respiration rates and N concentration declined with increasing longevity of leaves and roots. Species rankings of leaf and fine-root N and longevity were correlated, but not specific leaf area and specific root length. The C-3 and C-4 grasses had lower N concentrations than forbs and legumes, but higher photosynthesis rates across a similar range of leaf N.
   (.)Despite contrasting photosynthetic pathways and N-2-fixing ability among these species, concordance in above- and below-ground traits was evident in comparable rankings in leaf and root longevity, N and respiration rates, which is evidence of a common leaf and root trait syndrome linking traits to effects on plant and ecosystem processes.

AB Plant species are hypothesized to impact ecosystem nitrogen cycling in two distinctly different ways. First, differences in nitrogen use efficiency can lead to positive feedbacks on the rate of nitrogen cycling. Alternatively, plant species can also control the inputs and losses of nitrogen from ecosystems.
   Our current understanding of litter decomposition shows that most nitrogen present within litter is not released during decomposition but incorporated into soil organic matter. This nitrogen retention is caused by an increase in the relative nitrogen content in decomposing litter and a much lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of soil organic matter. The long time lag between plant litter formation and the actual release of nitrogen from the litter results in a bottleneck, which prevents feedbacks of plant quality differences on nitrogen cycling. Instead, rates of gross nitrogen mineralization, which are often an order of magnitude higher than net mineralization, indicate that nitrogen cycling within ecosystems is dominated by a microbial nitrogen loop. Nitrogen is released from the soil organic matter and incorporated into microbial biomass. Upon their death, the nitrogen is again incorporated into the soil organic matter. However, this microbial nitrogen loop is driven by plant-supplied carbon and provides a strong negative feedback through nitrogen cycling on plant productivity. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is strong for temperate grassland ecosystems. For other terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests, tropical and boreal regions, the data are much more limited. Thus, current evidence does not support the view that differences in the efficiency of plant nitrogen use lead to positive feedbacks. In contrast, soil microbes are the dominant factor structuring ecosystem nitrogen cycling. Soil microbes derive nitrogen from the decomposition of soil organic matter, but this microbial activity is driven by recent plant carbon inputs. Changes in plant carbon inputs, resulting from plant species shifts, lead to a negative feedback through microbial nitrogen immobilization.
   In contrast, there is abundant evidence that plant species impact nitrogen inputs and losses, such as: atmospheric deposition, fire-induced losses, nitrogen leaching, and nitrogen fixation, which is driven by carbon supply from plants to nitrogen fixers. Additionally, plants can influence the activity and composition of soil microbial communities, which has the potential to lead to differences in nitrification, denitrification and trace nitrogen gas losses. Plant species also impact herbivore behaviour and thereby have the potential to lead to animal-facilitated movement of nitrogen between ecosystems.
   Thus, current evidence supports the view that plant species can have large impacts on ecosystem nitrogen cycling. However, species impacts are not caused by differences in plant quantity and quality, but by plant species impacts on nitrogen inputs and losses.

AB The use of nutrient concentrations in plant biomass as easily measured indicators of nutrient availability and limitation has been the subject of a controversial debate. In particular, it has been questioned whether nutrient concentrations are mainly species' traits or mainly determined by nutrient availability, and whether plant species have similar or different relative nutrient requirements. This review examines how nitrogen and phosphorus concentration and the N:P ratio in wetland plants vary among species and sites, and how they are related to nutrient availability and limitation. We analyse data from field studies in European non-forested wetlands, from fertilisation experiments in these communities and from growth experiments with wetland plants. Overall, the P concentration was more variable than the N concentration, while variation in NT ratios was intermediate. Field data showed that the N concentration varies more among species than among sites, whereas the N:P ratio varies more among sites than among species, and the P concentration varies similarly among both. Similar patterns of variation were found in fertilisation experiments and in growth experiments under controlled nutrient supply. Nutrient concentrations and N:P ratios in the vegetation were poorly correlated with various measures of nutrient availability in soil, but they clearly responded to fertilisation in the field and to nutrient supply in growth experiments. In these experiments, biomass N:P ratios ranged from 3 to 40 and primarily reflected the relative avallabilities of N and P, although NT ratios of plants grown at the same nutrient supply could vary three-fold among species. The effects of fertilisation with N or P on the biomass production of wetland vegetation were well related to the N:P ratios of the vegetation in unfertilised plots, but not to N or P concentrations, which supports the idea that NT ratios, rather than N or P concentrations, indicate the type of nutrient limitation. However, other limiting or stressing factors may influence N:P ratios, and the responses of individual plant species to fertilisation cannot be predicted from their N:P ratios. Therefore, NT ratios should only be used to assess which nutrient limits the biomass production at the vegetation level and only when factors other than N or P are unlikely to be limiting.

AB We review the significance of two forms of sexual conflict (different evolutionary interests of the two sexes) for genetic differentiation of populations and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Conflicting selection on the alleles at a single locus can occur in males and females if the sexes have different optima for a trait, and there are pleiotropic genetic correlations between the sexes for it. There will then be selection for sex limitation and hence sexual dimorphism. This sex limitation could break down in hybrids and reduce their fitness. Pleiotropic genetic correlations between the sexes could also affect the likelihood of mating in interpopulation encounters. Conflict can also occur between (sex-limited) loci that determine behaviour in males and those that determine behaviour in females. Reproductive isolation may occur by rapid coevolution of male trait and female mating preference. This would tend to generate assortative mating on secondary contact, hence promoting speciation. Sexual conflict resulting from sensory exploitation, polyspermy and the cost of mating could result in high levels of interpopulation mating. If females evolve resistance to male pre-and postmating manipulation, males from one population could be more successful with females from the other, because females would have evolved resistance to their own (but not to the allopatric) males. Between-locus sexual conflict could also occur as a result of conflict between males and females of different populations over the production of unfit hybrids. We develop models which show that females are in general selected to resist such matings and males to persist, and this could have a bearing on both the initial level of interpopulation matings and the likelihood that reinforcement will occur. In effect, selection on males usually acts to promote gene flow and to restrict premating isolation, whereas selection on females usually acts in the reverse direction. We review theoretical models relevant to resolution of this conflict. The winning role depends on a balance between the 'value of winning' and 'power' (relating to contest or armament costs): the winning role is likely to correlate with high value of winning and low costs. Sperm-ovum (or sperm-female tract) conflicts (and their plant parallels) are likely to obey the same principles. Males may typically have higher values of winning, but it is difficult to quantify 'power', and females may often be able to resist mating more cheaply than males can force it. We tentatively predict that sexual conflict will typically result in a higher rate of speciation in 'female-win' clades, that females will be responsible for premating isolation through reinforcement, and that 'female-win' populations will be less genetically diverse.

AB There is now a solid body of theoretical work(1-4) demonstrating that the spatial structure of the habitat combined with animal movement strongly influence host-parasitoid dynamics. The spatial pattern over which parasitoid search takes place can be affected by the distribution of the hosts(5), by the spatial arrangement of the host's habitat(6) and by the spatial scale at which the parasitoid perceives variation in host abundance(7,8). Empirical work, however, has been largely restricted to small-scale field studies of less than one hectare(6,9) with very few larger(10,11). Here we report initial results of a many-year, large-scale study that is among the first to examine the interaction between a population-level process (parasitism) and anthropogenic forest fragmentation at large and at multiple spatial scales. We demonstrate that parasitism by four species of parasitoids attacking the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria, is significantly reduced or enhanced depending on the proportion of forested to unforested land. Each of the parasitoid species responds to this mosaic at four different spatial scales that correspond to their relative body sizes, Our data give empirical support to the argument that changes in landscape structure can alter the normal functioning of ecological processes such as parasitism, with large-scale population consequences(3'4).

AB We address the ecological ramifications of variation in hydrologic interaction between streams and alluvial aquifers in catchments with alluvium derived from parent materials of contrasting geologic composition. We present a conceptual model in which solute retention in streams results from hydrologic retention (increased water residence time resulting from surface-groundwater exchange), biological nutrient cycling, and chemical processes. Solute injection experiments were done in study catchments comprised of sandstone-siltstone (site 1), volcanic tuff (site 2), and granite-gneiss (site 3). Distribution of an injected conservative tracer (Br) illustrated that rate and extent of surface-water penetration into the alluvial aquifer increased across study catchments as was predicted from increasing alluvial hydraulic conductivity. Concurrently, groundwater inputs at baseflow represented between 13 and 57% of aboveground discharge at upstream transects, indicating bidirectional hydrologic exchange along the study reaches. N:P ratios in surface water ranged from 4 to 16, suggesting strong biotic demand for inorganic N. Coinjection of NaBr and NaNO3 revealed longest nitrate uptake length (S-w) at site 1, intermediate S-w at site 2, and shortest uptake length at site 3. Modeling of transient hydrologic solute storage revealed that S-w correlated with hydraulic storage, suggesting an important role for subsurface processes in total nitrate retention.

AB In the past, the importance of silicate as a limiting nutrient for new production in the ocean, and in determining global productivity and carbon budgets, has been relegated to the lower ranks compared to the role of nitrogen and, more recently, iron. This paper describes a ''silicate pump'' that acts in diatom-dominated communities to enhance the loss of silicate from the euphotic zone to deep water compared to nitrogen, which is more readily recycled in the grazing loop, thus leading the system to silicate limitation. The impact of this silicate pump is described for the HNLC (High Nutrient-Low Chlorophyll) waters offshore from 15 degrees S, Peru and reproduced in a simulation model of a diatom-dominated ecosystem. Silicate pumping to deep water results in low silicate, high nitrate conditions in the mixed layer, shown here to be a characteristic of many HNLC areas. These areas should more accurately be termed HNLSLC (High Nitrate-Low Silicate-Low Chlorophyll) areas. Silicate dynamics may control and dominate new production processes in these areas and consequently control the rate at which newly upwelled CO2 in the surface regions is reduced by the phytoplankton. In such silicate-controlled systems, export production (i.e. production that is lost to deep water) of silicon and nitrogen are not equivalent, since export production of silicon is controlled by input of silicate, whereas export production of nitrogen is controlled by grazing rate and regeneration.

AB The chemical weathering of Ca-Mg silicate rocks is the principal process whereby CO2 is removed from the atmosphere on long or multimillion-year time scales. At present vascular land plants exert an important influence on weathering by recycling water and by bringing about the secretion of acids and the buildup of high levels of CO2 in soils. Before the spread of vascular plants on the continents during the mid-Paleozoic, chemical weathering must have been achieved by higher levels of atmospheric CO2 and/or by the intercession of primitive land biota such as lichens and cyanobacteria. From examination of several pre-vascular weathering scenarios, it is concluded that in order to prohibit unreasonably high levels of atmospheric CO2, weathering during the Precambrian and early Paleozoic must have taken place under essentially closed-system abiotic conditions (linear feedback) or via strong regulation by primitive biota. Preliminary examination of modern weathering by lichens over tens to thousands of years militates against the latter possibility. However, much more work needs to be done on the quantitative effect of both primitive biota and vascular plants on the rate of weathering (and their response to changes in atmospheric CO2) before anything more definitive can be said.

AB Life-history traits such as longevity and fecundity often show low heritability. This is usually interpreted in terms of Fisher's fundamental theorem to mean that populations are near evolutionary equilibrium and genetic variance in total fitness is low. We develop the causal relationship between metric traits and life-history traits to show that a life-history trait is expected to have a low heritability whether or not the population is at equilibrium. This is because it is subject to all the environmental variation in the metric traits that affect it plus additional environmental variation. There is no simple prediction regarding levels of additive genetic variance in life-history traits, which may be high at equilibrium. Several other patterns in the inheritance of life-history traits are readily predicted from the causal model. These include the strength of genetic correlations between life-history traits, levels of nonadditive genetic variance, and the inevitability of genotype-environment interaction.

AB A large database of invasive forest pathogens (IFPs) was developed to investigate the patterns and determinants of invasion in Europe. Detailed taxonomic and biological information on the invasive species was combined with country-specific data on land use, climate, and the time since invasion to identify the determinants of invasiveness, and to differentiate the class of environments which share territorial and climate features associated with a susceptibility to invasion. IFPs increased exponentially in the last four decades. Until 1919, IFPs already present moved across Europe. Then, new IFPs were introduced mainly from North America, and recently from Asia. Hybrid pathogens also appeared. Countries with a wider range of environments, higher human impact or international trade hosted more IFPs. Rainfall influenced the diffusion rates. Environmental conditions of the new and original ranges and systematic and ecological attributes affected invasiveness. Further spread of established IFPs is expected in countries that have experienced commercial isolation in the recent past. Densely populated countries with high environmental diversity may be the weakest links in attempts to prevent new arrivals. Tight coordination of actions against new arrivals is needed. Eradication seems impossible, and prevention seems the only reliable measure, although this will be difficult in the face of global mobility.

AB Southeast Asia is a region of conservation concern due to heavy losses of its native habitats. In this overview, we highlight the conservation importance of Southeast Asia by comparing its degree of species endemism and endangerment, and its rate of deforestation with other tropical regions (i.e., Meso-America, South America, and Sub-Saharan Africa). Southeast Asia contains the highest mean proportion of country-endemic bird (9%) and mammal species (11%). This region also has the highest proportion of threatened vascular plant, reptile, bird, and mammal species. Furthermore, not only is Southeast Asia's annual deforestation rate the highest in the tropics, but it has also increased between the periods 1990-2000 and 2000-2005. This could result in projected losses of 13-85% of biodiversity in the region by 2100. Secondary habitat restoration, at least in certain countries, would allow for some amelioration of biodiversity loss and thus potentially lower the currently predicted extinction rates. Nonetheless, urgent conservation actions are needed. Conservation initiatives should include public education, sustaining livelihoods, and ways to enhance the sustainability of agriculture and increase the capacity of conservation institutions. Furthermore, these actions should be country-specific and not ignore areas heavily populated by humans, as they can also harbour high numbers of threatened species. We urge that cooperative conservation initiatives be undertaken and support (e.g., capacity-building) be given by more developed countries in the region and beyond.

AB Predator effects on prey dynamics are conventionally studied by measuring changes in prey abundance attributed to consumption by predators. We revisit four classic examples of predator-prey systems often cited in textbooks and incorporate subsequent studies of nonconsumptive effects of predators (NCE), defined as changes in prey traits (e. g., behavior, growth, development) measured on an ecological time scale. Our review revealed that NCE were integral to explaining lynx-hare population dynamics in boreal forests, cascading effects of top predators in Wisconsin lakes, and cascading effects of killer whales and sea otters on kelp forests in nearshore marine habitats. The relative roles of consumption and NCE of wolves on moose and consequent indirect effects on plant communities of Isle Royale depended on climate oscillations. Nonconsumptive effects have not been explicitly tested to explain the link between planktonic alewives and the size structure of the zooplankton, nor have they been invoked to attribute keystone predator status in intertidal communities or elsewhere. We argue that both consumption and intimidation contribute to the total effects of keystone predators, and that characteristics of keystone consumers may differ from those of predators having predominantly NCE. Nonconsumptive effects are often considered as an afterthought to explain observations inconsistent with consumption-based theory. Consequently, NCE with the same sign as consumptive effects may be overlooked, even though they can affect the magnitude, rate, or scale of a prey response to predation and can have important management or conservation implications. Nonconsumptive effects may underlie other classic paradigms in ecology, such as delayed density dependence and predator-mediated prey coexistence. Revisiting classic studies enriches our understanding of predator prey dynamics and provides compelling rationale for ramping up efforts to consider how NCE affect traditional predator-prey models based on consumption, and to compare the relative magnitude of consumptive and NCE of predators.

AB Genetic differentiation can be highly variable across the genome. For example, loci under divergent selection and those tightly linked to them may exhibit elevated differentiation compared to neutral regions. These represent "outlier loci" whose differentiation exceeds neutral expectations. Adaptive divergence can also increase genome-wide differentiation by promoting general barriers to neutral gene flow, thereby facilitating genomic divergence via genetic drift. This latter process can yield a positive correlation between adaptive phenotypic divergence and neutral genetic differentiation (described here as "isolation-by-adaptation"). Here, we examine both these processes by combining an AFLP genome scan of two host plant ecotypes of Timema cristinae walking-sticks with existing data on adaptive phenotypic divergence and ecological speciation in these insects. We found that about 8% of loci are outliers in multiple population comparisons. Replicated comparisons between population-pairs using the same versus different host species revealed that 1-2% of loci are subject to host-related selection specifically. Locus-specific analyses revealed that up to 10% of putatively neutral (nonoutlier) AFLP loci exhibit significant isolation-by-adaptation. Our results suggest that selection may affect differentiation directly, via linkage, or by facilitating genetic drift. They thus illustrate the varied and sometimes nonintuitive contributions of selection to heterogeneous genomic differentiation.

AB Although the X chromosome is usually similar to the autosomes in size and cytogenetic appearance, theoretical models predict that its hemizygosity in males may cause unusual patterns of evolution. The sequencing of several genomes has indeed revealed differences between the X chromosome and the autosomes in the rates of gene divergence, patterns of gene expression and rates of gene movement between chromosomes. A better understanding of these patterns should provide valuable information on the evolution of genes located on the X chromosome. It could also suggest solutions to more general problems in molecular evolution, such as detecting selection and estimating mutational effects on fitness.

AB Natural systems are being subjected to unprecedented rates of change and unique pressures from a combination of anthropogenic environmental change drivers. Plant-plant interactions are an important part of the mechanisms governing the response of plant species and communities to these drivers. For example, competition plays a central role in mediating the impacts of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, climate change and invasive nonnative species. Other plant-plant interaction processes are also being recognized as important factors in determining the impacts of environmental change, including facilitation and evolutionary processes associated with p[ant-plant interactions. However, plant-plant interactions are not the only factors determining the response of species and communities to environmental change drivers - their activity must be placed within the context of the wide, range of factors that regulate species, communities and ecosystems. A major research challenge is to understand when plant-plant interactions play a key role in regulating the impact of environmental change drivers, and the type of role that plant-plant interactions play. Although this is a considerable challenge, some areas of current research may, provide the starting point to achieving these goals, and should be pursued through large-scale, integrated, multisite experiments.

   PROGRAM
AB Monitoring of biodiversity and resource use by professional scientists is often costly and hard to sustain, especially in developing countries, where financial resources are limited. Moreover, such monitoring can be logistically and technically difficult and is often perceived to be irrelevant by resource managers and the local communities. Alternatives are emerging, carried out at a local scale and by individuals with little formal education. The methods adopted span a spectrum, from participatory monitoring where aims and objectives are defined by the community, to ranger-based monitoring in protected areas. What distinguishes these approaches is that local people or local government staff are directly involved in data collection and (in most instances) analysis. In this issue of Biodiversity and Conservation, 15 case studies examine whether these new approaches can address the limitations of professional monitoring in developing countries. The case studies evaluate ongoing locally-based monitoring schemes involving more than 1500 community members in 13 countries. The papers are based on a symposium held in Denmark in April 2004 (www. monitoringmatters. org). Here, we review how the case studies shed light on the following key issues concerning locally-based methods: cost, sustainability, their ability to detect true local or larger-scale trends, their links to management decisions and action, and the empowerment of local constituencies. Locally-based monitoring appears to be consistently cheap relative to the costs of management and of professional monitoring, even though the start-up costs can be high. Most local monitoring schemes are still young and thus their chances of being sustained over the longer term are not yet certain. However, we believe their chances of surviving are better than many professional schemes, particularly when they are institutionalised within existing management structures, and linked to the delivery of ecosystem goods or services to local communities. When properly designed, local schemes yield locally relevant results that can be as reliable as those derived from professional monitoring. Many management decisions emanate from local schemes. The decisions appear to be taken promptly, in response to immediate threats to the environment, and often lead to community-based actions to protect habitats, species or the local flow of ecosystem benefits; however, few local schemes have so far led to actions beyond the local scale. Locally-based monitoring schemes often reinforce existing community-based resource management systems and lead to change in the attitude of locals towards more environmentally sustainable resource management. Locally-derived data have considerable unexplored potential to elucidate global patterns of change in the status of populations and habitats, the services they provide, and the threats they face, but more effort is needed to develop effective modalities for feeding locally-derived data up to national and international levels.

AB Climate is a major determinant for the phenology, physiology, distribution and interactions of plants. The world's recent climate has shown a substantial increase in average temperature which is changing these processes in a perceptible way. The following review compiles and discusses studies reporting recently observed changes in the behaviour, ranges and interactions of species which are thought to be associated with climate change. The multitude of recently published studies providing evidence for the ecological impacts of climate change on many different continents strongly suggests that the last 30 years of warmer temperatures have had a substantial influence on both seasonal patterns, and altitudinal and poleward shifts in vegetation. Common features of change, but also some discrepancies in the response of plants to climate change, are discussed, as well as implications for biodiversity, higher level impacts on community structure and trophic interactions, and some ecosystem consequences.

AB Results from the first full year of measurements (1998-1999) of above canopy CO2 and energy fluxes at the AmeriFlux site in the Morgan-Monroe State Forest, IN, USA, are presented. The site is located in an extensive secondary successional broadleaf forest in the maple-beech to oak-hickory transition zone. The minimum fetch is 4 km. Turbulent flux measurements are obtained by an eddy-covariance system at 46 m (1.8 times the canopy height) with a closed-path infrared gas analyzer.
   Peak vegetation area index (VAI) was determined as 4.7+/-0.5 and the mean albedo during the vegetative period was 0.15+/-0.02. The aerodynamic roughness length was estimated as 2.1+/-1.1m. It showed little variation with wind direction or season. The seasonal variations of energy partitioning and of net CO2 exchange are discussed in terms of the phenological development of the forest. To estimate the annual net ecosystem production (NEP) and carbon sequestration, eddy-covariance measurements during periods of poorly developed turbulence at night, and missing data were replaced by a simple parametric model based on measurements of soil temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The night-time flux correction reduces the annual sequestration estimate by almost 50%. The corrected estimate of annual NEP for the 1998-1999 season is 2.4 t C ha(-1) per year +/-10%.

AB Wright's F-ST and related statistics are often used to measure the extent of divergence among populations of the same species relative to the net genetic diversity within the species. This paper compares several definitions of F-ST which are relevant to DNA sequence data, and shows that these must be used with care when estimating migration parameters. It is also pointed out that F-ST is strongly influenced by the level of within-population diversity. In situations where factors such as selection on closely linked sites are expected to have stronger effects on within population diversity at some loci than at others, differences among loci can result entirely from differences in within-population diversities. It is shown that several published cases of differences in F-ST among regions of high and low recombination in Drosophila may be caused in this way. For the purpose of comparisons of levels of between-population differences among loci or species which are subject to different intensities of forces that reduce variability within local populations, absolute measures of divergence between populations should be used in preference to relative measures such as F-ST.

AB The extent to which species richness in local communities is determined by regional and historical processes is not well understood. An increasingly popular way to investigate these large-scale processes is through regressions of local on regional species richness. We sampled local and regional species richness in a broad array of taxa from around the world to address five questions. First, is the relationship between local and regional species richness linear, or does local richness accumulate more slowly at progressively higher regional diversities, suggesting local saturation of species diversity? Second, do these relationships vary with locality size? Third, do taxa and continents differ in the form of relationships between local and regional diversity? Fourth, do relationships between local and regional diversity depart from that expected from a null model in which all individuals of a locality are randomly sampled from a regional pool of species whose abundances have a canonical log-normal distribution? Fifth, using this same null model, how does the expected relationship between local and regional species richness depend on the sampling intensity within localities? We used distribution maps to ensure that diversity was sampled in a consistent manner across diverse taxa. Each region was 500 x 500 km, and localities were 1% and 10% of the region size.
   There was no evidence of local species saturation, as local species richness was strongly and linearly related to regional richness at both spatial scales. Between scales, local diversity accumulated faster as a function of regional diversity at the larger spatial scale. The slope of this relationship between local and regional diversity was the same among taxa across continents, and between Australia and North America across taxa. In other words, at each spatial scale one relationship between local and regional diversity describes most cases very well. The null model showed that approximately linear relationships between local and regional diversity are expected when regional species abundances are log-normal and when the number of individuals sampled within localities is large (roughly 200 times the number of species in the most species-rich region examined). However, empirical slopes were less than expected from the null model, which we interpret as an effect of spatial turnover of species (beta diversity). Since these slopes were nevertheless similar among taxa and between regions, rates of spatial turnover must be approximately the same among these taxa and regions. The log-normal model also showed that nonlinear (concave down) relationships between local and regional diversity are expected under random sampling when sample size is small relative to regional diversity. Therefore, nonlinear relationships are not necessarily indicative of saturation. Our results suggest that at the scales investigated here local communities are unsaturated and that their diversities are strongly limited by species richness of the surrounding regions. Similarity between taxa and continents in the form of the local-regional diversity relationship implies that ''rules'' governing the assembly of local communities may be widely consistent. If so, understanding species diversity in local assemblages will require knowledge of processes acting at larger spatial scales, including determinants of regional species richness and spatial turnover of species.

AB THE existence of sympatric speciation-that populations diverge into species in the absence of physical or ecological barriers-is controversial1-6. The East African Great Lakes harbour hundreds of cichlid species representing only a few monophyletic lineages7,8, although palaeolimnological evidence9-11 and local restrictions on species distribution12 suggest that speciation in these lakes could have been allopatric13,14. The case for sympatry in restricted areas of Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika is stronger15-17 but not unassailable. A better case might be made for cichlid species flocks in small, ecologically monotonous crater lakes. Here we present a mitochondrial DNA analysis of cichlid species flocks endemic to two such lakes in Cameroon. The results suggest that the flocks in each lake are monophyletic: the implication being that each lake was colonized once only, the size and shape of each lake being such that subsequent diversification would have been sympatric.

AB Ways in which invertebrates colonize lotic habitats are reviewed, tracing patterns in behaviour, trophic ecology, and life history that could lead to predictions concerning resilience of stream communities after disturbance.  Patterns are described for small-scale experimental studies using introduced or natural substrates, for large-scale observations of new or rewatered channels, for rivers recovering from pollution, and for unstable rivers with fluctuating discharge.  Colonization depends on invertebrate mobility (drift, swimming, crawling, and flight), substrate texture and associated food supplies, competition, and predation.  Epilithon-browsers and filter feeders can use the resources of smooth stones; gatherers colonize as fine detritus accumulates; grazers increase as periphyton becomes established; shredders and predators tend to be late arrivals.  Propagules for colonization are made more available by asynchronous and aseasonal life cycles, long oviposition periods, and refuges in the streambed or neighbouring waterbodies.  Species in frequently disturbed streams benefit from these characteristics.  Although disturbance may be due to stochastic factors, recovery is not due to chance.  Recurring ecological patterns among early colonizers suggest that knowledge of the hydrologic regime, food resources, and dominant taxa can be used to predict the overall resilience of a stream community.

AB The succession of microbial community structure and function is a central ecological topic, as microbes drive the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. To elucidate the response and mechanistic underpinnings of soil microbial community structure and metabolic potential relevant to natural forest succession, we compared soil microbial communities from three adjacent natural forests: a coniferous forest (CF), a mixed broadleaf forest (MBF) and a deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) on Shennongjia Mountain in central China. In contrary to plant communities, the microbial taxonomic diversity of the DBF was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those of CF and MBF, rendering their microbial community compositions markedly different. Consistently, microbial functional diversity was also highest in the DBF. Furthermore, a network analysis of microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling genes showed the network for the DBF samples was relatively large and tight, revealing strong couplings between microbes. Soil temperature, reflective of climate regimes, was important in shaping microbial communities at both taxonomic and functional gene levels. As a first glimpse of both the taxonomic and functional compositions of soil microbial communities, our results suggest that microbial community structure and function potentials will be altered by future environmental changes, which have implications for forest succession.

AB Human-driven environmental changes may simultaneously affect the biodiversity, productivity, and stability of Earth's ecosystems, but there is no consensus on the causal relationships linking these variables. Data from 12 multiyear experiments that manipulate important anthropogenic drivers, including plant diversity, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, fire, herbivory, and water, show that each driver influences ecosystem productivity. However, the stability of ecosystem productivity is only changed by those drivers that alter biodiversity, with a given decrease in plant species numbers leading to a quantitatively similar decrease in ecosystem stability regardless of which driver caused the biodiversity loss. These results suggest that changes in biodiversity caused by drivers of environmental change may be a major factor determining how global environmental changes affect ecosystem stability.

AB Estuaries are biogeochemical hot spots because they receive large inputs of nutrients and organic carbon from land and oceans to support high rates of metabolism and primary production. We synthesize published rates of annual phytoplankton primary production (APPP) in marine ecosystems influenced by connectivity to land - estuaries, bays, lagoons, fjords and inland seas. Review of the scientific literature produced a compilation of 1148 values of APPP derived from monthly incubation assays to measure carbon assimilation or oxygen production. The median value of median APPP measurements in 131 ecosystems is 185 and the mean is 252 gCm(-2) yr(-1), but the range is large: from -105 (net pelagic production in the Scheldt Estuary) to 1890 g Cm-2 yr(-1) (net phytoplankton production in Tamagawa Estuary). APPP varies up to 10-fold within ecosystems and 5-fold from year to year (but we only found eight APPP series longer than a decade so our knowledge of decadal-scale variability is limited). We use studies of individual places to build a conceptual model that integrates the mechanisms generating this large variability: nutrient supply, light limitation by turbidity, grazing by consumers, and physical processes (river inflow, ocean exchange, and inputs of heat, light and wind energy). We consider method as another source of variability because the compilation includes values derived from widely differing protocols. A simulation model shows that different methods reported in the literature can yield up to 3-fold variability depending on incubation protocols and methods for integrating measured rates over time and depth.
   Although attempts have been made to upscale measures of estuarine-coastal APPP, the empirical record is inadequate for yielding reliable global estimates. The record is deficient in three ways. First, it is highly biased by the large number of measurements made in northern Europe (particularly the Baltic region) and North America. Of the 1148 reported values of APPP, 958 come from sites between 30 and 60 degrees N; we found only 36 for sites south of 20 degrees N. Second, of the 131 ecosystems where APPP has been reported, 37% are based on measurements at only one location during 1 year. The accuracy of these values is unknown but probably low, given the large interannual and spatial variability within ecosystems. Finally, global assessments are confounded by measurements that are not intercomparable because they were made with different methods.
   Phytoplankton primary production along the continental margins is tightly linked to variability of water quality, biogeochemical processes including ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange, and production at higher trophic levels including species we harvest as food. The empirical record has deficiencies that preclude reliable global assessment of this key Earth system process. We face two grand challenges to resolve these deficiencies: (1) organize and fund an international effort to use a common method and measure APPP regularly across a network of coastal sites that are globally representative and sustained over time, and (2) integrate data into a unifying model to explain the wide range of variability across ecosystems and to project responses of APPP to regional manifestations of global change as it continues to unfold.

ID GROWTH; SHAPE; SIZE
AB Biological systems that perform multiple tasks face a fundamental trade-off: A given phenotype cannot be optimal at all tasks. Here we ask how trade-offs affect the range of phenotypes found in nature. Using the Pareto front concept from economics and engineering, we find that best-trade-off phenotypes are weighted averages of archetypes-phenotypes specialized for single tasks. For two tasks, phenotypes fall on the line connecting the two archetypes, which could explain linear trait correlations, allometric relationships, as well as bacterial gene-expression patterns. For three tasks, phenotypes fall within a triangle in phenotype space, whose vertices are the archetypes, as evident in morphological studies, including on Darwin's finches. Tasks can be inferred from measured phenotypes based on the behavior of organisms nearest the archetypes.

AB As they have in response to past climatic changes, many species will shift their distributions in response to modern climate change. However, due to the unprecedented rapidity of projected climatic changes, some species may not be able to move their ranges fast enough to track shifts in suitable climates and associated habitats. Here, we investigate the ability of 493 mammals to keep pace with projected climatic changes in the Western Hemisphere. We modeled the velocities at which species will likely need to move to keep pace with projected changes in suitable climates. We compared these velocities with the velocities at which species are able to move as a function of dispersal distances and dispersal frequencies. Across the Western Hemisphere, on average, 9.2% of mammals at a given location will likely be unable to keep pace with climate change. In some places, up to 39% of mammals may be unable to track shifts in suitable climates. Eighty-seven percent of mammalian species are expected to experience reductions in range size and 20% of these range reductions will likely be due to limited dispersal abilities as opposed to reductions in the area of suitable climate. Because climate change will likely outpace the response capacity of many mammals, mammalian vulnerability to climate change may be more extensive than previously anticipated.

AB We critically review recent literature on carbon storage and fluxes within natural and constructed freshwater wetlands, and specifically address concerns of readers working in applied science and engineering. Our purpose is to review and assess the distribution and conversion of carbon in the water environment, particularly within wetland systems. A key aim is to assess if wetlands are carbon sinks or sources. Carbon sequestration and fluxes in natural and constructed wetlands located around the world has been assessed. All facets of carbon (solid and gaseous forms) have been covered. We draw conclusions based on these studies. Findings indicate that wetlands can be both sources and sinks of carbon, depending on their age, operation, and the environmental boundary conditions such as location and climate. Suggestions for further research needs in the area of carbon storage in wetland sediments are outlined to facilitate the understanding of the processes of carbon storage and removal and also the factors that influence them.

AB There is a need to document how plant phenology is responding to global change factors, particularly warming trends. "Near-surface" remote sensing, using radiometric instruments or imaging sensors, has great potential to improve phenological monitoring because automated observations can be made at high temporal frequency. Here we build on previous work and show how inexpensive, networked digital cameras ("webcams") can be used to document spatial and temporal variation in the spring and autumn phenology of forest canopies. We use two years of imagery from a deciduous, northern hardwood site, and one year of imagery from a coniferous, boreal transition site. A quantitative signal is obtained by splitting images into separate red, green, and blue color channels and calculating the relative brightness of each channel for "regions of interest" within each image. We put the observed phenological signal in context by relating it to seasonal patterns of gross primary productivity, inferred from eddy covariance measurements of surface-atmosphere CO2 exchange. We show that spring increases, and autumn decreases, in canopy greenness can be detected in both deciduous and coniferous stands. In deciduous stands, an autumn red peak is also observed. The timing and rate of spring development and autumn senescence varies across the canopy, with greater variability in autumn than spring. Interannual variation in phenology can be detected both visually and quantitatively; delayed spring onset in 2007 compared to 2006 is related to a prolonged cold spell from day 85 to day 110. This work lays the foundation for regional-to continental-scale camera-based monitoring of phenology at network observatory sites, e. g., National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) or AmeriFlux.

AB Background: Human movement is a key behavioral factor in many vector-borne disease systems because it influences exposure to vectors and thus the transmission of pathogens. Human movement transcends spatial and temporal scales with different influences on disease dynamics. Here we develop a conceptual model to evaluate the importance of variation in exposure due to individual human movements for pathogen transmission, focusing on mosquito-borne dengue virus.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We develop a model showing that the relevance of human movement at a particular scale depends on vector behavior. Focusing on the day-biting Aedes aegypti, we illustrate how vector biting behavior combined with fine-scale movements of individual humans engaged in their regular daily routine can influence transmission. Using a simple example, we estimate a transmission rate (R-0) of 1.3 when exposure is assumed to occur only in the home versus 3.75 when exposure at multiple locations-e. g., market, friend's-due to movement is considered. Movement also influences for which sites and individuals risk is greatest. For the example considered, intriguingly, our model predicts little correspondence between vector abundance in a site and estimated R-0 for that site when movement is considered. This illustrates the importance of human movement for understanding and predicting the dynamics of a disease like dengue. To encourage investigation of human movement and disease, we review methods currently available to study human movement and, based on our experience studying dengue in Peru, discuss several important questions to address when designing a study.
   Conclusions/Significance: Human movement is a critical, understudied behavioral component underlying the transmission dynamics of many vector-borne pathogens. Understanding movement will facilitate identification of key individuals and sites in the transmission of pathogens such as dengue, which then may provide targets for surveillance, intervention, and improved disease prevention.

AB Despite a strong current interest in ecological networks, the bulk of studies are static descriptions of the structure of networks, and very few analyze their temporal dynamics. Yet, understanding network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an arctic pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links per species.

AB Being able to efficiently and accurately delimit species is one of the most basic and important aspects of systematics because species are the fundamental unit of analysis in biogeography, ecology, and conservation. We present a rationale and approach for combining ecological niche modeling, spatially explicit analyses of environmental data, and phylogenetics in species delimitation, and we use our methodology in an empirical example focusing on Aneides flavipunctatus, the black salamander (Caudata: Plethodontidae), in California. We assess the relationships between genetic, environmental, and geographic distance among populations. We use 11 climatic variables and point locality data from public databases to create ecological niche models. The suitability of potential contact zones between parapatric lineages is also assessed using the data from ecological niche modeling. Phylogenetic analyses of portions of the mitochondrial genome reveal morphologically cryptic mitochondrial lineages in this species. In addition, we find that patterns of genetic divergence are strongly associated with divergence in the ecological niche. Our work demonstrates the ease and utility of using spatial analyses of environmental data and phylogenetics in species delimitation, especially for groups displaying fine-scaled endemism and cryptic species.

AB To maintain sexual reproduction, recombination of good genes through selective mate choice must achieve a twofold genetic benefit in each generation. "Fragrant" immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allow the choosy sex to complement her own set of alleles with a more or less diverse set of male alleles to reach an optimal number of different MHC alleles for the offspring. The optimal complement from the partner should include those MHC alleles that provide resistance against the current parasites, which could be revealed by the expression of costly secondary sexual characters. This maximizes resistance to ever-changing infectious diseases. Because the advantage of sex must be produced through recombination, assortative mating should combine currently advantageous MHC alleles. Preferring just MHC dissimilar mates is only a best-of-bad-job rule. MHC ligand peptides may be the natural "perfume" that reveals a potential partner's MHC genetics probably in all vertebrates. Perfumes may mimick MHC related signals.

AB Rapid faunal assessments can use different methods depending on environmental conditions and costs. To compare the efficiency of three methods in detecting species richness and abundance, we tested them in the grasslands of Emas National Park, central Brazil. Track census was the most effective method for detecting richness, followed by camera-trapping and direct faunal counts. Track census reached an asymptote for number of species after only 12 days, but all methods converged on similar estimates of species richness after around 30 days. There was no significant spatial correlation for species richness or total abundance, between camera trap and tracks, across the 29 samples distributed in the park. However, for some species, abundance showed significant spatial correlation between methods. Also, these rates were significantly correlated across species and the spatial correlation between methods was significantly associated with log-transformed body mass across species. We conclude that, despite the high initial costs for camera-trapping, this method is the most appropriate for mammal inventory in all environmental conditions, allowing a rapid assessment of wildlife conservation status.

AB Recent research has emphasized the importance of riparian ecosystems as centers of biodiversity and links between terrestrial and aquatic systems. Riparian ecosystems also belong among the environments that are most disturbed by humans and are in need of restoration to maintain biodiversity and ecological integrity. To facilitate the completion of this task, researchers have an important function to communicate their knowledge to policy-makers and managers, This article presents some fundamental qualities of riparian systems, articulated as three basic principles. The basic principles proposed are: (1) The flow regime determines the successional evolution of riparian plant communities and ecological processes. (2) The riparian corridor serves as a pathway for redistribution of organic and inorganic material that influences plant communities along rivers. (3) The riparian system is a transition zone between land and water ecosystems and is disproportionately plant species-rich when compared to surrounding ecosystems. Translating these principles into management directives requires more information about how much water a river needs and when and how, i.e., flow variables described by magnitude, frequency, timing, duration, and rate of change. It also requires information about how various groups of organisms are affected by habitat fragmentation, especially in terms of their dispersal. Finally, it requires information about how effects of hydrologic alterations vary between different types of riparian systems and with the location within the watershed.

AB Diversity (or biodiversity) is typically measured by a species count (richness) and sometimes with an evenness index; it may also be measured by a proportional statistic that combines both measures (e.g., Shannon-Weiner index H'). These diversity measures are hypothesized to be positively and strongly correlated, but this null hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We used the results of Caswell's neutral model to generate null relationships between richness (S), evenness (J'), and proportional diversity (H'). We tested predictions of the null model against empirical relationships describing data in a literature survey and in four individual studies conducted across various scales. Empirical relationships between or and differed from log S or J' and H' differed from the null model when <10 species were tested and in plants, vertebrates, and fungi. The empirical relationships were similar to the null model when >10 and <100 species were tested and in invertebrates. If >100 species were used to estimate diversity, the relation between and log S and H' was negative. The strongest predictive models included log S and J'. A path analysis indicated that log S and J' were always negatively related, that empirical observations could not be explained without including indirect effects, and that differences between the partials may indicate ecological effects, which suggests that S and J' act like diversity components or that diversity should be measured using a compound statistic.

AB We have amassed structural data for 108 characters and 52 taxa of magnoliids and basal monocots and eudicots, including observations by P. K. Endress and A. Igersheim on flowers. These data were analyzed separately and in combination with rbcL, 18S, and atpB sequences. Besides confirming agreements between previous analyses of both kinds of data (reduction of Magnoliales to six families; relation of Piperaceae, Saururaceae, Lactoris, and Aristolochiaceae), trees based on this data set show shifts toward molecular results (separation of Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae from Winteraceae and of Amborella, Austrobaileya, Trimeniaceae, and Chloranthaceae from Laurales; relation of Winteraceae and Canellaceae) plus continued conflicts (association of Chloranthaceae with Amborella and Trimeniaceae and of Nymphaeales with monocots). In cases where molecular and morphological trees conflict, combined analyses of morphological and molecular data generally yield the same topologies as molecular analyses, but morphology overcomes weak molecular evidence in indicating that Chloranthaceae belong just above the basal grade, that monocots are related to Piperales, and that Lauraceae are linked with Hernandiaceae. If angiosperms are rooted by molecular data, chloranthoid leaf teeth, two-trace nodes, columellar (not granular) pollen, and ascidiate carpels sealed by secretion are ancestral. Vesselless xylem is primitive in Amborella but secondary in Winteraceae and Trochodendraceae.

AB RNA folding from sequences into secondary structures is a simple yet powerful, biophysically grounded model of a genotype-phenotype map in which concepts like plasticity, evolvability, epistasis, and modularity can not only be precisely defined and statistically measured but also reveal simultaneous and profoundly non-independent effects of natural selection. Molecular plasticity is viewed here as the capacity of an RNA sequence to assume a variety of energetically favorable shapes by equilibrating among them at constant temperature. Through simulations based on experimental designs, we study the dynamics of a population of RNA molecules that evolve toward a predefined target shape in a constant environment. Each shape in the plastic repertoire of a sequence contributes to the overall fitness of the sequence in proportion to the Lime the sequence spends in that shape. Plasticity is costly since the more shapes a sequence can assume, the less time it spends in any one of them. Unsurprisingly, selection leads to a reduction of plasticity (environmental canalization). The most striking observation, however, is the simultaneous slow-down and eventual halting of the evolutionary process. The reduction of plasticity entails genetic canalization, that is, a dramatic loss of variability (and hence a loss of evolvability) to the point of lock-in. The causal bridge between environmental canalization and genetic canalization is provided by a correlation between the set of shapes in the plastic repertoire of a sequence and the set of dominant (minimum free energy) shapes in its genetic neighborhood. This statistical property of the RNA genotype-phenotype map, which we call plastogenetic congruence, traps populations in regions where most genetic variation is phenotypically neutral. We call this phenomenon neutral confinement. Analytical models of neutral confinement, made tractable by the assumption of perfect plastogenetic congruence, formally connect mutation rate, the topography of phenotype space, and evolvability. These models identify three mutational regimes: that corresponding to neutral confinement, an exploration threshold corresponding to a breakdown of neutral confinement with the simultaneous persistence of the dominant phenotype, and a classic error threshold corresponding to the loss of the dominant phenotype. In a final step, we analyze the structural properties of canalized phenotypes. The reduction of plasticity leads to extreme modularity, which we analyze from several perspectives: thermophysical (melting--the RNA version of a norm of reaction), kinetic (folding pathways--the RNA version of development), and genetic (transposability-the insensitivity to genetic context). The model thereby suggests a possible evolutionary origin of modularity as a side effect of environmental canalization. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 288:242-283, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB We examined the roles of dispersal mechanism, a biological barrier, light availability, an environmental barrier; and level of disturbance, a physical barrier, in explaining the spatial patterns of exotic plant species along road and stream segments in a forest landscape in the western Cascade Range of Oregon (U.S.A). The presence or absence of 21 selected exotic plant species and light levels were observed along 0.3- to 1.0-km transects within four habitat types. Each habitat represented a different level of disturbance: high-use roads, low-use roads, abandoned roads, and streams in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest. Nearly 300 50 X 2-m sampling units were surveyed along five transects in each habitat type. We used ordination (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and logistic regression to analyze data. All of the nearly 200 sampling units along roads with high and low levels of vehicle traffic contained at least one exotic plant species, and some contained as many as 14. Streams that were most recently disturbed by floods 20-30 years ago and abandoned spur roads with no traffic for 20-40 years also had numerous exotic species. Roads and streams apparently serve multiple functions that enhance exotic species invasion in this landscape: they act as corridors or agents for dispersal, provide suitable habitat, and contain reservoirs of propagules for future episodes of invasion. Species-specific dispersal mechanisms, habitat characteristics, and disturbance history each explain some, but not all, of the patterns of exotic species invasion observed in this study.

AB Human activities have more than doubled the inputs of nitrogen (N) into terrestrial systems globally. The sources and distribution of anthropogenic N, including N fertilization and N fixed during fossil fuel combustion, are rapidly shifting from the temperate zone to a more global distribution. The consequences of anthropogenic N deposition for ecosystem processes and N losses have been studied primarily in N-limited ecosystems in the temperate zone; there is reason to expect that tropical ecosystems, where plant growth is most often limited by some other resource, will respond differently to increasing deposition. In this paper, we assess the likely direct and indirect effects of increasing anthropogenic N inputs on tropical ecosytem processes. We conclude that anthropogenic inputs of N into tropical forests are unlikely to increase productivity and may even decrease it due to indirect effects on acidity and the availability of phosphorus and cations. We also suggest that the direct effects of anthropogenic N deposition on N cycling processes will lead to increased fluxes at the soil-water and soil-air interfaces, with little or no lag in response time. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties inherent in this analysis, and outline future research that is needed to address those uncertainties.

AB Microhabitat preferences are assumed to be adaptive, suggesting that fitness is higher in preferred microhabitats and potentially reflecting natural selection on habitat choices. I examined microhabitat preferences and adaptiveness of preferences for seven bird species coexisting in high elevation snowmelt drainages based on study of microhabitat and survival of 1556 nests. Habitat features in the nest patch differed from both random and non-use (sites centered on the same plant species as used for the nest) sites within each bird species, indicating nonrandom nest site choice. Bird species within a nesting guild (ground, shrub) also differed from each other based on the same vegetation features that differentiated nest sites from non-use and random sites, and this vegetation feature dominated the microhabitat type that was used most frequently by each species. In short, frequency of use of dominant vegetation types, comparisons of nest vs. random and nonuse sites, and comparisons among species were concordant in their indications of microhabitat preferences. The frequency in use of microhabitats was taken as an unambiguous measure of microhabitat preference within this study system: vegetation varied along a short microclimate gradient in the study system and territories of birds encompassed the entire gradient, thereby making all microhabitats available within the territory of each individual, such that use reflected a clear choice among alternatives. Microhabitat preferences differed among species and reflected differing positions on the microclimate gradient. Thus, species partitioned either microhabitat or microclimate within each nesting guild. Nest success was greater at preferred than at nonpreferred microhabitats for all seven species, indicating that preferences were adaptive. Examination of cubic spline curves and standardized directional selection differentials (s) and selection gradients (beta) indicated that preferences had positive directional selection coefficients. These selection coefficients suggested that selection might be acting to favor preferences, but information on genetic bases of habitat choices is needed before selection can be ascertained. Advances in understanding evolution of habitat preferences depend on an individual-level examination of habitat choices and their fitness consequences, and also examination of the phenotypic traits and mechanisms that underlie habitat-induced variation in fitness components.

AB A food web graphically represents the paths of nutrients and energy through the living components of an ecosystem and the context in which individuals exploit their prey and avoid their enemies. Temporary ponds are excellent arenas for the study of food webs because they are discrete communities that can be mimicked in containers that approach the realism of natural habitats. Artificial ponds permit repeatable initial conditions and sufficient replication of independent experimental units in complex experiments to test hypotheses about the control of structure and function in natural communities. I used a combination of observations of natural ponds, ''experimental natural history'' of artificial ponds in my study area, and controlled experiments in an array of 144 replicate ponds to develop, then test, hypotheses about how the structures of food webs are regulated.
   Understanding food webs begins with population biology. Amphibians use the aquatic larval stage of their biphasic life cycle to exploit ephemeral opportunities for growth and development in temporary ponds. The regulation of population density and the fitness of individuals are determined by complex interactions among competition, predation, and uncertainty in the length of the time ponds retain water. Exponential models of density-dependent recruitment relate the number of metamorphs to the input of eggs into ponds without predators. Extensions of these models include interspecific competition and predation. The addition of predation to these systems has three effects. (1) Predators can reduce, even eliminate, prey. There are species-specific differences among co-occurring prey in their risks of predation, and these risks change with relative body sizes of predator and prey. (2) individuals may evoke an inducible defense that reduces their risk by either decreasing active foraging or developing morphological adaptations, such as changes in the coloration and shape of tails. These defenses may entail costs in body size and timing of metamorphosis. (3) Finally, mortality due to predators may reduce competition, thereby benefiting the population of the prey by permitting individuals that escape predation to grow rapidly enough to escape drying ponds.
   The order of arrival of species at breeding ponds has an impact on their own success as well as having a lasting impact on the success of species that arrive later. Such priority effects may result from size-specific changes in trophic connections or indirect effects between species mediated through the food web. Anurans can have strong effects on the partitioning of the flow of nutrients through the phytoplankton vs. the periphyton. This effect on partitioning of production can then have strong effects on zooplankton and insects. Salamanders can play the role of keystone, or critical, predators by affecting the structure of the assemblages of zooplankton and anurans that determine much of the dynamics of nutrient flows within food webs in temporary ponds.

AB The outcome of many high-order processes in ecology depends on the way in which the abundance and distribution of plants affect the eating rate of mammalian herbivores. However, simple, mechanistic models describing the operation of the functional response of these animals have failed to emerge. We offer new models describing the effects of spatial and morphological characteristics of plants on the intake rate of plant tissue by mammalian herbivores feeding within plant patches. We structure our models to respond to three patterns of plant availability: (1) spatially dispersed, apparent plants; (2) spatially dispersed, nonapparent plants; and (3) spatially concentrated plants. We depart from the traditional representations of predator functional response in assuming that searching for food and processing it can overlap in time. Our models illustrate that several distinct mechanisms can account for Type II functional responses frequently seen in herbivores. We show how differences among these mechanisms can explain anomalies in the empirical literature on regulation of intake rate of mammalian herbivores including divergence in functional responses between grazers and browsers, linear functional response curves, and curves showing zero slope throughout the domain of food availability.

AB As climate change progresses, we are observing widespread changes in phenotypes in many plant populations. Whether these phenotypic changes are directly caused by climate change, and whether they result from phenotypic plasticity or evolution, are active areas of investigation. Here, we review terrestrial plant studies addressing these questions. Plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change are clearly occurring. Of the 38 studies that met our criteria for inclusion, all found plastic or evolutionary responses, with 26 studies showing both. These responses, however, may be insufficient to keep pace with climate change, as indicated by eight of 12 studies that examined this directly. There is also mixed evidence for whether evolutionary responses are adaptive, and whether they are directly caused by contemporary climatic changes. We discuss factors that will likely influence the extent of plastic and evolutionary responses, including patterns of environmental changes, species' life history characteristics including generation time and breeding system, and degree and direction of gene flow. Future studies with standardized methodologies, especially those that use direct approaches assessing responses to climate change over time, and sharing of data through public databases, will facilitate better predictions of the capacity for plant populations to respond to rapid climate change.

AB Leafing-out of woody plants begins the growing season in temperate forests and is one of the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. There is substantial variation in the timing of leaf-out, both within and among species, but the leaf development of almost all temperate tree and shrub species is highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, leaf-out times of temperate forests are valuable for observing the effects of climate change. Analysis of phenology data from around the world indicates that leaf-out is generally earlier in warmer years than in cooler years and that the onset of leaf-out has advanced in many locations. Changes in the timing of leaf-out will affect carbon sequestration, plant-animal interactions, and other essential ecosystem processes. The development of remote sensing methods has expanded the scope of leaf-out monitoring from the level of an individual plant or forest to an entire region. Meanwhile, historical data have informed modeling and experimental studies addressing questions about leaf-out timing. For most species, onset of leaf-out will continue to advance, although advancement may be slowed for some species because of unmet chilling requirements. More information is needed to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the timing of future spring onset.

AB Conceptually, plant functional types represent a classification scheme between species and broad vegetation types. Historically, these were based on physiological, structural and/or phenological properties, whereas recently, they have reflected plant responses to resources or environmental conditions. Often, an underlying assumption, based on an economic analogy, is that the functional role of vegetation can be identified by linked sets of morphological and physiological traits constrained by resources, based on the hypothesis of functional convergence. Using these concepts, ecologists have defined a variety of functional traits that are often context dependent, and the diversity of proposed traits demonstrates the lack of agreement on universal categories. Historically, remotely sensed data have been interpreted in ways that parallel these observations, often focused on the categorization of vegetation into discrete types, often dependent on the sampling scale. At the same time, current thinking in both ecology and remote sensing has moved towards viewing vegetation as a continuum rather than as discrete classes. The capabilities of new remote sensing instruments have led us to propose a new concept of optically distinguishable functional types ('optical types') as a unique way to address the scale dependence of this problem. This would ensure more direct relationships between ecological information and remote sensing observations.

AB There is an urgent need to thoroughly review and comprehend the effects of urbanization on wildlife in order to understand both the ecological implications of increasing urbanization and how to mitigate its threat to biodiversity globally. We examined patterns in comparative productivity of urban and non-urban passerine birds, using published estimates from paired comparisons, and by reviewing and developing explanations in terms of resources, competitors, predators and other specifically urban environmental factors. The most consistent patterns were for earlier lay dates, lower clutch size, lower nestling weight and lower productivity per nesting attempt in urban landscapes; these were supported by a formal meta-analysis. Nest failure rates did not show consistent patterns across the species considered. We suggest that food availability is a key driver of differences in passerine demography between landscapes. In urban habitats, human-provided food may improve adult condition over winter, leading to earlier lay dates and, in some species, to higher survival and higher breeding densities, but paucity of natural food may lead to lower productivity per nesting attempt. We demonstrate that additional comparative research is needed on a wider range of species, on the effects of natural and human-provided food availability, and on the differences in survival and dispersal between urban and non-urban populations. Importantly, better-targeted research and monitoring is needed in areas that are at greatest threat from urbanization, especially in the developing world.

AB A synthesis between community ecology and evolutionary biology is emerging that identifies how genetic variation and evolution within one species can shape the ecological properties of entire communities and, in turn, how community context can govern evolutionary processes and patterns. This synthesis incorporates research on the ecology and evolution within communities over short timescales (community genetics and diffuse coevolution), as well as macroevolutionary timescales (community phylogenetics and co-diversification of communities). As we discuss here, preliminary evidence supports the hypothesis that there is a dynamic interplay between ecology and evolution within communities, yet researchers have not yet demonstrated convincingly whether, and under what circumstances, it is important for biologists to bridge community ecology and evolutionary biology. Answering this question will have important implications for both basic and applied problems in biology.

AB Mixed-species plantations of Eucalyptus with a nitrogen (N-2) fixing species have the potential to increase productivity while maintaining soil fertility, compared to Eucalyptus monocultures. However, it is difficult to predict combinations of species and sites that will lead to these benefits. We review the processes and interactions occurring in mixed plantations, and the influence of species or site attributes, to aid the selection of successful combinations of species and sites. Successful mixtures, where productivity is increased over that of monocultures, have often developed stratified canopies, such that the less shade-tolerant species overtops the more shade-tolerant species. Successful mixtures also have significantly higher rates of N and P cycling than Eucalyptus monocultures. It is therefore important to select N-2-fixing species with readily decomposable litter and high rates of nutrient cycling, as well as high rates of N-2-fixation. While the dynamics of N-2-fixation in tree stands are not well understood, it appears as though eucalypts can benefit from fixed N as early as the first or second year following plantation establishment. A meta-analysis of 18 published studies revealed several trials in which mixtures were significantly (P < 0.001) more productive than monocultures, and no instances in which mixtures were less productive than monocultures. Regression analyses of such data were more informative than indices of relative yield, and were more informative in trials that contrasted four or more different species compositions. Thus replacement series examining compositions of 100:0, 67:33, 33:67, and 0: 100 were more informative than minimalist 100:0, 50:50 and 0: 100 series. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The provisioning of sustaining goods and services that we obtain from natural ecosystems is a strong economic justification for the conservation of biological diversity. Understanding the relationship between these goods and services and changes in the size, arrangement, and quality of natural habitats is a fundamental challenge of natural resource management. In this paper, we describe a new approach to assessing the implications of habitat loss for loss of ecosystem services by examining how the provision of different ecosystem services is dominated by species from different trophic levels. We then develop a mathematical model that illustrates how declines in habitat quality and quantity lead to sequential losses of trophic diversity. The model suggests that declines in the provisioning of services will initially be slow but will then accelerate as species from higher trophic levels are lost at faster rates. Comparison of these patterns with empirical examples of ecosystem collapse (and assembly) suggest similar patterns occur in natural systems impacted by anthropogenic change. In general, ecosystem goods and services provided by species in the upper trophic levels will be lost before those provided by species lower in the food chain. The decrease in terrestrial food chain length predicted by the model parallels that observed in the oceans following overexploitation. The large area requirements of higher trophic levels make them as susceptible to extinction as they are in marine systems where they are systematically exploited. Whereas the traditional species-area curve suggests that 50% of species are driven extinct by an order-of-magnitude decline in habitat abundance, this magnitude of loss may represent the loss of an entire trophic level and all the ecosystem services performed by the species on this trophic level.

AB Deliberate progress towards the goal of long-term sustainability depends on understanding the dynamics of linked social and ecological systems. The concept of social-ecological resilience holds promise for interdisciplinary syntheses. Resilience is a multifaceted concept that as yet has not been directly operationalized, particularly in systems for which our ignorance is such that detailed, parameter-rich simulation models are difficult to develop. We present an exploratory framework as a step towards the operationalization of resilience for empirical studies. We equate resilience with the ability of a system to maintain its identity, where system identity is defined as a property of key components and relationships (networks) and their continuity through space and time. Innovation and memory are also fundamental to understanding identity and resilience. By parsing our systems into the elements that we subjectively consider essential to identity, we obtain a small set of specific focal variables that reflect changes in identity. By assessing the potential for changes in identity under specified drivers and perturbations, in combination with a scenario-based approach to considering alternative futures, we obtain a surrogate measure of the current resilience of our study system as the likelihood of a change in system identity under clearly specified conditions, assumptions, drivers and perturbations. Although the details of individual case studies differ, the concept of identity provides a level of generality that can be used to compare measure of resilience across cases. Our approach will also yield insights into the mechanisms of change and the potential consequences of different policy and management decisions, providing a level of decision support for each case study area.

AB A useful way of summarizing genetic variability among different populations is through estimates of the inbreeding coefficient, F-st. Several recent studies have tried to use the distribution of estimates of F-st from individual genetic loci to detect the effects of natural selection. However, the promise of this approach has yet to be fully realized owing to the pervasive dogma that this distribution is highly dependent on demographic history. Here, I review recent theoretical results that indicate that the distribution of estimates of F-st is generally expected to be robust to the vagaries of demographic history. I suggest that analyses based on it provide a useful first step for identifying candidate genes that might be under selection, and explore the ways in which this information can be used in ecological and evolutionary studies.

AB This article argues that in order to facilitate a more effective transition to sustainability, tourism researchers need to keep abreast of transformations occurring in related fields, especially ecosystem ecology, ecological economics, global change science, and complexity theory. New knowledge from these spheres relating to complex adaptive systems, a necessary retreat from reductionism, extensive integration of human and natural systems, new interpretations of sustainability, and the emergence of sustainability science is of great relevance to contemporary tourism study. The article provides an introduction to the potentially extensive application of this knowledge to tourism and concludes by suggesting a reconceptualization of the field of study to accommodate it.

AB In the 1960s, when population geneticists first began to collect data on the amount of genetic variation in natural populations, balancing selection was invoked as a possible explanation for how such high levels of molecular variation are maintained. However, the predictions of the neutral theory of molecular evolution have since become the standard by which cases of balancing selection may be inferred. Here we review the evidence for balancing selection acting on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of vertebrates, a genetic system that defies many of the predictions of neutrality. We apply many widely used tests of neutrality to MHC data as a benchmark for assessing the power of these tests. These tests can be categorized as detecting selection in the current generation, over the history of populations, or over the histories of species. We find that selection is not detectable in MHC datasets in every generation, population, or every evolutionary lineage. This suggests either that selection on the MHC is heterogeneous or that many of the current neutrality tests lack sufficient power to detect the selection consistently. Additionally, we identify a potential inference problem associated with several tests of neutrality. We demonstrate that the signals of selection may be generated in a relatively short period of microevolutionary time, yet these signals may take exceptionally long periods of time to be erased in the absence of selection. This is especially true for the neutrality test based on the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions. Inference of the nature of the selection events that create such signals should be approached with caution. However, a combination of tests on different time scales may overcome such problems.

AB Comparisons of the causes and consequences of cross- and self-fertilization have dominated research on plant mating since Darwin's seminal work on plant reproduction. Here, I provide examples of these accomplishments, but also illustrate new approaches that emphasize the role of floral design and display in pollen dispersal and fitness gain through male function. Wide variation in outcrossing rate characterizes animal-pollinated plants. In species with large floral displays, part of the selfing component of mixed mating can arise from geitonogamy and be maladaptive because of strong inbreeding depression and pollen discounting. Floral strategies that separate the benefits of floral display from the mating costs associated with geitonogamy can resolve these conflicts by reducing lost mating opportunities through male function. The results from experiments with marker genes and floral manipulations provide evidence for the function of herkogamy and dichogamy in reducing self-pollination and promoting pollen dispersal. Evidence is also presented indicating that increased selfing resulting from changes to floral design, or geitonogamy in large clones, can act as a stimulus for the evolution of dioecy. The scope of future research on mating strategies needs to be broadened to include investigations of functional links among flowers, inflorescences and plant architecture within the framework of life-history evolution.

TI Atrophic cascade regulates salt marsh primary production
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF

LA English
DT Article
ID TOP-DOWN; SIZE; FLOW
AB Nutrient supply is widely thought to regulate primary production of many ecosystems including salt marshes. However, experimental manipulation of the dominant marsh grazer (the periwinkle, Littoraria irrorata) and its consumers (e.g., blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, terrapins, Malaclemys terrapin) demonstrates plant biomass and production are largely controlled by grazers and their predators. Periwinkle grazing can convert one of the most productive grasslands in the world into a barren mudflat within 8 months. Marine predators regulate the abundance of this plant-grazing snail. Thus, top-down control of grazer density is a key regulatory determinant of marsh grass growth. The discovery of this simple trophic cascade implies that over-harvesting of snail predators (e.g., blue crabs) may be an important factor contributing to the massive die-off (tens of km(2)) of salt marshes across the southeastern United States. In addition, our results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating widespread, predator regulation of marine macrophyte production via trophic cascades (kelps, seagrasses, intertidal algae).

DT Article
ID NATURAL-SELECTION; PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE; SEXUAL ISOLATION; SPECIATION;
   FREQUENCIES
AB Parallel evolution of similar traits in independent populations that inhabit ecologically similar environments strongly implicates natural selection as the cause of evolution(1). Parallel speciation is a special form of parallel evolution where traits that determine reproductive isolation evolve repeatedly, in closely related populations, as by-products of adaptation to ecological conditions(1,2). The outcome of such parallel evolution is that ecologically divergent pairs of populations exhibit greater levels of reproductive isolation than ecologically similar pairs of populations of a similar or younger age(2-4). The parallel evolution of reproductive isolation provides strong evidence for natural selection in the process of speciation(1), but only one conclusive example from nature is known(2). Populations of the walking-stick insect Timema cristinae that use different host-plant species have diverged in body size and shape, host preference, behaviour and the relative frequency of two highly cryptic colour-pattern morphs(5,6). Here we report that divergent selection for host adaptation, and not genetic drift, has promoted the parallel evolution of sexual isolation in this species. Our findings represent a clear demonstration that host-plant adaptation can play a crucial and repeatable role in the early stages of speciation.

AB It is paradoxical that exotic species invade and displace native species that are well adapted to local environments. Yet, even those exotics that eventually become abundant and widespread, often do so only after having failed to establish following multiple earlier introductions. The first pattern, while not generally discussed in this context, is usually explained by exotic species pre-adaptations for human-altered environments and by a release from enemies. It can be understood further by examining the superior quality of colonists from large species-rich regions and the historical contingency of evolution. The second pattern is generally explained by invoking demographic and environmental stochasticity; however, it can be understood further by examining the role of environmental variation over space and by metapopulation dynamics. These processes provide a context in which these patterns of invasion are not paradoxical, but instead, expected.

AB Flowing water has profound effects on a diverse array of ecological processes and patterns in streams and rivers. We propose a conceptual framework for investigating the multiple causal pathways by which flow influences benthic biota and focus particular attention on the local scales at which these organisms respond to flow. Flow (especially characteristics linked to the velocity field) can strongly affect habitat characteristics, dispersal, resource acquisition, competition, and predation; creative experiments will be needed to disentangle these complex interactions. Benthic organisms usually reside within the roughness layer, where the unique arrangement of sediment particles produces strongly sheared and highly three-dimensional flow patterns. Thus, accurate characterization of the local flow environments experienced by benthic organisms often requires the use of flow measurement technology with high spatial and temporal resolution. Because flow exhibits variation across a broad range of scales, it is also necessary to examine how organism-flow relationships at one scale are linked to those at others. Interdisciplinary approaches are needed in the study of physical-biological coupling; increased collaboration between ecologists and experts in fluid mechanics and hydraulic engineering is particularly desirable. A greater understanding of physical-biological coupling will not only yield deeper insights into the ecological organization of streams and rivers, it will also improve our ability to predict how flow alterations caused by various human activities affect these vital ecosystems.

AB Cascading trophic interactions are important in many freshwater pelagic food webs, but their importance in more complex, omnivore-rich littoral-zone food webs is less well known. We tested the existence of a trophic cascade involving omnivorous crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), macroinvertebrates, periphyton, and macrophytes using 9-m(2) cages in the littoral zone of Plum Lake, Wisconsin, USA. Treatments in the replicated (N = 4) experiment were crayfish enclosures, crayfish exclosures, and cageless references. During June-September, we measured macrophyte shoot numbers, macroinvertebrate numbers, and periphyton (on plastic strips) chlorophyll a, and dry mass (DM). We expected that crayfish foraging would directly reduce abundance and change species composition of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates and would indirectly enhance periphyton abundance by reducing the abundance of grazing snails.
   In enclosures, macrophyte and snail (but not nonsnail macroinvertebrate) densities declined significantly throughout the experiment, whereas densities of macrophytes, snails, and nonsnail macroinvertebrates increased in exclosures and cageless references. Some of the reduction in macrophytes resulted from nonconsumptive fragmentation of macrophytes by crayfish. Consistent with the cascading trophic interactions model, periphyton chlorophyll a per unit surface area increased in enclosures, but declined in exclosures. Periphyton quality (as indexed by chlorophyll a/DM) also increased in enclosures relative to exclosures and cageless references. However, because of large reductions in macrophyte surface area (which periphyton colonizes) in enclosures, total amount of periphyton chlorophyll a in enclosures (relative to exclosures) probably declined while periphyton quantity per unit surface area and periphyton quality increased. Thus, the impacts of crayfish omnivory on periphyton, expressed in two conflicting indirect effects, confirm the possibility that omnivory can complicate cascading trophic predictions. Overall, results support the existence of strong trophic interactions in the littoral zone, in which omnivorous crayfish control abundance of macrophytes, snails, and periphyton.

AB Receptors that recognize conserved pathogen molecules are the first line of cellular innate immunity defense. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best understood of the innate immune receptors that detect infections in mammals. Key features of the fish TLRs and the factors involved in their signaling cascade have high structural similarity to the mammalian TLR system. However, the fish TLRs also exhibit very distinct features and large diversity which is likely derived from their diverse evolutionary history and the distinct environments that they occupy. Six non-mammalian TLRs were identified in fish. TLR14 shares sequence and structural similarity with TLR1 and 2, and the other five (TLR19, 20, 21, 22 and 23) form a cluster of novel TLRs. TLR4 was lost from the genomes of most fishes, and the TLR4 genes found in zebrafish do not recognize the mammalian agonist LPS and are likely paralogous and not orthologous to mammalian TLR4 genes. TLR6 and 10 are also absent from all fish genomes sequenced to date. Of the at least 16 TLR types identified in fish, direct evidence of ligand specificity has only been shown for TLR2, TLR3, TLR5M, TLR5S and TLR22. The common carp TLR2 was shown to recognize the synthetic triacylated lipopeptide Pam(3)CSK(4) and lipopeptides from gram positive bacteria. The membrane-bound TLR5 (TLR5M) signaling in response to flagellin in rainbow trout is amplified through interaction with the soluble form (TLR5S) in a positive loop feedback. In Fugu, TLR3 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and recognizes relatively short dsRNA, while TLR22 has a surveillance function like the human cell-surface TLR3. Genome and gene duplications have been major contributors to the teleost's rich evolutionary history and genomic diversity. Duplicate or multi-copy TLR genes were identified for TLR3 and 7 in common carp, TLR4b, 5, 8 and 20 in zebrafish, TLR8a in rainbow trout and TLR22 in rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon. The main task for current and near-future fish TLRs research is to develop specificity assays to identify the ligands of all fish TLRs, which will advance comparative immunology research and will contribute to our understanding of disease resistance mechanisms in fish and the development of new adjuvants and/or more effective vaccines and therapeutics.

AB P>Paleobotanists have long used models based on leaf size and shape to reconstruct paleoclimate. However, most models incorporate a single variable or use traits that are not physiologically or functionally linked to climate, limiting their predictive power. Further, they often underestimate paleotemperature relative to other proxies.
   Here we quantify leaf-climate correlations from 92 globally distributed, climatically diverse sites, and explore potential confounding factors. Multiple linear regression models for mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) are developed and applied to nine well-studied fossil floras.
   We find that leaves in cold climates typically have larger, more numerous teeth, and are more highly dissected. Leaf habit (deciduous vs evergreen), local water availability, and phylogenetic history all affect these relationships. Leaves in wet climates are larger and have fewer, smaller teeth. Our multivariate MAT and MAP models offer moderate improvements in precision over univariate approaches (+/- 4.0 vs 4.8 degrees C for MAT) and strong improvements in accuracy. For example, our provisional MAT estimates for most North American fossil floras are considerably warmer and in better agreement with independent paleoclimate evidence.
   Our study demonstrates that the inclusion of additional leaf traits that are functionally linked to climate improves paleoclimate reconstructions. This work also illustrates the need for better understanding of the impact of phylogeny and leaf habit on leaf-climate relationships.

AB Hydrochory, or the passive dispersal of organisms by water, is an important means of propagule transport, especially for plants. During recent years, knowledge about hydrochory and its ecological consequences has increased considerably and a substantial body of literature has been produced. Here, we review this literature and define the state of the art of the discipline. A substantial proportion of species growing in or near water have propagules (fruits, seeds or vegetative units) able to disperse by water, either floating, submerged in flowing water, or with the help of floating vessels. Hydrochory can enable plants to colonize sites out of reach with other dispersal vectors, but the timing of dispersal and mechanisms of establishment are important for successful establishment. At the population level, hydrochory may increase the effective size and longevity of populations, and control their spatial configuration. Hydrochory is also an important source of species colonizing recruitment-limited riparian and wetland communities, contributing to maintenance of community species richness. Dispersal by water may even influence community composition in different landscape elements, resulting in landscape-level patterns. Genetically, hydrochory may reduce spatial aggregation of genetically related individuals, lead to high gene flow among populations, and increase genetic diversity in populations receiving many propagules. Humans have impacted hydrochory in many ways. For example, dams affect hydrochory by reducing peak flows and hence dispersal capacity, altering the timing of dispersal, and by presenting physical barriers to dispersal, with consequences for riverine plant communities. Hydrochory has been inferred to be an important vector for the spread of many invasive species, but there is also the potential for enhancing ecosystem restoration by improving or restoring water dispersal pathways. Climate change may alter the role of hydrochory by modifying the hydrology of water-bodies as well as conditions for propagule release and plant colonization.

AB Graph structures and habitat availability metrics are two recent and complementary approaches for analysing landscape connectivity. They have gained rapid popularity and provided significant conceptual improvements for decision making in conservation planning. We present a further methodological development of the habitat availability concept and metrics by partitioning them into three separate fractions that quantify the different ways in which individual landscape elements can contribute to overall habitat connectivity and availability in the landscape, including stepping stone effects. These fractions are derived from the same concept, are measured in the same units and can be directly compared and combined within a unifying framework. This avoids the problematic and, so far, usual combination of metrics coming from different backgrounds and the arbitrary weighting of connectivity considerations in a broader context of conservation alternatives. We analyse how the relative importance of each fraction varies with species traits. In addition, we show how the critical patches differ for each of the fractions by analysing various forest habitats in the province of Lleida (NE Spain). We discuss the conceptual and conservation implications of this approach, which can be adapted to different degrees of ecological and spatial detail within the graph while still maintaining a coherent framework for the identification of critical elements in the landscape network.

AB The dynamics of infectious diseases spread via direct person-to-person transmission (such as influenza, smallpox, HIV/AIDS, etc.) depends on the underlying host contact network. Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure. Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure. We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health. Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics. These results have implications for the design of control strategies.

AB Predicting past distributions of species climatic niches, hindcasting, by using climate envelope models (CEMs) is emerging as an exciting research area. CEMs are used to examine veiled evolutionary questions about extinctions, locations of past refugia and migration pathways, or to propose hypotheses concerning the past population structure of species in phylogeographical studies. CEMs are sensitive to theoretical assumptions, to model classes and to projections in non-analogous climates, among other issues. Studies hindcasting the climatic niches of species often make reference to these limitations. However, to obtain strong scientific inferences, we must not only be aware of these potential limitations but we must also overcome them. Here, I review the literature on hindcasting CEMs. I discuss the theoretical assumptions behind niche modelling, i.e. the stability of climatic niches through time and the equilibrium of species with climate. I also summarize a set of 'recommended practices' to improve hindcasting. The studies reviewed: (1) rarely test the theoretical assumptions behind niche modelling such as the stability of species climatic niches through time and the equilibrium of species with climate; (2) they only use one model class (72% of the studies) and one palaeoclimatic reconstruction (62.5%) to calibrate their models; (3) they do not check for the occurrence of non-analogous climates (97%); and (4) they do not use independent data to validate the models (72%). Ignoring the theoretical assumptions behind niche modelling and using inadequate methods for hindcasting CEMs may well entail a cascade of errors and naive ecological and evolutionary inferences. We should also push integrative research lines linking macroecology, physiology, population biology, palaeontology, evolutionary biology and CEMs for a better understanding of niche dynamics across space and time.

   WATER-QUALITY
AB In recent years, several sets of legislation worldwide (Oceans Act in USA, Australia or Canada; Water Framework Directive or Marine Strategy in Europe, National Water Act in South Africa, etc.) have been developed in order to address ecological quality or integrity, within estuarine and coastal systems. Most such legislation seeks to define quality in an integrative way, by using several biological elements, together with physico-chemical and pollution elements. Such an approach allows assessment of ecological status at the ecosystem level ('ecosystem approach' or 'holistic approach' methodologies), rather than at species level (e.g. mussel biomonitoring or Mussel Watch) or just at chemical level (i.e. quality objectives) alone.
   Increasing attention has been paid to the development of tools for different physico-chemical or biological (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, algae, phanerogams, fishes) elements of the ecosystems. However, few methodologies integrate all the elements into a single evaluation of a water body. The need for such integrative tools to assess ecosystem quality is very important, both from a scientific and stakeholder point of view. Politicians and managers need information from simple and pragmatic, but scientifically sound methodologies, in order to show to society the evolution of a zone (estuary, coastal area, etc.), taking into account human pressures or recovery processes.
   These approaches include: (i) multidisciplinarity, inherent in the teams involved in their implementation; (ii) integration of biotic and abiotic factors; (iii) accurate and validated methods in determining ecological integrity; and (iv) adequate indicators to follow the evolution of the monitored ecosystems. While some countries increasingly use the establishment of marine parks to conserve marine biodiversity and ecological integrity, there is awareness (e.g. in Australia) that conservation and management of marine ecosystems cannot be restricted to Marine Protected Areas but must include areas outside such reserves.
   This contribution reviews the current situation of integrative ecological assessment worldwide, by presenting several examples from each of the continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Experiments testing biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning have been criticized on the basis that their random-assembly designs do not reflect deterministic species loss in nature. Because previous studies, and their critics, have focused primarily on plants, however, it is underappreciated that the most consistent such determinism involves biased extinction of large consumers, skewing trophic structure and substantially changing conclusions about ecosystem impacts that assume changing plant diversity alone. Both demography and anthropogenic threats render large vertebrate consumers more vulnerable to extinction, on average, than plants. Importantly, species loss appears biased toward strong interactors among animals but weak interactors among plants. Accordingly, available evidence suggests that loss of a few predator species often has impacts comparable in magnitude to those stemming from a large reduction in plant diversity. Thus, the dominant impacts of biodiversity change on ecosystem functioning appear to be trophically mediated, with important implications for conservation.

AB Species-level phylogenies derived from molecular data provide an indirect record of the speciation events that have led to extant species. This offers enormous potential for investigating the general causes and rates of speciation within clades. To make the most of this potential, we should ideally sample all the species in a higher group, such as a genus, ensure that those species reflect evolutionary entities within the group, and rule out the effects of other processes, such as extinction, as explanations for observed patterns. We discuss recent practical and theoretical advances in this area and outline how future work should benefit from incorporating data from genealogical and phylogeographical scales.

AB With confirmation of anthropogenically induced climate change, the spotlight is on biologists to predict and detect effects on populations. The complexity of interactions within and between the biotic and abiotic components involved makes this a tough challenge, and most studies have consequently considered effects of only single climate variables on single species. However, some have gone further, and recently published long-term datasets now offer opportunities that complement new experimental approaches that span trophic levels. With these datasets, predicting relative shifts in temporal and spatial associations could be among the most tractable problems.

AB An alignment/phylogeny of the papain superfamily of cysteine proteases was created using an initial structure-based alignment followed by successive iterations of sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference. The iterative approach resulted in significant improvements in the alignment/phylogeny There were three groups of cysteine proteases that were distantly related and which could be aligned against each other only in the active site regions: the papain group, which included such stereotypical cysteine proteases as cathepsins B, C, H, L and S; and the bleomycin hydrolase and calpain groups. There was one bacterial sequence in each of the bleomycin hydrolase and calpain groups. The former probably arose by lateral gene transfer, the latter possibly by direct evolution from an ancestral protease predating the eukaryote/prokaryote divergence. The phylogeny of the papain group indicated that many families diverged almost simultaneously early during eukaryotic evolution. In mammals there are at least 12 distinct families of cysteine proteases, possibly many more, including at least two as yet uncharacterized enzymes.

AB Recent research on natural host races and sympatric sister species, comparative phylogenetic analyses, laboratory experiments and theoretical models has greatly strengthened the case for sympatric speciation. Traits evolving in response to divergent selection experienced by subpopulations adapting to different habitats provide sufficient intrinsic premating isolation for sympatric speciation to occur. The initiation of speciation through a habitat shift in animals which mate within a preferred habitat (such as many phytophagous and parasitic invertebrates and some vertebrates, including birds) requires few genetic changes.

AB Following principles used by A. J. Bateman, we identify the relationship between fecundity and mating success as the central feature in the operation of mating systems. Using selection theory from the field of quantitative genetics, we define the sexual selection gradient as the average slope of the relationship between fecundity and mating success and show how it can be estimated from data. We argue that sexual selection gradients are the key to understanding how the intensity of sexual selection is affected by mate provisioning, parental investment, and sex ratio.

AB The yeast SEC1 gene encodes a hydrophilic protein that functions at the terminal stage in secretion. We have cloned two yeast genes, SSO1 and SSO2, which in high copy number can suppress sec1 mutations and also mutations in several other late acting SEC genes, such as SEC3, SEC5, SEC9 and SEC15. SSO1 and SSO2 encode small proteins with N-terminal hydrophilic domains and C-terminal hydrophobic tails. The two proteins are 72% identical in sequence and together perform an essential function late in secretion. Sso1p and Sso2p show significant sequence similarity to six other proteins. Two of these, Sed5p and Pep12p, are yeast proteins that function in transport from ER to Golgi and from Golgi to the vacuole, respectively. Also related to Sso1p and Sso2p are three mammalian proteins: epimorphin, syntaxin A/HPC-1 and syntaxin B. A nematode cDNA product also belongs to the new protein family. The new protein family is thus present in a wide variety of eukaryotic cells, where its members function at different stages in vesicular transport.

AB This paper summarizes a strategy for supplying ecosystem services in urban areas through a participatory planning process targeting multifunctional green infrastructure. We draw from the literature on landscape multifunctionality, which has primarily been applied to agricultural settings, and propose opportunities to develop urban green infrastructure that could contribute to the sustainable social and ecological health of the city. Thinking in terms of system resilience, strategies might focus on the potential for green infrastructure to allow for adaptation and even transformation in the face of future challenges such as climate change, food insecurity, and limited resources. Because planning for multiple functions can be difficult when many diverse stakeholders are involved, we explored decision support tools that could be applied to green infrastructure planning in the early stages, to engage the public and encourage action toward implementing a preferred solution. Several specific ecosystem services that could be relevant for evaluating current and future urban green spaces include: plant biodiversity, food production, microclimate control, soil infiltration, carbon sequestration, visual quality, recreation, and social capital. Integrating such ecosystem services into small-scale greening projects could allow for creativity and local empowerment that would inspire broader transformation of green infrastructure at the city level. Those cities committing to such an approach by supporting greening projects are likely to benefit in the long run through the value of ecosystem services for urban residents and the broader public.

AB Structural equation modeling (SEM) is increasingly being chosen by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for prospective analyses.
   The illustrative example presented involves monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation (SE) model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions.
   The guidelines presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM process that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods. Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative implications of the results.

AB Consistent individual behavioural tendencies, termed "personalities", have been identified in a wide range of animals. Functional explanations for personality have been proposed, but as yet, very little consideration has been given to a possible role for sexual selection in maintaining differences in personality and its stability within individuals. We provide an overview of the available literature on the role of personality traits in intrasexual competition and mate choice in both human and non-human animals and integrate this into a framework for considering how sexual selection can generate and maintain personality. For this, we consider the evolution and maintenance of both main aspects of animal personality: inter-individual variation and intra-individual consistency.

AB Atmospheric CO2 enrichment may stimulate plant growth directly through (1) enhanced photosynthesis or indirectly, through (2) reduced plant water consumption and hence slower soil moisture depletion, or the combination of both. Herein we describe gas exchange, plant biomass and species responses of five native or semi-native temperate and Mediterranean grasslands and three semi-arid systems to CO2 enrichment, with an emphasis on water relations. Increasing CO2 led to decreased leaf conductance for water vapor, improved plant water status, altered seasonal evapotranspiration dynamics, and in most cases, periodic increases in soil water content. The extent, timing and duration of these responses varied among ecosystems, species and years. Across the grasslands of the Kansas tallgrass prairie, Colorado shortgrass steppe and Swiss calcareous grassland, increases in aboveground biomass from CO2 enrichment were relatively greater in dry years. In contrast, CO2-induced aboveground biomass increases in the Texas C-3/C-4 grassland and the New Zealand pasture seemed little or only marginally influenced by yearly variation in soil water, while plant growth in the Mojave Desert was stimulated by CO2 in a relatively wet year. Mediterranean grasslands sometimes failed to respond to CO2-related increased late-season water, whereas semiarid Negev grassland assemblages profited. Vegetative and reproductive responses to CO2 were highly varied among species and ecosystems, and did not generally follow any predictable pattern in regard to functional groups. Results suggest that the indirect effects of CO2 on plant and soil water relations may contribute substantially to experimentally induced CO2-effects, and also reflect local humidity conditions. For landscape scale predictions, this analysis calls for a clear distinction between biomass responses due to direct CO2 effects on photosynthesis and those indirect CO2 effects via soil moisture as documented here.

AB The net primary production of tropical forests and its partitioning between long-lived carbon pools (wood) and shorter-lived pools (leaves, fine roots) are of considerable importance in the global carbon cycle. However, these terms have only been studied at a handful of field sites, and with no consistent calculation methodology. Here we calculate above-ground coarse wood carbon productivity for 104 forest plots in lowland New World humid tropical forests, using a consistent calculation methodology that incorporates corrections for spatial variations in tree-size distributions and wood density, and for census interval length. Mean wood density is found to be lower in more productive forests. We estimate that above-ground coarse wood productivity varies by more than a factor of three (between 1.5 and 5.5 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1)) across the Neotropical plots, with a mean value of 3.1 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1). There appear to be no obvious relationships between wood productivity and rainfall, dry season length or sunshine, but there is some hint of increased productivity at lower temperatures. There is, however, also strong evidence for a positive relationship between wood productivity and soil fertility. Fertile soils tend to become more common towards the Andes and at slightly higher than average elevations, so the apparent temperature/productivity relationship is probably not a direct one. Coarse wood productivity accounts for only a fraction of overall tropical forest net primary productivity, but the available data indicate that it is approximately proportional to total above-ground productivity. We speculate that the large variation in wood productivity is unlikely to directly imply an equivalent variation in gross primary production. Instead a shifting balance in carbon allocation between respiration, wood carbon and fine root production seems the more likely explanation.

AB A Bayesian network consists of a graphical structure and a probabilistic description of the relationships among variables in a system. The graphical structure explicitly represents cause-and-effect assumptions that allow a complex causal chain linking actions to outcomes to be factored into an articulated series of conditional relationships. Each of these relationships can then be independently quantified using a submodel suitable for the type and scale of information available. This approach is particularly useful for ecological modelling because predictable patterns may emerge at a variety of scales, necessitating a multiplicity of model forms. As an example, we describe a Bayesian network integrating models of the various processes involved in eutrophication in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina. These models were developed using a range of methods, including: process-based models statistically fit to long-term monitoring data, Bayesian hierarchical modelling of cross-system data gathered from the literature, multivariate regression modelling of mesocosm experiments, and judgements elicited from scientific experts. The ability of the network to accommodate such a diversity of methods allowed for the prediction of policy-relevant ecosystem attributes not normally included in models of eutrophication. All of the submodels in the network include estimates of predictive uncertainty in the form of probability distributions which are propagated to model endpoints. Predictions expressed as probabilities give stakeholders and decision-makers a realistic appraisal of the chances of achieving desired outcomes under alternative nutrient management strategies. In general, the further down the causal chain a variable was, the greater the predictive uncertainty. This suggests that a compromise is necessary between policy relevance and predictive precision, and that, to select defensible environmental management strategies, public officials must adopt decision-making methods that deal explicitly with scientific uncertainty.

AB We argue that population growth rate is the key unifying variable linking the various facets of population ecology. The importance of population growth rate lies partly in its central role in forecasting future population trends; indeed if the form of density dependence were constant and known, then the future population dynamics could to some degree be predicted. We argue that population growth rate is also central to our understanding of environmental stress: environmental stressors should be defined as factors which when first applied to a population reduce population growth rate. The joint action of such stressors determines an organism's ecological niche, which should be defined as the set of environmental conditions where population growth rate is greater than zero (where population growth rate = r = log(e) (Nt+1Nt)). While environmental stressors have negative effects on population growth rate, the same is true of population density, the case of negative linear effects corresponding to the well-known logistic equation. Following Sinclair, we recognize population regulation as occurring when population growth rate is negatively density dependent. Surprisingly, given its fundamental importance in population ecology, only 25 studies were discovered in the literature in which population growth rate has been plotted against population density. In 12 of these the effects of density were linear, in all but two of the remainder the relationship was concave viewed from above.
   Alternative approaches to establishing the determinants of population growth rate are reviewed, paying special attention to the demographic and mechanistic approaches. The effects of population density on population growth rate may act through their effects on food availability and associated effects on somatic growth, fecundity and survival, according to a 'numerical response', the evidence for which is briefly reviewed. Alternatively, there may be effects on population growth rate of population density in addition to those that arise through the partitioning of food between competitors; this is 'interference competition'. The distinction is illustrated using a replicated laboratory experiment on a marine copepod, Tisbe battagliae. Application of these approaches in conservation biology, ecotoxicology and human demography is briefly considered. We conclude that population regulation, density dependence, resource and interference competition, the effects of environmental stress and the form of the ecological niche, are all best defined and analysed in terms of population growth rate.

AB The estimated 6000 species of Lycaenidae account for about one third of all Papilionoidea. The majority of lycaenids have associations with ants that can be facultative or obligate and range from mutualism to parasitism. Lycaenid larvae and pupae employ complex chemical and acoustical signals to manipulate ants. Cost/benefit analyses have demonstrated multiple trade-offs involved in myrmecophily. Both demographic and phylogenetic evidence indicate that ant association has shaped the evolution of obligately associated groups. Parasitism typically arises from mutualism with ants, arid entomophagous species are disproportionately common in the Lycaenidae compared with other Lepidoptera. Obligate associations are more common in the Southern Hemisphere, in part because highly ant-associated lineages make up a larger proportion of the fauna in these, regions. Further research on phylogeny and natural history, particularly of the Neotropical fauna, will be necessary to understand the rote ant association has played in the evolution of the Lycaenidae.

AB 1, An understanding of the links between life histories and responses to exploitation could provide the basis for predicting shifts in community structure by identifying susceptible species and linking life-history tactics with population dynamics.
   2, We examined long-term trends in the abundance of species in the North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fish community. Between 1925 and 1996 changes in species composition led to an increase in mean growth rate, while mean maximum size, age at maturity and size at maturity decreased. The demersal fish community was increasingly heavily fished during this period.
   3, Trends in mean life-history characteristics of the community were linked to trends in abundance of component species. An approach based on phylogenetic comparisons was used to examine the differential effects of fishing on individual species with contrasting life histories.
   4, Those species that decreased in abundance relative to their nearest relative, matured later at a greater size, grew more slowly towards a greater maximum size and had lower rates of potential population increase. The phylogenetically based analyses demonstrated that trends in community structure could be predicted from the differential responses of related species to fishing,
   5, This is the first study to link exploitation responses of an entire community to the life histories of individual species, The results demonstrate that fishing has greater effects on slower growing, larger species with later maturity and lower rates of potential population increase. The comparative approach provides a basis for predicting structural change in other exploited communities.

AB We examined rates of C, N, and P mineralization in soils from 16 northern Minnesota wetlands that occur across an ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient. Soils were incubated at 30 degrees C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 59 wk, and the results were fit with a two-pool kinetic model. Additionally, 39 different soil quality variables were used in a principal components analysis (PCA) to predict mineralization rates.
   Mineralization of C, N, and P differed significantly among wetland types, aeration status (aerobic vs. anaerobic), and their interaction term. Despite low total soil N and P, there was a rapid turnover of the nutrient pools in ombrotrophic sites, particularly under aerobic conditions. On a volumetric basis, C and N mineralization increased in a predictable manner across the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient, largely due to increasing soil bulk density. However, P mineralization per cubic centimeter remained relatively high in the bogs. The higher total P content of more minerotrophic soils appears to be offset by greater P immobilization due to geochemical sorption, yielding overall lower availability.
   Total C turnover rates were relatively similar among sites, despite large differences in soil quality. We suggest that, over time, the decay rates of organic matter in different wetland communities converge to a common rate. In contrast, CH4 production was extremely low in ombrotrophic pests.
   The apparent labile pools of N (N-0), P (P-0), and C (C-0) were generally <10% of their respective total pool sizes, except for P-0 in the bogs, which constituted up to 33% of total soil P. From 10% to 87% of the N, P, and C mineralized after 59 wk was derived from their respective labile pools.
   A simple group of variables describing the physical degree of decomposition of organic matter was often as good as, or superior to, more complicated chemical analyses in predicting C, N, and P mineralization. Because pears are classified and mapped according to these variables, it should make scaling efforts in landscape analyses much more tractable.
   Large differences in mineralization rates in northern wetland communities demonstrate that climate change models should not consider these areas as homogeneous entities. Our C mineralization results suggest that soil respiratory response to climate change (as CO2 and CH4) will vary considerably in different wetland communities. Our results also suggest that the common perception that more ombrotrophic sites are inherently more nutrient deficient needs to be reassessed.

AB Variation in the extent of sexual dimorphism among bird species is traditionally attributed to differences in social mating system. However, there are many different forms of dimorphism among birds, and not all of them show an obvious correlation with social mating system. For example, recent work has shown that many highly polygamous species are, in fact, monomorphic, whereas many putatively monogamous species are dimorphic. In this paper we break up sexual dimorphism into subcomponents and then use comparative analyses to examine the pattern of covariation between these subcomponents and various aspects of sexual, social, and parental behaviour. Our first finding is that size dimorphism and plumage-colour dimorphism do not show the same pattern of covariation. Differences in size dimorphism are associated with variation in social mating system and sex differences in parental care, whereas differences in plumage-colour dimorphism are associated with variation in the frequency of extra-bond paternity. These results suggest that size dimorphism is associated with the sort of intrasexual competition described by traditional classifications of social mating system, whereas plumage-colour dimorphism is associated with cryptic female choice. However, when we break up plumage-colour dimorphism according to whether it is due to melanins, carotenoids or structural colours, we find that each category of plumage-colour dimorphism shows a different pattern of covariation. The correlation between overall plumage-colour dimorphism and the rate of extra-bond paternity is due to structural colours, whereas melanin-based dimorphism is associated with sex differences in parental care. The former result is particularly interesting given that new work suggests structural colours are associated with active sexual displays and the reflection of ultraviolet light.

AB 1 Forest inventory data were collected in 1988-89 from permanent plots in undisturbed tropical forest along an altitudinal transect on the northern slope of Volcan Barva, Costa Rica. Plot altitude ranged from 30 m at the base to 2600 m near the summit.
   2 A total of 14 plots with a total area of 23.4 hectares was censused; all stems greater than or equal to 10 cm d.b.h. were tagged, identified, mapped, and measured in diameter and height.
   3 Altogether 11 478 live stems greater than or equal to 10 cm d.b.h. were encountered in the 1988-89 census, representing 561 species in 91 families,
   4 Canopy height was greatest at 300 m, decreasing both above and below that altitude, and reaching a minimum at the summit. Mean stem diameter remained constant from the base of the gradient to 1500 m a.s.l., increasing slightly at higher altitudes. Large-diameter trees were least abundant at middle altitudes. Basal area was greatest near the summit, exceeding 40 m(2) ha(-1) in the two highest plots.
   5 Diversity was highest at 300 m, with 149 species and 55 families per hectare. There was a progressive decrease both above and below this altitude in species richness, species diversity, number of families, and the number of species per family. Diversity was lowest at the summit.
   6 Five life-forms were recorded: dicot trees comprised 78.0% of stems; palms 14.9%; tree ferns 5.2%; lianas 1.5%; and hemi-epiphytes 0.4%. Life-form distribution varied markedly over the gradient.
   7 Species composition varied continuously with altitude, as shown by a detrended correspondence analysis ordination of data from 375 20-m x 20-m subplots. There were no discontinuities, nor evidence of discrete floristic zones.
   8 No Species was distributed over the entire 2600-m range of altitudes. The species with the greatest amplitude, Ardisia palmana, occurred over 75% of the gradient (a range of around 2000 m). A total of 203 species were recorded from only a single 1-ha plot.
   9 The altitudinal range of species did not vary with altitude: the range of lowland species was similar to that of montane species, Species of high-diversity assemblages (encountered at low altitude) were similar in altitudinal niche breadth to species of low-diversity assemblages (found at high altitude).

AB This paper investigates mechanisms of sperm competition by comparing reproductive characteristics across 74 butterfly species. Testis size scales with body size and, after controlling for this allometry, relative testis size increases with risk of sperm competition, as defined by female mating frequency. Both eupyrene (fertilizing) and apyrene (non-fertile) sperm lengths correlate positively with body size. After controlling for body size, relative eupyrene sperm lengths are greater in species where males experience higher risks of sperm competition. These results suggest that sperm competition in butterflies selects for increased investment in spermatogenesis, and specifically longer fertilizing sperm. Because longer sperm may be faster and more powerful, eupyrene sperm may therefore compete energetically, and are not selected to be minimally sized to maximize numbers for a purely raffle-based sperm competition mode. Apyrene sperm lengths are not affected directly by risk of encountering rival sperm. Instead, apyrene sperm show closer associations with body size which, if female tract morphometry correlates with body size, is consistent with the hypothesis that apyrene sperm retard female sexual receptivity by moving while in storage.

AB This paper addresses questions of community and patch stability as defined by the population biology of dominant plants in the context of different areas within a large kelp forest. We ask (1) "Do large-scale episodic events override biological mechanisms as major community structuring processes?", (2) "Are different local areas characterized by different processes?", and (3) "How persistent are the patches or biological structure over decadal and local spatial scales?" We evaluate these questions with regard to the effects of various types of disturbance for as much as three decades on the populations of several species of kelp in the large kelp forest off Point Loma, San Diego, California. The most sensitive population factors we studied include recruitment, density, and survivorship. Patch stability was evaluated with regard to the persistence of patches already well established in 1971-1972. The study sites offer a cross-shore transect through the central part of a large kelp forest at depths of 8, 12, 15, 18, and 21 m; two additional sites at the north and south ends of the forest offer a longshore transect along the 18-m contour.
   There were marked differences among the decades with regard to the intensity of the disturbances. Compared with the 1980s, the two preceding decades were relatively benign. The 1980s had two extreme disturbance events: the 1982-1984 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was the most severe El Nino event in the last century, which included very warm, nutrient-depleted water, and a short but intense storm in January 1988 appeared to have been the most severe in perhaps 200 yr. The storm changed age-specific kelp mortality patterns and caused the first large-scale understory mortality in several decades. By sweeping away drift algae it caused intense local urchin grazing. The storm was followed by a strong La Nina event marked by cool, nutrient-rich water in 1988-1989.
   Differences in kelp recruitment and survivorship in different areas of the kelp forest are influenced by gradients in longshore currents, temperature, light, wave energy, floc, planktonic propagules, and physical disturbance. The areas are characterized by different plant Population patterns and the effects of several species of herbivores. The massive disturbances of the 1980s obliterated much of the structure in the kelp forest. Certainly the disturbances caused many lag effects including outbreaks of understory algae such as Desmarestia ligulata, intraspecific competition, changes in grazing patterns, etc., which in tum resulted in between-area variation in recovery rates. However, in all cases this variation was overshadowed by the overwhelming competitive dominance of Macrocystis pyrifera. Most of the understory patches on the transect lines, some of which had persisted for 7 yr, died out by the end of 1990.
   The population biology of Macrocystis was remarkably similar in most areas, as the cohort longevity and survivorship curves were very similar, and the plant and stipe densities tended to level off in only a few years. Thus large-scale episodic events such as El Ninos, La Ninas, and rare storms exert dramatic impacts, but small-scale responses such as density-vague recruitment (neither density dependent nor density independent) and survival allow prompt recovery, often to preexisting patterns. The one exception was the southern site, which was marked by sea urchin grazing and poor kelp recruitment through the latter half of the 1980s, but a recent wa urchin disease event has led to kelp recruitment in fall 1991. A seeming paradox to the observed Macrocystis dominance is that in almost all areas, some understory patches of old plants have persisted through the 1980s.

AB We re-examined the longstanding dogma that cavity-nesting birds have larger clutch sizes than open-nesting species because of lower nest predation rates, which allow longer developmental periods. We provide data on nesting success of open-nesting species plus excavator and nonexcavator species (cavity-nesters that do vs. do not create their own cavities) of birds that coexist in the same habitat and use natural nest sites; studies were conducted in central Arizona in high-elevation forest drainages from 1987 to 1989. In comparisons among species, nest success increased in the order open-nesting < nonexcavator << excavator species. Length of the nestling period increased, whereas number of broods decreased, with increased nest success across these nest types. Contrary to conventional expectation, clutch size did not increase directly with increased nest success and length of the nestling period, and these patterns were not simply a result of phylogenetic effects.
   A literature review of data on adult survival in land birds indicated that nonexcavators have significantly lower adult survival than the other two nest types. The lower adult survival of nonexcavators was associated with greater annual productivity than for the other two nest types. Annual productivity appeared to be associated with nest site attributes, whereas number of brood attempts was related to nest failure rate. Clutch size was a byproduct of annual productivity and number of brood attempts. Thus, the long-standing paradigm relating clutch size directly to nesting failure and developmental period was not supported.

AB Although numerous species distribution models have been developed, most were based on insufficient distribution data or used older climate change scenarios. We aimed to quantify changes in projected ranges and threat level by the years 2061-2080, for 12 European forest tree species under three climate change scenarios. We combined tree distribution data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, EUFORGEN, and forest inventories, and we developed species distribution models using MaxEnt and 19 bioclimatic variables. Models were developed for three climate change scenarios-optimistic (RCP2.6), moderate (RCP4.5), and pessimistic (RPC8.5)-using three General Circulation Models, for the period 2061-2080. Our study revealed different responses of tree species to projected climate change. The species may be divided into three groups: "winners"-mostly late-successional species: Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur, and Quercuspetraea; "losers"-mostly pioneer species: Betula pendula, Larix decidua, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris; and alien species-Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercusrubra, and Robinia pseudoacacia, which may be also considered as "winners." Assuming limited migration, most of the species studied would face a significant decrease in suitable habitat area. The threat level was highest for species that currently have the northernmost distribution centers. Ecological consequences of the projected range contractions would be serious for both forest management and nature conservation.

AB Many experiments have shown that loss of biodiversity reduces the capacity of ecosystems to provide the multiple services on which humans depend(1,2). However, experiments necessarily simplify the complexity of natural ecosystems and will normally control for other important drivers of ecosystem functioning, such as the environment or land use. In addition, existing studies typically focus on the diversity of single trophic groups, neglecting the fact that biodiversity loss occurs across many taxa(3,4) and that the functional effects of any trophic group may depend on the abundance and diversity of others(5,6). Here we report analysis of the relationships between the species richness and abundance of nine trophic groups, including 4,600 above-and below-ground taxa, and 14 ecosystem services and functions and with their simultaneous provision (or multifunctionality) in 150 grasslands. We show that high species richness in multiple trophic groups (multitrophic richness) had stronger positive effects on ecosystem services than richness in any individual trophic group; this includes plant species richness, the most widely used measure of biodiversity. On average, three trophic groups influenced each ecosystem service, with each trophic group influencing at least one service. Multitrophic richness was particularly beneficial for 'regulating' and 'cultural' services, and for multifunctionality, whereas a change in the total abundance of species or biomass in multiple trophic groups (the multitrophic abundance) positively affected supporting services. Multitrophic richness and abundance drove ecosystem functioning as strongly as abiotic conditions and land-use intensity, extending previous experimental results(7,8) to real-world ecosystems. Primary producers, herbivorous insects and microbial decomposers seem to be particularly important drivers of ecosystem functioning, as shown by the strong and frequent positive associations of their richness or abundance with multiple ecosystem services. Our results show that multitrophic richness and abundance support ecosystem functioning, and demonstrate that a focus on single groups has led to researchers to greatly underestimate the functional importance of biodiversity.

AB Phylogenetic diversity (PD) describes the total amount of phylogenetic distance among species in a community. Although there has been substantial research on the factors that determine community PD, exploration of the consequences of PD for ecosystem functioning is just beginning. We argue that PD may be useful in predicting ecosystem functions in a range of communities, from single-trophic to complex networks. Many traits show a phylogenetic signal, suggesting that PD can estimate the functional trait space of a community, and thus ecosystem functioning. Phylogeny also determines interactions among species, and so could help predict how extinctions cascade through ecological networks and thus impact ecosystem functions. Although the initial evidence available suggests patterns consistent with these predictions, we caution that the utility of PD depends critically on the strength of phylogenetic signals to both traits and interactions. We advocate for a synthetic approach that incorporates a deeper understanding of how traits and interactions are shaped by evolution, and outline key areas for future research. If these complexities can be incorporated into future studies, relationships between PD and ecosystem function bear promise in conceptually unifying evolutionary biology with ecosystem ecology.

AB P>1. An increasing number of studies are examining the distribution and congruence of ecosystem services, often with the goal of identifying areas that will provide multiple ecosystem service 'hotspots'. However, there is a paucity of data on most ecosystem services, so proxies (e.g. estimates of a service for a particular land cover type) are frequently used to map their distribution. To date, there has been little attempt to quantify the effects of using proxies on distribution maps of ecosystem services, despite the potentially large errors associated with such data sets.
   2. Here, we provide the first study examining the effects of using proxies on ecosystem service maps and the degree of spatial congruence of these maps with primary data, using England as a case study.
   3. We show that land cover based proxies provide a poor fit to primary data surfaces for biodiversity, recreation and carbon storage, and that correlations between ecosystem services change depending on whether primary or proxy data are used for the analyses.
   4. The poor fit of proxies to primary data was also evident when we selected hotspots of single ecosystem services, and consistency between raw and modelled surfaces was extremely low when considering the locations that were coincident hotspots for multiple services.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Proxies may be suitable for identifying broad-scale trends in ecosystem services, but even relatively good proxies are likely to be unsuitable for identifying hotspots or priority areas for multiple services.

AB 1. Aridland ecosystems cover about one-third of terrestrial environments globally, yet the extent to which models of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling, developed largely from studies of mesic ecosystems, apply to aridland systems remains unclear.
   2. Within aridland ecosystems, C and N dynamics are often described by a pulse-reserve model in which episodic precipitation events stimulate biological activity that generate reserves of biomass, propagules and organic matter that prime the ecosystem to respond rapidly to subsequent precipitation events.
   3. The role of microbial C and N processing within the pulse-reserve paradigm has not received much study. We present evidence suggesting that fungi play a critical and underappreciated role in aridland soils, including efficient decomposition of recalcitrant C compounds, N-transformations such as nitrification, and nutrient storage and translocation of C and N between plants and biotic soil crusts. While fungi may perform some of these functions in other ecosystems, this 'fungal loop' assumes particular importance in the N cycle in aridlands because water availability imposes even greater restrictions on bacterial activity and physicochemical processes limit accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM).
   4. We incorporate these findings into a Threshold-Delay Nutrient Dynamics (TDND) model for aridland ecosystems in which plant responses to pulsed precipitation events are mediated by a fungal loop that links C and N cycling, net primary production (NPP) and decomposition in aridland soils.
   5. Synthesis. Arid ecosystems are highly sensitive to global environmental change including N deposition and altered precipitation patterns; yet, models from mesic ecosystems do not adequately apply to aridland environments. Our 'fungal loop' N cycle model integrates spatial structure with pulse dynamics and extends the pulse-reserve paradigm to include the key role of microbial processes in aridland ecosystem dynamics.

AB Cumulatively, headwater streams contribute to maintaining hydrologic connectivity and ecosystem integrity at regional scales. Hydrologic connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Headwater streams compose over two-thirds of total stream length in a typical river drainage and directly connect the upland and riparian landscape to the rest of the stream ecosystem. Altering headwater streams, e.g., by channelization, diversion through pipes, impoundment and burial, modifies fluxes between uplands and downstream river segments and eliminates distinctive habitats. The large-scale ecological effects of altering headwaters are amplified by land uses that alter runoff and nutrient loads to streams, and by widespread dam construction on larger rivers (which frequently leaves free-flowing upstream portions of river systems essential to sustaining aquatic biodiversity). We discuss three examples of large-scale consequences of cumulative headwater alteration. Downstream eutrophication and coastal hypoxia result, in part, from agricultural practices that alter headwaters and wetlands while increasing nutrient runoff. Extensive headwater alteration is also expected to lower secondary productivity of river systems by reducing stream-system length and trophic subsidies to downstream river segments, affecting aquatic communities and terrestrial wildlife that utilize aquatic resources. Reduced viability of freshwater biota may occur with cumulative headwater alteration, including for species that occupy a range of stream sizes but for which headwater streams diversify the network of interconnected populations or enhance survival for particular life stages. Developing a more predictive understanding of ecological patterns that may emerge on regional scales as a result of headwater alterations will require studies focused on components and pathways that connect headwaters to river, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. Linkages between headwaters and downstream ecosystems cannot be discounted when addressing large-scale issues such as hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and global losses of biodiversity.

AB We used chloroplast DNA sequences from matK and rbcL to infer the phylogeny for 101 of the approximately 111 species of Pinus (Pinaceae). At the level of subsection and above, the cpDNA tree is congruent with phylogenies based on nuclear DNA with one notable exception: cpDNA sequences from subsect. Contortae are sister to all other North American hard pines rather than occupying a more derived position in the same clade. We used the cpDNA tree plus evidence from nuclear ribosomal DNA and morphology to propose a new classification for the genus. The molecular phylogenies are symmetrical at the deepest branches of the genus, allowing for the delineation of two subgenera, each with two sections that form sister groups. Within sections, clades were slightly asymmetric and sometimes ambiguously resolved. To accomodate ambiguity in some interrelationships, avoid the creation of new ranks, and retain traditional names, we recognised up to three monophyletic subsections per section. Subgenus Pinus (the diploxylon, or hard pines) is divided into the predominantly Eurasian and Mediterranean section Pinus, composed of subsections Pinus and Pinaster, and the strictly North American section Trifoliae, composed of subsections Australes, Ponderosae, and Contortae. Subgenus Strobus (the haploxylon, or soft pines) is divided into the strictly North American section Parrya, composed of subsections Cembroides, Nelsoniae, and Balfourianae, and the Eurasian and North American section Quinquefoliae, composed of subsections Gerardianae, Krempfianae, and Strobus. Mapping of ten morphological and distributional characters indicates that two were diagnostic for infrageneric taxa: the number of vascular bundles per leaf distinguishes subgenus Pinus from subgenus Strobus, and a terminal-positioned umbo on the ovulate cone scale is diagnostic of subsect. Strobus.

AB Norovirus (NV) (formerly called Norwalk-like virus) is the most common cause of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans. Recently, we reported an NV genotyping scheme based on variability in the capsid N-terminal/shell (N/S) domain gene (Katayama et al., Virology 299:225-239, 2002). We found 19 genotypes, including nine of genogroup I and 10 of genogroup II. In the present study, we investigated the molecular epidemiology of NV from 66 outbreaks that occurred in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, from 1997 to 2002. We screened 416 stool specimens by a real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method (Kageyama et al., J. Clin. Micro-biol. 41:1548-1557, 2003) and detected 156 NV-positive specimens, from which we amplified the capsid N/S domain gene by RT-PCR and then cloned the PCR products. After sequencing these clones, we obtained 368 sequence variants (strains). By applying our classification scheme to the strains from Saitama and other published strains, we identified a total of 31 genotypes, including an additional five genotypes for genogroup I and seven for genogroup II. Of the 31 genotypes, 26 were present in the Saitama area during that time period. These results provide additional evidence for the great diversity of human NV genotypes. Specimens from all shellfish-related infections contained multiple genotypes, including several new genotypes. On the other hand, single genotypes were observed mostly in outbreaks that originated in semiclosed communities. Thus, the number of NV genotypes in each outbreak depended on the route of transmission.

AB Many early reports of ITS region (ITS 1, 5.8S, and ITS 2) variation in flowering plants indicated that nrDNA arrays within individuals are homogeneous. However, both older and more recent studies have found intra-individual nrDNA polymorphism across a range of plant taxa including presumed non-hybrid diploids. In addition, polymorphic individuals often contain potentially non-functional nrDNA copies (pseudogenes). These findings suggest that complete concerted evolution should not be assumed when embarking on phylogenetic studies using nrDNA sequences. Here we (1) discuss paralogy in relation to species tree reconstruction and conclude that a priori determinations of orthology and paralogy of nrDNA sequences should not be made based on the functionality or lack of functionality of those sequences; (2) discuss why systematists might be particularly interested in identifying and including pseudogene sequences as a test of gene tree sampling; (3) examine the various definitions and characterizations of nrDNA pseudogenes as well as the relative merits and limitations of a subset of pseudogene detection methods and conclude that nucleotide substitution patterns are particularly appropriate for the identification of putative nrDNA pseudogenes; and (4) present and discuss the advantages of a tree-based approach to identifying pseudogenes based on comparisons of sequence substitution patterns from putatively conserved (e.g., 5.8S) and less constrained (e.g., ITS 1 and ITS 2) regions. Application of this approach, through a method employing bootstrap hypothesis testing, and the issues discussed in the paper are illustrated through reanalysis of two previously published matrices. Given the apparent robustness of the test developed and the ease of carrying out percentile bootstrap hypothesis tests, we urge researchers to employ this statistical tool. While our discussion and examples concern the literature on plant systematics, the issues addressed are relevant to studies of nrDNA and other multicopy genes in other taxa. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Management of nonindigenous species is a crucial aspect of maintaining native biodiversity and normal ecosystem functions. We attempt to guide researchers in developing projects that will be of use to conservation practitioners, tangibly improving applied conservation measures. We advocate a directed approach for conservation research to aid in prioritizing nonindigenous species for intervention by resource managers. This approach includes outlining what needs to be known to make such relative judgments about the impacts of nonindigenous species and the most promising methods by which to obtain such information. We also address active measures that should be taken once priorities have been set, highlighting the roles of risk assessment and research in improving control efforts. Ultimately, a better match between research and practical conservation needs should result in more effective reduction of the effects of nonindigenous species on native species.

AB This paper compares two habitat-suitability assessing methods, the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and the Generalised Linear Model (GLM), to see how well they cope with three different scenarios. The main difference between those two analyses is that GLM is based on species presence/absence data while ENFA on presence data only. A virtual species was created and then dispatched in a geographic information system model of a real landscape following three historic scenarios: (1) spreading, (2) at equilibrium, and (3) overabundant species. In each situation, the virtual species was sampled and these simulated data sets were used as input for the ENFA and GLM to reconstruct the habitat suitability model. The results showed that ENFA is very robust to the quality and quantity of the data, giving good results in the three scenarios. GLM was badly affected in the case of the spreading species but produced slightly better results than ENFA when the species was overabundant; at equilibrium, both methods produced equivalent results. The use of a virtual species proved to be a very efficient method, allowing one to fully control the quality of the input data as well as to accurately evaluate the predictive power of both analyses.

AB Recent studies on diverse taxa suggest that natural selection caused by shifts in ecology or invasions of novel habitats plays an important role in adaptive divergence and speciation. Exciting new studies integrating approaches from both the field and the laboratory suggest that ecological shifts can result in extremely rapid rates of evolutionary divergence. Although experimental approaches that link rapid ecological divergence to reproductive isolation and speciation are in their infancy, recent research indicates those approaches that will be most useful.

AB Body mass estimates for 1534 North American fossil mammal species show that new species are on average 9.1% larger than older species in the same genera. This within-lineage effect is not a sampling bias. It persists throughout the Cenozoic; accounting for the gradual overall increase in average mass (Cope's rule). The effect is stronger for larger mammals, being near zero for small mammals. This variation partially explains the unwavering lower size limit and the gradually expanding mid-sized gap, but not the sudden large increase in the upper size limit, at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.

   FISHERIES; TRENDS
AB A major reorganization of the North-east Pacific biota transpired following a climatic 'regime shift' in the mid 1970s. In this paper, we characterize the effects of interdecadal climate forcing on the oceanic ecosystems of the NE Pacific Ocean. We consider the concept of scale in terms of both time and space within the North Pacific ecosystem and develop a conceptual model to illustrate how climate variability is linked to ecosystem change. Next we describe a number of recent studies relating climate to marine ecosystem dynamics in the NE Pacific Ocean. These studies have focused on most major components of marine ecosystems - primary and secondary producers, forage species, and several levels of predators. They have been undertaken at different time and space scales. However, taken together, they reveal a more coherent picture of how decadal-scale climate forcing may affect the large oceanic ecosystems of the NE Pacific. Finally, we synthesize the insight gained from interpreting these studies. Several general conclusions can be drawn.
   1 There are large-scale, low-frequency, and sometimes very rapid changes in the distribution of atmospheric pressure over the North Pacific which are, in turn, reflected in ocean properties and circulation.
   2 Oceanic ecosystems respond on similar time and space scales to variations in physical conditions.
   3 Linkages between the atmosphere/ocean physics and biological responses are often different across time and space scales.
   4 While the cases presented here demonstrate oceanic ecosystem response to climate forcing, they provide only hints of the mechanisms of interaction.
   5 A model whereby ecosystem response to specified climate variation can be successfully predicted will be difficult to achieve because of scale mismatches and nonlinearities in the atmosphere-ocean-biosphere system.

AB We review the major conceptual developments that have occurred over the last 50 years concerning the factors that influence insect biodiversity in streams and examine how well empirical descriptions and theory match. Stream insects appear to respond to both spatial and temporal variation in physical heterogeneity. At all spatial scales, the data largely support the idea that physical complexity promotes biological richness, although exceptions to this relationship were found. These exceptions may be related to how we measure habitat complexity at finer spatial scales and to factors that influence regional richness, such as biogeographic history, at broader spatial scales. However, the degree to which local stream insect assemblages are influenced by regional processes is largely unknown.

AB Natural ecosystems contain many individuals and species interacting with each other and with their abiotic environment. Such systems can be expected to exhibit complex dynamics in which small perturbations can be amplified to cause large changes. Here, we document the reorganization of an arid ecosystem that has occurred since the late 1970s. The density of woody shrubs increased 3-fold. Several previously common animal species went locally extinct, while other previously rare species increased. While these changes are symptomatic of desertification, they were not caused by livestock grazing or drought, the principal causes of historical desertification. The changes apparently were caused by a shift in regional climate: since 1977 winter precipitation throughout the region,vas substantially higher than average far this century. These changes illustrate the kinds of large, unexpected responses of complex natural ecosystems that can occur in response to both natural perturbations and human activities.

AB We investigated three procedures that may lead to rapid and accurate assessment of epigaeic arthropod biodiversity. They are: (1) the identification of taxa whose diversity is correlated with that of others; (2) the identification of times and methods of sampling that produce estimates of diversity representative of more intensive sampling; and (3) the use of morphospecies inventories generated by non-specialists.
   Ants, beetles, and spiders were sampled from four forest types, in three seasons, using two collecting methods: pitfall trapping and extraction from litter. Specimens were sorted by a non-specialist to morphospecies and by specialist taxonomists to species. Richness (alpha-diversity) and turnover (beta-diversity) were compared for different sampling regimes using morphospecies and species inventories.
   We found no significant positive correlations between ant, beetle, and spider species richness but there was a strong negative correlation between ant and beetle richness. For beetles alone, richness within the families Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, and Pselaphidae (i.e., avoiding taxonomically problematic families) was significantly correlated with richness within all other families.
   Assessment of turnover revealed that: (1) the four forest types contained significantly different assemblages of ants and beetles but not spiders and (2) the four forests were less clearly discriminated using species from the three beetle families Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, and Pselaphidae when compared to species from all beetle families pooled.
   Analyses of single sampling periods and methods revealed that summer and spring pitfall samples were most representative of more intensive sampling. That is: (1) the richness of ants and beetles in these samples was significantly positively correlated with the richness of all other samples and (2) turnover of beetles and ants among the four forests revealed by summer pitfall samples was similar to turnover using all samples. The three beetle surrogate families recorded by pitfall samples in spring, and to a lesser extent summer, showed significant correlations in richness with all other beetle species recorded in the same samples. However, the assessment of turnover was less accurate when only surrogate families were used.
   The most accurate and cost-effective assessment of turnover was generated by a summer pitfall sample in which data for ants, carabid, and scarab beetles were combined and analyzed as a single data set.
   Results were largely consistent regardless of whether species or morphospecies were used, which suggests that monitoring and assessment of terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity may be achieved by the careful use of morphospecies. Our results also suggest those invertebrate taxa, sampling methods, and sampling periods that yield the most consistent and reliable assessment of epigaeic invertebrate biodiversity in Australian temperate hardwood forests. However, empirical studies that follow the protocols discussed in this paper are urgently required in different environments. These studies may point the way to more representative monitoring and assessment of terrestrial biodiversity.

AB Two types of species pool are distinguished. The regional species pool is defined as the set of species, occurring in a certain region (here: Estonia) which are capable of coexisting in a target community. The actual species pool is defined as the set of species present in a community. Field data from 14 different vegetation types in Estonia were used. The regional pool was compiled by including from the regional flora (1) all species for which the Ellenberg indicator values did not differ more than 1.5 relative units from the community mean and (2) all indifferent species. The actual pool was compiled by careful field observations.
   The aim of the paper is to test the validity of two null hypotheses about the species pool. H0(1) postulates that any size of the actual species pool is equally probable in the interval between zero and the size of the regional species pool. H0(2) postulates that any value of species richness per unit area (1 m(2)) is equally probable in the interval between zero and the size of the actual species pool.
   To test the strengths of the relationships Monte Carlo modelling was used. It was shown that the relation between variables was stronger than proposed by the null models (P = 0.041 for H0(1) and P = 0.002 for H0(2)). Consequently, the size of the actual species pool is largely determined by the regional species pool, and the species richness per 1 m(2) is largely determined by the actual pool. The results are discussed in the framework of coexistence theory. The size of the regional pool is determined by evolutionary (speciation) and historical (large-scale migration) processes. The size of the actual pool depends on local-scale migration, which can be a function of isolation, successional stage, local management history, etc.

AB Divergent natural selection for efficient exploitation of alternative resources is thought to be a primary cause of adaptive radiation. I transplanted two recently diverged stickleback species (Gasterosteus sp.) and their Hybrids between habitats to test three predictions of this hypothesis: (1) the form of natural selection on feeding traits should differ between resource environments; (2) fitness trade-offs should occur between morphs specialized for different resources; (3) feeding efficiency should be the basis of fitness differences between morphs. Growth rate was used as a surrogate component of fitness. All three predictions were upheld. The larger of the two species (the Benthic), which has a larger mouth, deeper body, and fewer, shorter gill rakers than the second species (the Limnetic), had a twofold growth advantage in the littoral zone of the lake. This pattern was reversed in the open-water habitat, where the Limnetic species grew at double the rate of the Benthic. Hybrids, which are morphologically intermediate, tended to be intermediate in growth in both habitats. Growth rates were closely predicted by earlier laboratory measurements of feeding efficiency of the three forms in the same habitats, thus linking growth (and probably fitness) with feeding performance and morphology. I compare the strengths of the present approach with other methods that have been used to test the role of resources in adaptive radiation. I also argue that steep trade-offs in fitness along the littoral-open-water habitat gradient have two further consequences. First, they may cause Hybrids to have low fitness, allowing Benthics and Limnetics to coexist in the absence of perfect premating isolation between them. Second, they may promote ecological character displacement. Steep trade-offs may thus help explain why divergence along the littoral-open-water gradient is so common in fish that have colonized low-diversity lakes.

AB Protected areas (PAs) are a key strategy for protecting biological resources, but they vary considerably in their effectiveness and are frequently reported as having negative impacts on local people. This has contributed to a divisive and unresolved debate concerning the compatibility of environmental and socioeconomic development goals. Elucidating the relationship between positive and negative social impacts and conservation outcomes of PAs is key for the development of more effective and socially just conservation. We conducted a global meta-analysis on 165 PAs using data from 171 published studies. We assessed how PAs affect the well-being of local people, the factors associated with these impacts, and crucially the relationship between PAs' conservation and socioeconomic outcomes. Protected areas associated with positive socioeconomic outcomes were more likely to report positive conservation outcomes. Positive conservation and socioeconomic outcomes were more likely to occur when PAs adopted comanagement regimes, empowered local people, reduced economic inequalities, and maintained cultural and livelihood benefits. Whereas the strictest regimes of PA management attempted to exclude anthropogenic influences to achieve biological conservation objectives, PAs that explicitly integrated local people as stakeholders tended to be more effective at achieving joint biological conservation and socioeconomic development outcomes. Strict protection may be needed in some circumstances, yet our results demonstrate that conservation and development objectives can be synergistic and highlight management strategies that increase the probability of maximizing both conservation performance and development outcomes of PAs.

AB Because of its profound effects on the rates of biological processes such as aerobic metabolism, environmental temperature plays an important role in shaping the distribution and abundance of species. As temperature increases, the rate of metabolism increases and then rapidly declines at higher temperatures - a response that can be described using a thermal performance curve (TPC). Although the shape of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is often attributed to the competing effects of thermodynamics, which can be described using the Arrhenius equation, and the effects of temperature on protein stability, this account represents an over-simplification of the factors acting even at the level of single proteins. In addition, it cannot adequately account for the effects of temperature on complex multistep processes, such as aerobic metabolism, that rely on mechanisms acting across multiple levels of biological organization. The purpose of this review is to explore our current understanding of the factors that shape the TPC for aerobic metabolism in response to acute changes in temperature, and to highlight areas where this understanding is weak or insufficient. Developing a more strongly grounded mechanistic model to account for the shape of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is crucial because these TPCs are the foundation of several recent attempts to predict the responses of species to climate change, including the metabolic theory of ecology and the hypothesis of oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance.

AB Forest fragmentation results from deforestation and disturbance, with subsequent edge effects extending deep into remaining forest areas. No study has quantified the effects of both deforestation and selective logging, separately and combined, on forest fragmentation and edge effects over large regions. The main objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify the rates and extent of forest fragmentation from deforestation and logging within the Brazilian Amazon, and (2) contextualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of this forest fragmentation through a literature review of potential ecological repercussions of edge creation. Using GIS and remote sensing, we quantified forest fragmentation defined as both increases in the forest edge-to-area ratio and number of forest fragments - and edge-effected forest occurring from these activities across more than 1.1 million km(2) of the Brazilian Amazon from 1999 to 2002. Annually, deforestation and logging generated similar to 32,000 and 38,000 km of new forest edge while increasing the edge-to-area ratio of remaining forest by 0.14 and 0.15, respectively. Combined deforestation and logging increased the edge-to-area ratio of remaining forest by 65% over our study period, while generating 5539 and 3383 new forest fragments, respectively. Although we found that 90% of individual forest fragments were smaller than 4 km(2), we also found that 50% of the remaining intact forests were located in contiguous forest areas greater than 35,000 km(2). We then conducted a literature review documenting 146 edge effects and found that these penetrated to a median distance of 100 m, a distance encompassing 6.4% of all remaining forests in our study region in the year 2002, while 53% of forests were located within two km of an edge. Annually deforestation and logging increased the proportion of edge-forest by 0.8% and 3.1%, respectively. As a result of both activities, the total proportion of edge-forest increased by 2.6% per year, while the proportion within 100-m increased by 0.5%. Over our study period, deforestation resulted in an additional similar to 3000 km(2) of edge-forest, whereas logging generated similar to 20,000 km(2), as it extended deep into intact forest areas. These results show the large extent and rapid expansion of previously unquantified soft-edges throughout the Amazon and highlight the need for greater research into their ecological impacts.

AB Biodiversity is proposed to be important for the rate of ecosystem functions. Most biodiversity-ecosystem function studies, however, consider only one response variable at a time, and even when multiple variables are examined they are analyzed separately. This means that a very important aspect of biodiversity is overlooked: the possibility for different species to carry out different functions at any one time. We propose a conceptual model to explore the effects of species loss on overall ecosystem functioning, where overall functioning is defined as the joint effect of many ecosystem functions. We show that, due to multifunctional complementarity among species, overall functioning is more susceptible to species loss than are single functions. Modeled relationships between species richness and overall ecosystem functioning using five empirical data sets on monocultures reflected the range of effects of species loss on multiple functions predicted by the model. Furthermore, an exploration of the correlations across functions and the degree of redundancy within functions revealed that multifunctional redundancy was generally lower than single-function redundancy in these empirical data sets. We suggest that by shifting the focus to the variety of functions maintained by a diversity of species, the full importance of biodiversity for the functioning of ecosystems can be uncovered. Our results are thus important for conservation and management of biota and ecosystem services.

AB A considerable fraction of the world's biodiversity is of recent evolutionary origin and has evolved as a by-product of, and is maintained by, divergent adaptation in heterogeneous environments. Conservationists have paid attention to genetic homogenization caused by human-induced translocations (e.g. biological invasions and stocking), and to the importance of environmental heterogeneity for the ecological coexistence of species. However, far less attention has been paid to the consequences of loss of environmental heterogeneity to the genetic coexistence of sympatric species. Our review of empirical observations and our theoretical considerations on the causes and consequences of interspecific hybridization suggest that a loss of environmental heterogeneity causes a loss of biodiversity through increased genetic admixture, effectively reversing speciation. Loss of heterogeneity relaxes divergent selection and removes ecological barriers to gene flow between divergently adapted species, promoting interspecific introgressive hybridization. Since heterogeneity of natural environments is rapidly deteriorating in most biomes, the evolutionary ecology of speciation reversal ought to be fully integrated into conservation biology.

AB Anthropogenic influences on the biosphere since the advent of the industrial age are increasingly causing global changes. Climatic change and the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are ranking high in scientific and public agendas, and other components of global change are also frequently addressed, among which are the introductions of non indigenous species (NIS) in biogeographic regions well separated from the donor region, often followed by spectacular invasions. In the marine environment, both climatic change and spread of alien,species have been studied extensively; this review is aimed at examining the main responses of ecosystems to climatic change, taking into account the increasing importance of biological invasions.
   Some general principles on NIS introductions in the marine environment are recalled, such as the importance of propagule pressure and of development stages during the time course of an invasion. Climatic change is known to affect many ecological properties; it interacts also with NIS in many possible ways. Direct (proximate) effects on individuals and populations of altered physical-chemical conditions are distinguished from indirect effects on emergent properties (species distribution, diversity, and production). Climatically driven changes may affect both local dispersal mechanisms, due to the alteration of current patterns, and competitive interactions between NIS and native species, due to the onset of new thermal optima and/or different carbonate chemistry.
   As well as latitudinal range expansions of species correlated with changing temperature conditions, and effects on species richness and the correlated extinction of native species, some invasions may provoke multiple effects which involve overall ecosystem functioning (material flow between trophic groups, primary production, relative extent of organic material decomposition, extent of benthic-pelagic coupling). Some examples are given, including a special mention of the situation of the Mediterranean Sea, where so many species have been introduced recently, and where some have spread in very large quantities.
   An increasing effort by marine scientists is required, not only to monitor the state of the environment, but also to help predicting future changes and finding ways to mitigate or manage them. (C) 2006. Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SCENIC BEAUTY; PERCEPTION
AB There is increasing awareness of the need to monitor trends in our constantly changing agricultural landscapes. Monitoring programmes often use remote sensing data and focus on changes in land cover/land use in relation to values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage and recreation. Although a wide range of indicators is in use, landscape aesthetics is a topic that is frequently neglected. Our aim was to determine whether aspects of landscape content and configuration could be used as surrogate measures for visual landscape quality in monitoring programmes based on remote sensing. In this paper, we test whether map-derived indicators of landscape structure from the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes are correlated with visual landscape preferences. Two groups of people participated: (1) locals and (2) non-local students. Using the total dataset, we found significant positive correlations between preferences and spatial metrics, including number of land types, number of patches and land type diversity. In addition, preference scores were high where water was present within the mapped image area, even if the water itself was not visible in the images. When the dataset was split into two groups, we found no significant correlation between the preference scores of the students and locals. Whilst the student group preferred images portraying diverse and heterogeneous landscapes, neither diversity nor heterogeneity was correlated with the preference scores of the locals. We conclude that certain indicators based on spatial structure also have relevance in relation to landscape preferences in agricultural landscapes. However, the finding that different groups of people prefer different types of landscape underlines the need for care when interpreting indicator values. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Avian life history theory has long assumed that nest predation plays a minor role in shaping reproductive strategies. Yet, this assumption remains conspicuously untested by broad experiments that alter environmental risk of nest predation, despite the fact that nest predation is a major source of reproductive failure. Here, we examined whether parents can assess experimentally reduced nest predation risk and alter their reproductive strategies. We experimentally reduced nest predation risk and show that in safer environments parents increased investment in young through increased egg size, clutch mass, and the rate they fed nestlings. Parents also increased investment in female condition by increasing the rates that males fed incubating females at the nest, and decreasing the time that females spent incubating. These results demonstrate that birds can assess nest predation risk at large and that nest predation plays a key role in the expression of avian reproductive strategies.

AB Coexistence mechanisms that require environmental variation to operate contribute importantly to the maintenance of biodiversity. One famous hypothesis of diversity maintenance under disturbance is the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). The IDH proposes patterns of peaked diversity under intermediate disturbance regimes, based on a tension between competitively superior species and species which can rapidly colonize following disturbance. We review the literature, and describe recent research that suggests that more than one underlying mechanism can generate this unimodal diversity pattern in disturbed environments. Several exciting emerging research areas are identified, including interactions between disturbance types, operation of the IDH in multi-trophic systems, and changes in disturbance regimes. However, empirical work is still focussed on describing the IDH pattern, with little emphasis on identifying its mechanistic basis. We discuss how to extend methods for identifying different coexistence mechanisms, developed in the theoretical literature, to experimental research. In an attempt to operationalize these various ideas we outline a hypothetical IDH research programme. A solid understanding of the life history attributes of the component species and their responses to disturbance will facilitate identification of the coexistence mechanism(s) underlying the IDH pattern, and provide a framework by which empirical and theoretical results can be more fully integrated.

AB During the 20th century, farmers around the world replaced legume rotations and other traditional sources of nitrogen (N) fertility with synthetic N fertilizers. A sizable percentage of the human population now depends on synthetic N fertilizers for survival. In recent decades, N fertilizers have been linked to numerous environmental hazards including marine eutrophication, global warming, groundwater contamination, and stratospheric ozone destruction. Some researchers suggest that legumes, which can support biological NZ fixation, offer a more environmentally sound and sustainable source of N to cropping systems. This perspective is countered by researchers who argue that, (1) legume-derived N has equally negative environmental impacts as the N derived from synthetic fertilizers, and (2) the human population now exceeds the carrying capacity of agricultural systems that depend on legumes for N inputs. In this review, we compare the sustainability of obtaining N from legume versus industrial sources in terms of ecological integrity, energetics and food security. We conclude that obtaining N from legumes is potentially more sustainable than from industrial sources. We further suggest that while some countries are fundamentally dependent on synthetic N for food production, many countries have the capacity to greatly reduce or eliminate dependence on synthetic N through adoption of less meat-intensive diets, and reduction of food waste.

AB The consumption of figs (the fruit of Ficus spp. ;, Moraccae) by vertebrates is reviewed using data from the literature, unpublished accounts and new field data from Borneo and Hong Kong. Records of frugivory from over 75 countries are presented for 260 Ficus specie., (approximately 30 % of described species). Explanations are presented for geographical and taxonomic gaps in the otherwise extensive literature. In addition to a small number of reptiles and fishes, 1274 bird and mammal species in 523 genera and 92 families are known to eat figs. III terms of the number of species and genera of fig-eaters and the number of fig species eaten we identify the avian families interacting most with Ficus to be Columbidae, Psittacidae, Pycnonotidae, Bucerotidae. Sturnidae and Lybiidae. Among mammals, the major fig-eating families are Pteropodidae, Cercopithecidae, Sciuridae, Phyllostomidac and Cebidae. We assess the role these and other frugivores play in Ficus seed dispersal and identify fig-specialists. III most, but not all, cases fig specialists provide effective seed dispersal services to the Ficus species on which they feed. The diversity of fig-eaters is explained with respect to fig design and nutrient Content, phenology of fig ripening and the diversity of fig presentation. Whilst at a gross level there exists considerable overlap between birds, arboreal mammals and fruit bats with regard to the fig species they consume, closer analysis, based on evidence from across the tropics, suggests that discrete guilds, of Ficus species differentially attract subsets of sympatric frugivore communities. This dispersal guild structure is determined by interspecific differences in fig design and presentation, Throughout our examination of the fig-frugivore interaction we consider phylogenetic factors and make comparisons between large-scale biogeographical regions. Our dataset supports previous claims that Ficus is the most important plant genus for tropical frugivores. We explore the concept of figs as keystone resources and suggest criteria for future investigations of their dietary importance. Finally, fully referenced lists of frugivores recorded at each Ficus species and of Ficus species in the diet of each frugivore are presented as online appendices. In situations where ecological information is incomplete or its retrieval is impractical, this valuable resource will assist conservationists in evaluating the role of figs or their frugivores in tropical forest sites.

AB We review patterns of plant species richness with respect to variables related to resource availability and variables that have direct physiological impact on plant growth or resource availability. This review suggests that there are a variety of patterns of species richness along environmental gradients reported in the literature. However, part of this diversity may be explained by the different types and lengths of gradients studied, and by the limited analysis applied to the data. To advance in understanding species richness patterns along environmental gradients, we emphasise the importance of: (I) using variables that are related to the growth of plants (latitudinal and altitudinal gradients have no direct process impact on plant growth); (2) using multivariate gradients, not single variables; (3) comparing patterns far different life forms; and (4) testing for different shapes in the species richness response (not only linear) and for interaction between variables.

AB The region studied includes the Laurentian Great Lakes and a diversity of smaller glacial lakes, streams and wetlands south of permanent permafrost and towards the southern extent of Wisconsin glaciation. We emphasize lakes and quantitative implications. The region is warmer and wetter than it has been over most of the last 12000 years. Since 1911 observed air temperatures have increased by about 0.11 degrees C per decade in spring and 0.06 degrees C in winter; annual precipitation has increased by about 2.1% per decade. Ice thaw phenologies since the 1850s indicate a late winter warming of about 2.5 degrees C. In future scenarios for a doubled CO2 climate, air temperature increases in summer and winter and precipitation decreases (summer) in western Ontario but increases (winter) in western Ontario, northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Such changes in climate have altered and would further alter hydrological and other physical features of lakes. Warmer climates, i.e. 2 x CO2 climates, would lower net basin water supplies, stream flows and water levels owing to increased evaporation in excess of precipitation. Water levels have been responsive to drought and future scenarios for the Great Lakes simulate levels 0.2 to 2.5 m lower. Human adaptation to such changes is expensive. Warmer climates would decrease the spatial extent of ice cover on the Great Lakes; small lakes, especially to the south, would no longer freeze over every year. Temperature simulations for stratified lakes are 1-7 degrees C warmer for surface waters, and 6 degrees C cooler to 8 degrees C warmer for deep waters. Thermocline depth would change (4 m shallower to 3.5 m deeper) with warmer climates alone; deepening owing to increases in light penetration would occur with reduced input of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) from dryer catchments. Dissolved oxygen would decrease below the thermocline. These physical changes would in turn affect the phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos and fishes. Annual phytoplankton production may increase but many complex reactions of the phytoplankton community to altered temperatures, thermocline depths, light penetrations and nutrient inputs would be expected. Zooplankton biomass would increase, but, again, many complex interactions are expected.
   Generally, the thermal habitat for warm-, cool- and even cold-water fishes would increase in size in deep stratified lakes, but would decrease in shallow unstratified lakes and in streams. Less dissolved oxygen below the thermocline of lakes would further degrade stratified lakes for cold water fishes. Growth and production would increase for fishes that are now in thermal environments cooler than their optimum but decrease for those that are at or above their optimum, provided they cannot move to a deeper or headwater thermal refuge. The zoogeographical boundary for fish species could move north by 500-600 km; invasions of warmer water fishes and extirpations of colder water fishes should increase. Aquatic ecosystems across the region do not necessarily exhibit coherent responses to climate changes and variability, even if they are in close proximity. Lakes, wetlands and streams respond differently, as do fakes of different depth or productivity. Differences in hydrology and the position in the hydrological flow system, in terrestrial vegetation and land use, in base climates and in the aquatic biota can all cause different responses. Climate change effects interact strongly with effects of other human-caused stresses such as eutrophication, acid precipitation, toxic chemicals and the spread of exotic organisms. Aquatic ecological systems in the region are sensitive to climate change and variation.
   Assessments of these potential effects are in an early stage and contain many uncertainties in the models and properties of aquatic ecological systems and of the climate system. (C) 1997 by John Wiley B Sons, Ltd.

AB We estimated carbon allocation to belowground processes in unfertilized and fertilized red pine (Pinus resinosa Air.) plantations in northern Wisconsin to determine how soil fertility affects belowground allocation patterns. We used soil CO2 eMux and litterfall measurements to estimate total belowground carbon allocation (root production and root respiration) by the carbon balance method, established root-free trenched plots to examine treatment effects on microbial respiration, estimated fine root production by sequential coring, and developed allometric equations to estimate coarse root production. Fine root production ranged from 150 to 284 g m(-2) year(-1) and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Coarse root production ranged from 60 to 90 gm(-2)year(-1) and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfer tiIized plots. Annual soil CO2 fluxes ranged from 331 to 541 g C (m-2)year(-1) and were significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Annual foliage litterfall ranged from 110 to 187 g C m-2 year(-1) and was significantly greater for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Total belowground carbon allocation ranged from 188 to 395 g C m-2 year(-1) and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Annual soil CO2 flux was lower for trenched plots than for untrenched plots but did not differ between fertilized and unfertilized trenched plots. Collectively, these independent estimates suggest that fertilization decreased the relative allocation of carbon belowground.

AB The importance of genetic interactions in the evolutionary process has been debated for more than half a century. Genetic interactions such as under dominance and epistasis (the interaction among genetic loci in their effects on phenotypes or fitness) can play a special role in the evolutionary process because they can create multiple fitness optima (adaptive peaks) separated by fitness minima (adaptive valleys). The valleys prevent deterministic evolution from one peak to another. We review the evidence that genetic interaction is a common phenomenon in natural populations. Some studies give strong circumstantial evidence for multiple fitness peaks, although the mapping of epistatic interactions onto fitness surfaces remains incompletely explored, and absolute proof that multiple peaks exist can be shown to be empirically impossible. We show that there are many reasons that epistatic polymorphism is very difficult to find, even when interactions are an extremely important part of the genetic system. When polymorphism results in the presence of multiple fitness peaks within a group of interbreeding populations, one fitness peak will quickly be nearly fixed within all interbreeding populations, but when epistatic or under dominant loci are nearly fixed, there will be no direct evidence of genetic interaction. Thus when complex landscapes are evolutionarily most important, evidence for alternative high fitness genetic combinations will be most ephemeral. Genetic interactions have been most clearly demonstrated in wide crosses within species and among closely related species. This evidence suggests that genetic interactions may play an important role in taxonomic diversification and species-level constraints. Population genetic analyses linked with new approaches in metabolic and molecular genetic research are likely to provide exciting new insights into the role of gene interactions in the evolutionary process.

AB Nestedness of species assemblages occurs when the biotas of sites with lower numbers of species tend to be subsets of the biotas at richer sites. We develop new quantitative and statistical techniques for measuring, testing, and comparing nestedness, and apply these methods to data from the literature. Significantly nonrandom nestedness was present in all 27 assemblages examined, and tended to be stronger in systems dominated by extinction, such as landbridge islands. Sets of assemblages that were very strongly nested were more likely to have greater species richness on one or a few large sites than on several smaller sites of equivalent total area - that is, to fall toward the "single large" side of the "Single Large Or Several Small" (SLOSS) continuum. Our analysis indicates that nestedness, when quantified as a single number for a presence-absence matrix, measures community-wide differences in incidence (the frequency of occurrence or "distribution" of species). Factors that lead to consistent differences among species in immigration or extinction rates cause strong patterns of nestedness of species assemblages. Nestedness is negatively related to beta diversity: nestedness is low when beta diversity is high, and vice versa. Conservation managers will thus seek to minimize nestedness and the development of nested structure in systems of nature reserves.

AB In many parts of the world forest disturbance regimes have intensified recently, and future climatic changes are expected to amplify this development further in the coming decades. These changes are increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global literature review on the impact of three of the most important disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of the boreal, cool- and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i) synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services (P < 0.001). Indicators of biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by disturbance (P < 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a disturbance paradox', documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance. While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total ecosystem carbon by 38.5% (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by 35.6%. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed.

AB Carbohydrates provide the building blocks for plant structures as well as versatile resources for metabolic processes. The nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC), mainly sugars and starch, fulfil distinct functional roles, including transport, energy metabolism and osmoregulation, and provide substrates for the synthesis of defence compounds or exchange with symbionts involved in nutrient acquisition or defence. At the whole-plant level, NSC storage buffers the asynchrony of supply and demand on diel, seasonal or decadal temporal scales and across plant organs. Despite its central role in plant function and in stand-level carbon cycling, our understanding of storage dynamics, its controls and response to environmental stresses is very limited, even after a century of research. This reflects the fact that often storage is defined by what we can measure, that is, NSC concentrations, and the interpretation of these as a proxy for a single function, storage, rather than the outcome of a range of NSC source and sink functions. New isotopic tools allow direct quantification of timescales involved in NSC dynamics, and show that NSC-C fixed years to decades previously is used to support tree functions. Here we review recent advances, with emphasis on the context of the interactions between NSC, drought and tree mortality.

AB A systematic literature review was undertaken to analyse the linkages between different biodiversity attributes and 11 ecosystem services. The majority of relationships between attributes and ecosystem services cited in the 530 studies were positive. For example, the services of water quality regulation, water flow regulation, mass flow regulation and landscape aesthetics were improved by increases in community and habitat area. Functional traits, such as richness and diversity, also displayed a predominantly positive relationship across the services, most commonly discussed for atmospheric regulation, pest regulation and pollination. A number of studies also discussed a positive correlation with stand age, particularly for atmospheric regulation. Species level traits were found to benefit a number of ecosystem services, with species abundance being particularly important for pest regulation, pollination and recreation, and species richness for Umber production and freshwater fishing. Instances of biodiversity negatively affecting the examined ecosystem services were few in number for all ecosystem services, except freshwater provision. The review showed that ecosystem services are generated from numerous interactions occurring in complex systems. However, improving understanding of at least some of the key relationships between biodiversity and service provision will help guide effective management and protection strategies.

AB Disturbances to key aspects of ecological systems, including biodiversity loss, climate change, pollution and natural resource degradation, have become a major concern to many policy analysts. Instead of learning from the study of biological complexity however, social scientists tend to recommend simple panaceas, particularly government or private ownership, as 'the' way to solve these problems. This paper reviews and assesses potential solutions for such overly simplified institutional prescriptions, referred to here as the 'panacea problem'. In contrast to these simple prescriptions, recent research efforts are now illustrating the diversity of institutions around the world related to environmental conservation. The complexity of working institutions, however, presents a challenge to scholars who equate scientific knowledge with relatively simple models that predict optimal performance if specific institutional arrangements are in place. Dealing with this complexity has led to the development of frameworks as meta-theoretical tools. The institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework has been used over the last three decades as a foundation for a focused analysis of how institutions affect human incentives, actions and outcomes. Building on this foundation, the social-ecological systems (SES) framework has recently enabled researchers to begin the development of a common language that crosses social and ecological disciplines to analyse how interactions among a variety of factors affect outcomes. Such a framework may be able to facilitate a diagnostic approach that will help future analysts overcome the panacea problem. Using a common framework to diagnose the source, and possible amelioration, of poor outcomes for ecological and human systems enables a much finer understanding of these complex systems than has so far been obtained, and provides a basis for comparisons among many systems and ultimately more responsible policy prescriptions.

AB Salmon life histories are finely tuned to local environmental conditions, which are intimately linked to climate. We summarize the likely impacts of climate change on the physical environment of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of these changes, with particular reference to Columbia River Basin spring/summer Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. We discuss the possible evolutionary responses in migration and spawning date egg and juvenile growth and development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. We know little about ocean migration pathways, so cannot confidently suggest the potential changes in this life stage. Climate change might produce conflicting selection pressures in different life stages, which will interact with plastic (i. e. nongenetic) changes in various ways. To clarify these interactions, we present a conceptual model of how changing environmental conditions shift phenotypic optima and, through plastic responses, phenotype distributions, affecting the force of selection. Our predictions are tentative because we lack data on the strength of selection, heritability, and ecological and genetic linkages among many of the traits discussed here. Despite the challenges involved in experimental manipulation of species with complex life histories, such research is essential for full appreciation of the biological effects of climate change.
