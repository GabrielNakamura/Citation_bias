AB Despite the historical efforts to list and organize the taxonomic knowledge about the Brazilian ant fauna, the most diverse in the world, several gaps regarding species distribution data and sampling coverage persist. In an attempt to fill some of these gaps, we here apply a scientometric approach to provide an updated overview of the ants of Brazil based on formal publications on ant diversity in the Brazilian territory. In the last 50 years, ant diversity studies in Brazil revealed 1130 species, corresponding to around 70% of the species known to occur in the country. The Brazilian biomes with the highest number of described species recorded were, respectively, the Amazon Forest (716 species), Atlantic Forest (657 species), Cerrado (389 species), Caatinga (185 species), Pantanal (143 species), and Pampa (86 species). Considering the number and frequency of unidentified species, the genera Azteca, Hypoponera, Pheidole, and Solenopsis represent the main knowledge frontiers regarding taxonomic resolution, with more than 80% of their records associated with morphospecies codes in diversity studies in Brazil. Moreover, around 7.5% of the papers presented inconsistences in their species lists regarding the validity of taxonomic names, and we found studies for which some taxa records are geographically implausible. Besides demonstrating the importance of ecological publications to the ant diversity knowledge in Brazil, our findings highlight a strong sampling bias in ant occurrence data in the country, with species records unevenly distributed across Brazilian biomes. In short, our results constitute valuable information for future projects on ant taxonomy and surveying in Brazilian natural areas.

AB Closed artificial ecosystem has limited species and monotonically decreasing microbial species diversity, which is driven by inevitable interactions between microbial individuals. To find an approach to maintain microbial species diversity, simulated artificial interventions were implemented to change the spatial relationships of in-dividuals. In this study, four types of artificial interventions were performed including random mix, intermediate disturbance, position swap and the combined intervention. Six diversity indicators were applied to measure the effect of these interventions. An optimal combined intervention was found to be able to increase all the six in-dicators in nearly all steps. This study might provide reference to the study of the closed artificial ecosystem and other fields that need control of species diversity.

AB The lives of the urban poor in the majority world are unfree: blighted by social injustice in its manifold forms, from violence and ill-health to absent economic opportunities. We explore the pursuit of freedom through migration away from the metropole to ramais (colonisation tracks) at the rainforest frontier. Drawing on a case study in Brazilian Amazonia, we reveal urban-rural migration as a frontier dynamic driven by the search for a good life. We theorize freedom and the good life using the capabilities approach, starting from the observation that people in the ramais reported feeling better, and asking why that is. We find that frontiers provide a safer environment, which fosters individual and collective capabilities. A lower risk of violence reduces fears around bodily integrity, pervasive in Latin American cities. This safety fosters freedom and dignity by reducing worries and anxieties, leading to improve-ments in emotional well-being. We understand this increased sense of freedom as enhanced agency, that is, empowerment. In addition to new forms of political activity and subjectivity, we report a flourishing of senses, imagination and affiliation with others. Inequalities are reduced, positively influencing dignity and self-worth. These new freedoms are threatened by lack of rights provisioning by the State, however. We recommend that the Brazilian state should address social and environmental dimensions of these new forest frontiers. The state should recognize and support these settlements as valid forms of develop-ment, because they so clearly contribute to human wellbeing and flourishing. The state should guide and assist livelihood and landscape management toward more ecological approaches such as agroecology and agroforestry, to mitigate deforestation risks typical of forest frontiers.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mercury (Hg) toxicity in soils depends on Hg species and other physical and chemical attributes, as selenium (Se) hotspots in soils, particularly relevant in Amazonian soils. The study of Hg species and their relations in representative locations of the Amazon rainforest biome is critical for assessing the potential risks of Hg in this environment. This work aimed to determine the concentration of total Hg and its species (Hg-0, Hg-2(2+) and Hg2+), and to correlate Hg-total concentration with total elemental composition, magnetic susceptibility, and physicochemical attributes of Amazon soils. Nine sites in the Amazon rainforest biome, Brazil, were selected and analyzed for their chemical, physical, and mineralogical attributes. The clay fraction of the studied Amazon soils is dominated by kaolinite, goethite, hematite, gibbsite, and quartz. Mica was also found in soils from the States of Acre and Amazonas. Hg-total ranged from 21.5 to 208 mu g kg(-1) (median = 104 mu g kg(-1)), and the concentrations did not exceed the threshold value established for Brazilian soils (500 mu g kg(-1)). The Hg2+ was notably the predominant species. Its occurrence and concentration were correlated with the landscape position and soil attributes. Hg-total was moderately and positively correlated with TiO2, clay, and Se. The findings showed that geographic location, geological formation, and pedological differences influence the heterogeneity and distribution of Hg-total in the studied soil classes. Thus, a detailed characterization and knowledgment of the soil classes is very important to clarify the complex behavior of this metal in the Amazon rainforest biome.

AB There remain considerable controversies over payments for ecosystem services (PES) as an essential approach to improving ecosystem services. This study reviewed various definitions of PES and explored its economic nature; then explored previous methods for estimating the PES standard and finally proposed possible agendas for future PES research. Results suggested the PES and traditional land rent both originate from the monopoly of the providers on use rights of land vital to provision of certain ecosystem services, therefore PES should be redefined as a special kind of land rent for sharing land use rights of the providers to guarantee sustainable provision of certain ecosystem services. Besides, there has been no universal methods for estimating the rational PES standard due to insufficient understanding of the economic cause and nature of the PES. Re-imagining and re-designing PES as a system of land rights is advantageous to clearing up misunderstanding and disputes over the eco-nomic cause and nature of PES and overcoming limitations of existing methods for estimating the PES standard. Additionally, it is necessary to further improve the PES schemes based on cost-efficiency and explore the methods for estimating the PES standard based on the land rent theory and interdisciplinary knowledge.

AB Phosphorus (P) is an essential and limiting nutrient in soil and is tightly linked to soil fertility and productivity. Microorganisms have developed different mechanisms to respond to P scarcity and increase its availability in soil, which are susceptible to change under contrasting land uses. Here, we calculated and compared meta-genomic redundancy, as a measurement of ecosystem potential capacity, of 23 key functional genes related to organic P mineralization, inorganic P solubilization and P-starvation response regulation in forest, grassland and cropland soils through mining in public sequence repository. The redundancy of those genes in all currently published genomes (genome redundancy) from archaea, bacteria and fungi was also studied. Microbes in croplands and grasslands showed a higher potential (i.e., redundancy) to mineralize organic P through the action of alkaline phosphatases (phoA, phoD and phoX genes) and to solubilize inorganic P (gcd and pqqC) by producing gluconic acid than those in forests. Instead, the capacity of microbes to mineralize phosphonates through the action of C-P lyases (phnG, phnH, ..., phnM) was found to be higher in forests. The impact of land use on the metagenomic redundancy of genes encoding phytases (appA and 3-phytase) was dependent on the type of phytase. Intermetagenome redundancy (potentiality per metagenome unit) reached maximum values for phos-phatase production, P solubilization and regulation of P starvation, denoting the crucial role that these functions have in P cycling. Proteobacteria, within Bacteria, and Euryarchaeota, within Archaea, showed the greatest genomic potential to respond to P scarcity. However, the role of fungi seems to be more restricted. The present study provides an overview on how the microbial mechanisms that regulate P availability in soil potentially change with land use and taxonomy of microbes.

AB Soil microbes regulate the storage of carbon (C) in peatlands, which is facilitated by nutrients. To date, few researchers have examined the spatial distribution of soil microbial biomass, microbial community structure, and their metabolic nutrient limitations in mountain peatlands at different altitudes. This study aimed to improve the knowledge of how and why soil microbial biomass and their metabolic nutrient limitations varied with altitude. We investigated the phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and enzymatic stoichiometry in surface (0-20 cm) and subsurface (20-50 cm) soil from peatlands with different types of vegetation in the Changbai Mountains. Overall, the soil microbial PLFAs were higher in the sedge-dominated peatlands than in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The soil microbial PLFAs in the sedge-dominated peatlands were elevated at high altitudes but decreased with altitude in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The soil fungal/bacterial ratios (F/B) in the surface soil increased with altitude in the sedge-dominated peatlands but not in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacteria ratios (G+/G-) in the surface soil decreased with altitude in the sedge-dominated and shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The soil F/B ratios were higher, but the G+/ G- ratios were lower in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands than in the sedge-dominated peatlands. The soil pH and nutrient ratios explained most of the differences in soil bacterial and fungal PLFAs, respectively. However, the total nutrients of soil were the primary regulators of soil F/B and G+/G-. The soil microbial activities suffered from C- and phosphorus (P)- limitations in the mountain peatlands. The limitations were worse in the shrub/Sphagnum-dominated peatlands than in the sedge-dominated peatlands. The P limitations were greater at high altitude than at low altitude in both types of peatlands. The C and P limitations on soil microbial metabolism were primarily controlled by soil physical properties and nutrient ratios, respectively.

AB Distance-decay relationships (DDRs) represent a very useful approach to describing the spatial distribution of biological communities. However, plankton DDR patterns and community assembly mechanisms are still poorly understood at different spatial scales in reservoir ecosystems. We collected phytoplankton, zooplankton and water samples in 24 reservoirs from subtropical and tropical China from July to August 2018. We examined DDR patterns across three distinct spatial scales, i.e., within-reservoir, within-drainage (but between reservoirs) and between drainages. We tested whether the rate of change (i.e., slope) of DDRs is consistent across different spatial scales. We assessed the relative importance of spatial and environmental variables in shaping the community distribution of plankton and quantitatively distinguished the community assembly mechanisms. We observed significant DDR curves in phytoplankton and zooplankton communities, in which slopes of the DDRs were steepest at the smallest spatial scale. Both spatial and environmental factors had significant impacts on DDR and dispersal assembly was a slightly stronger process in reservoir phytoplankton and zooplankton community assembly than niche-based process. We conclude that DDRs of reservoir phytoplankton and zooplankton vary with spatial scale. Our data shed light on how spatial and environmental variables contribute to plankton community assembly together. However, we revealed that dispersal process contributes to the biogeography of reservoir plankton slightly more strongly than environmental filtering. Collectively, this study enhances the understanding of plankton biogeography and distribution at multiple spatial scales.

AB Mussels form dense three-dimensional beds that serve as habitat to other species. In rocky shores, these beds are often interspersed by gaps due to patchy dislodgement/mortality caused by the action of waves, predators, and/ or extreme temperatures. Although mussel beds and gaps are known to support distinctive invertebrate com-munities, variations in invertebrate habitat function between the interior and edges of mussel beds and gaps were not yet examined. Here, we evaluated variations in habitat properties and invertebrate composition between the edge and interior of mussel (Brachidontes rodriguezii) beds and gaps at three rocky shore sites in the Southwestern Atlantic. Our results indicate that the interior and edge of mussel-covered areas differ in terms of mussel size, density and orientation relative to the rock surface (all surrogates of habitat structure), and in the quantity of sediments they accumulate. However, this does not directly translated into differences in temperature, desic-cation, and invertebrate composition within the mussel bed. As it concerns to gaps, we generally observed increased limpet (Siphonaria lesonii) densities at their edges, which suggests that they encounter favourable conditions by the perimeter of mussel beds. The general lack of edge effects on the invertebrates inhabiting mussel beds suggests that their species composition would remain largely unaffected by expected increases in gap and edge habitat formation due to ongoing increases in the frequency and magnitude of storms and heat waves. Yet, if increased availability of edge habitats leads to increased overall density of limpets in these rocky shores, then changes could be expected in algal production, composition, and dynamics.

AB The Atlantic Forest of South America supports a rich terrestrial biodiversity but has been reduced to only a small extent of its original forest cover. It hosts a large number of endemic mammalian species but our knowledge of arboreal mammal ecology and conservation has been limited because of the challenges of observing arboreal species from ground level. Camera trapping has proven to be an effective tool in terrestrial mammal monitoring but the technique has rarely been used for arboreal species. For the first time in the Atlantic Forest, we obtained data on the arboreal mammal community using arboreal camera trapping, focusing on Caparao National Park, Brazil. We placed 24 infrared camera traps in the forest canopy in seven areas within the Park, operating them continuously during January 2017-June 2019. During this period the camera traps accumulated 4,736 camera-days of footage and generated a total of 2,256 photographs and 30-s videos of vertebrates. The arboreal camera traps were able to detect arboreal mammals of a range of body sizes. The mammal assemblage comprised 15 identifiable species, including the Critically Endangered northern muriqui Brachyteles hypoxanthus and buffy-headed marmoset Callithrix flaviceps as well as other rare, nocturnal and inconspicuous species. We confirmed for the first time the occurrence of the thin-spined porcupine Chaetomys subspinosus in the Park. Species richness varied across survey areas and forest types. Our findings demonstrate the potential of arboreal camera trapping to inform conservation strategies.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain has one of the highest levels of plant species endemism, but the intense historical fragmentation across the coastal Atlantic tropical rain forest has reduced the original vegetation to < 10% and an island-like, patchy landscape. Despite such unprecedented vegetation loss, biogeographically and phylogenetically interesting discoveries in different angiosperm families have been newly reported for the Atlantic Forest in recent years. Here, we show that species discovery in the legume family (Fabaceae) across the Atlantic Forest has counter-intuitively been increasing. Since 1850, more than half of the legume species described for the domain are endemic, and the total number of endemic species has since increased almost four-fold, resulting in the current record of 442 endemic legumes. One such endemic is a new papilionoid legume, only known from a few giant trees that remained misidentified for 70 years since it was first collected. This new species, described here under the name Dipteryx hermetopascoaliana, based on morphological, geographical and molecular evidence, represents the first endemic species to the genus in the Atlantic Forest. We provide a complete morphological description, distribution map, preliminary conservation status and illustration of the new species. The phylogenetic isolation of D. hermetopascoaliana as sister to all other species of the genus and its restricted distribution in a severely fragmented landscape isolated by sugarcane monocultures in north-eastern Brazil are a signature of how critically endangered the biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest is.

AB Natural regeneration and forest successional development are influenced by gap formation in forest stands. Nonetheless, there are limited studies that provide quantitative information on the influence of gaps on forest regeneration. We evaluated characteristics of inner and outer canopy gaps and their effects on natural regeneration in 40 canopy gaps in Sitapahar forest reserve of Bangladesh. A total of 50 individuals of 27 gapmaker tree species were found, of which 58% were formed by logging and the rest by natural damages. Elliptical shape represented 53% of the gaps followed by circular and rectangular gaps. The mean area of the outer and inner gaps was 50.1 +/- 8.6 and 20.0 +/- 3.0 m(2), respectively. Gap formation types and shapes did not vary significantly between outer and inner gaps, while the mean gap area in older gaps was significantly higher than in new gaps. In comparison with outer gaps, mean densities of seedlings and saplings in the inner gaps were significantly higher, which is probably because of the closeness to seed trees. The diversity index of regenerating species and their height and collar diameter did not vary significantly between the inner and outer gaps. Positive, but weak relationships of gap area with subcanopy tree density and diversity were found. Since gaps were found dominated by few light-demanding tree species such as Brownlowia elata, Lithocarpus acuminata, Lithocarpus polystachya, and Macaranga denticulate, it is suggested that larger gaps need to be replanted with a combination of light-demanding and shade-tolerant native trees.

AB Coexisting plants can enhance soil phosphorus (P) availability and plant-P acquisition. However, whether plants growing in P-impoverished desert ecosystems present flexible foliar-P allocation strategies and show discrepancies in their response to different chemical forms of soil-P in plant/plant mixed systems requires further exploration. Four sites with different soil-P availabilities were chosen and foliar-P fractions of legume Alhagi sparsifolia and non-legume Karelinia caspia in sole and mixed systems were determined. Correspondingly, soil P-fractions, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, and other soil properties were measured. Our results found Alhagi sparsifolia and Karelinia caspia were not complementary in mixed system. Compared to the sole Karelinia caspia, the dry leaf weight of mixed Karelinia caspia was increased by 16%, while mixed Alhagi sparsifolia was reduced by 30% relative to the sole Alhagi sparsifolia. In a mixed system, Alhagi sparsifolia allocated 34% foliar-P to nucleic acid-P, but Karelinia caspia allocated 35% foliar-P to metabolic-P and 32% foliar-P to structural-P, respectively. Moreover, compared to the sole system, soil active Pi in the mixed system was increased by 22%, but active organic-P (Po) was reduced by 14%. Furthermore, soil active Pi and Po were stronger determinants for the foliar-P fractions of mixed Alhagi sparsifolia, while active Pi and enzyme activity were stronger determinants for mixed Karelinia caspia. Overall, the flexible allocation of nucleic acid-P by mixed Alhagi sparsifolia and the different responses of foliar-P fractions in mixed systems to soil active Pi and Po indicated the P utilization and allocation strategies of two coexisting desert species to low-P environments.

AB Hainan gibbons are among the world's most critically endangered primates, with a remaining population of only 35 individuals distributed across 5 social groups in the Bawangling Branch of the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park, China. Habitat conversion and forest fragmentation over the past 40 years have reduced their geographical distribution by 95%. In the absence of a quantitative assessment of the availability of remaining suitable habitat, it is unclear whether this species can survive to the end of this century. We used behavioral observations, ArcGIS, remote sensing, stereo optical imagery, and MaxEnt modeling to identify patterns of Hainan gibbon range use and compare changes in the distribution of suitable forest types and areas of forest fragmentation over the past 20 years (2000-2020). The results indicate that the combined range of the 5 extant Hainan gibbon groups totaled 14.89 km(2). The home range of the smallest group (Group E, 3 individuals) was 1.51 km(2), which likely represents the minimum home range size for this species. The remaining area of highly suitable and moderately suitable habitat totals 26.9 km(2). However, habitat connectivity across the gibbon range is very low (less than 0.5), limiting the ability of Hainan gibbons to move between forest patches. The results of this study indicate that the availability of suitable habitat in Bawangling is insufficient to allow for future Hainan gibbon population growth. Therefore, immediate action must be taken to restore, reforest, and establish ecological corridors to reconnect areas of suitable habitat for these critically endangered gibbons.

AB Assessing the spatiotemporal behaviour of alien species is pivotal to designing effective management plans. Interspecific niche partitioning among ungulates is reported as a strategy to avoid direct interactions. The Mediterranean mouflon and wild boar are two ungulates introduced to Elba island for hunting and aesthetic purposes. We used intensive camera trapping to test whether species occupancy and temporal activity rhythms would vary in response to the presence or absence of the co-occurring species through multi-species occupancy modelling. Our findings report a lack of spatial and temporal segregation between the two species for the late spring-summer and late summer-autumn seasons. In contrast, results for the winter-early spring period suggest that spatial partitioning between wild boar and mouflon is present in areas with high artificial cover (e.g., paved roads). Animals may indeed exploit roads to move more rapidly in search of food; however, their occurrence in these areas seems to be influenced by the presence of the other species.

AB Introduction and establishment of nonnative fishes can negatively affect native species and ecosystems through a variety of ecological interactions. For example, competition between species that occupy a similar trophic guild can result in extirpation or reduced abundance of native fishes. We used a combination of standard sampling methods and stable isotope analysis to evaluate relative abundance and isotopic niche overlap among native and nonnative species in Odell Lake, Oregon. Our primary focus was on interactions between native Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus and nonnative Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush; however, we also evaluated relative abundance and isotopic niche characteristics of other native and nonnative species. Overall, the relative abundance of nonnative fishes was greater than that of native fishes. For example, Lake Trout outnumbered Bull Trout 27:1, and the numerically most dominant species in our sample was nonnative Tui Chub Siphateles bicolor. We also observed isotopic niche overlap among a variety of native and nonnative fishes. Bull Trout and Lake Trout are both top-level predators in Odell Lake and the probability that Bull Trout were within the isotopic niche of Lake Trout was 0.23. The probability that nonnative kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka and Tui Chub were within the isotopic niche of native Mountain Whitefish Prosopium williamsoni exceeded 0.95, and the probability that Tui Chub were within the isotopic niche of Rainbow Trout O. mykiss was 0.90. Based on data presented here and rangewide patterns for Bull Trout, we conclude that competition with Lake Trout is plausible and has the potential to influence the persistence of Bull Trout in Odell Lake. Further, we discuss ecological interactions potentially influencing the abundance of other native fishes in Odell Lake.

AB As major consumers of plants, insect herbivores have strong potential to influence long-term patterns of plant abundance and community structure. Nonetheless, remarkably few manipulative experiments exclude insects for three or more years. Thus, how often, and under what conditions insects have enduring impacts remains unclear. Here we summarize the key conceptual issues and evidence from long-term studies on the impact of insects on plant populations and communities. Models that project effects of herbivores on plant population growth, based on demographic study, suggest that insects often limit plant asymptotic population growth. However, empirical estimations of insect impacts on plant abundance based on long-term experimental studies are few. As such, the strength and conditionality of compensatory mechanisms (such as density dependence and seedbanks) that may dampen (or exacerbate) the negative effects of insects on plant populations remains unclear. The influences of insects on plant range size and limits, invasion success and biocontrol are well-established research areas, but are also underexplored in long-term experiments. Insect herbivores can influence plant community structure and diversity, and change successional trajectories, often through modification of plant competitive ability. Nonetheless, effects are mostly known from mesic grasslands, take years to manifest and the extent of insect damage does not always predict their impact. The relative importance of specialist versus generalist herbivores is unclear, as is how feedbacks between plant productivity, herbivory and plant species richness contribute to community dynamics over time. Synthesis. The few existing long-term insect suppression experiments, and many short-term studies, suggest that insect herbivores can importantly affect plant populations and communities. Although challenging, experimental studies spanning multiple plant generations could greatly enhance our ability to develop a more predictive framework for how insect herbivores influence plant populations and communities.

TI Organic P Inputs Alleviate P Limitation Effects on Nutrient Uptake and

AB Phosphorus (P) is a limiting nutrient in many agroecosystems and, apart from affecting plant growth, can also limit biological N-2 fixation (BNF) by leguminous plants. Thus, increasing P supply can have a positive effect on BNF particularly in P-deficient soils. Here, we provide new insights into the response of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), widely adopted as a legume cover crop, to P limitations, by comparing the effects of inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) P supply on plant growth and BNF capacity. This was achieved by means of a greenhouse experiment in which rhizobia-inoculated hairy vetch was grown in a P-limited agricultural soil and changes in plant growth, nitrogen (N) and P uptake, BNF capacity, and soil phosphatases activities were evaluated as a function of Pi and Po inputs, in the form of orthophosphate or phytic acid, respectively. When compared to P-deficient conditions where BNF was primarily limited by plant growth rather than directly due to the high P costs of symbiotic N fixation, Pi addition substantially enhanced plant growth (threefold), nodule formation (16-fold), P acquisition (sixfold), and BNF efficiency (sevenfold). In contrast, even with the addition of the highest dose of Po, the increase in plant growth, nodule formation, P acquisition, and BNF capacity (1.7, 3.5, 2.4 and 2.1-fold, respectively) was much less expressed, indicating that hairy vetch could only minimally access Po sources over the growth period in order to alleviate the P limitation effect on N-2 fixation in under P-deficient conditions. These findings suggest that hairy vetch will not be able to provide sufficient BNF for improving soil N inputs in low-fertility cropping systems that rely on organic inputs.

AB Key message The rate of vessel tapering is highly conserved across a precipitation gradient in tropical trees, pointing to a limit on tree height determined by a maximum basal vessel diameter. Maximum tree height in the tropics decreases strongly with decreasing precipitation. The role of hydraulic architecture in controlling this variation in tree height remains unclear. The widening of conducting xylem vessels from the apex to the base of trees, also known as tapering, is important for maintaining the hydraulic conductivity along the tree stem. If in contrast vessel diameter were constant, then resistance would increase with path length constraining flow rates as tree height increases. Whilst previous research has shown that vessel diameter scales with tree height at a similar rate (similar power law exponent) across biomes and taxa, knowledge on these relationships across precipitation gradients within a single species is incomplete, especially for the tropics. Here we report how vessel density and diameter at the tree base differ for two tropical Cedrela species across four sites varying in precipitation from 1014 to 2585 mm year(-1). We find that maximum tree height decreases with decreasing precipitation across sites from 42 to 13 m. Despite the strong differences between sites in maximum tree height and water availability, tapering is indeed remarkably conserved and close to published scaling with height based on multi-species analyses. Thus, for a given tree height, basal vessel diameter does not vary between sites, whilst the maximum basal vessel size is two times smaller at the drier site (with the shortest trees) compared to the wettest site (with the tallest trees). This suggests a possible limitation of tree height determined by a maximum basal vessel diameter that can be sustained, given increasing embolism risk with increasing dryness. Our results show no hydraulic adaptation across this wetness gradient and reveal a clear relationship between maximum tree height and maximum basal vessel size.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance contributes to global change by reshaping the ecological niche space available to biological communities. Quantifying the range of functional response traits required for species persistence is central towards understanding the mechanisms underlying community disassembly in disturbed landscapes. We used intensive field surveys of cloud forest bird communities across seven replicate landscapes undergoing agricultural conversion in the Peruvian Andes to examine how a suite of 16 functional response traits related to morphology, diet, foraging behaviour and environmental niche breadth predict (1) species-specific abundance changes in countryside habitats compared to forest and (2) differential changes to the ecological niche space occupied by communities. Our analyses relied on (1) hierarchical distance sampling models to examine the functional predictors of abundance change across the agricultural land use gradient while accounting for imperfect detection and (2) n-dimensional hypervolumes to quantify the expansion and contraction of ecological niche space in countryside habitats. Key traits related to increased abundance in early successional and mixed-intensity agricultural areas included (1) morphological adaptations to dense understorey habitats, (2) plant-based diets (flowers, fruit and seeds) and (3) broad elevational range limits and habitat breadth. Species occupying mixed and high-intensity agricultural land use regimes had mean elevational range limits 20%-60% wider than species found within forests. Collectively, ecological niche space expanded within agricultural habitats for traits related to diet and environmental niche breadth, while contracting for foraging and dispersal traits. Such changes were driven by species with unique functional trait combinations. Our results reveal the dynamic changes to ecological niche space that underly community structure in disturbed landscapes and highlight how increased niche breadth can ameliorate disturbance sensitivity for generalist species. We emphasize that functional traits can be used to predict changes in community structure across disturbance gradients, allowing insights into specific mechanisms underlying community disassembly beyond emergent patterns of functional diversity. By identifying key functional trait groups that align with different countryside habitats, we demonstrate how conservation practitioners can contribute to the retention of avian functional diversity in agricultural landscapes throughout the world.

AB Non-indigenous species (NIS) can invade marine ecosystems worldwide not only because of higher growth rates and reproductive potential but also due to their ability to escape from native consumers either by defensive traits or by the colonization of spatial refuges. Spatial consumption refuges can be present in tidepools, especially in those from the high shore, with harsh environmental conditions. In order to test this hypothesis, we quantified consumer pressure on NIS in tidepools with different tidal elevations. We deployed tethering assays within 73 tidepools at 30 degrees S (Chile) in 2021 using the following four bait types: two NIS (the green seaweed Codium fragile and the tunicate Ciona robusta) and two reference baits (blades of the kelp Lessonia and dried squid). The two reference baits as well as the two NIS were consumed across all tidepools. Thus, there was no tidal gradient in NIS consumption: higher tidepools did not offer a spatial refuge as native consumers can reach them and consume NIS. Possibly, on wave-exposed coasts, high shore tidepools are frequently splashed, mitigating harsh conditions, and, therefore, reducing the potential for spatial refuges from consumption. While both NIS were eaten by native consumers in tidepools, they are nevertheless successful invaders. Therefore, our results suggest that NIS can compensate for consumer losses in tidepools, which allows them to colonize tidepool systems even if these do not offer spatial refuges from consumption. Tidepools might represent a first invasion window for NIS to enter natural communities, potentially causing important effects on biodiversity of rocky intertidal habitats.

AB Nest predation is the primary cause of nest failure in most ground-nesting bird species. Investigations of relationships between nest predation rate and habitat usually pool different predator species. However, such relationships likely depend on the specific predator involved, partly because habitat requirements vary among predator species. Pooling may therefore impair our ability to identify conservation-relevant relationships between nest predation rate and habitat. We investigated predator-specific nest predation rates in the forest-dependent, ground-nesting wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix in relation to forest area and forest edge complexity at two spatial scales and to the composition of the adjacent habitat matrix. We used camera traps at 559 nests to identify nest predators in five study regions across Europe. When analyzing predation data pooled across predator species, nest predation rate was positively related to forest area at the local scale (1000 m around nest), and higher where proportion of grassland in the adjacent habitat matrix was high but arable land low. Analyses by each predator species revealed variable relationships between nest predation rates and habitat. At the local scale, nest predation by most predators was higher where forest area was large. At the landscape scale (10,000 m around nest), nest predation by buzzards Buteo buteo was high where forest area was small. Predation by pine martens Martes martes was high where edge complexity at the landscape scale was high. Predation by badgers Meles meles was high where the matrix had much grassland but little arable land. Our results suggest that relationships between nest predation rates and habitat can depend on the predator species involved and may differ from analyses disregarding predator identity. Predator-specific nest predation rates, and their relationships to habitat at different spatial scales, should be considered when assessing the impact of habitat change on avian nesting success.

AB The rapid loss of biodiversity in tropical rainforests calls for new remote sensing approaches capable of providing rapid estimates of biodiversity over large areas. Imaging spectroscopy has shown potential for the estimation of taxonomic diversity, but the link with spectral diversity has not been investigated extensively with experimental data so far. We explored the relationship between taxonomic diversity and visible to near infrared spectral variance derived from various spectral processing techniques by means of a labeled dataset comprising 2000 individual tree crowns from 200 species from an experimental tropical forest station in French Guiana. We generated a set of artificially assembled communities covering a broad range of taxonomic diversity from this experimental dataset. We analyzed the impact of various processing steps: spectral normalization, spectral transformation through principal component analysis, and feature selection. Correlation between taxonomic diversity and inter-specific spectral variance was strong. Correlation was lower with total spectral variance, with or without normalization and transformation. Dimensionality reduction through feature selection resulted in dramatic improvement of the correlation between Shannon index and spectral variance. While airborne diversity mapping of tropical forest may not be at hand yet, our results confirm that spectral diversity metrics, when computed on properly preprocessed and selected spectral information can predict taxonomic diversity in tropical ecosystems.

AB Aim The proximate ecological and evolutionary processes underlying the high biodiversity of neotropical montane cloud forests are still very poorly understood. Climatic oscillations may have contributed to vicariance and cladogenesis, but also promoted secondary contact and erosion of genetic divergence. Here we tested whether geographical diversification - or its lack thereof - in a complex of arboreal alligator lizards is explained by range shifts during Quaternary climatic oscillations. Location Pine-oak and cloud forests, central Mexico. Taxon Abronia taeniata-graminea species complex (Squamata: Anguidae: Gerrhonotinae). Methods We generated genomic data (ddRADseq) to infer patterns of geographical diversification in the complex, reconstruct its demographic history, estimate the timing of lineage split, and test for the presence of contemporary and/or historical hybridization. We evaluated whether the tempo and mode of diversification (i.e. strict isolation vs. secondary contact with introgression) are explained by the contemporary distribution of suitable habitats and/or range shifts experienced by the complex since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), as inferred from environmental niche modelling (ENM). Results Genomic data supported a marked genetic structure within the complex, and phylogenomic and dating analyses revealed cryptic lineage diversification starting at the onset of the Pleistocene followed by secondary contact with limited introgression. ENM pointed to considerable range expansions of the complex during the LGM and a marked fragmentation and scarce connectivity among contemporary populations, which was supported by genomic-based demographic reconstructions. Main Conclusions The geographical diversification of the complex has been moulded by vicariant events promoted by Pleistocene geologic and climatic changes impacting the distribution of their pine-oak and cloud forest habitats. Our data supported a model of divergence with introgression, indicating that pulses of population fragmentation and expansion during the Quaternary have led to multiple opportunities for both allopatric isolation and secondary contact.

AB As phylogenomics focuses on comprehensive taxon sampling at the species and population/subspecies levels, incorporating genomic data from historical specimens has become increasingly common. While historical samples can fill critical gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary history of diverse groups, they also introduce additional sources of phylogenomic uncertainty, making it difficult to discern novel evolutionary relationships from artifacts caused by sample quality issues. These problems highlight the need for improved strategies to disentangle artifactual patterns from true biological signal as historical specimens become more prevalent in phylogenomic datasets. Here, we tested the limits of historical specimen-driven phylogenomics to resolve subspecies-level relationships within a highly polytypic family, the New World quails (Odontophoridae), using thousands of ultraconserved elements (UCEs). We found that relationships at and above the species-level were well-resolved and highly supported across all analyses, with the exception of discordant relationships within the two most polytypic genera which included many historical specimens. We examined the causes of discordance and found that inferring phylogenies from subsets of taxa resolved the disagreements, suggesting that analyzing subclades can help remove artifactual causes of discordance in datasets that include historical samples. At the subspecies-level, we found well-resolved geographic structure within the two most polytypic genera, including the most polytypic species in this family, Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), demonstrating that variable sites within UCEs are capable of resolving phylogenetic structure below the species level. Our results highlight the importance of complete taxonomic sampling for resolving relationships among polytypic species, often through the inclusion of historical specimens, and we propose an integrative strategy for understanding and addressing the uncertainty that historical samples sometimes introduce to phylogenetic analyses.

AB Grazing considerably affects ecosystem nutrient cycling and element stoichiometry at the regional and global levels according to synthesized studies. However, the effects of grazing, especially its intensity, on the plant litter decomposition stage of key processes in biogeochemical cycles are not clearly understood. Here, a meta-analysis of 65 published papers was undertaken to examine the responses of eight variables associated with litter decomposition to grazing or grazing intensity. We also explored whether experimental and environmental factors altered the effects of grazing on litter decomposition. Our results indicated that grazing significantly promoted litter decomposition when all the data was averaged, and that the magnitude of its effects on litter decomposition became weaker as grazing intensity increased. Grazing did not affect mixed root litter decomposition, but increased single root litter decomposition, and light grazing had a stronger positive effect. Specifically, grazing significantly accelerated litter C and P release, and significantly increased single N release by single aboveground litter, but not root or mixed aboveground litter. In addition, environmental factors (e.g., elevation, and mean annual precipitation) and experimental factors (e.g., experiment duration and litterbag size) affected the litter decomposition responses to grazing. These results suggest that the effects of grazing on litter decomposition and nutrient release depend on grazing intensity, litter type, and plant organs. Grazing alters terrestrial plant litter decomposition and grazing intensity plays an important role in regulating the magnitude of the effect during litter decomposition and nutrient cycling.

AB Insect herbivores have the potential to consume large amounts of plant tissue in tropical forests, but insectivorous vertebrates effectively control their abundances, indirectly increasing plant fitness accordingly. Despite several studies already sought understanding of the top-down effects on arthropod community structure and herbivory, such studies of trophic cascades in old tropics are underrepresented, and little attention was paid to top-down forces in various habitats. Therefore, we examine how flying insectivorous vertebrates (birds and bats) impact arthropods and, consequently, affect herbivore damage of leaves in forest habitats in Papua New Guinea. In a 3-month long predator exclosure experiment conducted at four study sites across varying elevation and successional stage, we found that vertebrate predators reduced arthropod density by similar to 52%. In addition, vertebrate predators decreased the mean body size of arthropods by 26% in leaf chewers and 47% in non-herbivorous arthropods but had only a small effect on mesopredators and sap suckers. Overall, the exclusion of vertebrate predators resulted in a similar to 41% increase in leaf damage. Our results, across different types of tropical forests in Papua New Guinea, demonstrate that flying vertebrate insectivores have a crucial impact on plant biomass, create a selective pressure on larger and non-predatory prey individuals and they prey partition with mesopredators.

AB Plant defense against herbivores is multidimensional, and investment into different defense traits is intertwined due to genetic, physiological, and ecological costs. This relationship is expected to generate a trade-off between direct defense and tolerance that is underlain by resource availability, with increasing resources being associated with increased investment in tolerance and decreased investment in direct resistance. We tested these predictions across populations of the shrub Artemisia californica by growing plants sourced from a latitudinal aridity gradient within common gardens located at the southern (xeric) and northern (mesic) portions of its distribution. We measured plant growth rate, resistance via a damage survey, and tolerance to herbivory by experimentally simulating vertebrate herbivory. Plants from more northern (vs. southern) environments were less resistant (received higher percent damage by vertebrate herbivores) and tended to be more tolerant (marginally significant) with respect to change in biomass measured 12 months after simulated vertebrate herbivory. Also, putative growth and defense traits paralleled patterns of resistance and tolerance, such that leaves from northern populations contained lower concentrations of terpenes and increased N, specific leaf area, and % water. Last, plant growth rate did not demonstrate clear clinal patterns, as northern populations (vs. southern populations) grew more slowly in the southern (xeric) garden, but there was no clinal relationship detected in the northern (mesic) garden. Overall, our findings support the prediction of lower resistance and higher tolerance in plant populations adapted to more resource-rich, mesic environments, but this trade-off was not associated with concomitant trade-offs in growth rate. These findings ultimately suggest that plant adaptation to resource availability and herbivory can shape intraspecific variation in multivariate plant defenses.

AB Tropical montane cloud forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems, in central Veracruz, Mexico. Within this ecosystem, terrestrial orchids are strongly dependent on forest conditions and may be sensitive to environmental change. We applied field surveys of abiotic and biotic factors associated with the presence of the terrestrial orchid Cyclopogon luteo-albus and combined this with correlative niche modeling approaches to evaluate its potential distribution under two different environmental sets and two different extents. Layers of environmental information were obtained from Landsat imagery and interpolated bioclimatic and soil property layers. Existing species records were used as training data by sampling five forest fragments in central Veracruz, utilizing herbarium and global biodiversity information facility databases. The resulting predictions were tested by sampling at 15 sites of potential distribution. The model predicted the presence of C. luteo-albus with a reliability of 80%. The most important variables of models derived from interpolated layers coincide with site-relevant parameters suggesting the utility of these tools to further explore species suitabilities at larger geographic extents. Potential distribution mapping is an important tool to identify key areas for conservation and priority areas for future studies of species and partially resolves the lack of records of many orchid species.

AB Sacred groves (SGs) play an important role in the conservation of local biodiversity and provide numerous ecosystem services worldwide. We studied how the ecological status of Central Indian SGs contributes to regional tree diversity and carbon (C) storage. We inventoried the trees in fifty-nine SGs of Madhya Pradesh and recorded a total of 109 tree species (90 genera, 40 families). The most species-rich families were Fabaceae, Combretaceae, Malvaceae, and Moraceae. The tree density ranged from 75 to 925 individuals ha(-1) (mean: 398 +/- 32 individuals ha(-1)), while basal area varied from 2.5 to 69.2 m(2) ha(-1) (mean: 24.2 +/- 1.9 m(2) ha(-1)). The total C stock {tree C + soil organic C (SOC; 0-30 cm)} ranged from 44.7 to 455.4 Mg C ha(-1) (mean: 153.8 +/- 9.6 Mg C ha(-1)) across the SGs. The studied SGs represented 74.7% of the total tree diversity and contained 33.1% higher total C stock than the forests of the state. Tree C stock was significantly positively correlated with tree basal area, distance from the nearest village, and number of years of existence. The present study highlights the crucial role of SGs in sustaining regional biodiversity and storing C in biomass and soil. Continued conservation efforts and contained interventions by people are necessary in order to maintain the current role of these SGs as biodiversity and carbon reservoirs of Central India.

AB The present study illustrates the shell utilization and resource partitioning of two sympatric hermit crab species Clibanarius rhabdodactylus and Clibanarius ransoni with reference to gastropod shell species (shell shape), shell size and shell availability. Specimens were collected from January to March 2021 and hermit crab weight and shield length were measured. The gender of occupant hermit crab was identified and categorised into male, non-ovigerous female and ovigerous female. Gastropod shells were identified and different morphological parameters like shell length, shell aperture length and width, shell volume and dry weight were measured. The population of C. rhabdodactylus and C. ransoni was female biased with male: female ratio being 1:1.93 and 1:1.25 respectively. Clibanarius rhabdodactylus and C. ransoni were occupying 29 species and 28 species of gastropod shells respectively among which > 75% occupied shells were comprised of Cerithium caeruleum, Lunella coronata, Turbo bruneus, Tenguella granulate and Pollia undosa. Both the Clibanarius species were showing a high overlap in their intertidal distribution as well as gastropod shell use pattern. Cerithium caeruleum was found to occur in high abundance as compared to other gastropod species in the study area which may also influence the shell utilization of hermit crab species. Males and non-ovigerous females of the hermit crab species utilized almost all shell species, while ovigerous females used only a few shell species. Significant relationship was observed between different morphological parameters of the occupant crab species and occupied shells. Shell partitioning was evident between hermit crab sexes as well as reproductive stages on the basis of occupied shells of different species, shapes, and sizes. The present study revealed shell occupation pattern of C. rhabdodactylus and C. ransoni is highly influenced by the diversity, morphology and availability of gastropod shells in the study area.

AB Aims Plant-plant interactions are determined by resource availability. However, its responses to differences in soil phosphorus (P) and water and the rhizospheric driving mechanism have not been systematically revealed. Methods A pot-culture experiment was conducted in monoculture and in mixture with maize and grass pea. Resource stress treatments were created by organic and inorganic P applications (phytate and KH2PO4) as well as drought and well-watered treatments to address the above issue. Results Intercropping increased system yield and biomass by 3.5% and 4.5% on average in soils with sufficient P and water, and by 12.0% and 11.7% under stressful conditions respectively. With increasing water and P availability, the yield-based interaction types transited from mutually facilitated to maize facilitated with grass pea as facilitator. Comparatively, the biomass-based facilitation shifting from maize facilitated and grass pea neutral to both being facilitated with increasing stress. This shift was probably mediated by complementary use of soil water in the two species, and rhizospheric acidification in grass pea. Also, rhizospheric interactions promoted phosphatase secretion by 5.3-22.2%, and mobilized organic P to buffer P limitation under P-deficient soils. Regardless of crop species, reproductive and vegetative biomass fell into a typical allometric pattern (alpha > 1). The rhizospheric interactions drove the differentiated biomass allocation patterns and the species-specific interaction transition. Conclusion High P and water environments intensified the asymmetric interspecific competition. The trait-dependent facilitation shift was mechanically driven by rhizospheric interaction in intercropping systems. The findings update the understanding on stress gradient hypothesis in a modified model.

AB The role plant diversity has played in regulating insect communities has been of interest for decades. Recent syntheses from agroecosystems suggest increasing plant diversity can positively affect beneficial insects like predators, reducing pest pressure and increasing yield. However, the agricultural landscape of the Midwestern United States is dominated by just two crops-corn and soybean-which cover approximately 180 million acres of arable land yearly. New ideas to conserve wildlife that additionally provide economic opportunities for farmers must be developed in order to promote sustainable and resilient ecosystems. Here we tested the capacity of an alternative cropping system to support more diverse insect populations than conventional cropping systems. We quantified differences in the diversity of an insect taxon, ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), over an annual cycle using pitfall traps in thirty-two 2-m(2) plots of either woody perennial polycultures that contained apples, chestnuts, currants, hazelnuts, and raspberries or conventional corn-soybean rotations. In doing so, we found that woody perennial polycultures supported 2.4-fold more ant species and maintained a unique fauna of specialist and predatory ants. The observed differences in diversity were linked to higher levels of predation as 18.2-fold more sentinel prey were consumed during each month of the growing season. Combined, our results suggest that agricultural landscapes in the Midwestern United States can be modified to support important beneficial insects like ants while still producing commodities that can be economically beneficial to farmers.

AB The Cerrado-Amazon transition (CAT) is located between the two largest biogeographic domains of the Neotropical region, coinciding with the "Arc of Deforestation", an agricultural frontier that expands towards the Amazon. Fire plays an important role in the landscape changes that have been occurring in this transition. Thus, the objectives of this study were (i) evaluate the accuracy of different algorithms/techniques in predicting fires in the CAT; (ii) investigate the season of highest fire probabilities in the CAT; and (iii) identify, among anthropic, climatic, topographic and soil variables, the main drivers of fires spatial distribution in the CAT. Fire occurrence data (active fire pixels) from the MODIS sensor were used as input data in species distribution models. The SDM allowed the construction of monthly fire probability models for the study area. The model's quality was assessed by R-squared, RMSE, AUC and TSS metrics. In addition, we assessed the weight of variables in building the models. To obtain the fire seasonality, we used the bootstrap technique to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) about the mean. As result, we found that all algorithms obtained satisfactory performance, as well as the ensemble model technique used, which obtained an average AUC of 0.812 +/- 0.001. The algorithm with the best individual performance was Random Forest, with a mean AUC 0.851 +/- 0.002. Similar patterns were found when considering TSS metrics. The predicted and observed fire occurrences showed strong association (R-2 = 0.81). The high fire probability area was higher during the dry season (15304.37 +/- 41.65), showing a significant difference (p-value <= 0.05) from the rainy season. The variables that most explained the fire occurrences along the CAT were 'Silt Fraction', 'Distance from Agriculture' and 'Maximum Temperature'. In addition, 'Distance from Roads', 'Distance from Protected Areas' and Elevation' were relevant for the monthly models. Anthropogenic variables were more important during the dry season. The results demonstrate that SDMs can be adequately used in fire prediction. Protected areas have shown an important role in acting as a fire barrier. However, many of these areas are vulnerable, surrounded by high fire probabilities during the dry season, predominantly anthropic, putting the natural dynamics of fire in the region and the local biodiversity at risk. Our approach can be useful in environmental protection and monitoring, in addition to facilitating the understanding about the CAT ecological complexity and the high anthropogenic pressure happening there.

AB Second-growth forests (SGF) are critical components for limiting biodiversity loss and climate change mitigation. However, these forests were established after anthropic disturbances such as land use for planting, and in highly human-modified landscapes. These interventions can decrease the ability of biological communities to recover naturally, and it is necessary to understand how multiple drivers, from local scale to landscape scale influence the diversity and carbon stock of these forests in natural regeneration. For this, we used data from 37 SGF growing on areas previously used for eucalyptus plantations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, after the last cut cycle. For each SGF, the forest tree species diversity was calculated based on the Hills number, and we also calculated the aboveground carbon stock. Then, we evaluated the influence of multiple environmental factors on these indexes: soil properties, past-management intensity, patch configuration, and landscape composition. Little influence of soil properties was found, only soil fertility negatively influenced above-ground carbon stock. However, pastmanagement intensity negatively influenced tree species diversity and carbon stock. The isolation of other forests and tree species propagules source distance (>500 ha) also negatively influenced the diversity of species. This is probably due to the favoring of tree pioneer species in highly human-modified landscapes because they are more tolerant of environmental changes, less dependent on animal dispersal, and have low carbon stock capacity. Thus, areas with higher past-management intensity and more isolated areas are less effective for passive restoration and may require intervention to recover tree diversity and carbon stock in the Atlantic Forest. The approach, which had not yet been applied in the Atlantic Forest, brought similar results to that found in other forests, and serves as a theoretical basis for choosing priority areas for passive restoration in the biome.

AB The Humboldt Current Marine Ecosystem (HCE) is one of the most productive areas in the global ocean, but current anthropogenic stressors, particularly overfishing, pose a significant threat to marine biodiversity. Moreover, the limited time scale of modern assessments may underestimate the magnitude of human alterations to marine biodiversity. Here we use the rich Quaternary fossil record present along the HCE coast, encompassing the last ca. 500 kyr, to build a baseline to evaluate the impact of human activities on the diversity of mollusk assemblages. We compiled an extensive database of >13,000 occurrences and ca. 370,000 individuals of 164 species of gastropods and bivalves from modern and fossiliferous outcrops from southern Peru to northern Chile (15-30 degrees S). We tested for changes in coverage-based species richness, species dominance, species composition (Chao dissimilarity, unweighted and weighted by abundance), and the relative abundance (i.e., the proportion of individuals) of species exploited by the artisanal fisheries. Comparisons between fossil and modern assemblages were carried out at different scales of spatial aggregation to buffer against inherent differences in spatial and temporal averaging. Species composition shows remarkable stability in fossil assemblages, from Middle Pleistocene to Holocene, at most scales of spatial aggregation. Modern assemblages showed drastic alterations compared to fossil counterparts when analyses considered spatial aggregation scales, i.e., significant changes in species composition, and a 3 to 6-fold reduction in the relative abundance of exploited species, but not changes in species richness and dominance. Results suggest that contemporaneous anthropogenic activities disrupted a long-term stability in the species composition. The diversity of modern mollusk assemblages is unseen in the past 500 kyr and seems deeply perturbated by overfishing. Our synthesis sets the foundations for a conservation paleobiology approach to robustly understand the impacts of anthropogenic stressors at the HCE.

AB Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) is an invasive tramp ant species that has been transported globally since [at least] the early twentieth century. It is often claimed that despite the negative impacts associated with this species and its listing among the world's worst invasive species, very little research attention has been paid to W. auropuntata. Although the need for future research exists, there is currently a considerable body of research from around the world and spanning back to the 1920's on this species. Here we synthesize over 200 peer reviewed research manuscripts, book chapters, conference presentations, and media reports of new distributions spanning 1929-2022 culminating in a comprehensive literature review on W. auropunctata. This review covers all current knowledge on this species and is intended to serve as a quick reference for future research and provide the reference resources for those seeking more in-depth information on specific topics. Topics included in this review include taxonomic identification, current global distribution and pathways, life history, impacts, detection, and control. We discuss where consensus and ambiguity currently lie within the research community, identify contextual considerations for future researchers when interpreting data, and suggest where we believe more research or clarifications are needed.

AB Under the Ecosystem Exploitation Hypothesis ecosystem productivity predicts trophic complexity, but it is unclear if spatial and temporal drivers of productivity have similar impacts. Long-term studies are necessary to capture temporal impacts on trophic structure in variable ecosystems such as deserts. We sampled ants and measured plant resources in the Simpson Desert, central Australia over a 22-year period, during which rainfall varied 10-fold. We sampled dune swales (higher nutrient) and crests (lower nutrient) to account for spatial variation in productivity. We asked how temporal and spatial variation in productivity affects the abundance of ant trophic guilds. Precipitation increased vegetation cover, with the difference more pronounced on dune crests; seeding and flowering also increased with precipitation. Generalist activity increased over time, irrespective of productivity. Predators were more active in more productive (swale) habitat, i.e. spatial impacts of productivity were greatest at the highest trophic level. By contrast, herbivores (seed harvesters and sugar feeders) increased with long-term rainfall; seed harvesters also increased as seeding increased. Temporal impacts of productivity were therefore greatest for low trophic levels. Whether productivity variation leads to top-down or bottom-up structured ecosystems thus depends on the scale and dimension (spatial or temporal) of productivity.

AB Heavy metal remediation treatments might influence functional microbial community assembly. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) contributes to the nitrogen retention processes in soil ecosystems. We assumed that re mediation might reduce heavy metal toxicity and increase some available nutrients for the DNRA microbes, thus balancing the deterministic and stochastic process for DNRA community assembly. Here, we investigated the process of DNRA bacterial community assembly under different heavy metal remediation treatments (including control, biochar, limestone, rice straw, rice straw + limestone, and biochar + limestone) in an Alfisol soil. The abundance of DNRA bacteria diverged across treatments. The alpha-diversity of the DNRA bacterial community was correlated with pH, available phosphorus (AP), ammonium (NH4+), and extractable Fe (EFe). Metal Cd and Fe significantly affected the abundance of the nrfA gene. The beta-diversity was associated with pH, NH4+, and EFe. Deterministic processes dominantly drove the assembly processes of the DNRA bacterial community. NH4+ level played an essential role in the assembly processes than the other soil physicochemical properties and metal availability. High, moderate, and low levels of NH4+ could advocate stochastic process plus selection, heterogeneous selection to stochastic process, and heterogeneous selection, respectively. Network analysis highlighted a predominant role of NH4+ in regulating DNRA bacterial community assembly. However, the relative abundance of modules and some keystone species also were influenced by pH and EFe, respectively. Therefore, the DNRA bacterial community assembly under different heavy metal remediation treatments in this study was dominantly driven by nitrogen availability. pH, phosphorus, and metal availability were auxiliary regulators on DNRA bacterial community.

AB An important mechanism promoting species coexistence is conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), which inhibits conspecific neighbors by accumulating host-specific enemies near adult trees. Natural enemies may be genotype-specific and regulate offspring dynamics more strongly than non-offspring, which is often neglected due to the difficulty in ascertaining genetic relatedness. Here, we investigated whether offspring and non-offspring of a dominant species, Castanopsis eyrei, suffered from different strength of CNDD based on parentage assignment in a subtropical forest. We found decreased recruitment efficiency (proxy of survival probability) of offspring compared with non-offspring near adult trees during the seedling-sapling transition, suggesting genotype-dependent interactions drive tree demographic dynamics. Furthermore, the genetic similarity between individuals of same cohort decreased in late life history stages, indicating genetic-relatedness-dependent tree mortality throughout ontogeny. Our results demonstrate that within-species genetic relatedness significantly affects the strength of CNDD, implying genotype-specific natural enemies may contribute to population dynamics in natural forests.

AB Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) mediate plant survival when the plant's carbon (C) balance is negative, suggesting that NSCs could predict plant survival under C stress. To examine this possibility, we exposed saplings of six temperate tree species to diverse levels of C stress created by the combination of two light conditions (full light availability and deep shade) and two defoliation levels (severe defoliation and nondefoliation). We then measured survival, biomass and total NSCs and soluble sugars (SSs) concentrations in different organs of both dead and live saplings. We estimated mean NSCs and SSs contents and concentrations per sapling and fitted logistic generalized mixed-effects models to determine if NSCs and SSs predict survival. Using inverse prediction modelling, we also determined whether there is a common NSCs and SSs threshold across species at the time of sapling's death. Defoliation and shade reduced the mean sapling's NSCs and SSs contents, indicating C stress. Mean sapling NSCs and SSs contents and concentrations predicted survival and the robustness of the models improved with the inclusion of species. At death, saplings of the exotic deciduous tree species Acer pseudoplatanus exhibited significantly lower mean NSCs and SSs contents than saplings of the evergreen conifer species Podocarpus nubigenus and lower stem NSCs and SSs concentrations than the broadleaf evergreen species Drimys winteri. The energetic role that NSCs and SSs play in plants under C stress was evidenced by the capacity of these compounds to predict sapling survival under C stress. No common threshold of NSCs and SSs contents or concentrations for sapling survival amongst species was found, indicating that the level of these compounds may not be good proxies for interspecific comparisons of tolerance to C stress. Presumably, there are species-specific limits for the mobilization and use of NSCs and SSs in metabolism. Our results anticipate that the inclusion of NSCs and SSs in modelling will improve predictions regarding tree responses to ongoing climate change. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the many roles that carbohydrates play in plant survival under C stress is required to scale predictions up to the community level.

AB The contribution of sapling banks to the coexistence of species with different shade tolerance under the "wave regeneration" regime has not been researched extensively. This study first assessed spatial and temporal variations in the relative dominance of two Abies species, Abies veitchii and Abies mariesii, with different shade tolerance in a wave-regenerated forest. Second, we present the age structure and its spatial variation in young Abies stands (sapling stage) to exhibit the prevalence and variability of regeneration from sapling banks (defined as trees established 10 years before canopy opening). The relative dominance of A. mariesii, the more shade-tolerant species, compared to that of A. veitchii, did not change over a period of 10 years, irrespective of stand developmental stages, indicating the importance of initial dominance in determining the local species composition. The tree ages at the sapling stage were significantly higher for A. mariesii than for A. veitchii. Approximately, 30% of all trees were likely to arise from a sapling bank, and 86% of them were A. mariesii. Age structure significantly varied between 5 x 5 m quadrats; some quadrats were dominated by A. mariesii originating from sapling banks, while others were dominated by A. veitchii that were established at the time of canopy opening. These results indicate that regeneration from sapling banks contributes to the dominance of A. mariesii and that the spatial variation in the abundance of trees originating from sapling banks is essential for the coexistence of A. mariesii with A. veitchii.

AB Historically, ecosystem models have treated rainfall as the primary moisture source driving litter decomposition. In many arid and semi-arid lands, however, non-rainfall moisture (fog, dew, and water vapor) plays a more important role in supporting microbial activity and carbon turnover. To date though, we lack a robust approach for modeling the role of non-rainfall moisture in litter decomposition. We developed a series of simple litter decay models with different moisture sensitivity and temperature sensitivity functions to explicitly represent the role of non-rainfall moisture in the litter decay process. To evaluate model performance, we conducted a 30-month litter decomposition study at 6 sites along a fog and dew gradient in the Namib desert, spanning almost an eightfold difference in non-rainfall moisture frequency. Litter decay rates in the field correlated with fog and dew frequencies but not with rainfall. Including either temperature or non-rainfall moisture sensitivity functions improved model performance, but the combination of temperature and moisture sensitivity together provided more realistic estimates of litter decomposition than relying on either alone. Model performance was similar regardless of whether we used continuous moisture sensitivity functions based on relative humidity or a simple binary function based on the presence of moisture, although a Gaussian temperature sensitivity outperformed a monotonically increasing Q(10) temperature function. We demonstrate that explicitly modeling non-rainfall moisture and temperature together is necessary to accurately capture litter decay dynamics in a fog-affected dryland system and provide suggestions for how to incorporate non-rainfall moisture into existing Earth system models.

AB Trees regenerating in the understory respond to increased availability of light caused by gap formation by undergoing a range of morphological and physiological adjustments. These adjustments include the production of thick, sun-type leaves containing thicker mesophyll and longer palisade cells than in shade-type leaves. We asked whether in the shade-regenerating tree Acer pseudoplatanus, the increase in leaf thickness and expansion of leaf tissues are possible also in leaves that are already fully formed, a response reported so far only for a handful of species. We acclimated potted seedlings to eight levels (from 1 to 100%) of solar irradiance and, in late summer, transferred a subset of them to full sunlight. Within 30 days, the pre-shaded leaves increased leaf mass per area and became thicker mostly due to the elongation of palisade cells, except for the most shaded individuals which suffered irreversible photo-oxidative damage. This anatomical acclimation was accompanied by a transient decline in photosynthetic efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-M), the magnitude of which was related to the degree of pre-shading. The F-v/F-M recovered substantially within the re-acclimation period. However, leaves of transferred plants were shed earlier in the fall, indicating that the acclimation was not fully effective. These results show that A. pseudoplatanus is one of the few known species in which mature leaves may re-acclimate anatomically to increased irradiance. This may be an important mechanism enhancing utilization of gaps created during the growing season.

AB Selection through pollinators plays a major role in the evolution of reproductive traits. However, herbivory can also induce changes in plant sexual expression and sexual systems, potentially influencing conditions governing transitions between sexual systems. Previous work has shown that herbivory has a strong effect on sex allocation in the wind-pollinated annual plant Mercurialis annua, likely via responses to resource loss. It is also known that many plants respond to herbivory by inducing signaling, and endogenous responses to it, via the plant hormone jasmonate. Here, we attempt to uncouple the effects of herbivory on sex allocation in M. annua through resource limitation (tissue loss) versus plant responses to jasmonate hormone signaling. We used a two-factorial experiment with four treatment combinations: control, herbivory (25% chronic tissue loss), jasmonate, and combined herbivory and jasmonate. We estimated the effects of tissue loss and defense-inducing hormones on reproductive allocation, male reproductive effort, and sex allocation. Tissue loss caused plants to reduce their male reproductive effort, resulting in changes in total sex allocation. However, application of jasmonate after herbivory reversed its effect on male investment. Our results show that herbivory has consequences on plant sex expression and sex allocation, and that defense-related hormones such as jasmonate can buffer the impacts. We discuss the physiological mechanisms that might underpin the effects of herbivory on sex allocation, and their potential implications for the evolution of plant sexual systems.

AB Questions Arid communities are strongly limited by soil resources including water and nitrogen (N). Plants compete for N with other plants and microorganisms, which are also limited by carbon (C). We propose that above- and below-ground plant responses to soil resources are modulated by community structure (species relative abundances, "mass ratio hypothesis") and species traits (relative growth rates - RGRs). We evaluated the single and combined effects of soil N and C addition on the above- and below-ground biomass accumulation of perennial grass patches in an arid community, and the mechanisms involved in their responses. Location Patagonian steppe, Argentina. Methods We added N (2 g N m(-2); NH4NO3) and C (330 g C m(-2); sucrose) to 1-m(2) field plots in a factorial design. After two years, we harvested above-ground (n = 5 plots) and below-ground biomass (n = 10 soil cores) and sorted it by species. We measured potential soil respiration as a proxy of microbial activity. Results Total above-ground biomass increased by 55% as a result of N and decreased by 45% as a result of C addition, in relation to controls. C addition reduced total below-ground biomass by 42%. The above-ground differences were associated with changes in the biomass of dominant species according to their RGRs. Poa ligularis (dominant, high RGR) increased by 92% as a result of N addition while Pappostipa speciosa (dominant, low RGR) decreased by 55% as a result of C addition. Intermediate and subordinate grasses did not modify their biomass, independently of their RGR. Potential soil respiration was three times higher in plots with C addition than in control plots. Conclusions Community biomass was explained by a combination of mass ratio hypothesis and specific RGR, as dominant grasses controlled above-ground community responses to N (high-RGR species) and C addition (low-RGR species). Our findings highlight the independence between the above- and below-ground processes and the importance of considering community equitability and species characteristics to predict plant community responses to changes in soil resources.

AB Plant interactions have long been the subject of intense research and debate in ecology. Competition and facilitation are known to be the basic drivers of community structure, species coexistence, and forest succession dynamics; however, there remains a lack of understanding of how spatial patterns affect these in the mixed forest community of coniferous and broad-leaved species. In the present study, we studied the roles of competition and facilitation in a mixed forest community in the Zhejiang Province, China. For this, we divided plants measured at a study site according to the size of the diameter at breast height (DBH) into three levels of saplings as follows: saplings (1 cm <= DBH < 5 cm), juveniles (5 cm <= DBH < 15 cm), and adults (DBH >= 15 cm). We used the spatial point pattern method to explore the raw number, spatial distribution, and both intra- and inter-specific correlations of coniferous and broad-leaved species at these different diameter levels. The corresponding findings were as follows. First, the DBH and structure of coniferous and broad-leaved species were similar, showing a distinct distribution in an inverted "J" shape as the number of individuals with a particular diameter declined as DBH increased. Second, when all individuals of a similar diameter range were pooled, coniferous species were clustered at all size scales; however, in this situation, broad-leaved species (evergreen and deciduous) showed a clumped distribution at small scales, and this decreased as spatial scale increased. Third, there were small, but significant positive correlations between large-diameter trees and small-diameter trees of coniferous species and between evergreen broad-leaved species at different diameter levels; however, as the scale increased, the correlation diminished. On any scale, individual deciduous broad-leaved species at different diameter ranges did not have any significant correlation. Fourth, coniferous species had a strong competitive effect on broad-leaved species, and there was a weak promoting effect between deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved species as well. In summary, different tree species occupy similar living spaces, and through competition and facilitation, regulate the spatial pattern and community stability of coniferous and broad-leaved species in mixed forest communities.

AB Due to the increasing pressure on the environment from human activities, there is a growing need to understand the relationship between species and the environment. Therefore, this study constructs life cycle and niche from a geographic perspective, aiming to explain how existing spatial configurations affect the deterioration of coastal ecosystems. This research mainly adopts the method of literature analysis and field investigation, and then carries out four steps of reading, sorting, integration and analysis. In this study, the road kill data and living environment data of land crabs were integrated, and two results were obtained on the relationship between spatial conflict areas and land crab populations. The first is that the life cycle of land crabs is disturbed by TPH 26, thus confirming the spatial conflict hypothesis; the peak period of traffic flow at TPH 26 overlapped with the peak period of land crab larvae release, indicating that the spatial configuration of the reserve is not only a spatial conflict, but also a spatial-temporal conflict. Second, the land crab is an important indicator of coastal forests, and its niche also reflects geographic diversity, especially in features such as topographic structure, geological stability, and environmental humidity.

AB The Quercus wutaishanica forest influences the ecological environment and climate characteristics and plays an important ecological role in the Loess Plateau region. However, we still know relatively little about the genetic diversity and spatial distribution of Q. wutaishanica. Here, we assessed the genetic diversity of Q. wutaishanica using simple sequence repeats and used the point pattern method to analyze the spatial distribution patterns as well as intraspecific relationships. Our results indicate that the diameter structure of the Q. wutaishanica population was inverted J-type, showing a growing population. In addition, the population maintained high genetic diversity on a small scale. Due to dispersal constraints, the spatial distribution pattern of Q. wutaishanica seedlings (DBH < 1 cm) tended to aggregate at small scales and the degree of aggregation decreased with increasing spatial scale. However, trees (DBH > 5 cm) and saplings (1 cm <= DBH < 5 cm) showed more random distribution at the scale, indicating that Q. wutaishanica individuals shift from aggregation to random distribution at the spatial scale. In addition, although individuals of different diameter classes showed facilitative (trees vs. saplings, 5-6.5 m) and competitive effects (trees vs. seedlings, 13.5-16 m) on some scales, they showed no correlation on other scales, especially for saplings and seedlings, where they were not correlated on any scale. The results contribute to revealing the status and dynamics of Q. wutaishanica in the Loess Plateau, thereby providing a theoretical basis for further study on the maintenance mechanism of the population.

AB Secondary forests, i.e., those arising after the clearance and abandonment of previously forested land, dominate tropical forest landscapes, rapidly sequester carbon, provide essential ecosystem services and are prone to re-clearance. Secondary cloud forests (SCF) play a particularly critical role for biodiversity and hydrological regulation. To promote their persistence, sustainable management is necessary; however, there is limited information regarding SCF potential for sustainable timber production. We estimated the revenue from selective timber harvesting in a pilot study in a 20-year-old SCF in Mexico. We explored the effect of the harvested timber volume, harvesting costs and price of forest products on the Net Present Value (NPV). Small landowners could only extract 17% of the harvestable standing volume due to a high number of small trees, a high (34%) volume of non-timber species, and their limited capacity to process timber. A third of the income derived from fuelwood, and overall financial returns were negative. A positive NPV may result from a 20% harvesting intensity, a 10% reduction in harvesting costs, or a 20% increase in stumpage price. Our results warrant the development of forest policy instruments and economic incentives for small-scale SCF landowners to alleviate poverty and meet national and global restoration and climate mitigation goals.

AB Big trees and abundant species dominate forest structure and composition. As a result, their spatial distribution and interactions with other species and individuals may contribute disproportionately to the emergence of spatial heterogeneity in richness patterns. We tested scale-dependent spatial patterning and species richness structures to understand the role of individual trees (big trees) and species (abundant species) in driving spatial richness patterns on a 25 ha plot in a diverse tropical forest of Australia. The individual species area relationship (ISAR) was used to assess species richness in neighborhoods ranging from 1 to 50 m radii around all big trees (>= 70 cm dbh, n = 296) and all species with more than 100 individuals in the plot (n = 53). A crossed ISAR function was also used to compute species richness around big trees for trees of different size classes. Big individuals exert some spatial structuring on other big and mid-sized trees in local neighborhoods (up to 30 m and 16 m respectively), but not on small trees. While most abundant species were neutral with respect to richness patterns, we identified consistent species-specific signatures on spatial patterns of richness for 14 of the 53 species. Seven species consistently had higher than expected species richness in their neighborhood (species "accumulators"), and seven had lower than expected (species "repellers") across all spatial scales. Common traits of accumulators and repeller species suggest that niche partitioning along disturbance gradients is a primary mechanism driving spatial richness patterns, which is then manifested in large-scale spatial heterogeneity in species distributions across the plot.

AB Understanding how forest fragment size, topography, forest structure, and soil properties affect plant diversity remains a crucial question in conservation biology, with ferns often being understudied. To address this knowledge gap, we surveyed the abundance, species richness, and composition of ferns in a tropical landscape in south China using 75 sites in 42 forest fragments. We then used a multi-model inference approach to assess whether fern abundance, richness, and composition were better explained by (a) fragment size, (b) topography (slope, aspect), (c) forest structure (tree basal area, light availability), or (d) soil properties (pH, Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Calcium, Magnesium, water availability, and proportion of clay, silt, and sand). We also conducted a nestedness analysis to examine whether the composition of the fern communities in smaller fragments (0.4-1 km(2)) differed or represented a subset of the communities found in larger fragments (e.g., >10 km(2)). We found that (a) fern abundance was mostly influenced by soil properties, slope, and aspect, (b) fern species richness by soil properties and slope, and (c) fern species composition by forest structure, specifically, tree basal area. We also found that fern species composition was not nested in the landscape, suggesting that smaller forest fragments had different communities from larger fragments. Our results suggest also that soil properties play an important role in maintaining fern abundance and diversity and therefore protecting soil can help conserve ferns in fragmented landscapes.

AB The biotic interaction hypothesis, which states the species interaction becomes stronger in the tropics, is deeply rooted in classic ecological literature and widely accepted to contribute to the latitudinal gradients of biodiversity. Tests in latitudinal insect-plant interaction have emphasized leaf-eating insects on a single or a few plant species rather than within an entire community and mixed accumulating evidence, leaving the biotic interaction hypothesis disputed. We aimed to test the hypothesis by quantifying insect seed predation in a pair of tropical and temperate forest communities with similar elevations. We applied a consistent study design to sample predispersal seeds with systematically set seed traps in 2019-2020 and examined internally feeding insects. The intensity of seed predation was measured and further applied to tropical versus temperate comparison at two levels (cross-species and community-wide). Our results showed every latitudinal pattern associated with different study levels and years, that is, negative (greater granivory in the tropics in community-wide comparison in 2020), positive (less granivory in the tropics in community-wide and cross-species comparison in 2019), and missing (similar level of granivory in the tropics in cross-species comparisons in 2020). The cross-species level analyses ignore differences among species in seed production and weaken or even lose the latitudinal trend detected by community-wide comparisons. The between-year discrepancy in tropical-temperate comparisons relates to the highly variable annual seed composition in the temperate forest due to mast seeding of dominant species. Our study highlights that long-term community-level researches across biomes are essential to assess the latitudinal biotic interaction hypothesis.

AB Vegetation is a key biosphere component to supporting biodiversity on Earth, and its maintenance and proper functioning are essential to guarantee the well-being of humankind. From a broad perspective, a fundamental goal of vegetation ecology is to understand the roles of abiotic and biotic factors that affect vegetation floristic composition, structure, distribution, diversity, and functioning, considering the relevant spatial and temporal scales. In this contribution, we reflect on the difficulties and opportunities to accomplish this grand objective by reviewing recent advances in the main areas of vegetation ecology. We highlight theoretical and methodological challenges and point to alternatives to overcome them. Our hope is that this contribution will motivate the development of future research efforts that will strengthen the field of vegetation ecology. Ultimately, vegetation science will continue to provide a strong knowledge basis and multiple theoretical and technological tools to better face the current global environmental crisis and to address the urgent need to conserve, use, and restore sustainably the vegetation cover of our planet in the Anthropocene.

AB Neutral-theory-based stochastic and niche-theory-based determinative processes are commonly used to explain the mechanisms of natural community assembly. However, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the relative importance of different ecological processes in shaping forest communities. Functional traits and phylogeny provide important information about plant environmental adaptation strategies and evolutionary history and promise a better mechanistic and predictive understanding of community assembly. Based on nine leaf functional traits and phylogenetic data of 18 dominant species in a Lithocarpus glaber-Cyclobalanopsis glauca evergreen broad-leaved forest, we analyzed the variation in traits, explored the influence of phylogeny and environment on leaf traits, and distinguished the relative effects of spatial and environmental variables on functional traits and phylogenetic compositions. The results showed the following: (i) Leaf traits had moderate intraspecific variation, and significant interspecific variation existed especially among life forms. (ii) Significant phylogenetic signals were detected only in leaf thickness and leaf area. The correlations among traits both supported "the leaf economics spectrum" at the species and community levels, and the relationships significantly increased or only a little change after removing the phylogenetic influence, which showed a lack of consistency between the leaf functional trait patterns and phylogenetic patterns. We infer the coexistent species tended to adopt "realism" to adapt to their habitats. (iii) Soil total potassium and phosphorus content, altitude, aspect, and convexity were the most critical environmental factors affecting functional traits and phylogenetic composition. Total environmental and spatial variables explained 63.38% of the variation in functional trait composition and 47.96% of the variation in phylogenetic structures. Meanwhile, the contribution of pure spatial factors was significantly higher than that of the pure environment. Stochastic processes played dominant roles in driving community functional trait assembly, but determinative processes such as environmental filtering had a stronger effect on shaping community phylogenetic structure at a fine scale.

AB China's ecological compensation (EC) is based on the property rights structure of public ownership of natural resources, which should be based on the spatial planning, which is defined by local government as the boundary of property right management and the distribution of development power. This study combined spatial planning and ecosystem service value (ESV) accounting to design a decision-making framework of EC, which includes "Subject choice, Value accounting, Priority evaluation, Policy supply ". We selected 32 counties (districts) in the Yangtze River Delta region as the research object with the consideration of spatial planning and expert advice, and found that the implementation of EC slowed down the urbanization process and promoted the increase of ecological space. We conducted an accounting and sensitivity analysis on the spatial and temporal changes of ESV in the region from 2000 to 2019, and finally determined the amount and priority of accepting EC. The research results show that the ESV in the study area shows a general trend of increasing and then decreasing in time, and a spatial pattern of high in the south and low in the north and high in the east and low in the west. Forestland and water area are the main providers of ESV in the study area. The sensitivity coefficients of each type of ESV do not change much in each period, but the coefficients between the types have large differences. The total amount of EC in the Yangtze River Delta ecological barrier (YRDEB) is RMB 38,098.11 billion, and Shitai County is the area with the highest priority for compensation. We believe that this decision-making framework has the potential to be applied to the implementation of EC in other regions of China. At the same time, it can also be used to enrich the international views on EC research.

AB This article discusses Costa Rica's policies and institutions created by the state to redistribute land during the 1960s and 1970s, when Latin American was implementing agrarian reforms. The paper also addresses the creation of the national parks system and forest conservation state policy supported by different scientific organisations during the same period. Within this context, this research seeks to explore the interface between the agrarian question (surrounding land and agrarian reform) and the ecological question (related to forest, national parks and conservation policies). The study examines how the transformations in land tenure and forest conservation have led to the structuring of a 'new agrarian question', which encompasses the concentration of land as well as the concentration of payments for environmental services.

AB In forest ecosystems, seedling dynamics play a critical role in understanding species coexistence and community assembly. Exploring the effects of key factors on seedling survival can therefore offer key insights into how they interact to affect seedling mortality in natural forests. Based on 5 years of woody seedling census data and tree census data from a 25-ha permanent forest plot in the subtropical-temperate transitional region in the Qinling Mountains of north-central China, we examined the effects of biotic neighborhood processes and habitat heterogeneity as well as their interactions on seedling mortality using survival data of 11,408 seedlings of 69 species (i.e., 30 tree species and 39 shrub species). The results showed that negative density-dependence (NDD) had significant effects on seedling dynamics and survival at community level. Both biotic and abiotic factors affected seedling survival at different ages, but the influence of negative density-dependence was much more significant, especially on the tree seedlings >= 5 years old. For the shrub seedlings, however, biotic factors had a larger effect on their survival than abiotic factors. Thus, we concluded that both habitat heterogeneity and negative density-dependent mortality shaped species coexistence at the seedling stage in the deciduous broad-leaved forest.

AB Leaf-cutter ants are appreciated as ecosystem engineers. Conversely, under agricultural scenarios, they are considered serious pests. Coffee is one of the crops selectively foraged by this species either under traditional shading or unshaded intensified systems. Despite the economic importance of coffee in Neotropical regions, there are few observational field studies on the impact of leaf-cutter ants on coffee plantation soils and how impact may differ in response to shade management. Three hypotheses were tested in coffee plantations in presence of Atta cephalotes: (1) bioturbation activity by leaf-cutter ants depends on the soil properties, which in turn, are affected by agronomic management of the coffee plantations; (2) a relatively higher concentration of resources (i. e., coffee plants) results in greater leaf-cutter ant activity in unshaded plantations than in shaded plantations; and (3) the effect of ant defoliation on fruit production depends on the level of foliar damage. Ten active ant nests were selected from each management system in ten farm plots. Soil samples were collected from nests and from outside the nests (control), physical, chemical and biological properties were analysed, and leaf-cutter ant herbivory was also assessed. No significant differences in microbial activity, evaluated through respiration, were found between nest and control soils. Nest soils had higher and lower percentages of sand and silt, respectively, than the control soils. Nest soils contained significantly higher amounts of sulphur, regardless of shade management. A. cephalotes translocated mineral soils and improved water infiltration in nest soils. The herbivory index and proportion of damage were greater in unshaded coffee, although fruit production tended to increase, possibly due to a compensatory effect as coffee plants responded to low levels of foliar damage. Therefore, the first hypothesis was only partially supported since bioturbation depended on soil properties, and certain soil properties were affected by coffee management, while the second and third hypotheses were supported by the data, suggesting that leaf-cutter ants differentially affect coffee plantations based on their shade management and on the moment the coffee plants are affected. Our results form the basis for the development of future studies that evaluate production impacts and economic damage in coffee varieties by leaf-cutter ants. Depending on the ecological context of the agroecosystem and management practices used, leaf-cutter ants can have positive or negative impacts for coffee production.

AB Nature conservation relies largely on peoples' rule adherence. Nevertheless, non-compliance with regulations threatens in situ conservation in nearly every protected area (PA) and remains an intractable issue. We reviewed the available published scholarly literature on non-compliant biological resource-use in terrestrial protected areas (TPAs) of sub-Saharan Africa. The focus is on two objectives, firstly, to disentangle the complex drivers behind the various types of deviant behaviour observed in these PAs, and secondly, to assess the strategies deployed on the ground to deter such illegalities. Using 72 selected journal articles published between 2001 and 2021, we recorded nine types of deviant behaviour or illegal resource extraction that were reported. Poaching activity overshadowed all other criminal behaviours. Drivers varied according to the type of crime perpetrated or resources targeted. Poverty was the most cited driver of non-compliance, particularly for illegal bushmeat hunting. PA resentment prompted by destructive errant wildlife was almost as strong a motivation as material poverty. To deter offenders from committing a crime, a combination of interventions, i.e., law enforcement and a spectrum of non-enforcement approaches, such as Reformed Poachers Associations, long-term research sites and resource-access agreements, were deployed. Our synthesis demonstrates that the growing sub-Saharan African literature on non-compliant biological resource-use in TPAs is dominated by bushmeat poaching drivers. Other motives for PA offences by border villagers are scarcely dealt with in the peer-reviewed literature. Future studies of wildlife crime need to address PA transgression multidimensionality, not just bushmeat poaching, to reveal further drivers of transgressive behaviour and ultimately allow for evidence-informed conservation intervention design.

AB Land-use change is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide, but its negative effects can vary depending on the spatial scale analyzed. Considering the continuous expansion of agricultural demand for land, it is urgent to identify the drivers that shape biological communities in order to balance agricultural production and biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes. We used a patch-landscape design and a multimodel inference approach to assess the effects of landscape composition and configuration at two spatial scales (patch and landscape) on the structure of dung beetle assemblages. We performed our study in the Caatinga, the largest dry forest in South America. We sampled 3,526 dung beetles belonging to 19 species and 11 genera. At patch scale, our findings highlight the positive relationship of forest cover and landscape heterogeneity with dung beetle diversity, which are the major drivers of beetle assemblages. Edge density, in turn, is a major driver at the landscape scale and has a negative effect on beetle diversity. Our results support the hypothesis that landscapes combining natural vegetation remnants and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes are the most effective at conserving the biodiversity of dung beetles in the Caatinga landscapes. Directing efforts to better understand the dynamics of dung beetles in agricultural lands can be helpful for policymakers and scientists to design agri-environment schemes and apply conservation strategies in tropical dry forests.

AB Translocating topsoil from an appropriate donor forest is a promising strategy to restore seriously degraded sites. However, some dominant or constructive species did not survive due to plant stress in the seedling stage, which ultimately led to a poor community structure and low similarity between new communities and donor forest. In this study, we replaced the topsoil of karst rocky desertification with forest topsoil and imposed different shading and watering treatments following quadratic saturation D-optimum design. Richness, abundance, height and base diameter of woody species (trees + shrubs) were measured yearly to construct mathematical equation between them and shade degrees (SD) and water quantity (WQ) by using multiple stepwise regression. Results displayed a positive linear relationship between richness of woody species and SD at the second year of topsoil translocation, which changed to a parabolic relationship at the fifth year with a maximum 30.8 species when SD was 37.5 %. The positive linear relationship between density of woody species, shrubs and trees and SD at the second year transformed into a parabolic relationship at the fifth year, and density reached maximum 6.3, 3.7 and 3.8 seedlings/m(2) when SD were 41.7, 38.9 and 45.0%, respectively. In contrast, the density of Paliurus orientalis and Sophora viciifolia turned into a negative linear relationship with SD at the fifth year. Moreover, although the effect of SD and WQ on height of woody species increased over time, shading inhibited base diameter of shrubs and height of Quercus cocciferoides, Sapium sebiferum and Fraxinus malacophylla at the fifth year. We concluded that no-shading and heavy shading reduced species diversity, and light to moderate shading should be recommended in first 2-3 years after topsoil translocation to enhance woody species survival and accelerate similar forest community establishment providing guidance for the management, regeneration and restoration of native forest in semi-arid areas.

AB Investigations of thermally adaptive behavioral phenotypes are critical for both understanding climate as a selective force and predicting global species distributions under climate change conditions. Cooperative nest founding is a common strategy in harsh environments for many species and can enhance growth and competitive advantage, but whether this social strategy has direct effects on thermal tolerance was previously unknown. We examined the effects of alternative social strategies on thermal tolerance in a facultatively polygynous (multiqueen) desert ant, Pogonomyrmex californicus, asking whether and how queen number affects worker thermal tolerances. We established and reared lab colonies with one to four queens, then quantified all colony member heat tolerances (maximum critical temperature [CTmax]). Workers from colonies with more queens had higher and less variant CTmax. Our findings resemble weak link patterns, in which colony group thermal performance is improved by reducing frequencies of the most temperature-vulnerable individuals. Using ambient temperatures from our collection site, we show that multiqueen colonies have thermal tolerance distributions that enable increased midday foraging in hot desert environments. Our results suggest advantages to polygyny under climate change scenarios and raise the question of whether improved thermal tolerance is a factor that has enabled the success of polygyne species in other climatically extreme environments.

AB The Cerrado complex is covered by twelve physiognomies characterized by a gradient of grassland, savanna and forest formations. We assessed the recruitment (RI) and mortality (MI) of individuals and the gain (BG) and loss (BL) of basal area in the Cerrado complex. We used 26 sites classified into savanna (15) and forest formations (11); dry (19) and moist environments (7); non-disturbed (14) and disturbed areas (12) that were recovered from the literature. The median of the vegetation dynamics varied as follows: MI = 3.95, RI = 2.99, BL = 3.08 and the BG = 3.99. MI exceeded RI at 13 sites, and forests formation comprised 70% of the sites with high MI. The median RI was 2.2 times higher in savanna than in forest formations, while it was 1.7 times higher in disturbed areas than in non-disturbed ones. Although the vegetation dynamics have been studied for decades in Cerrado, the studies of disturbances are majority focused on fire and fragmentation effects, indicating that the research should go beyond it. Generalized additive models (GAMs) showed that the MI, RI, BL and BG differ in their responses to three environmental gradients: (1) elevation + temperature, (2) precipitation and (3) precipitation seasonality, even across sites with similar environmental conditions.

AB Spatial targeting plays a key role in improving the efficiency of payment for ecosystem services (PES). However, the risk of grassland degradation after implementing PES increases uncertainty about the efficiency of PES. Here, we identified the spatial heterogeneity of grassland degradation risk using Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model, then incorporated grassland degradation risk as a criterion into PES spatial targeting using cost-benefit analysis and ranking optimization. The framework was applied to a case study of the Three-River-Source National Park, China. We found that grasslands in the study area continued to degrade between 2015 and 2025, and the area of degraded grasslands increased by 26%. Compared with spatial targeting of PES without considering grassland degradation risk, PES spatial targeting that considered grassland degradation risk was significantly different (the overlap area accounted for only 75%, 82%, and 94% of the PES area within 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total protection cost budget). When the grassland degradation risk was considered as a targeting criterion, PES efficiency increased by 154%, 116%, 124%, and 99%, respectively, within 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the total protection cost budget. Our results demonstrate that considering grassland degradation risk in the spatial targeting of PES increases efficiency because it helps to target areas with greater environmental benefits.

AB Climatic changes are altering precipitation patterns in the Amazon and may influence soil methane (CH4) fluxes due to the differential responses of methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms. However, it remains unclear if these climate feedbacks can amplify land-use-related impacts on the CH4 cycle. To better predict the responses of soil CH4-cycling microorganisms and emissions under altered moisture levels in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon, we performed a 30-day microcosm experiment manipulating the moisture content (original moisture; 60%, 80%, and 100% of field capacity - FC) of forest and pasture soils. Gas samples were collected periodically for gas chromatography analysis, and methanogenic archaeal and methanotrophic bacterial communities were assessed using quantitative PCR and metagenomics. Positive and negative daily CH4 fluxes were observed for forest and pasture, indicating that these soils can act as both CH4 sources and sinks. Cumulative emissions and the abundance of methanogenesis-related genes and taxonomic groups were affected by land use, moisture, and their interaction. Pasture soils at 100% FC had the highest abundance of methanogens and CH4 emissions, 22 times higher than forest soils under the same treatment. Higher ratios of methanogens to methanotrophs were found in pasture than in forest soils, even at field capacity conditions. Land use and moisture were significant factors influencing the composition of methanogenic and methanotrophic communities. The diversity and evenness of methanogens did not change throughout the experiment. In contrast, methanotrophs exhibited the highest diversity and evenness in pasture soils at 100% FC. Taken together, our results suggest that increased moisture exacerbates soil CH4 emissions and microbial responses driven by land-use change in the Amazon. This is the first report on the microbial CH4 cycle in Amazonian upland soils that combined one-month gas measurements with advanced molecular methods.

AB Deforestation is the most important cause of biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems. Epiphytic species, lichens and bryophytes, are very sensitive to environmental changes, including those produced by conversion of primary forests into secondary vegetation. However, little is known about the differences between different secondary forests and plantations regarding the epiphytic biota. We compared epiphytic communities among different secondary forests and non-native plantations in southern Ecuador. Four forest types were considered: non-native Pinus patula plantations, monospecific secondary forests of Alnus acuminata, monospecific secondary forests of Andesanthus lepidotus and mixed secondary forests. Within each forest type, two stands were surveyed, establishing a total of 80 plots and analyzing four trees per plot. We estimated lichen and bryophyte cover in four inventories per tree and calculated and compared different metrics for taxonomic and functional diversity, as well as community composition. The results revealed forest type as the major predictor for the species and functional traits richness, and for diversity and composition. In total, 422 taxa were identified (312 lichens and 110 bryophytes), with mixed secondary forests having the richest communities (194 species) and non-native plantations having the lowest richness (105 species). Bryophyte richness was highest in A. lepidotus forests. Taxonomic and functional diversity, and species composition differed greatly among forest types and followed a different pattern depending on the organism considered. Lichens were the most sensitive indicators of environmental conditions associated with different tropical forest types.

AB Using a mechanistic spatially explicit trait-based neighborhood-model, we quantify the impact of mutations on intraspecific spatial interactions to better understand mechanisms underlying the maintenance of genetic variation and the potential effects of these evolved interactions on the population dynamics of Arabidopsis thaliana. We use 100 twenty-fifth generation mutation accumulation (MA) lines (genotypes) derived from one founder genotype to study mutational effects on neighbor responses in a field experiment. We created individual-based maps (15,000 individuals), including phenotypic variation, to quantify mutational effects within genotypes versus between genotypes on reproduction and survival. At small-scale (within 80 cm of the focal plant), survival is enhanced but seed-set is decreased when a genotype is surrounded by different genotypes. At large-scale (within 200 cm of the focal plant), seed set is facilitated by different genotypes while the same genotype has either no effect or negative effects. The direction of the interactions among MA lines suggests that at small scale these interactions may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation and at large scale contribute to the survival of the population. This may suggest, that, mutations potentially have immediate effects on population and community dynamics by influencing the outcome of competitive and faciliatory interactions among conspecifics.

AB Aim Coastal infrastructures are increasing at different latitudes, and their deployment often results in a complete replacement of natural habitats. Although infrastructure provides novel habitats, ecological engineering can increase their similarity to natural rocky habitats. One hurdle for effective design of greener infrastructure is the scarce information on the processes that underpin differences in the structure of communities between built and natural habitats. Using long-term data of intertidal community structure, we tested whether the magnitude of between-habitat differences changes with breakwater age and across latitudes, and we examined the role of topographic microhabitats (i.e., rock pools) in driving these differences. Location Nine locations distributed from 18 to 41 degrees S. Time period 2016-2020. Methods We sampled the mid-intertidal community structure on breakwaters of different age and on natural rocky habitats (platforms and boulder fields) and assessed the availability of microhabitats, such as crevices and rock pools, along a coastline spanning 23 degrees of latitude. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we assessed the effect of the different factors on species diversity and functional group abundances. Results Age since construction was a poor predictor of differences between breakwaters and natural habitats. Communities on older breakwaters bore a poor resemblance to the species composition or functional group abundances found in natural habitats. The magnitude of differences between breakwaters and natural habitats varied with latitude, with season and with the type of natural habitat attributable to differences in microhabitats, especially in rock pool availability. Conclusions Our results indicate that replacement of rocky habitats with breakwaters will cause permanent alterations to coastal ecosystems. Our findings suggest that the availability of microhabitats able to shelter species from stressful environmental conditions is more important at lower and intermediate latitudes; hence, they should be incorporated primarily into infrastructures in tropical or subtropical areas. These strategies could help to compensate for the impacts on rocky ecosystems associated with increases in coastal urbanization.

AB Combining metabolic and maximum entropy theories of ecology, the authors derive an equation of state capable of capturing the relationships between multiple ecological variables across varied spatial scales and habitats.
   To advance understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem function, ecologists seek widely applicable relationships among species diversity and other ecosystem characteristics such as species productivity, biomass, and abundance. These metrics vary widely across ecosystems and no relationship among any combination of them that is valid across habitats, taxa, and spatial scales, has heretofore been found. Here we derive such a relationship, an equation of state, among species richness, energy flow, biomass, and abundance by combining results from the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology and the Metabolic Theory of Ecology. It accurately captures the relationship among these state variables in 42 data sets, including vegetation and arthropod communities, that span a wide variety of spatial scales and habitats. The success of our ecological equation of state opens opportunities for estimating difficult-to-measure state variables from measurements of others, adds support for two current theories in ecology, and is a step toward unification in ecology.

AB In the Southern Ocean, the living environment of organisms has changed due to the dramatic increase in melting sea ice and the loss of glaciers, which have consequently caused substantial changes in biodiversity. Samples of pelagic ciliates from 13 sites were collected as bioindicators to demonstrate the relationship between spatial distribution patterns and environmental heterogeneity affected by sea ice melting and to reveal the community assembly mechanisms in the Ross Sea. Univariate analyses and multivariate analyses were effective tools demonstrating clear spatial patterns and providing a sufficient explanation to interpret strong correlations between pelagic ciliate communities and environmental variations, especially the distribution pattern of nutrients and Chl a. Moreover, environmental heterogeneity might affect the co-occurrence network complexity of ciliate communities. Furthermore, our results also indicated that stochastic processes play a significant role in the community assembly of pelagic ciliates. This study examined the controlling mechanisms of environmental heterogeneity affected by sea ice melting on pelagic ciliate communities and provided explanations for the community assembly of pelagic ciliates in polar marine ecosystems.

AB Ecological niche models (ENMs) have become a practical and key mechanism for filling major gaps in spatial information for targeted conservation planning, particularly when only occurrence data are available. Nonetheless, accounting for abundance patterns in the internal structure of species' ranges, and the role of biotic interactions in such models across broadscale, remains highly challenging. Our study gathered baseline information on abundance data of two Endangered Amazonian primates (Ateles chamek and Lagothrix lagotricha cana) to create geospatial abundance models using two spatial interpolation methods: Inverse distance weight (IDW) and Ordinary kriging (OK). The main goals were to: (i) test whether geospatial abundance models are correlated with habitat suitability derived from correlative ENMs; (ii) compare the strength of the abundance-suitability relationships between original and interpolated abundances; (iii) test whether interspecific competition between the two target taxa constrained abundance over broad spatial scales; and (iv) create ensemble models incorporating both habitat suitability and abundance to identify high-priority areas for conservation. We found a significant positive relationship between habitat suitability with observed and predicted abundances of woolly (L. l. cana) and spider (A. chamek) monkeys. Abundance-suitability correlations showed no significant differences when using original relative abundances compared to using interpolated abundances. We also found that the association between L. l. cana abundance and habitat suitability depended on the abundance of its putative competitor species, A. chamek. Our final models combining geospatial abundance information with ENMs were able to provide more realistic assessments of hotspots for conservation, especially when accounting for the important, but often neglected, role of interspecific competition in shaping species' geographic ranges at broader scales. The framework developed here, including general trends in abundance patterns and suitability information, can be used as a surrogate to identify high-priority areas for conservation of poorly known species across their entire geographic ranges.

AB Biomass allocation in plants is fundamental for understanding and predicting terrestrial carbon storage. Here, the authors conduct a meta-analysis showing that warming effect on plant root:shoot is influenced by precipitation and the type of mycorrhizal fungi associated.
   Biomass allocation in plants is fundamental for understanding and predicting terrestrial carbon storage. Yet, our knowledge regarding warming effects on root: shoot ratio (R/S) remains limited. Here, we present a meta-analysis encompassing more than 300 studies and including angiosperms and gymnosperms as well as different biomes (cropland, desert, forest, grassland, tundra, and wetland). The meta-analysis shows that average warming of 2.50 degrees C (median = 2 degrees C) significantly increases biomass allocation to roots with a mean increase of 8.1% in R/S. Two factors associate significantly with this response to warming: mean annual precipitation and the type of mycorrhizal fungi associated with plants. Warming-induced allocation to roots is greater in drier habitats when compared to shoots (+15.1% in R/S), while lower in wetter habitats (+4.9% in R/S). This R/S pattern is more frequent in plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, compared to ectomycorrhizal fungi. These results show that precipitation variability and mycorrhizal association can affect terrestrial carbon dynamics by influencing biomass allocation strategies in a warmer world, suggesting that climate change could influence belowground C sequestration.

AB Insular environments are among the most endangered ecosystems as they face a myriad of anthropogenic stressors. Forest mammals perform a wide range of ecological services, with their persistence being vital for ecosystem functionality in both natural and artificial islands. Studies revealed that shrinkage in island size usually leads to the decay of mammal species richness and abundance in patchy landscapes. However, mammal species-area (SARs) and abundance-area (AARs) relationships can differ among insular environments: oceanic, fluvial, artificial, and land-bridge islands (i.e., natural islands connected to the mainland). Large dams create vast insularized landscapes after river impoundment, leading to pervasive habitat loss and potentially causing even worse biodiversity losses than other insular systems. We conducted an extensive literature search and used meta-analysis techniques to quantify the magnitude of SAR and AAR for forest mammals across different archipelago landscapes worldwide. After a screening process, we ended up with 26 studies comprising 55 different effect sizes representing the magnitude of SARs and AARs. Our global analysis unveiled a positive relationship between effect sizes and island area, with mammal species richness and abundance increasing in fluvial, oceanic, and artificial islands accordingly with island area, but not in land-bridge islands. These results demonstrate that, except for land-bridge islands, SAR and AAR are still fair models to predict mammal diversity. These results could improve the prediction of SAR and AAR in insular environments under habitat loss scenarios and propose sound conservation strategies since the rate at which insular communities have been lost is presently unknown.

AB Background Tropical tree species can maintain high growth rates on low-phosphorus (P) soils. However, the physiological basis of the high growth rates of tropical tree species remains unknown. Scope Here, we examine how traits related to P uptake and use efficiency might account for this phenomenon. Based on a comparison of plant physiological responses to P and nitrogen (N) limitation, we hypothesize that distinct evolutionary processes have occurred on strongly weathered tropical soils characterized by low P availability relative to weakly and moderately weathered temperate soils characterized by low N availability. Efficient P-use arises through the synthesis of galactolipids rather than phospholipids, small genome size, preferential and flexible P allocation to leaves, efficient P resorption from wood and leaves, tissue longevity, and a decrease in P allocation to reproduction. Efficient P uptake mechanisms include synthesis of phosphatase in roots to acquire organic P from phosphodiesters and phytate, association with mycorrhizal fungi efficient at acquiring P, secretion of organic anions from roots to mobilize soil P, increased mass flow, and modifications of root depth distribution and structure. Conclusions Despite the prevalence of low P soils throughout the tropics, few studies have explored P-use efficiency and acquisition mechanisms in tropical trees. We predict that the wide range of mechanisms by which plants can efficiently acquire and use P maintains productivity and promotes species diversity on low P soils in the tropics and elsewhere.

AB Leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.) are the main Eucalyptus plantation pests that cause successive defoliation, and productivity losses might be significant. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the influence of vegetation composition and landscape structure on the occurrence of leaf-cutting ants in Eucalyptus spp. plantations neighboring areas of Atlantic Forest vegetation. We collected data on the occurrence of ants (Atta spp.) and the amount of loose soil in each ant colony. We calculated the landscape metrics for the area that we divided in landscape planning unit. We proceeded with information-theoretic approach to identify the best set of models with AICc criteria. We found that 81.1% of the ant colonies had an area of loose soil smaller than 1 m(2), and the diversity of Eucalyptus ages, edges of Eucalyptus plantation, and conservation of native fragments have influence on ant occurrence and reduce their effects. So, an increase in vegetation conservation status, decrease of roads that lead to edges in Eucalyptus plantations, and adoption of age mosaics in production areas disrupts ant occurrence. In addition, better functional and structural conditions favor ecosystem services, such as soil and water conservation, through a reduction in the use of formicidal baits.

AB Considering the high rate of primary forest degradation and loss in the tropics, the ability to conserve plant diversity within alternative forest landscape components is critical to biodiversity conservation. This study compares the restoration potential of old forest plantations and secondary forests. We assessed and compared the floristics, plant species diversity, conservation value, and structure of old (42-47 years) timber plantations of Aucoumea klaineana Pierre, Cedrela odorata L., Tarrietia utilis Sprague, and Terminalia ivorensis A. Chev. and similar-aged secondary forests with nearby primary (old-growth) forests in the moist and wet forest zones of Ghana. We established a systematic sampling set-up of ninety-three 20 m x 20 m plots in total on 11 sites, with smaller nested subplots for saplings and ground vegetation. The floristic composition of the plantation and secondary forest stands were similar to that of the primary forests, with many rare and restricted-range species shared by the three forest types. Approximately 77% and 60% of primary forest plant species also occurred in plantation and secondary forests, respectively. Species diversity, measured by the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (H') and Simpson Index (S), for the primary forest (H'=3.07, S = 0.91) was not statistically different from the plantation (H'=2.85, S = 0.87) or secondary (H'=2.95, S = 0.88) forests. Overall, species richness was higher in the primary and secondary forests compared to the plantations. At the tree stratum (>= 10 cm DBH), the assessed diversity indices were significantly different between the primary forest and the plantations. However, such differences did not exist among the saplings (10 cm > DBH >= 2 cm) and ground vegetation (< 2cm DBH). The plantations and secondary forests were similar to the primary forests for all the structural characteristics assessed. However, basal area and bole volume were significantly higher in the plantations compared with secondary forests. Conservation value (using Genetic Heat Index as an indicator) was highest in one of the C. odorata plantations (W-CO). Our study demonstrates that plantation and secondary forests can develop into structurally complex and floristically diverse self-organized stands similar to primary forests. Passive conversion of plantations to more natural ecosystems is an effective and low-cost forest restoration strategy leading to diverse ecosystems with high conservation value.

AB Developing meaningful agroecosystem soil P inventories necessitates moving beyond single measures of readily extractable inorganic P (Pi) limited to surface depths. We drew on a long-term (36 year) experimental field trial in the US Maize Belt (northwestern Illinois) to evaluate how crop rotation [maize-maize (Zea mays L.) vs maizesoybean (Glycine max L. Merr.)] and N fertilization (0 vs 269 kg N ha-1) impact P dynamics throughout the soil profile by using sequential fractionation and phosphatase activity assays, contextualized by soil P stocks and agronomic P balances. Distribution of P fractions by depth (0-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-90 cm) indicate that management effects were limited to the surface soil layers (0-30 cm). Soil P fractions differed more by depth than by experimental treatments. Long-term N fertilization significantly decreased pH concurrently with labile organic P (Po) and phosphodiesterase activity. Soil labile inorganic P (Pi) was two-fold lower under N fertilization compared to zero N fertilization, reflecting greater yield and thus P export via grain harvest. Under N fertilization, integration of soybean elevated soil phosphodiesterase activity and decreased water-extractable Po. Higher stocks of soil Po than labile Pi at surface depths (0-30 cm) corroborated a hypothesized appreciable pool size of soil Po relative to the labile Pi pool to which most agronomic assessments are limited. Large negative agronomic balances over the 36-year period (-426 to -945 kg P ha-1) are suggestive of legacy P from preexperiment manure application and high native P stocks, with net P export equivalent to 11-35% of soil P stocks at 0-90 cm depth at the initiation of the experiment. These results contribute to a better understanding how N fertilization and rotation practices influence soil P cycling and stocks, thereby informing P budgets for comprehensive agroecosystem P management.

AB Studies investigating the effect of aboveground herbivory on plants often use clipping to simulate the effects of herbivores, for practical reasons. However, herbivore movements and transfer of oral secretions during herbivory may cause a different response in plant physiology and morphology compared to clipping. While studies have compared effects of real herbivory vs. clipping on biomass production, plant physiology, and shoot morphology, no study has compared such effects on root morphology. Therefore, we investigated the effect of herbivory by grasshoppers, herbivory simulated by clipping, and no herbivory on root morphological traits of ten grassland plant species. Root morphological traits were differently affected by the two herbivory treatments. Grasshopper herbivory significantly changed root morphology toward thinner roots with increased specific root length and root area, and decreased root tissue density compared to untreated control plants. Clipping had mostly similar, but weaker effects on root morphology than grasshopper herbivory. On the species level, grasshopper herbivory led to strongest changes in root morphology in almost all cases. In contrast, depending on the species, clipping resulted in varying root morphological trait values similar to grasshopper-damaged plants, or in some cases, more closely aligned with control plants. Though clipping was partly able to mimic the effects of herbivory by grasshoppers, results also indicate that, depending on the species, grasshopper herbivory had different but mostly stronger effects. We, therefore, recommend that future studies apply herbivory with real herbivores to better reflect natural responses in plants and related processes that root morphological traits mediate.

AB A comprehensive understanding of phylogeography requires the integration of knowledge across different organisms, ecosystems, and geographic regions. However, a critical knowledge gap exists in the arid biota of the vast Asian drylands. To narrow this gap, here we test an "out-of-Central Asia" hypothesis for the desert scorpion Mesobuthus mongolicus by combining Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction and ecological niche modeling. Phylogenetic analyses of one mitochondrial and three nuclear loci and molecular dating revealed that M. mongolicus represents a coherent lineage that diverged from its most closely related lineage in Central Asia about 1.36 Ma and underwent radiation ever since. Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction indicated that the ancestral population dispersed from Central Asia gradually eastward to the Gobi region via the Junggar Basin, suggesting that the Junggar Basin has severed as a corridor for Quaternary faunal exchange between Central Asia and East Asia. Two major dispersal events occurred probably during interglacial periods (around 0.8 and 0.4 Ma, respectively) when climatic conditions were analogous to present-day status, under which the scorpion achieved its maximum distributional range. M. mongolicus underwent demographic expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum, although the predicted distributional areas were smaller than those at present and during the Last Interglacial. Development of desert ecosystems in northwest China incurred by intensified aridification might have opened up empty habitats that sustained population expansion. Our results extend the spatiotemporal dimensions of trans-Eurasia faunal exchange and suggest that species' adaptation is an important determinant of their phylogeographic and demographic responses to climate changes.

AB Since coexisting invasive and native plant species are exposed to similar environmental circumstances and selection pressures, variation in the morpho-functional, resource allocation and reproductive performance of these species could reflect the strategies adopted by the former for their invasion success. This study observed general differences in the morphological and physiological traits between invasive Ageratina adenophora and its co-occurring other invasive (Bidens pilosa) and native (Galinsoga ciliata) aster species in roadside populations of Kumaun Himalayan region. Plant samples were collected during their peak growth period. For the collection of plant and soil samples, five plots of 50 m x 2 m size were established at regular interval on the Nainital-Kathgodam road between 1800 and 1900 m asl. Five quadrats of 1 m x 1 m size were randomly placed at each of these plots, and from these quadrat, five individuals of each species were randomly collected. Soil was collected from 0 to 15 cm depth from all the five study plots. The results showed that soil properties did not vary among study plots and were of same nature. A. adenophora showed higher plant height and total biomass than its neighboring species and allocated more biomass to stem (76%) than G. ciliata (44%) and B. pilosa (38%) which reflects the competitive superiority of this plant over nearby vegetation for light harvesting. In contrast, highest biomass to leaves was allocated by G. ciliata (27%) followed by B. pilosa (26%) and A. adenophora (6%). The root/shoot ratio was lowest in A. adenophora and highest in B. pilosa. Specific leaf area was reported least for A. adenophora, while specific leaf weight was maximum reflecting the strategy of A. adenophora to survive in water stress conditions. High leaf dry matter content represented the physical strength and conservative strategy of A. adenophora in addition to protection from natural and biological hazards, whereas the highest seed number and reproductive index represented the superior reproductive efficiency than its co-occurring two species. Plant functional traits were positively or negatively correlated with each other and did not always exhibit higher values for A. adenophora. These findings suggest that A. adenophora possess superior traits associated with resource acquisition and resource conservation strategies in addition to advanced reproductive performance, which strongly influence the invasive success of this plant in comparison with other co-occurring native and invasive species.

AB Context Biodiversity hotspots harbor 77% of endemic plant species. Patagonian Temperate Forest (PTF) is a part of a biodiversity hotspot, but over the past centuries, has been over-exploited, fragmented and replaced with exotic species plantations, lately also threatened by climate change. Objectives Our aim is to better understand patterns of habitat suitability and niche overlap of nine endemic gymnosperm species, key elements of the PTF, complementing traditional approaches of biodiversity conservation. Methods Using R packages and 3016 occurrence data, we deployed ecological niche models (ENM) in MaxEnt via kuenm, and classified species according to Rabinowitz's types of rarity. We then overlapped their niches calculating Schoener's D index, and considered types of rarity in a spatial ecological context. Finally, we overlay high species' suitability and protected areas and detected conservation priorities using GapAnalysis. Results We generated simplified ENMs for nine Patagonian gymnosperms and found that most niches overlap, and only one species displayed a unique niche. Surprisingly, we found that three species have divergent suitability of habitats across the landscape and not related with previously published geographic structure of neutral genetic variation. We showed that the rarer a species is the smaller niche volume tend to have, that six out of nine studied species have high conservation priority, and that there are conservation gaps in the PTF. Conclusion Our approach showed that there are unprotected suitable areas for native key species at high risk in PTF. Suggesting that integrating habitat-suitability models of multiple species, types of rarity, and niche overlap, can be a handy tool to identify potential conservation areas in global biodiversity hotspots.

AB Triaenonychidae is a family of Opiliones with almost 500 described species distributed in the southern continents. Recent work has provided a solid phylogenetic foundation based on Sanger and ultraconserved element molecular sequence data that resulted in a global reorganisation of the family. In this study, we turn to the South American triaenonychids, aggregating sequences of three markers (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I), re-examining the position of additional South American species and confirming the existence of a new genus. We provide novel information regarding the external morphology of 10 of the 11 South American genera of Triaenonychidae, based on stereomicroscope and SEM images of the body and genitalia. In addition, a new genus Adrianonyx gen. nov. and two new species, Adrianonyx contulmo sp. nov. from the Monumento Natural Contulmo (Chile) and Adrianonyx crypticus sp. nov. from the Parque Nacional Nahuelbuta (Chile) are described.

AB Climate is a major extrinsic factor affecting the population dynamics of many organisms. The Broad-Scale Climate Hypothesis (BSCH) was proposed by Elton to explain the large-scale synchronous population cycles of animals, but the extent of support and whether it differs among taxa and geographical regions is unclear. We reviewed publications examining the relationship between the population dynamics of multiple taxa worldwide and the two most commonly used broad-scale climate indices, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Our review and synthesis (based on 561 species from 221 papers) reveals that population changes of mammals, birds and insects are strongly affected by major oceanic shifts or irregular oceanic changes, particularly in ENSO- and NAO-influenced regions (Pacific and Atlantic, respectively), providing clear evidence supporting Elton's BSCH. Mammal and insect populations tended to increase during positive ENSO phases. Bird populations tended to increase in positive NAO phases. Some species showed dual associations with both positive and negative phases of the same climate index (ENSO or NAO). These findings indicate that some taxa or regions are more or less vulnerable to climate fluctuations and that some geographical areas show multiple weather effects related to ENSO or NAO phases. Beyond confirming that animal populations are influenced by broad-scale climate variation, we document extensive patterns of variation among taxa and observe that the direct biotic and abiotic mechanisms for these broad-scale climate factors affecting animal populations are very poorly understood. A practical implication of our research is that changes in ENSO or NAO can be used as early signals for pest management and wildlife conservation. We advocate integrative studies at both broad and local scales to unravel the omnipresent effects of climate on animal populations to help address the challenge of conserving biodiversity in this era of accelerated climate change.

AB Species range expansion induced by climate change and human activities threaten native populations and communities across the biosphere. Insect herbivores, important consumers of plants, are known to expand or contract their range under global change, with potential consequences to the newly reached environment. The selection of oviposition sites by herbivorous insects could notably impact offspring performance. However, the role of such effects in impacting the receiving ecosystem has been rarely explored. Here, we provide the first evidence showing that a terrestrial range-expanding phytophagous wood-borer moth (Zeuzera leuconotum Butler) heavily attacked the saplings of a foundation plant species tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis) in salt marshes. Long-term field surveys and laboratory behaviour experiments revealed that the oviposition preference of adult females was beneficial to their larval performance. The preference to oviposit on young branches of the new host plants, which were often softer and contained enough nutrients for larval development, indicates that females could still make the right choice on novel host-plants. This finding supports the 'mother knows best' hypothesis that female insects will evolve to oviposit on hosts on which their offspring fare best. Consequently, the survival of host-plant saplings decreased dramatically under this top-down control, revealing that herbivory of this range-expanding insect has a profound negative impact on the recruitment and succession of coastal foundation species, thereby potentially leading to saltmarsh degradation. These findings highlight the importance of the maternal oviposition effects in range-expanding insects and how these populations can establish using novel host-plants and threaten coastal wetlands.

AB Successful seed-based restoration in dryland systems is difficult due to the many limitations associated with germination and establishment. Seed predators, including granivorous ants, can consume or move applied seeds offsite reducing restoration success. Granivorous ants in the U.S. southwest move and store tens of thousands of seeds and show preferences for seeds based on weight, size, nutrient content, and novelty. In this study, we examine which seed traits most influence seed predation rates in a grassland in southwestern Arizona, U.S.A. We presented 24 seed types from native species with restoration value in three cafeteria-style selection areas installed adjacent to Pogonomyrmex nests. We also installed pitfall traps to assess the diversity of ant species that may have visited the cafeterias. Our results showed that among offered seeds, 3-99% were collected by granivorous ants, with small seeds and those with no structure the most preferred. Across all cafeterias, we had 11 ant species in our pitfall traps, with over half of those being known seed predators. From our study, we found that seed traits do influence ant seed preference and our results can help inform practices that could aid in keeping seed on the ground and increasing the chance of germination and establishment.

AB Tree mycorrhizal type plays an important role in promoting plant species diversity and coexistence, via its mediating role in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), i.e., the process by which an individual's performance is impaired by the density of conspecific plants. Previous findings suggest that ectomycorrhizal (EM) tree species are generally less susceptible to CNDD than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species, due to the chemical and physical protection that EM fungi provide their host with. We examined how CNDD effects on leaf herbivory, seedling growth, and survival differ between AM and EM seedlings of ten tree species collected over 3 years in an old-growth temperate forest in northeastern China. We found that AM and EM seedlings differed in how conspecific density affected their leaf herbivory, seedling growth, and survival. Specifically, AM seedlings leaf herbivory rates significantly increased with increasing conspecific seedling and adult density, and their growth and survival rates decreased with increasing conspecific adult density, these patterns were, however, absent in EM seedlings. Our work suggests that AM seedlings have a performance disadvantage relative to EM seedlings related to the negative effects from conspecific neighbors. We highlight the importance of integrating information on seedling leaf herbivory, seedling growth, to provide further understanding on potential mechanisms driving differences in CNDD between AM and EM tree seedlings.

AB Introduction: Infrastructure projects or development activities often generate a loss of biodiversity and reduce the quality of the environment's services to human societies. Fortunately, many of these impacts can be reduced, controlled, or compensated through mitigation, rehabilitation, and compensation measures, which usually rely on the environmental legal framework of the countries or states where they are implemented. This review provides a theoretical vision of using environmental compensation as a legal/technical instrument integrated into natural environment management.Methodology: We reviewed the global literature on the subject using the GoogleScholar and SciELO reference search engines using various indicators in English and Spanish.Results: We found 244 references on environmental compensation, showing a clear increasing pattern in the last decade. Environmental compensation constitutes a legal/technical instrument that allows offsets for environmen-tal losses and often is part of the Environmental Impact Studies regulated by the state. Several methodological strategies are used to establish compensatory actions, each of them based on one of four possible approaches: economic, ecological, political, and cultural. The ecological equivalence between the impacted environmental elements and compensation is sought within the ecological approach, ensuring no net loss. Thus, this approach allows the incorporation of multiple criteria for the evaluation of damage and compensation actions: it can be applied in different situations. Nevertheless, compensatory measures are not exempt from criticism. There are situations in which the singularity of the impacted elements makes an adequate compensation for losses impossible.Conclusions: Compensation is highly relevant in environmental management and must favor the universal right to a healthy environment. However, its practical application requires clear procedures and close vigilance to prevent losses or even a net environmental gain.

AB Earth's most speciose biomes are in the tropics, yet tropical plant phenology remains poorly understood. Tropical phenological data are comparatively scarce and viewed through the lens of a 'temperate phenological paradigm' expecting phenological traits to respond to strong, predictably annual shifts in climate (e.g., between subfreezing and frost-free periods). Digitized herbarium data greatly expand existing phenological data for tropical plants; and circular data, statistics, and models are more appropriate for analyzing tropical (and temperate) phenological datasets. Phylogenetic information, which remains seldom applied in phenological investigations, provides new insights into phenological responses of large groups of related species to climate. Consistent combined use of herbarium data, circular statistical distributions, and robust phylogenies will rapidly advance our understanding of tropical - and temperate - phenology.

AB The Brazilian Amazon provides important hydrological cycle functions, including precipitation regimes that bring water to the people and environment and are critical to moisture recycling and transport, and represents an important variable for climate models to simulate accurately. This paper evaluates the performance of 13 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. This is done by discussing results from spatial pattern mapping, Taylor diagram analysis and Taylor skill score, annual climatology comparison, cumulative distribution analysis, and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Precipitation analysis shows: (1) This region displays higher rainfall in the north-northwest and drier conditions in the south. Models tend to underestimate northern values or overestimate the central to northwest averages. (2) The southern Amazon has a more defined dry season (June, July, and August) and wet season (December, January, and February) and models simulate this well. The northern Amazon dry season tends to occur in August, September, and October and the wet season occurs in March, April, and May, and models are not able to capture the climatology as well. Models tend to produce too much rainfall at the start of the wet season and tend to either over- or under-estimate the dry season, although ensemble means typically display the overall pattern more precisely. (3) Models struggle to capture extreme values of precipitation except when precipitation values are close to 0. (4) EOF analysis shows that models capture the dominant mode of variability, which was the annual cycle or South American Monsoon System. (5) When all evaluation metrics are considered, the models that perform best are CESM2, MIROC6, MRIESM20, SAMOUNICON, and the ensemble mean. This paper supports research in determining the most up-to-date CMIP6 model performance of precipitation regime for 1981-2014 for the Brazilian Amazon. Results will aid in understanding future projections of precipitation for the selected subset of global climate models and allow scientists to construct reliable model ensembles, as precipitation plays a role in many sectors of the economy, including the ecosystem, agriculture, energy, and water security.

AB Rockfish (genus Sebastes) assemblages can inform mechanisms of coexistence and maintenance of diversity in ecological communities. Coexistence theory characterizes ecological assemblages as following either a deterministic niche differentiation model, or a stochastic lottery model. We used natural abundances of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes from the tissues of ten co-occurring species of rockfish to assess position, size, and overlap of trophic niches in this diverse assemblage. We created a stochastic null model and compared observed values against the null model to determine if patterns were consistent with a deterministic or a stochastic model. We classified rockfish species as either demersal or pelagic. Mean delta 13C and delta 15N values differed among pelagic and demersal rockfish species and mean position was more variable than what was predicted by our null model. All species had relatively small trophic niches compared to occupied trophic niche space for the entire assemblage and trophic niche size was smaller than what was predicted by our null model. Trophic niche overlaps varied from 32% to 189% but were substantially lower than predicted by our null mode. All observed trophic niche metrics were different than the stochastic null model. This rockfish assemblage follows a deterministic model of community composition.

AB Seedling performance in the early stage is crucial to natural forest restoration, and functional traits have been widely employed in exploring plant adaptation under field conditions. However, the responses and variabilities of leaf traits have not been clearly defined at the light gradients that are used in restoration practices. We evaluated the variation in leaf treats in species and community levels in a controlled field plot with shading treatments. We found that the variation characteristics differed across different species and trait types along shading gradients. Individuals of most species had a larger leaf area (LA) and specific leaf area (SLA) in the shaded habitats, while only a few tree species showed significant responses in their leaf shape and chlorophyll concentration. Although LA and SLA showed similar directions and trends of changes in the trait mean, four response models were observed based on the light points corresponding to initial responses and following trends. The extent of within-species trait variation for each treatment was similar at the community level due to diverse changes in the direction and degrees of variation in co-occurring species. Intraspecific variation was limited within each shading treatment, while it noticeably contributed to the local adaptation in the entire heterogeneous restoration community. Our findings indicate that species with different trait combinations will have different responses to light gradients, and that the mean and degree of variation in leaf traits will also lead to distinctive strategies being created to match the different shading conditions. Vegetation restoration should consider the adaptive traits and their response diversity when selecting species and for habitat management with specific trait-environment interactions.

AB Negative densification affects the spatial distribution of species in secondary evergreen broad-leaved forests and is a key mechanism governing species coexistence. We investigated the effects of habitat heterogeneity and density on the spatial distribution of populations of dominant woody species in a secondary evergreen broad-leaved forest in Wuchaoshan using spatial univariate point pattern analyses. This 6 ha forest dynamic monitoring sample area in Hangzhou, China is a typical secondary subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest. We found (1) a strong effect of habitat heterogeneity that led to the spatial aggregation of dominant species in the plot. Habitat heterogeneity had a strong impact on mature individuals at different life history stages and of different species on a large scale. (2) Negative density dependence (NDD) generally affected spatial distributions of most dominant species and decreased in magnitude with age class. Therefore, different species of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in China have formed unique spatial structures due to their habitat preferences but are generally subjected to density-dependent effects.

AB Gap-scale disturbances drive successional and structural development patterns in most forest ecosystems. Although fire-maintained Pinus palustris woodlands are less light limited than closed canopy forests, gap-scale disturbance processes may still influence successional and developmental pathways. We quantified biophysical characteristics of 50 canopy gaps in a montane Pinus palustris woodland to analyze gap-scale disturbance patterns and processes. We found most gaps (64%) were caused by the death of a single tree. Snag-formed gaps were most common (38%) followed by snapped stems (32%). We hypothesized that insect-induced mortality, perhaps in combination with drought periods, resulted in the high frequency of snag- and snapped stem-formed gaps. We did not find significant differences in gap size or shape based on gap formation or closure mechanisms. Most gaps (74%) were projected to close by lateral crown expansion of gap perimeter trees. We hypothesized most gaps projected to close via subcanopy recruitment would be captured by a P. palustris stem. The majority of gaps were small and gap frequency declined with increased gap size. We found gaps were significantly clustered through the woodland at distances of 8-36 m from gap edge to gap edge but were randomly distributed beyond 36 m.

AB Lianas are self-supporting systems that are increasing their dominance in tropical forests due to climate change. As lianas increase tree mortality and reduce tree growth, one key challenge in ecological remote sensing is the separation of a liana and its host tree using remote sensing techniques. This separation can provide essential insights into how tropical forests respond, from the point of view of ecosystem structure to climate and environmental change. Here, we propose a new machine learning method, derived from Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting) algorithms, to separate lianas and trees using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) point clouds. We test our method on five tropical dry forest trees with different levels of liana infestation. First, we use a multiple radius search method to define the optimal radius of six geometric features. Second, we compare the performance of RF and XGBoosting algorithms on the classification of lianas and trees. Finally, we evaluate our model against independent data collected by other projects. Our results show that the XGBoosting algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 0.88 (recall of 0.66), and the RF algorithm has an accuracy of 0.85 (recall of 0.56). Our results also show that the optimal radius method is as accurate as the multiple radius method, with F1 scores of 0.49 and 0.48, respectively. The RF algorithm shows the highest recall of 0.88 on the independent data. Our method provides a new flexible approach to extracting lianas from 3D point clouds, facilitating TLS to support new studies aimed to evaluate the impact of lianas on tree and forest structures using point clouds.

AB With increasing concerns about sustainable exploitation of tropical timber, there is a need for developing independent tools to check their origin. We evaluated the potential of tree-ring stable isotopes for identifying four Cedrela species (C. balansae, C. fissilis, C. odorata, and C. saltensis) and for identifying geographic origin of C. fissilis and C. odorata, two of the most intensively exploited species. We studied differences in delta C-13 and delta O-18 of wood among 11 forest sites (163 trees). We quantified isotope composition of 10-year bulk samples, and for a subset we also evaluated isotopic annual fluctuations for the last 10 years. Although annual isotopic variability was not correlated to precipitation or elevation, we found a significant relationship between the 10-year bulk stable-isotope composition and average precipitation and elevation. However these relationships were not consistent across all sites. We also explored isotopic site and species differentiation using Kernel Discriminant Analyses. Site discrimination was low: 30% accuracy for C. odorata, and 40% for C. fissilis sites. However, species discrimination was 57.5% for C. odorata and 95.3% for C. fissilis. These results suggest that although delta C-13 and delta O-18 isotopic analyses hold potential to verify species identification, discrimination of geographical origin within a country may still be challenging.

AB Cities continue to grow worldwide, and the highly modified urban landscape becomes an inhospitable envi-ronment for many species because the natural vegetation cover is commonly fragmented, and the remnants are often isolated. Protected Areas (PAs) located surrounding or within urban areas may not achieve their goal of protecting local or regional biodiversity. Thus, an urban ecological network is essential to support their PAs. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the PAs connectivity in an urban landscape in Brazil and understanding whether urban forest fragments can support an urban ecological network. Besides spatial models based on functional connectivity and graph theory, we used participatory techniques to design the resistance surface and the least-cost paths (LCPs) for Atlantic Forest birds. The results showed critical paths (LCPs), important areas for restoration programs for improving PAs connectivity, and essential forest fragments for conservation and restoration. Although the landscape has a forest structure with 1873 forest fragments and 516 links through which the LCPs were structured, most forest fragments and LCPs cannot provide the necessary support for the PAs connectivity. The current ecological network is dependent on forest fragments neighboring (outside PAs) and the flux dispersions occurred mainly in the peri-urban areas. Riparian zones and anthropic grasslands also showed importance for the PAs connectivity. We identified only 28 forest fragments spatially connected, pre-senting several sizes, and located near large forest areas, relevant PAs, and riparian zones. Six of these forest fragments, smaller than ten hectares and strategically located in the urban matrix, were indicated for restoration actions. The current low connectivity among PAs brings the importance of native vegetation restoration in the riparian zone and anthropic grassland and the importance of the periurban areas to promote biodiversity con-nectivity in the urban landscape.

AB This study aimed at evaluating the effects of unpredictability on behavioral and clinical aspects of Geoffroy's woolly monkey (Lagothrix cana cana) - a frugivorous Amazonian primate species - under human care. We studied seven individuals subjected to five conditions: two control conditions (PRE and POST; 10 days each), and three experimental conditions in which unpredictability was associated to food presentation. Each experimental condition had three intensities (stages): spatial unpredictability (food offer in unusual, changing places; S1, S2, S3), temporal unpredictability (food offer in unusual, changing times; T1, T2, T3), and spatial and temporal unpredictability combined (C1, C2, C3). Each stage lasted 10 days. Behaviors were collected using scan sampling in 24 five-minute daily sessions, with records taken every 20 s. A Behavioral Diversity Index (BDI) was also calculated daily, and welfare assessment was performed at each stage, with the use of the Five Domains Model. Condition T promoted an increase in exploration, and reductions in behaviors indicative of dysfunction, surveillance, maintenance, and in affiliative interactions. In condition S, we found an increase in foraging, and reductions in maintenance behaviors and agonistic interactions. Finally, in condition C, we recorded increases in exploration, and reductions in behaviors indicative of dysfunction, surveillance, maintenance, affiliative and agonistic interactions. Most of these effects have been correlated to improved welfare. The Five Domains Model evaluation also supported an improvement in welfare levels in all experimental stages, compared to PRE condition. Our behavioral and welfare assessment results pointed that unpredictability promoted an improvement in the welfare levels for the animals studied, and is recommended for the maintenance of the species under human care.

AB Ecological mechanisms governing inheritance of bacterial and fungal communities from seed to seed in rice are revealed. The inherited microbes dominate each community at the ripening stage, and parental seeds and stem endosphere are major sources.
   Vertical transmission of microbes is crucial for the persistence of host-associated microbial communities. Although vertical transmission of seed microbes has been reported from diverse plants, ecological mechanisms and dynamics of microbial communities from parent to progeny remain scarce. Here we reveal the veiled ecological mechanism governing transmission of bacterial and fungal communities in rice across two consecutive seasons. We identify 29 bacterial and 34 fungal members transmitted across generations. Abundance-based regression models allow to classify colonization types of the microbes. We find that they are late colonizers dominating each community at the ripening stage. Ecological models further show that the observed temporal colonization patterns are affected by niche change and neutrality. Source-sink modeling reveals that parental seeds and stem endosphere are major origins of progeny seed microbial communities. This study gives empirical evidence for ecological mechanism and dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities as an ecological continuum during seed-to-seed transmission.

AB Conservation genetics provides wildlife managers powerful tools to assist conservation planning, being recognized as an important biodiversity component. Nevertheless, communication between wildlife conservation actors is still not effective. Furthermore, wildlife conservation funds are often allocated to conservation actions incompatible with thorough long-term genetic research. In the Neotropics, the political organization of the territory, the complex socio-economic context, and the environmental heterogeneity impose additional challenges to the use of genetics for wildlife conservation. Here we present an assessment of the state-of-the-art on the conservation genetics of the giant anteater, as a study case. We use this species to discuss key wildlife threats and challenges along nine major Neotropical biomes. We review the main scientific research on the species, comprising and analyzing genetic data, and focusing on each biome and its region-specific threats. Our genetic meta-analysis reveals low levels of genetic diversity for the species, signs of population differentiation and dissimilar demographic trends per biome. Large-scale investigations are needed to disclose between hypotheses of panmixia, population structure and local adaptation, and to better assess the species demography. The limited information available for a known Vulnerable species perfectly illustrates the need for greater and internationally concerted investment in genetic/genomic research in the Neotropics. Finally, we describe the main wildlife conservation challenges per biome assessed, and present open research questions to which genetics could be of paramount importance.

AB We discuss recent methodological developments in inhomogeneous summary statistics and envelope testing and study their applications in the field of spatial point pattern analysis. Specifically, we use these methods to test McGill's theory of biodiversity. This theory is based upon three axioms: individuals of the same species cluster together, many rare species co-exist with a few common ones and individuals of different species grow independently of each other. We assess the validity of the first and third axioms for data obtained from a 50 hectare plot on Barro Colorado Island.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Knowledge of the leaf trait-growth rate relationship is essential for assessing plant physiological performance in forest ecosystems. Intraspecific leaf trait variation may have different effects on tree growth at various spatial and temporal scales. Plant functional-group and life-stage approaches have the potential to clarify the specific roles to understand the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. Our research determined the significance of leaf traits and soil variation in broadleaf and coniferous tree growth across different life stages and habitat types. In a 9 ha Liangshui forest dynamic plot in Northeast China, we used linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to model tree growth as a function of leaf traits and soil variables in three habitat types with different soil organic matter and slope conditions. Tree growth in the broadleaf saplings was more significantly influenced by leaf traits and soil variation than that in the adults. On the other hand, the growth of coniferous adults was more significantly influenced by leaf traits and soil variation than that of the saplings. The influence of leaf traits on the growth of broadleaf saplings was dependent on the habitat type. Soil variation had positive effects on the growth of broadleaf saplings and coniferous adults in the high-nutrient habitat type. Different functional types can provide different insights into the influence of leaf traits on tree growth. To apply leaf traits to forest management, the relationships of plant functional types, life stages, and local environments with tree growth need to be carefully considered, particularly in mixed-species forests with varying tree sizes.

AB Ground beetles (carabids) constitute an important functional component of biodiversity in agroecosystems, mainly because of their role as predators of pests, but also as consumers of weed seeds and as prey to other organisms. Over the past few decades, there has been a marked and continuous decline of ground beetles in Europe, and many species of this insect family are threatened by intensive agricultural practices. The effect of soil tillage, a standard technique in arable farming, on carabids has been investigated in many experimental studies. However, there is currently no clear and differentiated picture of how ground beetles are affected by tillage operations in direct and indirect ways. In this review, we narrow this gap of knowledge and show that the effects of intensive tillage on ground beetles-especially the use of mouldboard ploughing-are extremely variable. Nonetheless, on balance across multiple studies, greater tillage intensity tends to have a negative effect on abundance, species richness, and diversity. The observed variability may partly be attributed to a change in species-specific food availability or habitat conditions, induced by tillage. Tillage effects on dominant species tend to have a strong impact on total carabid abundance. The high variability of carabid responses to tillage is also a consequence of various modifying factors such as cover cropping, rotations, and variations in weed control associated with tillage. Because different modes of tillage tend to affect different carabid species, the diversification of tillage operations within a farm or region may contribute to the overall diversity of carabid communities.

AB Across the globe, non-native plant species have become abundant in many tropical forests, resulting in altered patterns of biological diversity and species composition, and impacting important ecosystem functions. However, long-term experimental research on the efficacy of non-native tree removal for tropical forest restoration remains limited. We investigated the removal of non-native tree species in a mesic tropical forest in Hawai'i, where rates of endemism and endangerment of plant species is high and multiple non-native tree species are abundant. As a collaboration between resource managers and researchers, we tested the effects of non-native tree removal on overstory and understory metrics of restoration using three restoration approaches: "total cut " (cutting all non-native trees); "girdle " (girdle of all non-native trees); and "selective cut " (cutting approximately 50% of nonnative trees). Prior to removal, we established permanent plots (four 10 x 10 m plots per restoration treatment, with 10 1 x 1 m subplots in each), then monitored them over 10 years. Across all treatments, canopy openness increased significantly post restoration, peaked after three years, then decreased to pre-treatment levels or lower. The increase was largest for the total cut treatment, but there was large variation within treatments. By the end of the experiment, the total cut and girdle treatments performed similarly for all our metrics of restoration, including survival, growth, density, and basal area of native trees; density and richness of native species in the understory; and total weed biomass. The selective treatment performed worse, showing lower relative gains in basal area of native trees and density of native understory individuals. Overall, tree removal was effective in restoring a native canopy. However, understory native species richness and density remained at pre-treatment levels, likely due to limited seed dispersal, seed predation by non-native rodents, and continued competition from non-native herbaceous species. Nonetheless, subplots with the best starting conditions performed the best. More intensive and longer-term weeding of non-native species in the understory, focused on areas with the best starting conditions and combined with out-planting of native seeds, seedlings and/or saplings, is likely necessary to foster effective native species regeneration. Overall, our research shows that removal of non-native trees using the total cut and girdle techniques can foster native forest restoration in the mesic forests of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, but that ongoing long-term management in the understory is critical.

AB The tension between the large global demand for tropical timber, and ecological sustainability and local socioeconomic development in the fragile natural ecosystems of the Amazon region has challenged many generations. In this case study, carried out in an ecotone forest in the northern Brazilian Amazon, we seek to demonstrate how forest management can became more sustainable through silvicultural prescriptions that reduce forest degradation and soil erosion. We evaluated the effects of the sustainable forest management (SFM) on tree diversity, timber volumes, and carbon stocks. A continuous forest inventory was carried out in nine 1-ha permanent plots (900 subplots of 100 m2), distributed in three treatments with three repetitions: T1 = control without selective logging, T2 = SFM, and T3 = SFM + silvicultural treatment of thinning release by tree girdling and poisoning. SFM was carried out with an average of three commercial timber trees harvested per hectare with DBH (diameter at breast height) >= 50 cm, corresponding to a timber volume of 20 +/- 6 m3 ha-1, equivalent to the removal of 7 +/- 2 Mg C ha-1 (5% of the original C). The formation of clearings (gaps) arising from the falling of exploited trees (0.12 +/- 0.09 ha) resulted in greater impacts on the forest structure than the construction of 4 m skidder trails (0.06 +/- 0.04 ha), with an average of 7 +/- 4 damaged trees ha-1 and 5 +/- 3 dead trees ha-1. Although six trees species became locally extinct, tree diversity was little altered, and timber volumes and forest carbon volume stocks remained essentially constant at this average logging intensity. Based on our results, sustainable forest management can become an efficient model for land use in the Amazon when harvesting is carried out using this average logging intensity. However, long-term monitoring studies using permanent plots in ecotone forests in the Brazilian Amazon will still be necessary. Quantifying, evaluating, and reporting impacts related to forest management will enable the formation of an empirical basis to support sustanaible forestry practices and for updating environmental legislation, contributing to local socioeconomic development, and maintaining the environmental services provided globally by tropical forests.

AB Exploring the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in shaping community composition is crucial to gain insights into community assembly. At present, however, their roles in riparian plant communities remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the responses of taxonomic and functional trait compositions of riparian plant communities to environmental and spatial factors in the upper Han River basin, China. We aimed to (1) investigate the responses of both taxonomic composition and functional traits to anthropogenic disturbances and (2) compare the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in affecting both taxonomic and functional trait compositions. Results showed that species diversity of riparian plant communities was highest under mild disturbance, and both types of riparian plant community composition were strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities. In addition, the riparian plant community compositions in the upper Han River basin were driven by both environmental and spatial factors. Compared to spatial factors, environmental filtering was more important in explaining species composition, while the opposite trend was observed for functional composition due to the high environmental heterogeneity of the 5 tributaries and the reproductive mode from riparian plants. Thus, for assessment and management of riparian vegetation, the taxonomic and functional characteristics of communities should be considered as they may respond to important drivers and anthropogenic disturbances differently.

AB Plant litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems involves the physical and chemical breakdown of organic matter. Development of databases is a promising tool for achieving a predictive understanding of organic matter degradation at regional and global scales. In this paper, we present aridec, a comprehensive open database containing litter mass loss data from aridlands across the world. We describe in detail the structure of the database and discuss general patterns in the data. Then, we explore what are the most appropriate model structures to integrate with data on litter decomposition from the database by conducting a collinearity analysis. The database includes 184 entries from aridlands across the world, representing a wide range of climates. For the majority of the data gathered in aridec, it is possible to fit models of litter decomposition that consider initial organic matter as a homogenous reservoir (one pool models), as well as models with two distinct types of organic compounds that decompose at different speeds (two pool models). Moreover, these two carbon pools can either decompose without interaction (parallel models) or with matter transfer from a labile pool to a slowly decomposing pool after transformation (series models). Although most entries in the database can be used to fit these models, we suggest that potential users of this database test identifiability for each individual case as well as the number of degrees of freedom. Other model applications that are not discussed in this publication might also be suitable for use with this database. Lastly, we give some recommendations for future decomposition studies to be potentially added to this database. The extent of the information included in aridec in addition to its open-science approach makes it a great platform for future collaborative efforts in the field of aridland biogeochemistry.

AB Forest fragmentation is a major driver of tropical bird endangerment, yet the mechanisms underlying species losses in fragmented landscapes remain poorly known. Loss of foraging microhabitats and food diversity in fragmented landscapes are potential mechanisms explaining fragmentation sensitivity. We, therefore, measured the body condition (i.e., body mass adjusted for individual size) of 20 tropical understory birds as a proxy for food availability across gradients of fragment patch size and silvicultural histories in the Western Andes of Colombia. Specifically, we asked (1) if body condition correlates with patch size, edge effects, or selective logging disturbance; and (2) if species responses were driven by the same explanatory variables or varied idiosyncratically. We documented significant variation in body condition with covariates in 11 of 20 (55%) understory bird species, and 55% of significant correlations were with fragmentation and selective-logging associated variables. Species responses were idiosyncratic and contrasting, with at least 1 significant response to each fragmentation-related covariate. Most effects, however, were driven by logging-induced changes to vegetation structure including loss of large-diameter trees, reduction in foliage height diversity and canopy cover, and loss of understory vegetation. The body condition of frugivores and nectarivores increased with logging-induced shifts in vegetation structure, with canopy gaps potentially favoring early-successional fruiting and flowering plants. By contrast, some insectivores suffered lower body condition with loss of vegetation structure (reduced foliage height diversity). Overall, our data support the hypothesis that fragmentation and selective logging change food resources available to birds and that some widespread nectarivores, frugivores, and omnivores may benefit from increasing edge density and logging-driven vegetation disturbance. We also documented significant positive effects of breeding condition on body condition, however, highlighting the need to control for this factor. Body condition may therefore be a useful index of habitat suitability when paired with analyses of abundance and demographic changes.
   Lay Summary center dot Body condition, body weight adjusted for body size, is a measure of food availability for birds, but has never been used to evaluate the hypothesis that loss of food leads to the local extirpation of birds in tropical forest fragments. center dot We used mist-net captures to measure the effects of forest patch size, amount of forest edge, and selective logging on the body condition of Andean birds across a range of patch sizes in Colombia. center dot Half of significant correlations of environmental variables with body condition were with fragmentation- and logging-related covariates, but responses were variable across species (both positive and negative). center dot Changes to vegetation structure from selective logging explained two-thirds of significant responses, likely due to differences in the availability of food plants and foraging habitats. center dot Contrasting responses to logging disturbance were related to the foraging behavior of each species, suggesting that gain or loss of food resources is a mechanism explaining positive or negative effects, respectively, of logging on tropical bird communities.

AB Some studies suggest that canopy gaps are not crucial for woody species recruitment in typhoon-disturbed forests because of frequently defoliated forest crowns and invariant high-light levels under the forest canopy. Here we examined this speculation focusing on seedling establishment stages and forest floor light in a forest with annual return frequencies of typhoons. We monitored light (photosynthetically active radiation; PAR) and seedling dynamics in 75 seedling quadrats (each 1 x 1 m(2)) for eight years in Nanjenshan tropical lowland forest, Taiwan (2043 newly recruited seedlings; 199 advance regeneration seedlings). Due to attenuation by the understorey vegetation, only 24% of the PAR that penetrated the forest canopy reached the forest floor. We found that PAR transmittance on the forest floor was heterogeneous temporally, ranging from 0.01 to 15.6%. Nonetheless, shade-intolerant species established at relatively high median values of light transmittance, compared to species of the moderate and tolerant groups, indicating that light is a crucial resource at the establishment stage. However, many seedlings died in relatively high-light conditions, suggesting that factors other than low light were more critical for survival. The generally low-light environment on the forest floor also resulted in similar composition and slow growth of seedlings across quadrats, except for a few in extraordinary high-light quadrats. In conclusion, the temporal light environment below the understorey layer was heterogeneous and was critical for differentiated establishment and growth patterns of newly recruited seedlings. Thus, besides canopy gaps, the light attenuation effect caused by understorey vegetation plays an essential role in the early establishment stage of seedlings in a forest frequently disturbed by typhoons.

AB Context. Many grassland forb populations have greatly diminished because their habitat coincides with prime agricultural land and remnants lack appropriate disturbance regimes. Aim. The aim of the current study is to examine the survivorship, vegetative recruitment, biomass and sexual reproduction of S. papaverifolium in response to burning in one of a few natural surviving populations in Queensland. Methods. We monitored the survivorship, vegetative recruitment, and reproduction of a rare native forb, Solanum papaverifolium, within a randomised replicated experiment by using 14 circular plots measuring 12.56 m(2) (2 m radius). Key results. Plant survival rate after 5 months was greater in the burnt plots (56%) than the unburnt plots (44%). Vegetative recruitment from suckers in the burnt plots was almost twice that in the unburnt plots. The probability of flowering was also enhanced by burning. Fruit set in new recruits was higher in the burnt plots (20%) than in the unburnt plots (5%). Whereas fruiting did not occur in unburnt plots for surviving plants that flowered, only 1% fruited in the burnt plots. Seedling production was not observed. Conclusion. Previous studies have demonstrated that the subtropical grassland flora in the study region is unaffected by burning, whereas the present study suggests that some grassland species respond positively to burning. Implications. Although fire increased flowering in this species, suggesting that fire may be a useful tool to stimulate sexual reproduction, ongoing research is required to understand the precise factors that promote flowering after burning and the barriers to seedling reproduction.

AB Responses of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change have been explored in many regions worldwide. While continued drying and warming may alter process rates and deteriorate the state and performance of ecosystems, it could also lead to more fundamental changes in the mechanisms governing ecosystem functioning. Here we argue that climate change will induce unprecedented shifts in these mechanisms in historically wetter climatic zones, towards mechanisms currently prevalent in dry regions, which we refer to as 'dryland mechanisms'. We discuss 12 dryland mechanisms affecting multiple processes of ecosystem functioning, including vegetation development, water flow, energy budget, carbon and nutrient cycling, plant production and organic matter decomposition. We then examine mostly rare examples of the operation of these mechanisms in non-dryland regions where they have been considered irrelevant at present. Current and future climate trends could force microclimatic conditions across thresholds and lead to the emergence of dryland mechanisms and their increasing control over ecosystem functioning in many biomes on Earth.
   In drylands, there are unique mechanisms that influence multiple ecosystem processes. In this Perspective, the authors identify these dryland mechanisms and show that they could become more important in non-dryland regions or areas that will become drier in the future.

AB In this study dedicated to Winfried Lampert, we present a suite of case studies which successfully combined empirical long-term and experimental data with theory to identify mechanisms driving the non-linear dynamics and critical transitions in a lake ecosystem under environmental change. The theoretical concepts used include Warning Indicators. Only by linking theory with data do we gain a mechanistic understanding of the dynamics and long-term changes observed in the case study sites ??? allowing for realistic projections under different climate change scenarios. If this combined approach correctly identifies the mechanisms governing change in case studies, then upscaling beyond the case study at hand is likely feasible. Indeed, for most of the presented case studies, identified mechanisms were confirmed by explicitly linking them to relevant recent studies based on large-scale global data sets. These include the rise in lake ice intermittency, shifts in thermal regime and the amplification of lake???s trophic state in a warmer world. This link also documents the importance and value of re-using long-term records under the FAIR data principles in international initiatives. Further, in the context of linking theory and data, largescale data has the unique ability to test the general validity of a theory, thus giving valuable feedback to theory.

AB Understanding the effects of forest-to-agriculture conversion on microbial diversity has been a major goal in soil ecological studies. However, linking community assembly to the ruling ecological processes at local and regional scales remains challenging. Here, we evaluated bacterial community assembly patterns and the ecological processes governing niche specialization in a gradient of geography, seasonality, and land-use change, totaling 324 soil samples, 43 habitat characteristics (abiotic factors), and 16 metabolic and co-occurrence patterns (biotic factors), in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, a subtropical biome recognized as one the world's largest and most threatened hotspots of biodiversity. Pairwise beta diversities were lower in pastures than in forest and no-till soils. Pasture communities showed a predominantly neutral model, regarding stochastic processes, with moderate dispersion, leading to biotic homogenization. Most no-till and forest microbial communities followed a niche-based model, with low rates of dispersal and weak homogenizing selection, indicating niche specialization or variable selection. Historical and evolutionary contingencies, as represented by soil type, season, and dispersal limitation were the main drivers of microbial assembly and processes at the local scale, markedly correlated with the occurrence of endemic microbes. Our results indicate that the patterns of assembly and their governing processes are dependent on the niche occupancy of the taxa evaluated (generalists or specialists). They are also more correlated with historical and evolutionary contingencies and the interactions among taxa (i.e., co-occurrence patterns) than the land-use change itself.

AB Purpose We evaluated the importance of dry season (summer) sunlight on carbon (C) turnover in a Mediterranean-type climate ecosystem in the context of spatially heterogenous distribution of vegetation. Methods We manipulated summer sunlight exposure of litter and soil at the ecosystem scale in a natural Patagonian woodland over two years and evaluated its effect on C turnover in litter and surface soil. We measured decomposition of standing dead litter of dominant grass and shrub species, changes in labile C pools in soil microsites with and without plant litter, and potential enzyme activity of litter and both soil microsites, evaluating seasonal and legacy effects of summer sunlight exposure. Results Summer sunlight exposure significantly increased standing litter decomposition for both shrub and grass litter (p < 0.05). Additionally, summer sunlight significantly increased labile carbohydrate availability (saccharification) and potential microbial enzymatic activity of grass (but not shrub) litter. Interestingly, summer sunlight exposure also had effects on soil, reducing by 50% labile organic C while stimulating potential extracellular enzyme activity in both soil microsites, with and without plant litter. Conclusion Summer sunlight accelerates C loss from standing litter and soil consistently across patches of heterogeneously distributed vegetation. In addition, sunlight exposure demonstrated carryover effects on the acceleration of grass litter decay in the following rainy season, when sunlight increased decomposition five times more than in the dry season. These results suggest that summer sunlight is an important and lasting control of C turnover at the ecosystem scale even in seasonally and spatially heterogenous ecosystems.

AB Drylands, which cover > 40% of Earth's terrestrial surface, are dominant drivers of global biogeochemical cycling and home to more than one third of the global human population. Climate projections predict warming, drought frequency and severity, and evaporative demand will increase in drylands at faster rates than global means. As a consequence of extreme temperatures and high biological dependency on limited water availability, drylands are predicted to be exceptionally sensitive to climate change and, indeed, significant climate impacts are already being observed. However, our understanding and ability to forecast climate change effects on dryland biogeochemistry and ecosystem functions lag behind many mesic systems. To improve our capacity to forecast ecosystem change, we propose focusing on the controls and consequences of two key characteristics affecting dryland biogeochemistry: (1) high spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions and (2) generalized resource scarcity. In addition to climate change, drylands are experiencing accelerating land-use change. Building our understanding of dryland biogeochemistry in both intact and disturbed systems will better equip us to address the interacting effects of climate change and landscape degradation. Responding to these challenges will require a diverse, globally distributed and interdisciplinary community of dryland experts united towards better understanding these vast and important ecosystems.

AB Analyzing the impacts of agricultural activities on biodiversity requires a full knowledge of the ecology of the studied species. Using a trait-based approach may improve our ability to understand land use impacts on less well-studied species in order to establish general trends that will facilitate the prediction of these impacts. In this study, we applied a trait-based approach to understand the impact of land use change on ant communities in the Colombian Llanos region. Five common land uses were considered (annual crops, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, improved pastures and semi-natural savannas) to test whether some morphological traits respond to soil properties and land uses. An RLQ analysis shows a significant common structure between species distribution, environmental factors, and morphological ant traits. This indicates that morphological traits could be used to predict the response of ant communities in different land uses since they respond to environmental characteristics as vegetation complexity, composition and management. Based on the selected morphological ant traits, three groups of land uses were differentiated: grazing-based systems, agroforestry plantations and annual crops. Agroforestry plantations, especially rubber plantations tend to host larger and specialized ant species, while grazing-based systems (i.e. improved pastures) mainly host small and generalist ants, and annual crops host more pigmented ants. These findings suggest that certain morphological traits can reflect the ability of ant species to settle down and survive in a given land use system. Our study shows that improving knowledge about trait environment associations could be a useful way to better understand how ecological filtering shape neotropical ant communities and how they respond to landscape transformation and land use changes.

AB Avian nectar-robbing is common in some floras but its impact on plant-pollinator mutualisms, flowering phenology, and the evolution of floral traits remains largely unexplored. Surprisingly, there have been no quantitative studies of the topography and extent of floral damage inflicted on any flowering species by nectar-robbing birds. I studied nectar-robbing of orchard oriole (Icteridae: Icterus spurius) on the large reddish-orange flowers of trumpet creeper (Bignoniaceae: Campsis radicans), an ornithophilous liana of eastern North America. Floral traits that inhibit nectar-robbery by hummingbirds and bees, such as the thickened calyx and sympetalous corolla, are ineffective in deterring orioles. Orioles target the zygomorphic trumpet-shaped corollas at the 11:00 h or 01:00 h positions with a closed-bill puncture and then enlarge the incision with bill-gaping to reach the nectary. More than 92% of flowers were robbed when orioles were present. Fruit set was nil until orioles departed on fall migration in late July-early August. The timing suggests oriole nectary-robbery may be a potent selection agent for an extended flowering season or delay in the onset of flowering. The biological and geographic attributes of the Campsis-Icterus association make it a promising model system for studying the consequences of avian nectar-robbery on pollination biology and floral trait evolution.

AB The 'Critically Endangered' Black-winged Trumpeter Psophia obscura is endemic to the Belem Centre of Endemism in extreme eastern Amazonia and has a declining population and range. Here we report on a five-year (2016-2020) systematic camera-trap (n = 61) study of the species in Gurupi Biological Reserve, one of its most important conservation areas. We used a multi-season occupancy model to identify factors affecting occupancy rates and to assess occupancy trends in the reserve. Occupancy was negatively related to elevation and site-level tree density, and was positively related to post-logging recovery times. Average annual occupancy rates remained stable throughout the study period (ranging between 0.57 and 0.67) and this stability was largely driven by high between-year survival rates. Results confirm that the Black-winged Trumpeter is an interior-forest specialist that is highly sensitive to forest disturbance, which underlines the importance of the Gurupi Biological Reserve as a core site for the conservation of the species. However, the species is long-lived, so continuous monitoring is needed to further clarify population trends. We also recommended that the status of the species in other forest remnants, most of which remain unprotected, is assessed.

AB Disturbances elicit both positive and negative effects on organisms; these effects vary in their strength and their timing. Effects of disturbance interval (i.e., the length of time between disturbances) on population growth will depend on both the timing and strength of positive and negative effects of disturbances. Climate change can modify the relative strengths of these positive and negative effects, leading to altered optimal disturbance intervals (the disturbance interval at which population growth rate is highest) and changes in the sensitivity of population growth rate to disturbance interval. While we know that climate may alter impacts of disturbance in some systems, we have a poor understanding of which effects of disturbance and which vital rates might drive an altered response to disturbance interval in a changing climate. We use demographic monitoring of natural populations of Dionaea muscipula, the Venus flytrap, that have experienced natural and managed fires, combined with realistic past and future climate projections, to construct climate- and fire-driven integral projection models (IPMs). We use these IPMs to compare the effect of fire return interval (FRI) on population growth rate in past and future climates. To dissect the mechanisms driving FRI response, we then construct IPMs with demographic data from an experimental manipulation of fire effects (ash addition, neighbor removal) and an accidental fire. Our results show that an FRI of 10 years is optimal for D. muscipula in past climate conditions, but a longer FRI (12 years) is optimal in future climate conditions. Further, deviations from optimal FRI reduce population growth rate dramatically in the past climate, but this reduction is muted in a future climate (future minus past sensitivity = 0.006, 95% CI [0.002, 0.011]). Finally, our experimental work suggests that fire effects are driven in part by positive, additive effects of competitor removal and ash addition immediately following a fire; for one population, both these treatments significantly increased population growth rate. Our work suggests that climate change can alter the response of populations to disturbance, highlighting the need to consider the interacting effects of multiple abiotic drivers when projecting future population growth and geographical distributions.

AB Primates can respond to food availability shortages by increasing the energy they invest in searching for alternative food resources or by conserving energy by altering their diet while reducing movement. To gain information on the ecological flexibility of Beni titi monkeys (Plecturocebus modestus), we assessed seasonal variation in the behavior and ranging and feeding patterns of two focal groups across a year. We recorded group behaviors using instantaneous group scan sampling and used all occurrence sampling to collect ranging and feeding data (1,178 observation hours in the dry season, and 1,202 in the wet season). We collected data on food availability via monthly phenology monitoring. We found that during the fruit-scarce dry season, these frugivorous primates significantly reduced their monthly investment in moving and increased their consumption of flowers. They also showed some decrease in fruit consumption, home ranges and daily path length. Our observations of a diet shift to a high intake of alternative foods and reduction of time spent on moving suggest that the P. modestus groups that we studied used an energy-area minimizing strategy when fruits were less available. While we found that P. modestus could find food in the naturally fragmented forests, high levels of ongoing anthropogenic forest fragmentation may lead to reductions in important food resources, threatening the survival of these Endangered primates. This study shows the ecological flexibility of primates and provides important information to be incorporated in the design of specific effective conservation actions for this threatened an endemic species, as well as highlights the importance of mitigating the current threats to these forest ecosystems.

AB We used data on the species composition of regional assemblages of fleas and their small mammalian hosts from 6 biogeographic realms and applied a novel method of step-down factor analyses (SDFA) and cluster analyses to identify biogeographic (across the entire globe) and ecological (within a realm across the main terrestrial biomes) clusters of these assemblages. We found that, at the global scale, the clusters of regional assemblage loadings on SDFA axes reflected well the assemblage distribution, according to the biogeographic realms to which they belong. At the global scale, the cluster topology, corresponding to the biogeographic realms, was similar between flea and host assemblages, but the topology of subtrees within realm-specific clusters substantially differed between fleas and hosts. At the scale of biogeographic realms, the distribution of regional flea and host assemblages did not correspond to the predominant biome types. Assemblages with similar loadings on SDFA axes were often situated in different biomes and vice versa. The across-biome, within-realm distributions of flea vs host assemblages suggested weak congruence between these distributions. Our results indicate that dispersal is a predominant mechanism of flea and host community assembly across large regions.

AB Epiphytes are still an understudied plant group in Amazonia. The aim of this study was to identify distributional patterns and conservation priorities for vascular epiphyte assemblages (VEA) across Amazonia. We compiled the largest Amazonian epiphyte plot database to date, through a multinational collaborative effort of 22 researchers and 32 field sites located across four Amazonian countries - the Amazonian Epiphyte Network (AEN). We addressed the following continental-scale questions by utilizing the AEN database comprising 96,448 epiphyte individuals, belonging to 518 vascular taxa, and growing on 10,907 tree individuals (phorophytes). Our objectives here are, first, to present a qualitative evaluation of the geographic distribution of the study sites and highlight regional lacunae as priorities for future quantitative inventories. Second, to present the floristic patterns for Amazonia-wide VEA and third, to combine multivariate analyses and rank abundance curves, controlled by major Amazonian habitat types, to determine how VEA vary geographically and ecologically based on major Amazonian habitat types. Three of the most striking patterns found are that: (1) VEA are spatially structured as floristic similarity decays with geographic distance; (2) a core group of 22 oligarchic taxa account for more than a half of all individuals; and (3) extensive floristic sampling gaps still exist, mainly across the highly threatened southern Amazonian deforestation belt. This work represents a first step toward unveiling distributional pattern of Amazonian VEA, which is important to guide future questions on ecology and species distribution ranges of VEA once the collaborative database grows allowing a clearer view of patterns.

AB This study seeks to use machine learning to investigate the role of meteorological and climate variables on wildfire occurrence in the Arctic and the global tropical forests biomes. Using monthly fire counts observed by the MODIS satellites in combination with temperature and precipitation data, indices of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic anomalies (teleconnections), and global temperature anomalies (GT), a combined wavelet-machine learning approach is developed to identify drivers of variability in global wildfire counts on a monthly scale. Precipitation and temperature are found to be the most important predictors of wildfire count in all regions. In addition, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and GT are identified as the two major drivers of wildfire occurrence. Results indicate that the record-breaking 2019 wildfires in the Asian Arctic can be attributed to unusually warm and dry weather, while the recent increase in wildfires in Amazonia rather can be attributed to regional human activities.

AB An interim hierarchical classification (i.e. biogeographical regionalisation or area taxonomy) of the world's terrestrial regions is provided, following the work of Morrone published in Australian Systematic Botany in 2015. Area names are listed according to the International Code of Area Nomenclature so as to synonymise redundant names. The interim global terrestrial regionalisation to the subregion level recognises 3 kingdoms, 2 subkingdoms, 8 regions, 21 subregions and 5 transition zones. No new names are proposed for the regions; however, Lydekker's Line is renamed Illiger's Line. We note that some regions still require area classification at the subregion level, particularly the Palearctic, Ethiopian and Oriental regions. Henceforth, the following interim global regionalisation may be used as a template for further revisions and additions of new areas in the future.

AB Studies that aim to quantify and analyze the dynamics of vegetation growth provide information for the management and conservation of forests over time. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to analyze the dynamics and growth in basal area, at different intervals (2008-2016; 2008-2017 and 2008-2019), in two areas with different disturbance and use histories, in the municipality of Forest -PE. Forty permanent plots measuring 20 mx 20 m were installed, with data collection from the year 2008 to 2019, in two areas, A1: less conserved and A2: more conserved, in which individuals and shafts with a circumference of 1.30 were measured m from the ground >= 6 cm. The number of individuals and stems per species was verified, calculating the basal area at different intervals, rates of entry, mortality, gross and net growth, including and excluding entries. A decrease in the number of individuals and stems over the years was observed for both areas, however, there was an increase in the basal area of the A1, 2008: 3.1 m2.1.6ha-1; 2016: 3.8 m2.1.6ha-1; 2017: 3.9 m2.1.6ha-1 and 2019: 4.6 m2.1.6ha-1, while in (A2) the reverse occurred, with an initial basal area of 8.3 m2.1.6ha-1; 6.4 m2.1.6ha-1; 6.4 m2.1.6ha-1; and 7.0 m2.1.6ha-1, respectively, it was also found that in years with less rain the basal area had a lower mean value, the inverse is true, higher precipitated volume means an increase in basal area. Although A1 stood out, the high mortality rates of stems and individuals in all studied intervals caused the basal area to gradually decrease, the net growth was affected. basal, showing climate dependence, impacting forest dynamics.

AB In this study, we used retrospective dendroclimatological analyses to explore whether El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and local precipitation patterns have an influence on tree growth in Suriname, a country located on the Guiana Shield, as annual precipitation patterns on the Guiana Shield are related to ENSO. Discs were taken from 20 trees of Cedrela odorata, whose stem forms very distinct annual growth rings, for tree ring analyses. The trees grew in unmanaged tropical wet forests of Suriname. The tree-ring series of individual trees started between 1836 and 1931 and extended over a period of 84-180 years. The 20 dated series were utilized for constructing a tree-ring chronology. Unlike many other studies that used local anomalies such as flood pulse, precipitation, and drought events to describe the influence of El Nino on tree growth, we used monthly precipitation and ENSO indices as predictors of tree growth to calculate response and correlation functions. The study observed that tree ring growth of Cedrela odorata is influenced by precipitation in August and June of the current year and in August of the previous year, as well as by the ENSO indices SSTA, TSA, TNA, and NAO. Systematic increases in the strength of the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection due to climate change could affect the growth of trees on the Guiana Shield.

AB Previous studies have focused on the functional traits of trees, while undergrowth shrubs have not received the same attention. We collected 97 shrubs from 6 habitats in 3 diameter classes to measure the functional traits of Lonicera fragrantissima var. lancifolia, which is one of the dominant species in the shrub layer of the Qinling Huangguan plot. We found that leaf thickness (LT) decreased with an increase in diameter classes. Other functional traits did not change significantly with the diameter classes. Most of the functional traits changed with the habitats, which may be influenced by topography and soil. On the whole, Lonicera fragrantissima var. lancifolia showed low variation, which indicates that its growth was stable and good. The relationships between functional traits within species was in accordance with the leaf economic spectrum. The positive correlation between soil total nitrogen (STN) and C:N verified the "nutrition luxury hypothesis".

AB We investigated how different degrees of shading affected growth, morphology, and biomass allocation in seedlings from two coniferous and three broadleaved species. The experiment was conducted in a shade house over a 1-year period. Our results showed that under increasing shade, seedlings from most species exhibited lower total biomass, net assimilation rates, relative growth rates, root mass ratios, and root/shoot ratios. In contrast, the slenderness quotients, leaf area ratios, and specific leaf areas increased with increasing shade. For coniferous species, growth traits were relatively more plastic (responsive to shade) than morphology or biomass allocation traits, whereas for broadleaved species, growth and biomass allocation were the most shade-sensitive traits. When comparing coniferous versus broadleaved species, the former had a higher growth plasticity index and lower allocation plasticity than the latter. Root biomass and stem mass ratio were the most and least plastic traits in response to shading. Our results indicate that shade differentially affects coniferous and broadleaved species in terms of their growth, morphology, and biomass allocation. These findings have important implications for the establishment and maintenance of mixed-species stands.

AB Little is known about the competition between and niche differentiation of water and nutrients between angiosperm and gymnosperm tree species under prolonged drought stress, especially in fragile environments. We imposed 21 d drought and competition treatments on Broussonetia papyrifera and Platycladus orientalis and measured water, N, and P contents, the isotopic composition of N and C, the activity of P assimilation enzymes, and stomatal conductance under solo planting and mixed planting to characterize resource diversity and competition in response to treatments. The N content, delta C-13, delta N-15, phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, g(s), and foliage water content were significantly affected by the soil water content. The delta N-15 content in young leaves showed that N competition between these two plants could be alleviated through niche differentiation, but the changes in the PDE: PME ratio for these two plants indicated that they lost the niche differentiation of the P source under drought stress. Additionally, it was observed that foliage water content, WUE, N contents, and N and P sources were significantly affected by interspecific competition, and Broussonetia papyrifera benefited from water competition under moderate drought. Our results indicate that plants have different competition and niche differentiation modes to different nutrients under drought stress, and the effect of interspecific water competition should be seriously considered in mixed forests in semiarid areas.

AB Identifying the mechanisms that underlie the assembly of plant communities is critical to the conservation of terrestrial biodiversity. However, it is seldom measured or quantified how much deterministic versus stochastic processes contribute to community assembly in alpine meadows. Here, we measured the decay in community similarity with spatial and environmental distance in the Zoige Plateau. Furthermore, we used redundancy analysis (RDA) to divide the variations in the relative abundance of plant families into four components to assess the effects of environmental and spatial. Species assemblage similarity liner declined with geographical distance (p < .001, R-2 = .6388), and it decreased significantly with increasing distance of total phosphorus (TP), alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), available potassium (AK), nitrate nitrogen (NO3+-N), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N). Environmental and spatial variables jointly explained a large proportion (55.2%) of the variation in the relative abundance of plant families. Environmental variables accounted for 13.1% of the total variation, whereas spatial variables accounted for 11.4%, perhaps due to the pronounced abiotic gradients in the alpine areas. Our study highlights the mechanism of plant community assembly in the alpine ecosystem, where environmental filtering plays a more important role than dispersal limitation. In addition, a reasonably controlled abundance of Compositae (the family with the highest niche breadth and large niche overlap value with Gramineae and Cyperaceae) was expected to maintain sustainable development in pastoral production. These results suggest that management measures should be developed with the goal of improving or maintaining suitable local environmental conditions.

AB Question The Cerrado is a global biodiversity hotspot, highly threatened by changes in land use. Alterations in species composition and the colonization of Cerrado grasslands by woody species can lead to long-term changes in these communities. In this study, we investigated changes over 20 years in three grassland areas, in terms of species richness and diversity and growth-form cover, as well as the effects of shrub and grass encroachment on species richness. Location Cerrado Brazilian savanna, moist grassland and dry shrub grassland. Areas under low and high anthropogenic pressure. Methods Plant species composition and cover were sampled on seven occasions between the years 2000 and 2020, in permanent line-transects. We compared plant cover, richness, diversity and growth-form cover between the periods for each area. Next, we developed mixed-effect linear models to test whether species richness in grasslands at the latest sampling event was altered by species representing 70% of the species cover at this time. Results Grasslands located in areas under higher anthropogenic pressure presented reduced richness and diversity, and cover concentrated on a few species of shrubs and large tussock grasses. Moist grassland undergoing encroachment by the native shrub Trembleya parviflora had lost over 50% of its diversity since encroachment. In the same area, a shrub grassland undergoing encroachment by native shrub Raulinoreitzia tremula, three native grass species and one exotic grass presented significantly reduced species richness. The moist grassland in an area under low anthropogenic pressure showed a reordering of the species cover over time, but a decrease in species richness. Conclusion We observed changes in plant richness, diversity, cover, composition and growth-form cover over a period of 20 years in grassland communities. We found, however, different trajectories in the three grassland areas sampled, mainly due to the encroachment of a few species, leading to floristic homogenization in grasslands located in areas under high anthropogenic pressure.

AB We study the probability of fixation in a stochastic two-species competition model. By identifying a naturally occurring fast timescale, we derive an approximation to the associated backward Kolmogorov equation that allows us to obtain an explicit closed form solution for the probability of fixation of either species. We use our result to study fitness tradeoff strategies and show that, despite some tradeoffs having nearly negligible effects on the corresponding deterministic dynamics, they can have large implications for the outcome of the stochastic system.

AB Pollination is essential for ecosystem functioning, yet our understanding of the empirical consequences of species loss for plant-pollinator interactions remains limited. It is hypothesized that the loss of abundant and generalized (well-connected) species from a pollination network will have a large effect on the remaining species and their interactions. However, to date, relatively few studies have experimentally removed species from their natural setting to address this hypothesis. We investigated the consequences of losing an abundant, generalist native species from a series of plant-pollinator networks by experimentally removing the flowers of Helianthella quinquenervis (Asteraceae) from half of a series of 10 paired plots (15 m diameter) within a subalpine ecosystem. We then asked how the localized loss of this species influenced patterns of pollinator visitation, floral visitor composition, and interaction network structure. The experimental removal of Helianthella flowers led to an overall decline in plot-level pollinator visitation rates and shifts in pollinator composition. Species-level responses to floral removal differed between the two other abundant, co-flowering plants in our experiment: Potentilla pulcherrima received higher visitation rates, whereas Erigeron speciosus visitation rates did not change. Experimental floral removal altered the structural properties of the localized plant-pollinator networks such that they were more specialized, less nested, and less robust to further species loss. Such changes to interaction network structure were consistently driven more by species turnover than by interaction rewiring. Our findings suggest that the local loss of an abundant, well-linked, generalist plant can bring about diverse responses within intact pollination networks, including potential competitive and facilitative effects for individual species, changes to network structure that may render them more sensitive to future change, but also numerous changes to interactions that may also suggest flexibility in response to species loss.

AB The separation of two sister groups such as ants and bees in the Cretaceous involved the development of distinctive characteristics to occupy separate ecological niches. From the point of view of biology and ecology, it is important to see how different life history strategies affect the physiology of these insects. The fat body is the most metabolically important tissue in the organism of each insect. Therefore, we conducted a comparative analysis of the morphological image of the subcuticular fat body in different localisation/segments in Formica (Seviformica) cinerea and Apis mellifera mellifera foragers, because of the similarity of their functions in colonies. We observed that the fat bodies of ants and bees were composed of the same cell types: trophocytes and oenocytes. However, in each of the segments, the fat body cells in ants were bigger and there were fewer of them in comparison with bees. The dorsal part of the fat body of ants had a bilayer structure, where the outer layer was formed by binucleated oenocytes. Binucleated oenocytes were also found in the inner layer near the heart and tracheole. In bees, the fat body was unilayered and the trophocytes and oenocytes were present side by side. The similarities and, in particular, the differences in the structure of the fat body are the adaptation of these sister groups to life in a diverse environment.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Ants alter soil moisture and nutrient distributions during foraging and nest construction. Here, we investigated how the effects of ants on soil vary with elevation. We compared moisture, carbon, and nitrogen levels in soil samples taken both within nests and nearby the nests (control) of two subterranean ant species. Using a paired design, we sampled 17 sites along elevation gradients in two California mountain ranges (Formica francoeuri in the San Jacinto mountains and Formica sibylla in the Sierra Nevada). We observed an interaction between soil carbon and nitrogen composition and elevation in each mountain range. At lower elevations, nest soil had lower amounts of carbon and nitrogen than control soil, but at higher elevations, nest soil had higher amounts of carbon and nitrogen than control soil. However, our sampling method may only breach the interior of ant nests in some environments. The nest soil moisture did not show any elevational patterns in either mountain range. Ants likely modulate soil properties differently across environmental gradients, but testing this effect must account for variable nest architecture and other climate and landscape differences across diverse habitats.

AB Crustaceans comprise an ecologically and morphologically diverse taxonomic group. They are typically considered resilient to many environmental perturbations found in marine and coastal environments, due to effective physiological regulation of ions and hemolymph pH, and a robust exoskeleton. Ocean acidification can affect the ability of marine calcifying organisms to build and maintain mineralized tissue and poses a threat for all marine calcifying taxa. Currently, there is no consensus on how ocean acidification will alter the ecologically relevant exoskeletal properties of crustaceans. Here, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ocean acidification on the crustacean exoskeleton, assessing both exoskeletal ion content (calcium and magnesium) and functional properties (biomechanical resistance and cuticle thickness). Our results suggest that the effect of ocean acidification on crustacean exoskeletal properties varies based upon seawater pCO(2) and species identity, with significant levels of heterogeneity for all analyses. Calcium and magnesium content was significantly lower in animals held at pCO(2) levels of 1500-1999 mu atm as compared with those under ambient pCO(2). At lower pCO(2) levels, however, statistically significant relationships between changes in calcium and magnesium content within the same experiment were observed as follows: a negative relationship between calcium and magnesium content at pCO(2) of 500-999 mu atm and a positive relationship at 1000-1499 mu atm. Exoskeleton biomechanics, such as resistance to deformation (microhardness) and shell strength, also significantly decreased under pCO(2) regimes of 500-999 mu atm and 1500-1999 mu atm, indicating functional exoskeletal change coincident with decreases in calcification. Overall, these results suggest that the crustacean exoskeleton can be susceptible to ocean acidification at the biomechanical level, potentially predicated by changes in ion content, when exposed to high influxes of CO2. Future studies need to accommodate the high variability of crustacean responses to ocean acidification, and ecologically relevant ranges of pCO(2) conditions, when designing experiments with conservation-level endpoints.

AB In some karst mountainous areas, with the urban expansion driven by rapid urbanization, a large number of natural mountains that were not suitable for development and construction were embedded into the urban built environment, forming urban remnant mountains(URMs). In this study, we conducted a indicator system to explore the relationship between morphological characteristics of URM and its plant species diversity. The results showed that: (i) The two boundary plane morphological indicators of URMs were significantly associated with its plant species alpha and beta diversity; among the overall morphological indicators, mountain form factor (MFF) was significantly associated with plant species alpha and beta diversity, mountain size coefficient (MSC) was negatively related to Margalef (R) index, and mountain volume density (MVD) had no significant relationship with plant diversity. Additionally, surface morphological indicators were significantly negatively correlated with the Pielou (Jgi) index, and positively correlated with Jaccard (Cj) and Sorenson (Cs) indices. (ii) There were also differences in the influence of morphological characteristic indicators of URMs on the plant species diversity of its different slope position and slope direction. Mountain shape index (MSI), mountain fractal dimension (MFD) and MFF had significant influence on plant species alpha and beta diversity indices of different slope position and slope direction; All surface indicators of URMs morphological characteristics were significantly associated with plant species alpha and beta diversity indices on the southern slope of URMs. (iii) The effects of URMs morphological indicators on plant diversity of different life forms were different, and the influence of herb plant diversity was more significant. (iiii) The multiple regression analysis showed that the URM morphological characteristic indicators could explain the difference of plant species alpha diversity among different URMs, while the interpretation of plant species beta diversity among URMs was poor. In general, the three-dimensional characteristics of the URM are complex and particularity, and the quantitative indicators of different dimensions all showed the impact on the plant species diversity of the URMs. This study demonstrated that the ecological processes of the URM habitats have more complex patch effects in response to interference as compared to the general remnant habitat.

AB For many regions, such as in South America, it is unclear how well the existent protected areas network (PAs) covers different taxonomic groups and if there is a coverage bias of PAs towards certain biomes or species. Publicly available occurrence data along with ecological niche models might help to overcome this gap and to quantify the coverage of taxa by PAs ensuring an unbiased distribution of conservation effort. Here, we use a published occurrence database of 271 species from the cacao family (Malvaceae) to explore how South American PAs cover species with different distribution, abundance, and threat status. Furthermore, we compared the performance of online databases, expert knowledge, and modelled species distributions in estimating species coverage in PAs. We found 79 species from our survey (29% of the total) lack any record inside South American PAs and that 20 out of 23 species potentially threatened with extinction are not covered by PAs. The area covered by South American PAs was low across biomes, except for Amazonia, which had a relative high PA coverage, but little information on species distribution within PA available. Also, raw georeferenced occurrence data were underestimating the number of species in PAs, and projections from ecological niche models were more prone to overestimating the number of species represented within PAs. We discuss that the protection of South American flora in heterogeneous environments demand for specific strategies tailored to particular biomes, including collecting specimens inside PAs in less collected areas, and the delimitation of areas for protection in more known areas.

AB Determination of reclamation status of secondary forests is particularly urgent in human impacted landscapes for conservation of biodiversity and other ecosystem services. However, there is a lack of a quantitative method to estimate the recovery status of secondary forest globally. In the present work, the authors have attempted to estimate the recovery status of a dry secondary forest of Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India quantitatively with a nearby primary forest. We have formulated an equation (measure of climax stage) to estimate the secondary forest for its possible climax stage (early climax stage/mid climax stage/stable climax stage/non climax stage) based on species richness. For this study, the value of "measure of climax stage " between 0 and 0.2 is considered as stable climax stage, 0.2-0.6 as mid climax stage and 0.6-1 as early climax stage. On the other hand, the value > 1 was considered as a non-climax stage of the forest. Accordingly, the studied secondary forest was estimated as to be in mid climax stage (measure of climax stage = 0.4230) even after c. 25 years of successional stage. We have also estimated the recovery stage of a secondary dry forest in SBR by fitting it with a suitable equation and found that the time frame for the stable climax stage is more than 50 years. ANOVA analysis indicates that there is no significant difference observed in the case of soil nutrient contents (except Electrical Conductivity) between primary and secondary forest sites. This developed equation may be implicated in the evaluation of reclamation status of secondary and degraded forest lands globally. Further, in-depth study is encouraged for the development of a modern climax concept to understand the ecological restoration process in a better way.

AB Over the past century, ecologists have attempted to understand patterns of species diversity by showing stable coexistence arising from a baseline expectation of competitive exclusion. This expectation stems from an explicit assumption of resource scarcity and implicit assumptions of Malthusian struggle and winner-takes-all dynamics. Fidelity to the competitive exclusion principle (CEP) presents species diversity as a paradox: if species compete for limited resources, how can they coexist? In this article, we investigate the contradiction between the theoretical expectation of competitive exclusion and the empirical prevalence of multispecies communities. We trace the persistence of the CEP in ecological research despite numerous challenges and explore publishing trends suggesting that this framework has resulted in a disproportionate focus on competition and exclusion in contemporary research. From a critical science studies perspective, we analyze the sociopolitical factors that have contributed to these patterns. We argue that we must excavate the ideological foundation on which competition-based coexistence research has been built to move beyond the current perceived "diversity paradox." To that end, we propose shifting the baseline expectation of coexistence research, introducing the notion of a coexistence principle, which positions the persistence of multispecies communities as the rule rather than the exception in nature.

AB Elevational gradients as well as habitat variability provide variation in environmental conditions enabling plants to alter their functional traits with respect to their surroundings on the way to sustain and better perform. Phenotypic plasticity has been suggested as one of the foremost mechanisms that invasive species implement to endure and invade wide geographical areas. The present study was performed to understand the leaf functioning and reproductive approaches adopted by the invasive weed Ageratina adenophora in response to different habitats of Kumaun Himalaya along elevational ranges. ANOVA showed significant effects of elevational ranges, habitats and their interactions on most of the investigated traits. A wide range in leaf area (367-1278 cm(2)/plant) and seed number (2803-12,240 seeds/plant) across the elevational zones indicated high plastic responses. Linear regression analysis revealed that the specific leaf area (r =-0.279; p < 0.05) and leaf area ratio (r =-0.255; p < 0.05) decreased significantly with increasing elevation. Reproductive traits like seed number (r =-0.284; p < 0.05) and reproductive index (r =-0.416; p < 0.05) also decreased significantly with increasing elevation. The results revealed that this species responds to heterogeneous environments via altering its leaf traits and reproductive performance. The large differences in trait values between habitats and elevations suggested a high degree of plasticity, which is leading to the successful encroachment and establishment of A. adenophora across an elevational gradient without undergoing adaptive evolution.

AB Conceptual gaps and imprecise terms and definitions may obscure the breadth of plant-animal dispersal relationships involved in directed dispersal. The term 'directed' indicates predictable delivery to favourable microsites. However, directed dispersal was initially considered uncommon in diffuse mutualisms (i.e. those involving many species), partly because plants rarely influence post-removal propagule fate without specialized adaptations. This rationale implies that donor plants play an active role in directed dispersal by manipulating vector behaviour after propagule removal. However, even in most classic examples of directed dispersal, participating plants do not influence animal behaviour after propagule removal. Instead, such plants may take advantage of vector attraction to favourable plant microsites, indicating a need to expand upon current interpretations of directed dispersal. We contend that directed dispersal can emerge whenever propagules are disproportionately delivered to favourable microsites as a result of predictably skewed vector behaviour. Thus, we propose distinguishing active and passive forms of directed dispersal. In active directed dispersal, the donor plant achieves disproportionate arrival to favourable microsites by influencing vector behaviour after propagule removal. By contrast, passive directed dispersal occurs when the donor plant takes advantage of vector behaviour to arrive at favourable microsites. Whereas predictable post-removal vector behaviour is dictated by characteristics of the donor plant in active directed dispersal, characteristics of the destination dictate predictable post-removal vector behaviour in passive directed dispersal. Importantly, this passive form of directed dispersal may emerge in more plant-animal dispersal relationships because specialized adaptations in donor plants that influence post-removal vector behaviour are not required. We explore the occurrence and consequences of passive directed dispersal using the unifying generalized gravity model of dispersal. This model successfully describes vectored dispersal by incorporating the influence of the environment (i.e. attractiveness of microsites) on vector movement. When applying gravity models to dispersal, the three components of Newton's gravity equation (i.e. gravitational force, object mass, and distance between centres of mass) become analogous to propagules moving towards a location based on characteristics of the donor plant, the destination, and relocation processes. The generalized gravity model predicts passive directed dispersal in plant-animal dispersal relationships when (i) animal vectors are predictably attracted to specific destinations, (ii) animal vectors disproportionately disperse propagules to those destinations, and (iii) those destinations are also favourable microsites for the dispersed plants. Our literature search produced evidence for these three conditions broadly, and we identified 13 distinct scenarios where passive directed dispersal likely occurs because vector behaviour is predictably skewed towards favourable microsites. We discuss the wide applicability of passive directed dispersal to plant-animal mutualisms and provide new insights into the vulnerability of those mutualisms to global change.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests that herbivorous insects influence the local composition and richness of Neotropical plant species, particularly in species-rich genera. Species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and chemical diversity all influence the ability of insect herbivores to find and utilize their hosts. The relative impact of these components of diversity on species coexistence and plant-herbivore interactions is not well understood. We constructed 60 local communities of up to 13 species of Piper (Piperaceae) in native, mature forest at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. The species composition of each community was chosen such that species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and GCMS-based chemical diversity were varied independently among communities. We predicted that chemical diversity would most strongly affect the communities across time, with smaller effects of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. At 13 months after the experimental planting, we assessed survivorship of each cutting, measured total leaf area loss of the survivors, leaf area loss to generalist and specialist herbivorous insect species, and local extinction of species. Generalist and specialist herbivory decreased with increasing levels of species richness and phylogenetic diversity, respectively. Surprisingly, there was no independent effect of chemical diversity on any of the three measures of herbivore damage. Nevertheless, plots with a higher chemical and phylogenetic diversity showed decreased plant mortality and local species extinction. Overall, our results suggested that both chemical and phylogenetic similarity are important factors in the assembly and maintenance of tropical plant communities. The fact that chemical diversity influences plant mortality suggests that leaf herbivores, and possibly other plant natural enemies, could increase plant diversity via the selective mortality of similar chemotypes.

AB Biodiversity is often attributed to a dynamic equilibrium between the immigration and extinction of species. This equilibrium forms a common basis for studying ecosystem assembly from a static reservoir of migrants-the mainland. Yet, natural ecosystems often consist of many coupled communities (i.e., metacommunities), and migration occurs between these communities. The pool of migrants then depends on what is sustained in the ecosystem, which, in turn, depends on the dynamic migrant pool. This chicken-and-egg problem of survival and dispersal is poorly understood in communities of many competing species, except for the neutral case-the "unified neutral theory of biodiversity." Employing spatiotemporal simulations and mean-field analyses, we show that self-consistent dispersal puts rather tight constraints on the dynamic migration- extinction equilibrium. When the number of species is large, species are pushed to the edge of their global extinction, even when competition is weak. As a consequence, the overall diversity is highly sensitive to perturbations in demographic parameters, including growth and dispersal rates. When dispersal is short range, the resulting spatiotemporal abundance patterns follow broad scale-free distributions that correspond to a directed percolation phase transition. The qualitative agreement of our results for short-range and long-range dispersal suggests that this self-organization process is a general property of species-rich metacommunities. Our study shows that self-sustaining metacommunities are highly sensitive to environmental change and provides insights into how biodiversity can be rescued and maintained.

AB Background The tradeoff between negative and positive interactions of facilitated species and facilitators may depend on the degree of resource availability in agroecosystems. However, the rhizospheric mechanisms driving trade-offs that occur along phosphorus (P) and water availability gradients have not yet been systematically clarified. We established three types of root isolation conditions (no barrier, nylon barrier and solid barrier) at different P and water addition levels to address the above issue in a maize-grass pea intercropping system. Results The total yield and biomass net effect (NE) and the relative interaction index (RII) were significantly higher than 0 under all environmental conditions, demonstrating that plant-plant interactions generated positive effects in the intercropping system. The maize yield and biomass RII were 0.029-0.095 and 0.018-0.066, respectively, which indicated that maize growth was constantly facilitated. However, the RII for grass pea yield and biomass exhibited a different trend in comparison with maize. It was higher than 0 (as the facilitated species) under low soil P and moisture conditions and transitioned to values lower than 0 (facilitator species) under high P and moisture conditions, which showed that the type and intensity of plant-plant interactions steadily shifted with the applied stressors. Direct interactions decreased the maize rhizospheric soil pH by 1.5% and 1.9% under Low-P conditions. Notably, the rhizospheric soil acid and alkaline phosphatase secretions of maize and grass pea increased by 17.4-27.4% and 15.3-27.7%, respectively, in P-deficient soils. These results show that plant-plant interactions can effectively relieve P stress by mineralizing organophosphorus in P-deficient soils. Furthermore, the above tendency became more pronounced under drought-stressed conditions. The nylon barrier partially restricted the exchange and utilization of available nutrients and decreased the total yield and biomass by 1.8-7.8% and 1.1-7.8%, respectively. The presence of a solid barrier completely restricted interspecific rhizospheric interactions and decreased the total yield and biomass by 2.1-13.8% and 1.6-15.7%, respectively. Phytate and KH2PO4 addition intensified asymmetric interspecific competition, and grass pea was consistently subjected to competitive pressures. Conclusion Briefly, the tradeoff between facilitation and competition was driven by rhizospheric interactions, and the transition in the intensity and type of interaction was highly dependent on resource availability in a biologically diverse system.

AB Marine microbial communities are extremely complex and diverse. The number of locally coexisting species often vastly exceeds the number of identifiable niches, and taxonomic composition often appears decoupled from local environmental conditions. This is contrary to the view that environmental conditions should select for a few locally well-adapted species. Here we use an individual-based eco-evolutionary model to show that virtually unlimited taxonomic diversity can be supported in highly evolving assemblages, even in the absence of niche separation. With a steady stream of heritable changes to phenotype, competitive exclusion may be weakened, allowing sustained coexistence of nearly neutral phenotypes with highly divergent lineages. This behaviour is robust even to abrupt environmental perturbations that might be expected to cause strong selection pressure and an associated loss of diversity. We, therefore, suggest that rapid evolution and individual-level variability are key drivers of species coexistence and maintenance of microbial biodiversity.

AB Understanding the effects of island shape and dispersal limitation on species assemblages is important for the conservation of bryophytes in fragmented landscapes. In order to explore the comparative contributions of dispersal limitation vs environmental filtering, island shape vs other island attributes to bryophyte species assemblages in fragmented landscapes, we investigated bryophyte flora and environmental variables (island shape, area, elevation, and isolation degree) of 71 islands in the Zhoushan Archipelago in the East China Sea. We used redundancy analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and generalized linear mixed models to explore comparative contributions of dispersal limitation vs environmental filtering, shape vs other explanatory variables to bryophyte species composition and species richness. Dispersal limitation independently accounted for 15% of the total variation in species composition, which was higher than environmental filtering (6.6%). When island shape was the only constraining explanatory variable, it explained 22.5% of the total species richness variation. Variance partitioning showed that island shape per se explained 3.8% of the total variation in species richness and 18.7% of the variation was confounded by island shape and other variables. Island shape combined with area and elevation was a good predictor of bryophyte species richness, independently explaining 40% of the total SR variation. Among twenty tested bryophyte categories, eighteen categories had positive relationships of their species richness with island shape irregularity, their species richness linearly increasing with island shape irregularity to varying extents. Island shape irregularity exerted a stronger effect on the species richness of acrocarpous mosses than that of pleurocarpous mosses. Therefore, dispersal limitation exerted significant effects on bryophyte species assemblages, and island shape imposed a significant and taxon-specific effect on bryophyte species richness. Our findings implied that a forest reserve with a high irregular shape is favourable for bryophyte conservation.

AB The collective construction of environmental management and natural resource conservation strategies can empower and reduce marginalized communities' material and political dependence. Local participation is key to the success of these strategies. This research applies connectivity and hydrological efficiency analyses to support local water capture and soil restoration strategies in four marginalized indigenous communities in the tropical region of Mexico. We used the connectivity index (IC) and lateral hydrological efficiency index (LHEI) to identify plots where the configuration of landscape elements favors water and sediment transfer and priority areas for intervention. We analyzed 39 water capture and soil restoration infrastructures through satellite imagery to determine the water persistence (WP) and used correlation analysis and regression trees to identify significant correlations between WP and IC/LHEI values. The data were shared with local actors through participatory workshops, and we identified 11 intervention points with similar IC/LHEI characteristics in collaboration with community residents. This approach highlighted the utility of hydrological connectivity analysis to strengthen decision-making focused on food production systems and ecosystem restoration.

AB Development and implementation of effective protected area management to reduce deforestation depend in part on identifying factors contributing to forest loss and areas at risk of conversion, but standard land-use-change modeling may not fully capture contextual factors that are not easily quantified. To better understand deforestation and agricultural expansion in Amazonian protected areas, we combined quantitative land-use-change modeling with qualitative discourse analysis in a case study of Brazil's Jamanxim National Forest. We modeled land-use change from 2008 to 2018 and projected deforestation through 2028. We used variables identified in a review of studies that modeled land-use change in the Amazon (e.g., variables related to agricultural suitability and economic accessibility) and from a critical discourse analysis that examined documents produced by different actors (e.g., government agencies and conservation nonprofit organizations) at various spatial scales. As measured by analysis of variance, McFadden's adjusted pseudo R-2, and quantity and allocation disagreement, we found that including variables in the model identified as important to deforestation dynamics through the qualitative discourse analysis (e.g., the proportion of unallocated public land, distance to proposed infrastructure developments, and density of recent fires) alongside more traditional variables (e.g., elevation, distance to roads, and protection status) improved the predictive ability of these models. Models that included discourse analysis variables and traditional variables explained up to 19.3% more of the observed variation in deforestation probability than a model that included only traditional variables and 4.1% more variation than a model with only discourse analysis variables. Our approach of integrating qualitative and quantitative methods in land-use-change modeling provides a framework for future interdisciplinary work in land-use change.

AB Tropical ecosystems are often biodiversity hotspots, and invertebrates represent the main underrepresented component of diversity in large-scale analyses. This problem is partly related to the scarcity of data widely available to conduct these studies and the lack of systematic organization of knowledge about invertebrates' distributions in biodiversity hotspots. Here, we introduce and analyze a comprehensive data compilation of Amazonian ant diversity. Using records from 1817 to 2020 from both published and unpublished sources, we describe the diversity and distribution of ant species in the Brazilian Amazon Basin. Further, using high-definition images and data from taxonomic publications, we build a comprehensive database of morphological traits for the ant species that occur in the region. In total, we recorded 1067 nominal species in the Brazilian Amazon Basin, with sampling locations strongly biased by access routes, urban centers, research institutions and major infrastructure projects. Large areas where ant sampling is non-existent represent about 52% of the basin and are concentrated mainly in the northern, southeastern and western Brazilian Amazon. We found that distance to roads is the main driver of ant sampling in the Amazon. Contrary to our expectations, morphological traits had lower predictive power in predicting sampling bias than purely geographic variables. However, when geographic predictors were controlled, habitat stratum and traits contribute to explain the remaining variance. More species were recorded in better-sampled areas, but species richness estimation models suggest that areas in southern Amazonian edge forests are associated with especially high species richness. Our results represent the first trait-based, large-scale study for insects in Amazonian forests and a starting point for macroecological studies focusing on insect diversity in the Amazon Basin.

AB Understanding how environmental filtering and biotic interactions structure communities across elevational and latitudinal gradients is still a matter of debate. To provide insight into their relative importance, we explore the mismatch between three dimensions of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic), and compare their patterns to null models of random community assembly. We focus on a highly diverse tropical group: the tree frogs (hylids) of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. For that, we combined geographic distribution data with phylogenetic and trait information for 158 species to produce maps of the three dimensions of diversity. We show that communities of tree frogs of the Hylidae family tend to have high functional richness along the Atlantic Forest, potentially driven by niche partitioning. However, environmental filtering gains importance in extreme environments, both at high elevations and higher latitudes. In these areas of the forest, clustering of both functional and phylogenetic diversity is observed. Trait overdispersion is found in areas of contact between vegetation types, or of adjacent biomes, reflecting the encounter of amphibian species adapted to distinct environmental conditions and landscape configurations. Considering all three dimensions of diversity along with multiple axes of environmental variation allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the processes shaping amphibian community assembly in this biodiversity hotspot.

AB Background Shifting cultivation is a major agriculture practice in the Nagaland state of India. This study examines the effect of shifting cultivation and the length of the fallow period on soil quality index (SQI). Four sites were selected for the study, viz., a shifting cultivation site (SCS), a 3-year-old fallow land (FL-3), a 7-year-old fallow land (FL-7), and a 12-year-old fallow land (FL-12). Soil parameters were recorded seasonally and SQI was calculated from the minimum data set. Results With the increase in the fallow period, the values of conductivity, soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, moisture, clay, and cation exchange capacity of soil increased. Meanwhile, soil pH and bulk density decreased with fallow duration. The additive SQI(a) values were in the order SCS < FL-3 < FL-12 < FL-7; meanwhile, the weighted SQI(w) values were in the order SCS < FL-3 < FL-7 < FL-12. It is also observed that the SQI value decreases with the increase in soil depth under both the weighted and additive indexes. SCS with the lowest SQI value reflects the reduced soil organic carbon (SOC) and macronutrients. Increased SOC levels in site FL-12 (2.88-3.94%) may be one reason for its higher SQI value. Conclusions Our study highlights that unsustainable practices of shifting cultivation and reduction in the fallow period negatively affect soil quality. Furthermore, the study also recommends the use of the weighted method of SQI as it agrees with the reports of land use causing alteration in the soil quality. Our findings may be utilized to quickly access and disseminate information to the stakeholders and aid in constructing local soil quality index maps of the region. There is an urgent need for a rapid, cost and resource-efficient soil quality assessment and SQI may be one tool that achieves this goal.

AB Elevational changes in vegetation are associated with changes in environmental factors, an example of which is provided by the shade-tolerant Abies mariesii and less shade-tolerant Abies veitchii, which dominate forests at high and low elevations, respectively, in subalpine zones of central Japan. In this study, we sought to establish the factors underlying the differential elevational dominance of these two species from the perspective of sapling growth and survival. It is assumed that the growth and survival of saplings is greater at higher rates of surplus production (the value obtained by subtracting the minimum net production to maintain the current sapling leaf mass from the total net production), as sapling leaf mass gradually declines with time if saplings cannot maintain the current sapling leaf mass, thereby increasing the risk of premature mortality. In this regard, we aimed to verify the following two hypotheses: (1) at low elevations, the surplus production rate of A. veitchii is greater than that of A. mariesii in canopy gaps, and vice versa in the forest understory; and (2) at high elevation, the surplus production rate of A. mariesii is greater than that of A. veitchii in both forest understory and canopy gaps. The results obtained in this study were consistent with our two stated hypotheses. In addition, at the low elevation site, the rate of the growth in height of A. veitchii in canopy gaps was greater than that of A. mariesii, indicating that A. veitchii can dominate after disturbance at low elevations. The findings of this study indicate that the differential elevational distribution of the two Abies species can be attributed to interspecific differences in surplus production rates. We believe that these findings will be useful for predicting changes in the distribution of vegetation in response to climate change.

AB Microplastics provide new microbial niches in aquatic environments. Nevertheless, information on the assembly processes and potential ecological mechanisms of bacterial communities on microplastics from reservoirs is lacking. Here, we investigated the assembly processes and potential ecological mechanisms of bacterial communities on microplastics through full-length 16S rRNA sequencing in the Three Gorges Reservoir area of the Yangtze River, compared to water and sediment. The results showed that the Burkholderiaceae were the dominant composition of bacterial communities in microplastics (9.95%), water (25.14%), and sediment (7.22%). The niche width of the bacterial community on microplastics was lower than those in water and sediment. For the microplastics and sediment, distance-decay relationship results showed that the bacterial community similarity was significantly decreased with increasing geographical distance. In addition, the spatial turnover rate of the bacterial community on microplastics along the similar to 662-km reaches of the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges Reservoir area was higher than that in sediment. Null model analysis showed that the assembly processes of the bacterial community on microplastics were also different from those in water and sediments. Dispersal limitation (52.4%) was the primary assembly process of the bacterial community on microplastics, but variable selection was the most critical assembly process of the bacterial communities in water (47.6%) and sediment (66.7%). Thus, geographic dispersal limitation dominated the assembly processes of bacterial communities on microplastics. This study can enhance our understanding of the assembly mechanism of bacterial communities caused by the selection preference for microplastics from the surrounding environment.
   IMPORTANCE In river systems, microplastics create new microbial niches that significantly differ from those of the surrounding environment. However, the potential relationships between the biogeographic distribution and assembly processes of microbial communities on microplastics were still not well understood. This study could help us address the lack of knowledge about the assembly processes of bacterial communities on microplastics caused by selection from the surrounding environment. In this study, strong geographic dispersal limitation dominated assembly processes of bacterial communities on microplastics, compared to water and sediment, which may be responsible for the microplastic bacterial richness, and the niche distance was lower than those in water and sediment. In addition, sediment may be the main potential source of bacterial communities on microplastics in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, which makes higher community similarity between microplastics and sediment than between microplastics and water.

AB Lianas are increasing in abundance in many tropical forests. This increase can alter forest structure and decrease both carbon storage and tree diversity via antagonistic relationships between lianas and their host trees. Climate change is postulated as an underlying driver of increasing liana abundances, via increases in dry-season length, forest-disturbance events, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations; all factors thought to favour lianas. However, the impact of climate change on liana reproductive phenology, an underlying determinant of liana abundance, has been little studied, particularly outside of Neotropical forests. Over a 15-year period (2000-2014), we examined the phenological patterns of a liana community in intact rainforests of the Wet Tropics bioregion of Australia; a World Heritage Area and hotspot of floral diversity. Specifically, we assessed (1) flowering and fruiting patterns of liana species; (2) potential climate drivers of flowering and fruiting activity; and (3) the influence of El Nino-related climatic disturbances on liana phenology. We found that flowering and fruiting of the studied liana species increased over time. Liana reproduction, moreover, rose in apparent response to higher temperatures and reduced rainfall. Finally, we found flowering and fruiting of the liana species increased following El Nino events. These results suggest that liana reproduction and abundance are likely to increase under predicted future climate regimes, with potentially important impacts on the survival, growth, and reproduction of resident trees and thus the overall health of Australian tropical rainforests.

AB Phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate salts) can constitute a large fraction of the organic P in soils. As a more recalcitrant form of soil organic P, up to 51 million metric tons of phytate accumulate in soils annually, corresponding to similar to 65% of the P fertilizer application. However, the availability of phytate is limited due to its strong binding to soils via its highly-phosphorylated inositol structure, with sorption capacity being similar to 4 times that of orthophosphate in soils. Phosphorus (P) is one of the most limiting macronutrients for agricultural productivity. Given that phosphate rock is a finite resource, coupled with the increasing difficulty in its extraction and geopolitical fragility in supply, it is anticipated that both economic and environmental costs of P fertilizer will greatly increase. Therefore, optimizing the use of soil phytate-P can potentially enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture production. To increase phytate-P availability in the rhizosphere, plants and microbes have developed strategies to improve phytate solubility and mineralization by secreting mobilizing agents including organic acids and hydrolyzing enzymes including various phytases. Though we have some understanding of phytate availability and phytase activity in soils, the limiting steps for phytate-P acquisition by plants proposed two decades ago remain elusive. Besides, the relative contribution of plant- and microbe-derived phytases, including those from mycorrhizas, in improving phytate-P utilization is poorly understood. Hence, it is important to understand the processes that influence phytate-P acquisition by plants, thereby developing effective molecular biotechnologies to enhance the dynamics of phytate in soil. However, from a practical view, phytate-P acquisition by plants competes with soil P fixation, so the ability of plants to access stable phytate must be evaluated from both a plant and soil perspective. Here, we summarize information on phytate availability in soils and phytate-P acquisition by plants. In addition, agronomic approaches and biotechnological strategies to improve soil phytate-P utilization by plants are discussed, and questions that need further investigation are raised. The information helps to better improve phytate-P utilization by plants, thereby reducing P resource inputs and pollution risks to the wider environment.

AB The oryzomyine rodent Euryzoryzomys russatus is endemic to the Atlantic Forest of South America, where it inhabits mostly pristine humid forests. Previous phylogeographical studies performed with limited sample sizes indicated that rivers and climatic oscillations might have driven the diversification of this species. Here, we used a more comprehensive database to revisit the phylogeography and demographic history of E. russatus. Our phylogenetic inferences and haplotype network recovered four groups within E. russatus, each of which diversified between 0.33 and 0.60 Mya. These groups are mostly allopatric and are structured latitudinally along the Atlantic Forest. We did not detect any genetic break related to the major river drainages. Species distribution models recovered similar suitable areas for E. russatus in the present and past times, suggesting stability in the geographical range during the Pleistocene. The most pronounced change was the expansion of suitable areas onto the emerged continental shelf during the Last Glacial Maximum. Demographic analyses showed evidence of population expansion during periods of lowered seal levels, especially for the haplogroup associated with the Serra do Mar forest refuge. Therefore, our results failed to support the hypothesis of riverine barriers and suggest that the diversification of E. russatus is explained better by forest refugial processes.

AB Although abiotic environmental factors have been historically regarded as the dominant deterministic process in microbial community assembly, recent studies indicate that biotic interactions may be equally significant. However, the extent to which both processes are important in assembly of belowground communities is unknown. Along two environmental gradients: alkalinity (ranging from pH similar to 7 to similar to 11) and habitat type (lakes, shorelines, and prairies around lakes) present in the Western Nebraska Sandhills, we used 18S rRNA gene marker metabarcoding and statistical analyses, including generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM), to evaluate the dynamics between abiotic and biotic factors that might play a role in nematode community assembly. Lakes supported the least diverse and prairies the most diverse communities with completely distinct compositions. We also observed a potential role of alkalinity in shaping these communities but only in lakes. Generally, GDMs indicated the influence of both abiotic and biotic factors. However, their relative importance in explaining community variability was dependent on the habitat. Biotic factors influenced the lake communities most, followed by shorelines and prairies, explaining similar to 47%, 27% and 8% of the variation, respectively. In contrast, the role of abiotic factors was relatively similar in lakes, shorelines and prairies (similar to 15%, 18% and 14% of the variation, respectively). Most variation in the shorelines (62%) and prairies (82%) remained unexplained, suggesting the potential importance of factors associated with specific traits or a stronger role of stochastic processes. Nevertheless, our findings suggest both deterministic processes are important in nematode community assembly, but their specific contributions are context-dependent.

AB Background Currently, at the global level, human food is mainly based on a few crops extensively cultivated as monocultures. Climate change, changes in land to agriculture and cattle raising, as well as the scarcity of water all affect and reduce the possibility of cultivating alternative crops. One way to face this global problem is to promote the knowledge, production and consumption of native food species on a regional scale. For this study, two databases were constructed for the Gulf of Mexico Province: 1) edible plant species with their corresponding common name, category of use, plant organ(s) utilised as food and type of management; 2) distribution records of these edible species. These species, in addition to being part of the biological diversity of Mexico are of high nutritional, cultural and gastronomical value and have been present in the diet of the inhabitants and ethnic groups in the region since pre-Hispanic times. New information This study presents the native edible plants of the Gulf of Mexico Province, an area inhabited by 15 ethnic groups. The main novelty of this contribution is the edible plant species database, which includes the records of 482 species that belong to 101 families and 268 genera. We also present information rarely reported in an ethnobotanical inventory: 1) category of food use, 2) category of plant organ used, 3) common name, 4) type of management and 5) the georeferenced distribution of species occurrence in the Gulf of Mexico Province.

AB Background and aims Biocrusts are major contributors to dryland nutrient cycling by regulating C, N and P inputs and fluxes. However, our understanding about how the decomposition of biocrust constituents contributes to soil nutrient cycling in drylands is virtually unknown.
   Methods We conducted a microcosm experiment to: i) evaluate the litter decomposition dynamics of two common biocrust-forming species with contrasting tissue chemistry and growth form (the lichen Cladonia foliacea and the moss Syntrichia caninervis), and ii) their effects on several soil variables related to soil functioning.
   Results Cladonia litter decomposed gradually with time (92% total mass loss after 342 days), while Syntrichia litter decomposed much faster (92% total mass loss after 62 days, with no further losses until the end of the experiment at 342 days). We observed species-specific effects of their litter on dissolved organic N (DON) and NH4+ depending on collection time, which changed the effects of litter decomposition on DON and pH regardless of the biocrust species considered. Overall, biocrust litter had a positive effect on SOC, DON, NH4 and acid phosphatase activity.
   Conclusions Our experimental results show that decomposition of biocrust tissues plays an important role in soil nutrient cycling, indicating that this process impacts the fertility and functioning of dryland soils.

AB Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are one way instructors can increase engagement and learning of material. One of the goals in the report Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action is to increase active learning activities. By implementing a CURE or CURE-type model, instructors provide students with the opportunity to develop a better understanding of science content, to apply what they have learned, and make an impact in real-world science. Our classes replicated a subset of the work being completed in Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique. We had students complete biodiversity surveys through collection and classification of ant species using field and lab techniques. DNA barcoding analyses are commonly used techniques in biology labs worldwide. Polymerase chain reaction and cycle sequencing will be taught to illustrate how the extracted DNA can be amplified at different markers and used to identify species. We utilized the CURE model to have students complete a biodiversity survey of both a southern intermountain-west and a southeastern state through collection, classification, and genotyping and barcoding of ant species.

AB Fire plays an important role in maintaining grassy forests, and reduced fire frequency has been linked to encroachment of woody plants into grassy forests and woodlands globally. In Australia a range of threatened animals, including the northern population of the endangered eastern bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus), are dependent on grassy forests. We examined this issue by collating three decades of detailed monitoring and fire data for 43 current and historically-occupied bristlebird sites, and examined the relationships among fire history, bristlebird occupancy and habitat patch size/condition. Habitat patch size declined by over 50% between 1980 and 2009 due to woody plant encroachment. Bristlebird occupancy was associated with reduced habitat loss and time since fire, while reduced fire frequency was the main predictor of decline in grassy cover, a critical habitat element for bristlebirds. Our models suggested habitat loss was strongly influenced by fire history, particularly fire frequency, with reduced habitat loss associated with more-frequent burning. Native grass cover can return quickly, and remained high until 5-10 years post-fire; densest grass cover was found at sites with fire intervals of between 3.5 and 7 years. Active fire management, including regular ecological burning, is imperative for conservation of the eastern bristlebird and other threatened fauna that depend on these grassy forests. The massive changes in global patterns of fire currently occurring, and the threat this poses to biodiversity, make understanding the nuances of fire ecology, including the role of fire frequency, essential to improving conservation management.

AB We evaluated the functional capacities of dung removal and secondary seed dispersal by two telecoprid dung beetles, Canthon rutilans cyanescens (Harold) and Deltochilum multicolor Balthasar, and two paracoprid dung beetles, Dichotomius sericeus (Harold) and Phanaeus splendidulus (Fabricius), in a remnant of Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. We aimed to describe and understand the variability of these behaviors among these species and compare their dung removal capacities by standardized biomass. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of exposure time to the resource on the functional capacity of the four species and the effect of density on C. r. cyanescens and D. sericeus in arenas with single male/female pairs or groups of three pairs. Beetles were exposed to 30 g of canine feces with artificial seeds, which remained in the field for two, seven, or 21 days in four replicates. The paracoprids were more efficient than the telecoprids in all ecological functions. Canthon r. cyanescens removed significantly more dung with increasing exposure time and density, while D. multicolor showed no significant differences in any ecosystem function. For D. sericeus, time was relevant for increasing dung removal and dispersion of large seeds, while density only affected dung removal. Phanaeus splendidulus removed more dung with increasing exposure time, but its effect on seed dispersal was not significant. When evaluating dung removal capacity by standardized biomass, C. rutilans and D. sericeus were the most efficient species, demonstrating that paracoprids are usually more efficient because of their greater body biomass. As much as the functional capacity of certain ecological functions differs among species, different functional groups provide complementarity in communities. Thus, data on the biology and behavior of species are important in ecosystem functions.

AB Litter decomposition is an important component of the nutrient recycling process and is highly sensitive to climate change. However, the impacts of warming and increased precipitation on litter decomposition have not been well studied, especially in the alpine grassland of Tianshan Mountains. We conducted a manipulative warming and increased precipitation experiment combined with different grassland types to examine the impact of litter quality and climate change on the litter decomposition rate based on three dominant species (Astragalus mongholicus, Potentilla anserina, and Festuca ovina) in Tianshan Mountains from 2019 to 2021. The results of this study indicated there were significant differences in litter quality, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content. In addition, litter quality exerted significant effects on litter decomposition, and the litter decomposition rate varied in different grassland types. Increased precipitation significantly accelerated the litter decomposition of P. anserina; however, it had no significant effect on the litter decomposition of A. mongholicus and F. ovina. However, warming consistently decreased the litter decomposition rate, with the strongest impact on the litter decomposition of F. ovina. There was a significant interaction between increased precipitation and litter type, but there was no significant interaction between warming and litter type. These results indicated that warming and increased precipitation significantly influenced litter decomposition; however, the strength was dependent on litter quality. In addition, soil water content played a crucial role in regulating litter decomposition in different grassland types. Moreover, we found that the litter decomposition rate exhibited a hump-shaped or linear response to the increase of soil water content. Our study emphasizes that ongoing climate change significantly altered litter decomposition in the alpine grassland, which is of great significance for understanding the nutrient supply and turnover of litter.

AB There is an increasing likelihood that invasive plants are again exposed to their co-evolved specialist herbivores in the non-native range. However, whether there is a latitudinal pattern associated with the resistance of an invasive plant to its co-evolved herbivores and how soil microbes affect resistance has been little explored. We hypothesized that the resistance of invasive Solidago canadensis to its co-evolved insect herbivore Corythucha marmorata could increase with latitude, and that local rhizosphere microbes could facilitate invasive plants to become resistant to their co-evolved herbivores. We conducted a field survey and a greenhouse experiment to examine whether there was a latitudinal pattern in the abundance of C. marmorata and in the damage it caused to S. canadensis in China. We tested whether local rhizosphere microbes of invasive plants can promote the resistance of S. canadensis to C. marmorata herbivory. In the field survey, both density of C. marmorata and damage level of S. canadensis were positively correlated with latitude, and with S. canadensis plant growth, indicating a latitudinal pattern in the resistance of S. canadensis to C. marmorata. However, in the greenhouse experiment, S. canadensis from different latitudes did not suffer significantly from different levels of damage from C. marmorata. Additionally, the damage level of S. canadensis was lower when rhizosphere soil and rhizomes originated from field S. canadensis with same damage level than with different damage levels. This result indicates that local rhizosphere soil microbes promote the adaptation of S. canadensis to resistance of C. marmorata.

AB Specific factors that determine whether hummingbirds feed from flowers matching their bill morphology are not well understood. Here, we asked whether long-billed hummingbirds at tropical mid-elevations visit flowers that match their bill morphology more often when those flowers are more energetically profitable in terms of nectar concentration compared to short-corolla flowers. We measured visitation rates by hummingbirds in 3 experiments involving feeders with 5 flower morphologies and 2 nectar concentrations in the mountains of Costa Rica. Not surprisingly, all species tended to prefer higher nectar concentration when given the choice across all available flower morphologies. When nectar concentration was the same across all flower morphologies, hummingbirds with bills shorter than 28 mm generally avoided long-corolla flowers (30 mm) and fed more frequently from short-corolla flowers (10 mm), while species with longer bills did not show a preference. When nectar concentration was higher in long-corolla flowers compared to short-corolla flowers (30% vs 10% m/v), short-billed species showed the same visitation rates as above, but long-billed species (>28 mm) changed their visitation patterns and visited long-corolla flowers significantly more often than short-corolla flowers. Our results suggest that visitation rates of long-billed hummingbirds to long-corolla flowers might be influenced more by nectar properties than by flower morphology at mid-elevations in the tropics.

AB Landscape structure and configuration may affect bird body condition, with contrasting effects on resident and migratory species. There is little empirical evidence to support this hypothesis in tropical regions, where land-use change poses a major threat to biodiversity. We aimed to assess the effects of landscape structure and configuration on the body condition of neotropical migrant and resident bird species. We compiled body condition data (using the scaled mass index) of nine bird species (five resident and four migratory). We characterized landscape structure and configuration at 26 localities. We evaluated the effects of landscape metrics on bird body condition using Bayesian linear mixed models. The landscapes in our study largely varied in forest, crop, and grassland cover, as well as in landscape metrics. When we examined migrant birds, we found a positive effect of landscape connectivity and crop cover on body condition. Similarly, body condition of resident birds was positively affected by connectivity and crop cover, but also by forest patch area and capture day. Changes in landscape structure and configuration may indirectly alter the access to resources, causing additional energy expenditures, leading to a deteriorated body condition. Conversely, landscape heterogeneity may have a positive effect on bird body condition. Therefore, we recommend maintaining connectivity and complementary resources in the landscape.

AB The mechanisms responsible for biodiversity formation and maintenance are central themes in biodiversity conservation. However, the relationships between community assembly, phylogeny, and functional traits remain poorly understood, especially following disturbance. In this study, we examined forest community assembly mechanisms in different disturbance regimes across spatial scales and including tree life history classes, using phylogenetic and functional trait metrics. Across disturbance regimes, phylogenetic structure tended to be over-dispersed, while functional structure tended to be clustered. The over-dispersion of phylogenetic structure also increased from small to large diameter species. Moreover, the explanation of spatial distance for the turnover of phylogenetic and functional structure was increased, while environmental distance explained less structure as disturbance intensity decreased. Our findings suggest that niche theory largely explains forest community assembly in different disturbance regimes. Furthermore, environmental filtering plays a major role in moderate to high disturbance regimes, while competitive exclusion is more important in undisturbed and slightly disturbed ecosystems.

AB The Hyrcanian forests of Iran are mainly managed with the single-selection silvicultural technique. Despite significant ecological benefits associated with selection cutting, this type of forest management leads towards more challenging situations where it is difficult to maintain and practice successful forestry than in even-aged systems. Therefore, this study provides relevant management tools in the form of models to estimate low growth levels in Hyrcanian forests. In the present study, estimation of the population growth rate and then the allowable cut rate of these forests using a matrix model have been calculated in the Gorazbon district. For this purpose, the data of 256 permanent sample plots measured during the years between 2003 and 2012, as well as the data recorded about the trees harvested according to the forestry plan, have been used. As a first step, the most frequently occurring tree species were divided into four groups (beech, hornbeam, chestnut-leaved oak, and other species). Compartments of the district were divided into two groups of logged and unlogged compartments. The purpose of this division was to estimate the allowable cut and compare its volume with the volumes of observed and predicted allowable cuts obtained from forestry plans. The results showed that the total operated allowable cut (OAC) in logged compartments was more than the estimated allowable cut (EAC). In unlogged compartments, the total predicted allowable cut (PAC) was more than EAC. A comparison of EAC and OAC showed that hornbeam has been harvested more than its potential.

AB With the increasing global human activities, local microbial communities will be dramatically changed and impaired. Sea-crossing bridges have been constructed worldwide with the rapid economic development. However, knowledge about impacts of bridge constructions on diversity and functional shifts of local microbiota is lacking. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics were implemented to compare changes of microbial communities between sediments influenced by sea-crossing bridge construction (EG group) and the surrounding control sediments (CG group). High levels of beta diversity in EG group indicated environmental changes and bridge construction increased local microbial diversity. Comparative analyses revealed significant changes in microbial composition and abundance and a total of 17 indicator species were detected using LEfSe approach. The predicted functional attributes of microbiota revealed most of which were involved in metabolism, environmental and genetic information processing. Notably, annotated pathways involved in human diseases were significantly enriched in EG group, revealing potential deleterious effects of public health security influenced by bridge construction. For the first time, our study revealed significant changes in local microbial communities affected by sea-crossing bridge construction. We suggested local biodiversity and human health should be specifically noticed in engineering construction process. These results may greatly enhance our understanding of the microbial responses to marine infrastructure and civil engineering. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Some of the elements in the rocky intertidal zone, such as boulders, act as a refuge, mating, feeding and nursery area for marine fauna. In the present study, we analysed the population structure of the intertidal stone crab Xantho poressa in a human-restricted area, between March 2019 and February 2020, comprised of a rocky shore along the SW Atlantic Spanish coast. The study aims to provide information about the size distribution and identify which environmental factors shape the distribution, sex ratio and mating system of the species. The males were significantly larger than the females and no significant difference in size was observed between ovigerous and non-ovigerous females. The sex ratio was biased towards females. Groups constituted by one large male and several females were observed coexisting under a boulder. Other groups of two or more males and various females were also observed during the study. The distribution of the species is mainly determined by the size and weight of the boulder. The complexity of the study area, and the key role of boulders in the distribution of the species, suggests that X. poressa might have a refuge-defence polygynous mating system.

AB Land-use changes have affected biodiversity and the role it plays in ecological functioning throughout the Neotropics. It is important to understand the response of species to land-use changes to recommend appropriate management and conservation strategies. This is particularly true when land use systems include agroforestry systems, such as shade coffee plantations. In this study, we evaluated the taxonomic diversity of birds and the effect of land-use types (cattle pastures, shade coffee plantations, and forests in late successional stages) on the presence of functional groups at the local and landscape level in a Mexican cloud forest landscape. We carried out monthly bird surveys for one year in 90 circular points with a radius of 25 m (30 points per land use type) in which we compared bird taxonomic diversity using effective diversity or Hill numbers. We analyzed the composition and abundance of bird species and functional groups across land use types using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and tested the effect of predictor variables on functional group abundance at the local and landscape level using ordination methods and generalized linear models. In total, we recorded 134 bird species belonging to 27 families. Bird species richness was highest in late forests. Bird species diversity was high in both late forests and coffee plantations in comparison to cattle pastures. There was a greater similarity in the bird species composition and functional groups in both late forests and coffee plantations compared to cattle pastures. Bird functional groups favored by more complex vegetation structure included forest granivores, small insectivorous flycatchers, and nectarivores, groups that were also present in more diverse plant communities at the local level and by humid forests associated with shade coffee plantations at the landscape level. Avian granivores associated with disturbed environments were negatively related with vegetation complexity and forest cover across scales and omnivores were positively associated with disturbed areas at the landscape level. This study shows the susceptibility of certain bird functional groups to different land use types at distinct spatial scales and highlights the role of shade coffee plantations as a land use type that maintains taxonomic and functional diversity of birds in Neotropical cloud forests.

AB The facilitatory role that isolated trees play in the regeneration of degraded areas that are not under the cover of invasive exotic plants is well recognized. In contrast, the influence of isolated trees in restoring sites invaded by exotic plants has hardly been studied. Such studies are needed because conditions that favor native tree regeneration under isolated trees, such as microclimate amelioration, increased nutrient levels, and facilitated dispersal, may also be favorable to certain species of exotic plants. Using transects, we studied species richness, abundance and resilience (as indicated by re-sprouting) of trees regenerating underneath the crowns of 15 isolated native trees that are emergent over a near continuous canopy of paper mulberry Broussonetia papyrifera in a degraded area of Mabira Forest, Uganda. Data collected beneath emergent tree crowns were matched by control data from the area immediately beyond the crowns. Native tree species abundance and richness were significantly higher beneath than beyond crowns; while the opposite was true of the density of B. papyrifera seedlings and saplings. Species richness was significantly higher beneath than beyond crowns for late-, but not early-succession trees. Polynomial regressions of species richness and abundance showed that B. papyrifera abundance increased significantly from stem bases to crown edges and leveled-off beyond crowns; while the density of native tree species was constant from stem bases to crown edges and decreased thereafter. Native tree species richness peaked at crown edges. The proportion of re-sprouts assigned to cutting of native tree species was significantly higher beyond than beneath crowns. We attribute the higher abundances and species richness of native species underneath crowns to both facilitation by isolated trees and the apparent shade-intolerance of B. papyrifera. Significantly higher levels of re-sprouting by native tree species could be an indication that the regeneration underneath crowns is less resilient to disturbance than that beyond, or that less resilient species occur beneath crowns. Overall, the results suggest that in sites invaded by mulberry, isolated trees have potential to accelerate recovery of native tree species while suppressing mulberry. Peaking of species richness at crown edges is not a commonly reported finding for isolated trees and needs to be further investigated.

AB How and when to upscale and finance nature-based solutions in watersheds in order to improve downstream urban water security is a global concern. In this paper we address such challenge by providing a novel method for planning the expansion of a chosen set of nature-based solutions that couples optimization of sequential decision making, hydrology modelling and hydroeconomics in a single modeling framework. The benefits were considered the avoided costs of water scarcity and water treatment perceived downstream. The optimal expansion schedule of decisions was then defined under the objective function of minimizing total cost. We demonstrated the framework by applying it to a set of benchmark alternative scenarios for the Sinos River watershed (Brazil). We found that the optimal schedule of nature-based solutions expansion is sensitive to the initial land use and future drivers. Treatment cost reduction was the greatest feature in some scenarios, confirming it as a strategy for addressing water quality issues of degraded watersheds. But the accounting of water scarcity cost introduced a tradeoff: expansion of nature-based solutions in well-preserved watersheds may not worth the investment. Future research may improve current limitations in scope and models without structural changes in the framework. Practical implications of this work arise from the funding of watershed payments for environmental services projects by institutions and governments, which demand evidence-based policies to support investment of public resources.

AB In recent decades, land use/land cover change caused by rapid economic development has led to a sharp decline in the values of ecosystem service. Based on the land use/land cover change images of the PRD in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, the land use change was analyzed and the corresponding Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) were evaluated. In addition, a future land use simulation model was developed to simulate multiple scenarios in 2030. The results show that the area of construction land increased nearly 166.05% from 1990 to 2020, and the total ESVs decreased by 11.20 billion yuan. The contribution order of the four types ecosystem service to ESVs is regulating services > supporting services > provisioning services > cultural services. Compared with 2020, the values of ecosystem service of all the five scenarios shows a downward trend, and the order is the Ecological protection scenario (EPS) > the Natural development Scenario (NDS) > the Carbon neutral scenario (CNS) > the Production priority scenario (PPS) > the Economic development scenario (EDS). The CNS may be the most suitable scenario for the PRD region among the five scenarios.

AB To understand how climate change stressors might affect marine organisms and support adequate projections it is important to know how multiple stressors may be modulated by the presence of other species. We evaluated the direct effects of ocean warming (OW) and ocean acidification (OA) together with non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of the predatory crab Acanthocyclus hassleri on early ontogeny fitness-related traits of the commercially important rocky-shore keystone gastropod Concholepas concholepas. We measured the response of nine traits to these stressors at either the organismal level (survival, growth, feeding rates, tenacity, metabolic rate, calcification rate) or sub-organismal level (nutritional status, ATP-supplying capacity, stress condition). C. concholepas survival was not affected by any of the stressors. Feeding rates were not affected by OW or OA; however, they were reduced in the presence of crab NCEs compared with control conditions. Horizontal tenacity was affected by the OA x NCEs interaction; in the presence of NCEs, OA reduced tenacity. The routine metabolic rate, measured by oxygen consumption, increased significantly with OW. Nutritional status assessment determined that carbohydrate content was not affected by any of the stressors. However, protein content was affected by the OA x NCEs interaction; in the absence of NCEs, OA reduced protein levels. ATP-supplying capacity, measured by citrate synthase (CS) activity, and cellular stress condition (HSP70 expression) were reduced by OA, with reduction in CS activity found particularly at the high temperature. Our results indicate C. concholepas traits are affected by OA and OW and the effects are modulated by predator risk (NCEs). We conclude that some C. concholepas traits are resilient to climate stressors (survival, growth, horizontal tenacity and nutritional status) but others are affected by OW (metabolic rate), OA (ATP-supplying capacity, stress condition), and NCEs (feeding rate). The results suggest that these negative effects can adversely affect the associated community.

AB Payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes are an increasingly important approach that often try to achieve triple bottom line solutions - achieving biodiversity conservation and social equity-, while minimizing costs. However, when planning for multiple objectives with a limited budget, spatial mismatches and trade-offs between objectives are likely to exist. Here, we present a framework for evaluating the potential spatial trade-offs among different objectives for sound policy-and decision-making. We explore the trade-offs: 1) between water and above-ground carbon storage ecosystem services; 2) among ecosystem services (both individually and when they are considered simultaneously) and biodiversity; and 3) among ecosystem services, biodiversity, and social equity in Colombia. We found that there are clear trade-offs between water services and biodiversity, and between social equity and biodiversity, suggesting that PES schemes targeting just one of these objectives may lead to poor outcomes for the others. However, there are a minimal trade-off between carbon and biodiversity, indicating that PES schemes targeted at biodiversity likely also contribute to carbon sequestration objectives. The framework we employ here can be used in other contexts to navigate the potential trade-offs in PES designed for triple bottom line solutions to allow decision-makers to better target where to prioritize PES investment.

AB Background: Forests of Pinus pinceana in the Eastern Sierra Madre of Tamaulipas grow in dry environmental conditions. It is important to know the composition and floristic diversity, as well as the useful structural parameters for future conservation programs.
   Questions: What is the structure, composition and floristic diversity of the vegetation associated with the Pinus pinceana forest in Tamaulipas?
   Studied species / data description /Mathematical model: Pinus pinceana, structural parameters, diversity, and linear regression models. Study site and dates: State of Tamaulipas, Mexico. March 2016 to March 2017.
   Methods: At each site (A and B) three strata were analyzed, ten 100 m(2) plots for high stratum, 25 m(2) for medium stratum and 1 m(2) for low stratum, for a total of 30 plots per site.
   Results: A total of 48 species, 39 genera and 24 families of vascular plants were recorded. Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Asparagaceae were the most representative families. Pinus pinceana had the highest Importance value index (IVI), whereas Flourensia laurifolia and Acacia roemeriana had the highest IVI values for the medium stratum. For the low stratum Croton ciliatoglandulifer and Hechtia hernandez-sandovalii had the highest IVI value. Significant differences were also found in the structure of the middle and upper stratum between the two study sites.
   Conclusions: The vegetation of the Pinus pinceana forests in Tamaulipas are similar in composition and diversity of species between sites, but the structure of the middle and upper stratum between the two study sites is different.

AB Macrophyte rhizosphere microbes, as crucial components of the wetland ecosystem, play an important role in maintaining the function and stability of natural and constructed wetlands. Distinct environmental conditions and management practices between natural and constructed wetlands would affect macrophytes rhizosphere microbial communities and their associated functions. Nevertheless, the understanding of the diversity, composition, and co-occurrence patterns of the rhizosphere bacterial communities in natural and constructed wetlands remains unclear. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing to characterize the bacterial community of the rhizosphere and bulk sediments of macrophyte Phragmites australis in representative natural and constructed wetlands. We observed higher alpha diversity of the bacterial community in the constructed wetland than that of the natural wetland. Additionally, the similarity of bacterial community composition between rhizosphere and bulk sediments in the constructed wetland was increased compared to that of the natural wetland. We also found that plants recruit specific taxa with adaptive functions in the rhizosphere of different wetland types. Rhizosphere samples of the natural wetland significantly enriched the functional bacterial groups that mainly related to nutrient cycling and plant-growth-promoting, while those of the constructed wetland-enriched bacterial taxa with potentials for biodegradation. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that the interactions among rhizosphere bacterial taxa in the constructed wetland were more complex than those of the natural wetland. This study broadens our understanding of the distinct selection processes of the macrophytes rhizosphere-associated microbes and the co-occurrence network patterns in different wetland types. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the importance of plant-microbe interactions in wetlands and further suggest P. australis rhizosphere enriched diverse functional bacteria that might enhance the wetland performance through biodegradation, nutrient cycling, and supporting plant growth.

AB Climate and soil factors induce substantial controls over plant biodiversity in stressful ecosystems. Despite of some studies on plant biodiversity in extreme ecosystems including rocky outcrops, simultaneous effects of climate and soil factors have rarely been studied on different facets of biodiversity including taxonomic and functional diversity in these ecosystems. In addition, we know little about plant biodiversity variations in such extreme ecosystems compared to natural environments. It seems that environmental factors acting in different spatial scales specifically influence some facets of plant biodiversity. Therefore, we studied changes in taxonomic and functional diversity along precipitation and soil gradients in both landscapes (i) rocky outcrops and (ii) their nearby rangeland sites in northeast of Iran. In this regard, we considered six sites across precipitation and soil gradients in each landscape, and established 90 1m(2) quadrates in them (i.e. 15 quadrats in each site; 15 x 6 = 90 in each landscape). Then, taxonomic and functional diversity were measured using RaoQ index, FDis and CWM indices. Finally, we assessed impacts of precipitation and soil factors on biodiversity indices in both landscapes by performing regression models and variation partitioning procedure. The patterns of taxonomic diversity similarly showed nonlinear changes along the precipitation and soil factors in both landscapes (i.e. outcrop and rangeland). However, we found a more negative and significant trends of variation in functional diversity indices (except for CWMSLA) across precipitation and soil factors in outcrops than their surrounding rangelands. Variations of plant biodiversity were more explained by precipitation factors in surrounding rangelands, whereas soil factors including organic carbon had more consistent and significant effects on plant biodiversity in outcrops. Therefore, our results represent important impacts of soil factors in structuring plant biodiversity facets in stressful ecosystems. While, environmental factors acting in regional and broad scales such as precipitation generally shape vegetation and plant biodiversity patterns in natural ecosystems. We can conclude that rocky outcrops provide suitable microenvironments to present plant species with similar yields that are less able to be present in rangeland ecosystems.

AB Research on resource partitioning in plant-pollinator mutualistic systems is mainly concentrated at the levels of species and communities, whereas differences between males and females are typically ignored. Nevertheless, pollinators often show large sexual differences in behaviour and morphology, which may lead to sex-specific patterns of resource use with the potential to differentially affect plant reproduction and diversification. We investigated variation in behavioural and morphological traits between sexes of hummingbird species as potential mechanisms underlying sex-specific flower resource use in ecological communities. To do so, we compiled a dataset of plant-hummingbird interactions based on pollen loads for 31 hummingbird species from 13 localities across the Americas, complemented by data on territorial behaviour (territorial or non-territorial) and morphological traits (bill length, bill curvature, wing length and body mass). We assessed the extent of intersexual differences in niche breadth and niche overlap in floral resource use across hummingbird species. Then, we tested whether floral niche breadth and overlap between sexes are associated with sexual dimorphism in behavioural or morphological traits of hummingbird species while accounting for evolutionary relatedness among the species. We found striking differences in patterns of floral resource use between sex. Females had a broader floral niche breadth and were more dissimilar in the plant species visited with respect to males of the same species, resulting in a high level of resource partitioning between sexes. We found that both territoriality and morphological traits were related to sex-specific resource use by hummingbird species. Notably, niche overlap between sexes was greater for territorial than non-territorial species, and moreover, niche overlap was negatively associated with sexual dimorphism in bill curvature across hummingbird species. These results reveal the importance of behavioural and morphological traits of hummingbird species in sex-specific resource use and that resource partitioning by sex is likely to be an important mechanism to reduce intersexual competition in hummingbirds. These findings highlight the need for better understanding the putative role of intersexual variation in shaping patterns of interactions and plant reproduction in ecological communities.

AB 1. Drylands have low nitrogen stocks and are predicted to be sensitive to modest increases in reactive nitrogen availability, but direct evidence that atmospheric nitrogen deposition will have sustained effects on dryland ecosystems is sparse and conflicting.
   2. We used three long-running in situ nitrogen deposition simulation experiments and a complementary laboratory incubation experiment to address fundamental questions about how nitrogen inputs affect drylands: (1) What are the long- and short-term consequences of nitrogen inputs for biogeochemical and ecosystem properties?; (2) Do these consequences depend on soil moisture availability?; and (3) Does soil texture modify the effects of nitrogen inputs and/or soil moisture availability?
   3. In 2011, we established three study sites along a soil texture gradient in Arches National Park with plots receiving 0, 2, 5 or 8 kg N ha(-1) annually (n = 5 per treatment per site). We assessed a suite of biogeochemical metrics over the long term and short term. To assess longer term effects, we sampled annually (2013-2019), just prior to spring nitrogen fertilization. To assess short-term effects, we sampled immediately before and after spring nitrogen fertilization in 2013. Additionally, we compared foliar chemistry, soil extracellular enzyme activities, heterotrophic respiration rates, and nitrogen trace gas fluxes at select intervals during the study period (2011-2019). Finally, we conducted a laboratory incubation to measure the individual and interacting effects of soil moisture and nitrogen additions on soil microbial activity.
   4. We identified some short-term effects in situ, but no lasting consequences of added nitrogen for any of the metrics measured. In the incubation, soil moisture treatments independently increased heterotrophic respiration rates but did not modify the effects of added nitrogen. In contrast to nitrogen treatments, soil texture was associated with large differences in biogeochemical cycling.
   5. Our results oppose the common prediction that coupled dryland biogeochemical cycles are sensitive to nitrogen inputs and suggest that fine-scale edaphic heterogeneity is a key driver of dryland ecosystem properties.
   6. Synthesis. This study synthesizes a rare, long-term dataset, which provides robust evidence that carbon and nutrient cycling and availability are resistant to realistic levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in remote dryland ecosystems.

AB The fire regime is essential in creating a mosaic of plant structure and diversity in South American open savannas, especially favouring herbs. However, studies investigating diversity patterns in Neotropical savannas rarely focus on the herb-subshrub layer. This study investigated the variation of the herb-subshrub layer under contrasting fire regimes in the most conserved site within the Cerrado Domain, the Jalapao region, Brazil. We selected four sites of open savanna physiognomy with similar topographic, climatic and edaphic features: three burned every 2 years, while the fourth site has remained unburned for at least the last 10 years. We randomly distributed 15 plots of 4 m(2) in each site and identified all herbs and subshrubs in each plot to estimate density, richness, alpha diversity and species composition. The unburned site had lower herb-subshrub density, richness and diversity than the frequently burned sites. Species composition varied between frequently burned and unburned sites, partially explained by the fire frequency across sites. Although other ecological factors may explain the patterns detected, we cannot rule out the importance of fire in structuring plant communities in the Jalapao region. As in other savannas, our study in the Cerrado Domain reinforces the essential role of the fire regimes in modifying and maintaining the diversity of herbaceous plants at the landscape scale.

AB Fungal communities can influence the productivity, composition and survival of trees through cycling nutrients, providing resources and altering pathogens. Thus, shifts in fungal communities could impact forests by altering interactions between trees and their environments. Fungal community composition may be shaped by stochastic and deterministic processes such as dispersal limitation, environmental filtering and partner specificity between trees and fungi. For tree species with large geographical ranges, we expect fungal assembly processes to change with environmental variation across the range of the tree partner. Due to specificity between trees and symbiotic fungi, we expect deterministic to outweigh stochastic processes in root compared with soil fungi. As some tree species have exceptional longevity, we also expected tree age to influence fungal community assembly. We surveyed fungi in four stands of Pseudotsuga menziesii with tree ages up to 800 years along an 1,800 km transect. We sampled roots and soil around 12 P. menziesii in each stand, aged the trees, and sequenced fungal rDNA to determine composition and richness from which we calculated the relative role of deterministic and stochastic assembly processes. We used null models to evaluate the relative importance of deterministic variable and homogenizing selection, and stochastic dispersal limitation, drift and homogenizing dispersal in fungal community assembly. We detected 7,280 amplicon sequence variants with 5,270 associated with soil, 3,887 with roots and 1,877 found across both roots and soils. Deterministic processes dominated root and soil fungal communities at all sites except one where stochastic processes (i.e. dispersal limitation and drift) controlled root fungi. Despite the dominance of determinism in fungal community assembly, the proportion of processes differed by site. Assembly processes did not vary with tree age. Synthesis. Taken together, we suggest that the local environment, water limitation and partner-preference between trees and their associated fungi, influence fungal community composition across the range of P. menziesii. We conclude that while fungal communities occurring near P. menziesii are dominated by homogenizing selection, the role of neutral processes still has a minor influence on community assembly and may be important in spatially isolated communities and those with strong gradients of fungal diversity.

AB Increased demand on forests to produce renewable biomass have accelerated the use of non-native tree species in forestry worldwide, often with negative effects on native biodiversity. In Sweden, the North American lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex. Loudon var. latifolia) was introduced already in the 1970's. Even though the species now covers large areas, effects on native flora and fauna have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this study, we used a large-scale field experiment with 30 paired P. contorta and P. sylvestris stands in central and northern Sweden to study the effects of P. contorta plantation on the abundance and activity of red wood ants of the Formica rufa-group, density and species richness of other ant species, as well as possible effects on the abundance of the specialized ant predator Pella humeralis. We collected epigaeic insects with pit fall traps, surveyed wood ant mound density and volume, and monitored ant activity on trees in all stands. Our analyses revealed a trend with higher mound density in P. sylvestris compared with P. contorta stands, although wood ant worker catch did not differ between the pine species. However, red wood ant activity was significantly higher in P. sylvestris stands, suggesting that P. contorta is not a preferred tree species for the tending of aphids for honeydew. Total ant species richness as well as the catch of Camponotus herculeanus and Myrmica ruginodis were higher in P. sylvestris stands, suggesting that they constitute a more favorable habitat for ants. Ant species richness was negatively influenced by wood ants in P. sylvestris stands only. A similar pattern was shown for C. herculeanus. Myrmica ruginodis was more abundant in P. sylvestris stands only if no thinning had been applied. Wood ant catch was positively correlated with catch of the specialized predatory rove beetle Pella humeralis showing that there is a strong interaction between the predatory beetle and wood ants.Our results suggest that P. contorta plantations impact both red wood ants and associated species and although competition from wood ants is more pronounced in P. sylvestris stands they still constitute a more favorable habitat for most ant species. Thus, large scale plantation of the non-native but closely related P. contorta may negatively impact epigaeic assemblages, a pattern that is not compensated by released competition by dominant red wood ants.

AB Forest disturbance, including deforestation, is a major driver of global biodiversity decline. Identifying the underlying socioeconomic drivers can help guide interventions to halt biodiversity decline. Here, we quantified spatial overlaps between the distributions of 6164 globally threatened terrestrial vertebrate species and five major forest disturbance drivers at the global scale: commodity-driven deforestation, shifting agriculture, forestry, wildfire, and urbanization. We find that each driver has a distinct relative importance among species groups and geographic regions with, for example, the dominant disturbance drivers being forestry in northern regions and shifting agriculture in the tropics. Overall, shifting agriculture was more prevalent within threatened forest species' ranges in the tropics, and some temperate nations. Our findings suggest that, globally, threatened forest species are exposed to a disproportional decrease in habitat area. Combining forest disturbance maps and species ranges can help evaluate agricultural landscape management and prioritize conservation efforts to reduce further biodiversity loss.
   Spatial overlaps between forest disturbance drivers and threatened species' ranges reveal that shifting agriculture is a major driver of forest biodiversity loss at a global scale, as demonstrated by a global analysis of forest disturbance and threatened vertebrate species distributions.

AB Agricultural landscapes can be managed to protect biodiversity and maintain ecosystem services. One approach to achieve this is to restore native perennial vegetation within croplands. Where rowcrops have displaced prairie, as in the US Midwest, restoration of native perennial vegetation can align with crops in so called "prairie strips." We tested the effect of prairie strips in addition to other management practices on a variety of taxa and on a suite of ecosystem services. To do so, we worked within a 33-year-old experiment that included treatments that varied methods of agricultural management across a gradient of land use intensity. In the two lowest intensity crop management treatments, we introduced prairie strips that occupied 5% of crop area. We addressed three questions: (1) What are the effects of newly established prairie strips on the spillover of biodiversity and ecosystem services into cropland? (2) How does time since prairie strip establishment affect biodiversity and ecosystem services? (3) What are the tradeoffs and synergies among biodiversity conservation, non-provisioning ecosystem services, and provisioning ecosystem services (crop yield) across a land use intensity gradient (which includes prairie strips)? Within prairie strip treatments, where sampling effort occurred within and at increasing distance from strips, dung beetle abundance, spider abundance and richness, active carbon, decomposition, and pollination decreased with distance from prairie strips, and this effect increased between the first and second year. Across the entire land use intensity gradient, treatments with prairie strips and reduced chemical inputs had higher butterfly abundance, spider abundance, and pollination services. In addition, soil organic carbon, butterfly richness, and spider richness increased with a decrease in land use intensity. Crop yield in one treatment with prairie strips was equal to that of the highest intensity management, even while including the area taken out of production. We found no effects of strips on ant biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions (N2O and CH4). Our results show that, even in early establishment, prairie strips and lower land use intensity can contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services without a disproportionate loss of crop yield.

AB Over a century after Wallace's proposition of the riverine barrier hypothesis, the role of rivers in the diversification of species remains a matter of interest in Amazon biogeography. Amazonian rivers, in particular those large and fast flowing rivers, are widely recognized to act as barriers to the dispersal of some organisms. However, the extent to which primate species changes across interfluves (beta-diversity) in response to river features remains to be explicitly tested. In this study, we examine how river characteristics affect the variation in taxonomic and phylogenetic beta-diversity to elucidate the ecological processes behind the differences in primate assemblages between neighboring interfluves in the Brazilian Amazonia. We compiled International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) distribution maps of 80 river-bounded primate species in 10 interfluves separated by major rivers throughout the Brazilian Amazonia. We assessed both the taxonomic (disregarding phylogenetic relationships between species) and phylogenetic beta-diversities. We applied multiple linear models to evaluate whether annual discharge, sinuosity, and reflectance (as a proxy for amount of sediments) in each river or river section that separates neighboring interfluves make rivers effective barriers to primates. We found that mean discharge has a positive effect, while both sinuosity and amount of sediments have negative effects on primate beta-diversity. These variables have significant effects on total taxonomic and phylogenetic beta-diversity between neighboring interfluves, and their species turnover components. River features, however, have no effect on species richness differences. Genera are capable of traversing almost all interfluves, but species are replaced by others in opposite interfluves. Discharge affected both small- and large-sized primate total beta-diversity, but sinuosity only affected large-sized primate assemblages in neighboring interfluves. Our results indicate that although Amazonian rivers act as barriers for many primate species, this barrier effect seems limited to the short/medium time scales, as primate lineages are able to cross them over long-time scales.

AB Environmental heterogeneity is a key component in explaining the megadiversity of tropical forests. Despite its importance, knowledge about local drivers of environmental heterogeneity remains a challenge for ecologists. In Neotropical forests, epiphytic tank bromeliads store large amounts of water and nutrients in the tree canopy, and their tank overflow may create nutrient-rich patches in the soil. However, the effects of this nutrient flux on environmental heterogeneity and plant community structure in the understory remain unexplored. In a Brazilian coastal sandy forest, we investigated the effects of the presence of epiphytic tank bromeliads on throughfall chemistry, soil chemistry, soil litter biomass, light, and seedling community structure. In the presence of epiphytic tank bromeliads, the throughfall nitrogen concentration increased twofold, the throughfall phosphorus concentration increased threefold, and the soil patches had a 3.96% higher pH, a 50% higher calcium concentration, and 11.88% less light. By altering the availability of soil resources and conditions, the presence of bromeliads partially shifted the available niche spaces for plant species and indirectly affected the structure of the seedling communities, decreasing their diversity, density, and biomass. For the first time, we showed that the presence of tank bromeliads in the canopy can create characteristic soil patches in the understory, affecting the structure of seedling communities via fertilization. Our results reveal a novel local driver of environmental heterogeneity, reinforcing and expanding the key role of tank bromeliads both in nutrient cycling and plant community structuring of Neotropical coastal sandy forests.

AB Mountain spruce forests in Central Europe decline under storms and bark beetle calamities driven by climate change. A stabilisation by planting rare or missing tree species is expensive and requires funding. A funding policy should mitigate climate change and support biodiversity. The goal of this study was to identify a conversion strategy of even-aged spruce-dominated forest stands to uneven-aged mixed stands with spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and fir (Abies alba Mill.). A simultaneous nonlinear optimisation of the number of planted trees and harvested trees per species and per period schedules stand treatments aiming to maximise the long-term financial outcome. Planting modelling extends a density-dependent stand-level matrix transition model based on diameter classes with an age-class-based model for artificial regeneration. An optimal conversion strategy was applied for five funding policy schemes, each for five initial states representing different stages of age and species composition typical for spruce forest conversion in the mountain zone of the Western Carpathians. Only 50% and higher funding of planting costs for the minor/missing fir and beech species facilitates a substantial increase of their shares in stand volume. Funding decreases the volume failure due to mortality. Funding increases the standing and harvested volume, which mitigates climate change by increasing the carbon sequestration. Funding causes unintended effects on ecosystem services by lowering harvest diameters, decreasing the volume of less profitable beech, and temporarily reducing the stand density aimed at supporting plantings and their diameter increments.

AB Arabidopsis resistance to herbivory can be primed by insect egg deposition during the vegetative stage of the plant, but this primability is lost in flowering plants at no reproductive cost.
   While traits of plant resistance to herbivory often change during ontogeny, it is unknown whether the primability of this resistance depends on the plant's developmental stage. Resistance in non-flowering Arabidopsis thaliana against Pieris brassicae larvae is known to be primable by prior egg deposition on leaves. We investigated whether this priming effect is maintained in plants at the flowering stage. Larval performance assays revealed that flowering plants' resistance to herbivory was not primable by egg deposition. Accordingly, transcriptomes of flowering plants showed almost no response to eggs. In contrast, egg deposition on non-flowering plants enhanced the expression of genes induced by subsequent larval feeding. Strikingly, flowering plants showed constitutively high expression levels of these genes. Larvae performed generally worse on flowering than on non-flowering plants, indicating that flowering plants constitutively resist herbivory. Furthermore, we determined the seed weight in regrown plants that had been exposed to eggs and larvae during the non-flowering or flowering stage. Non-flowering plants benefitted from egg priming with a smaller loss in seed yield. The seed yield of flowering plants was unaffected by the treatments, indicating tolerance towards the larvae. Our results show that the primability of anti-herbivore defences in Arabidopsis depends on the plant's developmental stage.

AB With the burgeoning use of immune-based treatments for cancer, never has there been a greater need to understand the tumour microenvironment within which immune cells function and how it can be perturbed to inhibit tumour growth. Yet, current challenges in identifying optimal combinations of immunotherapies and engineering new cell-based therapies highlight the limitations of conventional paradigms for the study of the tumour microenvironment. Ecology has a rich history of studying predator-prey dynamics to discern factors that drive prey to extinction. Here, we describe the basic tenets of predator-prey theory as applied to 'predation' by immune cells and the 'extinction' of cancer cells. Our synthesis reveals fundamental mechanisms by which antitumour immunity might fail in sometimes counterintuitive ways and provides a fresh yet evidence-based framework to better understand and therapeutically target the immune-cancer interface.
   Improving on current cancer immunotherapies will require engaging immune effectors beyond T cells alone. Predator-prey theory can reveal understudied and counterintuitive facets of antitumour immunity, inspiring new approaches to manipulate the tumour ecosystem in favour of cancer cell extinction.

AB Mutualistic interactions are regulated by plant and animal traits, including animal body size and population density. In seed dispersal networks, frugivore body size determines the interaction outcome, and species population density determines interaction probability through encounter rates. To date, most studies examining the relative role of body size and population density in seed dispersal networks have examined animal guilds encompassing a narrow range of body sizes (e.g., birds only). Given non-random, body-size dependent defaunation, understanding the relative role of these traits is important to predict and, ideally, mitigate the effects of defaunation. We analyzed a hyper-diverse seed dispersal network composed of birds and mammals that cover a wide range of body sizes and population densities in the Brazilian Pantanal. Animal density per se did not significantly explain interaction patterns. Instead, population biomass, which represents the combination of body size and population density, was the most important predictor for most interaction network metrics. Population biomass was strongly correlated with body size, but not with density. Thus, larger frugivore species dispersed more plant species and were involved in more unique pairwise interactions than smaller species. Moreover, species with larger population biomass had the strongest influence (i.e., as indicated by measures of centrality) on other species in the network and were more generalist, interacting with a broader set of species, compared to species with lower population biomass. We posit that the increased abundance of small-sized frugivores resulting from the pervasive defaunation of large vertebrates would not compensate for the loss-of-function of the latter and the inherent disruption of seed dispersal networks.

AB Inducible responses to herbivores can be either localized or spread systemically throughout a plant. The ways in which clonal plants integrate their response to herbivores among clonal ramets is not well understood. Yet, this is important to understand the impacts that herbivores may have on clonal plants. We conducted a factorial split-plot greenhouse experiment to determine whether resistance is induced among ramets and how biomass allocation changes among ramets following herbivore damage to one of them. We manipulated the presence of two herbivores, Pieris rapae and Trichoplusia ni, and the root connection of ramets of the clonal invasive weed, Lepidium draba. We found local inducible resistance on the ramet where an herbivore fed, but not in neighboring ramets. Biomass allocation shifted in response to herbivores. Feeding by the generalist caterpillar T. ni resulted in a greater belowground biomass relative to shoot biomass in the local plant, but only when the clonal connection was intact. In contrast, herbivores had little impact on the root mass fraction of neighboring ramets. Herbivory to the local ramet increased the regrowth of neighboring ramets that lacked clonal connection, a trend that was driven by the specialist herbivore P. rapae. Herbivores did not induce systemic resistance among ramets of L. draba, but herbivores, especially the specialist, did alter how neighboring ramets regrow after grazing or mowing. Our observations suggest that individual ramets have fairly autonomous responses to herbivores, and that coordination among ramets, when present, may happen via signals that do not depend on root connections.

AB Perennial grasses are the main source of fuel during fires in savannas. The demography of these grasses likely varies between species although they have the same general architecture and coexist in savannas. However, very few studies compare their demography. Similarly, their demography likely varies between years because of the variability in weather condition and fire intensity. We described and compared the demography and life-cycle of the four dominant perennial grass species (Andropogon canaliculatus, Andropogon schirensis, Hyparrhenia diplandra and Loudetia simplex) of the Lamto savanna (Ivory Coast) and assessed the influence of their demographic features (stasis, fecundity, growth, fragmentation and retrogression) on this demography. Grass species were monitored over three consecutive years (2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018) on three 5 m x 10 m plots. We used a size-classified matrix model with 5 circumference classes (3-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-35 cm, 35-50 cm and >50 cm). Results showed differences in the age-based parameters, asymptotic growth rates (lambda s) and elasticities of the lambda s of the grass species. The population of A. canaliculatus, A. schirensis and H. diplandra were slowly declining while L. simplex was significantly declining. There were noticeable year-to-year variations in the demography of these four species. The most important demographic parameter influencing As was the stasis in all species, while retrogression and fragmentation contributed to a relative homogeneity of ages between size-classes 2 to 5. This study provides new insights about the demography of Guinean savanna grasses that could be used to describe the mechanisms of their coexistence, and inform fire management policies.

AB Aims Light availability varies drastically in forests, both vertically and horizontally. Vertical light heterogeneity (i.e., patterns of light attenuation from the forest canopy to the floor) may be related to light competition among trees, while horizontal light heterogeneity (i.e., variations in light intensity at a given height within forests) may be associated with light-niche partitioning among tree species. However, light heterogeneity in vertical and horizontal directions and their associations with forest structure are rarely studied to date. Here we report the first comprehensive study to compare the vertical and horizontal light heterogeneity in differently aged forests in two forest types. Location Twelve forest stands of different ages in cool-temperate forests (consisting of deciduous broad-leaved trees) and five of different ages in warm-temperate forests (evergreen conifer and deciduous broad-leaved trees) in Japan. Methods We measured vertical light profiles at 1-m intervals from the understorey (1 m above the ground) to the top canopy (12-22 m depending on stands) at 16 locations for each stand (20 m x 20 m). We also measured structural parameters (diameter at breast height, height, and crown dimensions) for all major trees in these stands. Results Along the secondary successional gradients, the vertical and horizontal light heterogeneity changed in a systematic manner in both forests. The vertical light attenuation rate was steeper in early succession and more gradual in late succession, and the horizontal light heterogeneity was relatively small in early succession and more pronounced in late succession. The vertical light attenuation rate was different between the two forest types; the light intensity dropped more sharply from the canopy surface in the cool-temperate forests due to the crown being vertically shorter and denser (i.e., higher leaf density per unit volume). Conclusion In early succession, a steeper light attenuation rate is likely related to the strong light competition among co-occurring trees and thus a self-thinning process. In late succession, the high spatial light heterogeneity in forests (i.e., larger horizontal light heterogeneity and gradual light attenuation rate) may allow more species to partition light, and thus may enhance species coexistence and diversity.

AB Tropical species are predicted to be among the most vulnerable to climate change as they often live close to their upper limits to thermal tolerance and in many cases, behavioural thermoregulation is required to persist in the thermal extremes of tropical latitudes. In concert with warming temperatures, near-shore species are faced with the additional threat of shoreline hardening, leading to a reduction in microhabitats that can provide thermal refuges. This situation is exemplified in Singapore, which lies almost on the equator and so experiences yearround hot temperatures, and much of its coastline is now seawall. To investigate the thermal ecology of a common intertidal gastropod, Nerita undata, on these artificial structures, we measured thermal conditions on two seawalls, the temperatures of habitats occupied by the snail, and compared these with the snail's thermal tolerance by measuring heart rate and behavioural thermoregulation (as preferred temperature, Tpref). At one of the two seawalls (Tanjong Rimau), temperatures experienced by N. undata exceeded all measures of thermal tolerance in the sun, while at the other (Palawan Beach), they did not. Temperatures in habitats occupied by the snails on the seawalls were similar to their measured Tpref in the laboratory and were lower than all measures of thermal tolerance. Behavioural thermoregulation by the snails, therefore, significantly increased the thermal safety margins of N. undata on the relatively homogenous seawalls in Singapore, and at one of the two seawalls were necessary to allow snails to survive. Accordingly, to facilitate motile species to maintain broad thermal safety margins through behavioural regulation, the provision of additional refuges from thermal stress is recommended on artificial coastal defences such as seawalls.

AB Mountain cloud forests (MCF) are one of the most diverse ecosystems due to their natural environmental heterogeneity and distribution. This ecosystem exhibits a high beta diversity at regional or local levels. In this study, the amphibian species diversity and assemblage structure were examined in a mountain cloud forest at El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve (ETBR) in southeastern Mexico. Ninety-six plots were sampled in eight sites, distributed in two core zones of protected mountain cloud forest. The amphibian species diversity, assemblage structure, and functional groups were analyzed and compared between the two zones; the relationships between environmental variables and amphibian diversity and the conservation status of the species were also examined. Based on six surveys conducted at each core zone over 24 months (1,536 person-hours), 306 individuals of 14 amphibian species were recorded, with only six species present in both core zones. While differences were found in the number of individuals and assemblage structure between the core zones, there were no differences in the number of species or the common or dominant species. Craugastor matudai was the most dominant species in both zones, while partial differences were found in the second- and third-most dominant species. While this study shows that the amphibian species diversity did not change within the extensive and conserved cloud forest of the ETBR, slight variations were observed in the structure of the amphibian assemblages and composition of species. The environmental heterogeneity (mainly humidity, temperature, and canopy cover) of the mountain cloud forest seems to determine the variation in the species assemblages between the different zones and the areas that make up this ecosystem. Nine amphibian species (64%) found in the ETBR are under an IUCN threat category. This study is one of the few that addresses the structure of amphibian assemblages in a large, well-preserved mountain cloud forest.

AB (1) Background: Southern Amazonia encompasses some of the most human-impacted and deforested regions of South America, resulting in a hyper-fragmented landscape. In this context, by using a geometric morphometrics approach, we aimed to examine the effect of forest fragmentation on developmental instability (DI) of the mandible, assessed by variation of fluctuating asymmetry (FA), in four neotropical small mammal species inhabiting the municipality of Alta Floresta (Brazil). (2) Methods: The impact of fragment area, fragment shape, isolation, and edge length on DI were assessed by measuring variation in mandibular FA in the long-tailed spiny rat (Proechimys longicaudatus), the hairy-tailed bolo mouse (Necromys lasiurus), the woolly mouse opossum (Marmosa demerarae), and the Amazonian red-sided opossum (Monodelphis glirina). Mandibles from a total of 304 specimens originating from different-sized fragments (ranging from 5 to 900 ha) were used. Twelve homologous landmarks were digitized in photographs of the mesial view of each hemi-mandible. (3) Results: The two largest species, P. longicaudatus and M. demerarae, exhibited significantly higher levels of FA in mandibular shape in small fragments (5-26 ha) in comparison to large ones (189-900 ha). Edge length negatively impacted M. demerarae, the only arboreal species, reinforcing its strongest dependence on core forest habitats. (4) Conclusions: For small mammal communities, we propose that fragments >similar to 200 ha should be the focus of conservation efforts, as both resilient and more sensitive species would benefit from their more preserved biotic and abiotic conditions. Conversely, fragments <similar to 25 ha seem to lead to a significant increase in stress during developmental stages.

AB Background and aims: Several studies have shown an increase in tree mortality in intact tropical forests in recent decades. However, most studies are based on networks of field plots whose representativeness is debated. We examine the potential of repeated Airborne LiDAR Scanning data to map forest structure change over large areas with high spatial resolution and to detect tree mortality patterns at landscape level. Methods: The study site is a complex forested landscape in French Guiana with varied topographic positions, vegetation structures and disturbance history. We computed a Gap Dynamics Index from Canopy Height Models derived from successive LiDAR data sets (2009, 2015 and 2019) that we compared to field-measured mortality rates (in stem number and basal area loss) obtained from regular monitoring of 74 1.56-ha permanent plots. Results: At the plot level, the relation between gap dynamics and absolute basal area loss rate (combining fallen and standing dead trees) was overall highly significant (R2 = 0.60) and especially tight for the 59 ha of unlogged forest (R2 = 0.72). Basal area loss rate was better predicted from gap dynamics than stem loss rate. In particular, in previously logged plots, intense self-thinning of small stems did not translate into detectable gaps, leading to poor predictability of stem mortality by LiDAR in those forests severely disturbed 30 years before. At the landscape scale, LiDAR data revealed spatial patterns of gap creation that persisted over the successive analysis periods. Those spatial patterns were related to local topography and canopy height. High canopy forests and bottomlands were more dynamic, with a higher fraction of canopy affected by gaps per unit time indicating higher basal area loss rates. Conclusion: Gap detection and mapping via multitemporal LiDAR data is poised to become instrumental in characterizing landscape-scale forest response to current global change. Meaningful comparison of gap dynamics across time and space will, however, depend on consistent LiDAR acquisitions characteristics.

AB Cabo Verde's biodiversity is threatened by activities that meet human needs. To counteract this, an integration of scientific and indigenous knowledge is required, but no comprehensive list of the useful local plants is available. Thus, in this work, we assess (1) their diversity and phytogeography; (2) the role of geophysical, historical, and socio-economic factors on species distribution and uses; and (3) potentially relevant species for sustainable development. Data were obtained from flora, scientific publications, historical documents, herbarium specimens and field work. Many species were introduced since the 15th century to support settlement and commercial interests. We identified 518 useful taxa, of which 145 are native, 38 endemic and 44 endangered. The number of useful taxa is correlated with altitude and agricultural area, as well as with rural population indicators, but not with total population or socio-economic indicators such as gross domestic product. Native taxa are mostly used for fuelwood, forage and utilitarian purposes. Agrobiodiversity and traditional practices seem crucial to cope with recurrent droughts and ensure food security. Most of the introduced species do not present conservation problems, contrasting with the overuse of some native taxa. The safeguarding of native populations will ensure the sustainable exploitation of these resources and benefit the local economy.

AB The selection of habitats with potential reproductive resources may maximize individual reproductive success and overall fitness. Dendrobatid frogs display remarkable parental care which is associated with water bodies (phytotelmata) contained in plants with characteristics that are important to offspring survival. It has been shown that the size of phytotelmata is a key factor that drove the divergence in parental care patterns in poison frogs and that the distribution of reproductive resources can influence space use in these species. Here, we investigated parental care strategies and the influence of reproductive resource distribution on space use patterns in a wild population of Andinobates claudiae in Bocas del Toro, Panama. We identified the phytotelmata characteristics that predict tadpole deposition and analysed the association between the spatial distribution of phytotelmata and spatial use of males and females. Our observations showed that this species mates polygamously and exhibits male parental care. We found that male frogs have smaller kernel density home ranges and core areas compared to females, and that space use is related to the density of Heliconia plants whose axil cavities are used for tadpole rearing. Furthermore, we found that tadpoles were more frequently found in phytotelmata that were at lower heights and contained larger water volumes. Fathers invested time inspecting multiple cavities and travelled further than predicted from their territories to find suitable deposition sites. Our observations suggest a selective choice of phytotelmata regarding tadpole deposition, where distribution and quality of cavities might influence parental care decisions.

AB Stepping-stone restoration plantings can reconcile conservation goals and local land-use needs in highly fragmented ecosystems. We explored how initial planting composition influences recruiting plant species density, diversity, abundance, and forest structure in a 13-year-old restoration experiment in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Treatments included eight fenced plantings with animal-dispersed species, eight plantings with wind-dispersed species, eight unplanted plots to favor natural succession, and eight plots in the primary forest as reference sites. We predicted that by attracting more seed dispersers, animal-dispersed plantings would most closely resemble the primary forest. A census of trees taller than 2 m showed that while wind-dispersed plantings had more recruits, the animal-dispersed plantings most closely resembled the primary forest in pioneer abundance, species density and abundance of biotically dispersed and abiotically dispersed plants, individual tree basal area (in square meters per hectare), and vertical structure. The wind-dispersed plantings more closely approximated the forest in non-pioneer abundance and community composition. However, restoration treatments were more similar to each other than to the primary forest and did not differ in plant diversity. Animal-dispersed and wind-dispersed plantings did not differ in non-pioneer species density and matched the primary forest in total plot basal area. Higher abundance of trees in wind-plantings is explained by lower establishment limitations, seed legacy effects, and rapid reproduction of a few planted species. As the experiment continues, we expect treatment effects on seed dispersers will more strongly influence the recruiting plant community, leading the animal-dispersed plantings to more closely resemble the primary forest in diversity and forest structure.

AB The loss of larger frugivores alters seed dispersal. Species reintroductions have been proposed as a strategy for reversing local disperser extinctions. However, their effects on ecological processes have seldom been assessed. Howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba) have been reintroduced in Tijuca National Park, a defaunated Atlantic Forest fragment. We compared the fate of seeds dispersed by howlers to dispersal by two other frugivores present in the park: capuchin monkeys (Sapajus nigritus) and guans (Penelope superciliaris). Howlers produce clumped defecations that attract dung beetles, which provide secondary dispersal by burying seeds embedded in feces. We expected that seeds dispersed by howlers would have a different fate from those dispersed by capuchins and guans, since their scattered defecations are less attractive to dung beetles. We followed the fate of seeds 3-14 mm in diameter through three processes after seed deposition: secondary dispersal, predation, and seedling emergence. We estimated the probabilities in each step according to the primary disperser and plant species. Dispersal by howlers increased the recruitment of large-seeded plants because of the higher probability of secondary dispersal of the seeds in their feces. Fewer of the seeds dispersed by capuchins or guans were buried, regardless of size, and burial depths were shallower. For 3 mm seeds, the final recruitment probability was similar across frugivores. However, more of the larger seeds reached the seedling stage when dispersed by howlers since they were buried more deeply, which increased their survival without affecting seedling emergence. Reintroductions can thus contribute to restoring ecological processes.

AB Forest height inversion with Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) has become a research hotspot in the field of radar remote sensing. In this paper, we systematically studied a modified two-step, three-stage inversion simulating the L-band (L = 23 cm) full-polarization interferometric SAR data with an average forest height of 18 m using ESA PolSARpro-SIM software. We applied this method to E-SAR L-band single-baseline full PolInSAR data in 2003. In the first step, we modified the three-stage inversion algorithm based on phase diversity (PD)/maximum coherence difference (MCD) coherence optimization methods, corresponding to PD, MCD, respectively. In the second step, we introduced the coherence amplitude inversion term and modified the fixed weight to the variable of epsilon times the ground scattering ratio, which improved the accuracy of forest height inversion. The mean of forest height inversion by the HV method was the lowest (15.83 m) and the RMSE was the largest (4.80 m). The PD method was superior to the HV method with RMSE (4.60 m). The MCD method was slightly better than using the PD method with the smallest RMSE (4.43 m). After adding the coherence amplitude term, the RMSE was improved by 0.15 m, 0.14 m, and 0.08 m, respectively. The smallest RMSE was obtained by MCD, followed by the PD and HV methods. Although the robustness of the forest height inversion algorithm was reduced, the underestimation was improved and the RMSE was reduced. Due to the complexity of the real SAR E-SAR L-band single-baseline full PolInSAR data and the small sample sizes, the three-stage inversion methods based on coherent optimization were lower than the three-stage in-version method. After introducing the coherent magnitude term, the overestimation of the forest height was significantly weakened in HVWeight, PDweight, and MCDWeight, and PDWeight was optimal. The modified two-step, three-stage inversion algorithm had significant effects in alleviating forest height underestimation and overestimation, improving the accuracy of forest height inversion, and laying a foundation for the upcoming L-band SAR satellite generation, new SAR and LIDAR systems combined with RPAs (remotely piloted aircrafts)/UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) for small areas mapping initiatives, and promoting the depth and breadth of the SAR applications of the new SAR system.

AB To meet international and national commitments to decrease emissions of fossil fuels, cities around the world must obtain information on their historical levels of emissions, identifying hotspots that require special attention. Direct atmospheric measurements of pollution sources are almost impossible to obtain retrospectively. However, tree rings serve as an archive of environmental information for reconstructing the temporal and spatial distribution of fossil-fuel emissions in urban areas. Here, we present a novel methodology to reconstruct the spatial and temporal contribution of fossil-fuel CO2 concentration ([CO2F]) in the urban area of Medellin, Colombia. We used a combination of dendrochronological analyses, radiocarbon measurements, and statistical modeling. We obtained annual maps of [CO2F] from 1977 to 2018 that describe changes in its spatial distribution over time. Our method was successful at identifying hotspots of emissions around industrial areas, and areas with high traffic density. It also identified temporal trends that may be related to socioeconomic and technological factors. We observed an important increase in [CO2F] during the last decade, which suggests that efforts of city officials to reduce traffic and emissions did not have a significant impact on the contribution of fossil fuels to local air. The method presented here could be of significant value for city planners and environmental officials from other urban areas around the world. It allows identifying hotspots of fossil fuels emissions, evaluating the impact of previous environmental policies, and planning new interventions to reduce emissions.

AB Forest dynamics is driven by the formation of gaps, especially in temperate forests. A potentially useful tool for identifying canopy gaps at different spatial scales is remote sensing. Our study used two types of data: (1) high spatial resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) to detect canopy gaps in the forest and (2) field data to quantify natural and artificial regeneration within the gaps. The study aimed to: (i) measure the characteristics of canopy gaps; (ii) identify the regeneration patterns within gaps; (iii) identify the factors influencing tree species regeneration within gaps. We analysed 313 tree canopy gaps in the Polish part of Bialowieza Forest (ca. 620 km(2)), east Poland. Variability in the mean gap area was very high, ranging from 20.2 to 8693.8 m(2). The number of gaps with an area > 1000 m(2) was the largest. The total area of gaps was highest in coniferous stands, where the biggest median area was also found. Gap size did not affect regeneration density in the Bialowieza Forest, except for birch and hornbeam. The density of less light-demanding tree species in the gaps was greater than light demanding ones. Birch regenerated in all gap sizes, and its density increased with gap area. Oak seedlings dominated in small gaps but conditions in the 'matrix of small gaps' was sufficient for short oak saplings. Hornbeam regeneration was highest in the gaps surveyed, especially the density of short saplings. Seedlings of hornbeam were present in 32% of gaps, but saplings were present in as many as 56% of gaps. Spruce regeneration was less numerous than hornbeam regeneration. Birch regeneration was the most numerous in short sapling stage. We analyzed 31 variables from different categories to identify the factors influencing tree species regeneration within gaps. The most essential variables for the birch and hornbeam regeneration were those containing supporting information, especially the percentage of the specific tree species covering the land around the gap. The variables based on gap geometry (size, shape, direction, elongation) were less important than variables from other categories. We found the positive influence of browsing on the density of hornbeam saplings. However, the high density of ungulates and their browsing pressure hinder birch regeneration. Intensive browsing by ungulates seems to be the most important factor in changing species composition and forest regeneration structure in gaps.

AB Does climate determine the trophic organization of communities around the world? A recent study showed that a limited number of community trophic structures emerge when co-occurrence of trophic guilds among large mammals is examined globally. We ask whether the pattern is general across all terrestrial mammals (n = 5272) and birds (n = 9993). We found that the six community-trophic structures previously identified with large mammals are largely maintained when all mammals and birds are examined, both together and separately, and that bioclimatic variables, including net primary productivity (NPP), are strongly related to variation in the geographical boundaries of community trophic structures. We argue that results are consistent with the view that trophic communities are self-organized structures optimizing energy flows, and that climate likely acts as the main control parameter by modulating the amount of solar energy available for conversion by plants and percolated through food webs across trophic communities. Gradual changes in climate parameters would thus be expected to trigger abrupt changes in energy flows resulting from phase transitions (tipping points) between different dynamical stable states. We expect future research to examine if our results are general across organisms, ecosystems, scales and methodologies, and whether inferences rooted in complex systems theory are supported. The emergence of general patterns in the functional properties of animal communities at broad scales supports the emergence of food-web biogeography as a sub-discipline of biogeography focused on the analysis of the geographical distributions of trophic relationships among organisms.

AB The authors investigated the role of thermoregulation mechanisms and thermal limits on thermal niche differentiation in two hierarchical similar Eucraniini dung beetle assemblages inhabiting arid environments in north-western Argentina. Both dung beetle assemblages showed temporal and thermal niche segregation between all sympatric species, minimising overlap during their daily activity and soil temperature preferences. Thermal tolerance of Eucraniini species was partially modulated by behavioural adaptations and complementary thermoregulatory mechanisms related to eliminating the temperature excess, increasing the metabolic rate promoting an effective regulation of the excess heat that permitted a decrease in their body temperature by evaporative cooling. Based on the physiological syndromes obtained, the authors found a greatest interspecific differentiation that allows us to differentiate each species using ecophysiological traits. Interspecific body size differences in sympatric Eucraniini contributed greatly to the metabolic capacity of individuals to thermoregulate. Eucranium species, the largest species showed the lowest capacity to respond to thermal stress decreasing heat excess temperature, presenting the lowest thermal limit values coinciding with a 'minithermy' strategy that explains the preferred lower soil temperatures around 30 degrees C. On the contrary, Anomiopsoides species showed a clear adaptation to being active during periods of the day in which the soil temperature reached over 50 degrees C, adopting a strategy of 'maxithermy' by foraging when temperatures are closer to their thermal limits. In conclusion, it can be determined that ecophysiological syndromes related to thermal stress regulation and thermal limits allowed a displacement in thermal niche dimension, minimising interspecific competition and so allowing species coexistence in Eucraniini dung beetles.

AB A vast literature indicates that environment plays a paramount role in determining floristic composition in tropical forests. However, it remains unclear which are the most important environmental factors and their relative effect across different spatial scales, plant life forms or forest types. This study reviews the state of knowledge on the effect of soil and climate on floristic composition in tropical forests. From 137 publications, we collated information regarding: (1) spatial scale, continent, country, life form, and forest type; (2) proportion of variance in floristic composition explained by soil and climatic variables and how it varies across spatial scales; and (3) which soil and climate variables had a significant relationship on community composition for each life form and forest type. Most studies were conducted at landscape spatial scales (67%) and mainly in South America (74%), particularly in Brazil (40%). Studies majorly focused on trees (82%) and on lowland evergreen tropical forests (74%). Both soil and climate variables explained in average the same amount (14% each) of the variation observed in plant species composition, although soils appear to exert a stronger influence at smaller spatial scales while climate effect increases toward larger ones. Temperature, precipitation, seasonality, soil moisture, soil texture, aluminum, and base cations-calcium and magnesium-and their related variables (e.g., cation exchange capacity, or base saturation) were frequently reported as important variables in structuring plant communities. Yet there was variability when comparing different life forms or forest types, which renders clues about certain ecological peculiarities. We recommend the use of standardized protocols for collecting environmental and floristic information in as much as possible, and to fill knowledge gaps in certain geographic regions. These actions will be especially beneficial to share uniform data between researchers, conduct analysis at large spatial scales and get a better understanding of the link between soils and climate gradients and plant strategies, which is key to propose better conservation policies under the light of global change.

AB Background There is a long-term trend towards the abandonment of agro-pastoral activities in the mountain areas of Europe: the following encroachment process of semi-natural grasslands by shrubs is one of the main severe threats to the conservation of biodiversity in mountain environments. To better understand the impact of land abandonment, we analysed the reliability of plant functional groups, ant traits, and ant functional groups as indicators of land use changes. We carried out the research in Italy at four sites along a latitudinal/altitudinal gradient in three biogeographic regions (Mediterranean, Continental, Alpine). We identified three stages of a chronosequence at each site as representative of the plant succession in response to pastoral land-use abandonment. Results As expected, both the plant and ant assemblages considerably differed across sites at the species level and, within each site, among the three stages. This trend was found also using ant traits, functional groups of ants, and plant functional groups. Ant and plant communities were related in terms of composition and functionality. Harvester ants and ants with collective foraging strategy were associated with annual legumes and grasses (Therophytes); ants with a strictly individual foraging strategy with Phanerophytes. Ant traits and plant functional groups indicated significant differences among the three stages of the chronosequence. However, ant functional groups could not discriminate between the stages represented by secondary grasslands currently grazed and shrub-encroached grasslands ungrazed. Conclusion Despite some limitations of ant functional groups in explaining the succession stages of land abandonment, our results suggest that ants are a good surrogate taxon and might be used as bioindicators of land-use changes and ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the functional group approach should be applied to other European ecosystems. Finally, reducing the taxonomic complexity could contribute to developing predictive models to detect early environmental changes and biodiversity loss in mountain habitats.

AB Janzen-Connell effects (JCEs), specialised predation of seeds and seedlings near conspecific trees, are hypothesised to maintain species richness. While previous studies show JCEs can maintain high richness relative to neutral communities, recent theoretical work indicates JCEs may weakly inhibit competitive exclusion when species exhibit interspecific fitness variation. However, recent models make somewhat restrictive assumptions about the functional form of specialised predation-that JCEs occur at a fixed rate when offspring are within a fixed distance of a conspecific tree. Using a theoretical model, I show that the functional form of JCEs largely impacts their ability to maintain coexistence. If predation pressure increases additively with adult tree density and decays exponentially with distance, JCEs maintain considerably higher species richness than predicted by recent models. Loosely parameterising the model with data from a Panamanian tree community, I elucidate the conditions under which JCEs are capable of maintaining high species richness.

AB Among tropical forests, lianas are predicted to have a growth advantage over trees during seasonal drought, with substantial implications for tree and forest dynamics. We tested the hypotheses that lianas maintain higher water status than trees during seasonal drought and that lianas maximize leaf cover to match high, dry-season light conditions, while trees are more limited by moisture availability during the dry season. We monitored the seasonal dynamics of predawn and midday leaf water potentials and leaf phenology for branches of 16 liana and 16 tree species in the canopies of two lowland tropical forests with contrasting rainfall regimes in Panama. In a wet, weakly seasonal forest, lianas maintained higher water balance than trees and maximized their leaf cover during dry-season conditions, when light availability was high, while trees experienced drought stress. In a drier, strongly seasonal forest, lianas and trees displayed similar dry season reductions in leaf cover following strong decreases in soil water availability. Greater soil moisture availability and a higher capacity to maintain water status allow lianas to maintain the turgor potentials that are critical for plant growth in a wet and weakly seasonal forest but not in a dry and strongly seasonal forest.

AB Litter decomposition plays a central role in carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. In drylands, which cover 40% of the Earth's land surface, photodegradation and biotic decomposition driven by non-rainfall moisture are important mechanisms of litter decay, though studies have only recently begun examining interactions between these two processes. We describe a novel priming mechanism in which photodegradation and biotic decay of the cuticle of plant litter increase litter absorption of non-rainfall moisture (fog, dew and water vapor), supporting greater microbial decomposition. We used several field experiments in a coastal fog desert and a series of in situ observations to demonstrate a relationship between solar radiation, cuticle integrity, water absorption rates and mass loss. Experimentally attenuating solar radiation for 36 months slowed mass loss, reduced cuticle degradation and decreased litter moisture uptake relative to litter under ambient sunlight controls. In a separate field experiment, removing the cuticle of recently senesced grass tillers increased mass loss fourfold over 6 months relative to controls. Tillers with degraded cuticles also absorbed 3.8 times more water following an overnight dew event than did those with intact cuticles. Finally, fungal growth was consistently greater on the sun-facing side of in situ tillers than on the shaded side, coincident with greater cuticle degradation. We present a conceptual model where the cuticle of plant litter acts as a water-resistant barrier that is first degraded by solar radiation and surficial microbes, increasing litter's ability to absorb enough water during non-rainfall moisture events to support substantial biotic decomposition inside the tissue. Considering how photodegradation and non-rainfall moisture are both substantial drivers of litter decomposition in drylands, understanding how they interact under realistic field conditions will help us better predict how these systems are responding to changing climate regimes.

AB The Amazon is under threat due to an unprecedented attack on environmental legislation. The municipality of Manicore, Brazil, is an example of how the weakening of laws affect the conservation of biodiversity in the region. Manicore is characterized as a scientifically understudied area, with high biodiversity potential and is likely to contain many species not yet described. Recently, 801 species of angiosperms were listed for this municipality, and during the collection expeditions it was possible to verify the effects of the weakening of environmental policies and laws. In this work, we show how a set of local actions can affect the balance of power and economic exploitation in a region in the Amazon. The examples we highlight here help to understand the entire current context of conservation in the Amazon, as we dissect the details of the political dynamics that weaken the biodiversity protection network and accelerate the exploitation of natural resources in the region.

AB Fire can change gallery forest vegetation structure, thereby altering nutrient fluxes between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In Brazilian savannas, which are fire-prone ecosystems, the fire regime is changing due to human activities such as converting native vegetation to farmland and urban areas. Uncontrolled wildfires in these savannas can reach gallery forests, which are more sensitive to fire impacts, leading to concerns about the effects of fire on gallery forest vegetation structure and freshwater ecosystems. We analysed the relationships between fire severity (the degree to which the fire has changed an area), percentage of burned area, variation in precipitation with gallery forest and savanna vegetation structure recovery and input of nutrients (NH4, NO2-, NO3- and PO43) to streams for 16 months after a fire event in five watersheds associated with small streams. One year after the fire, vegetation recovery (NDVI) was lower in gallery forest areas than in savanna woodlands, despite the more severe fires in savannas. The short-term effects of fire on gallery forest vegetation included increased nitrate concentrations in streams, which were also influenced by increased precipitation and the extent of the burned area. The nutrient inputs into the stream stabilized within 1 year. However, gallery forest vegetation did not fully recover at that time and may continue to alter the functioning of the aquatic ecosystem. Together, these results demonstrate the need for an integrated fire management plan that considers both gallery forests and the surrounding savannas in the landscape to address consequences to aquatic ecosystems.

AB The study of community spatial structure is central to understanding diversity patterns over space and species co-occurrence at local scales. Although most analytical approaches consider horizontal and vertical dimensions separately, in this study we introduce a three-dimensional spatial analysis that simultaneously includes horizontal and vertical species associations. Using tree census data (2000-2016) and allometries from the Luquillo forest plot in Puerto Rico, we show that spatial organization becomes less random over time as the forest recovered from land-use legacy effects and hurricane disturbance. Tree species vertical segregation is predominant in the forest with almost all species that co-occur in the horizontal plane avoiding each other in the vertical dimension. Horizontal segregation is less common than vertical, whereas three-dimensional aggregation (a proxy for direct tree competition) is the least frequent type of spatial association. Furthermore, dominant species are involved in more non-random spatial associations, implying that species co-occurrence is facilitated by species segregation in space. This novel three-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify and quantify tree species spatial distributions, how interspecific competition was reduced through forest structure, and how it changed over time after disturbance, in ways not detectable from two-dimensional analyses alone.

AB Phosphorus (P) is often one of the most limiting nutrients in highly weathered soils of humid tropical forests and may regulate the responses of carbon (C) feedback to climate warming. However, the response of P to warming at the ecosystem level in tropical forests is not well understood because previous studies have not comprehensively assessed changes in multiple P processes associated with warming. Here, we detected changes in the ecosystem P cycle in response to a 7-year continuous warming experiment by translocating model plant-soil ecosystems across a 600-m elevation gradient, equivalent to a temperature change of 2.1 degrees C. We found that warming increased plant P content (55.4%) and decreased foliar N:P. Increased plant P content was supplied by multiple processes, including enhanced plant P resorption (9.7%), soil P mineralization (15.5% decrease in moderately available organic P), and dissolution (6.8% decrease in iron-bound inorganic P), without changing litter P mineralization and leachate P. These findings suggest that warming sustained plant P demand by increasing the biological and geochemical controls of the plant-soil P-cycle, which has important implications for C fixation in P-deficient and highly productive tropical forests in future warmer climates.

AB Purpose Organic anions commonly released from plant roots and microorganisms are widely reported to mobilize soil phosphorus (P). We characterized soil organic P that was mobilized by organic anions and assessed its amenability to hydrolysis by phosphatase enzymes. Methods Six soils differing in organic P concentration were extracted with citrate, malate or oxalate solutions and incubated with preparations of phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, or phytase. Organic P compounds present in these extracts were putatively identified and quantified with solution P-31-NMR spectroscopy and the enzyme-labile P fractions were assessed by changes in molybdate-reactive P (MRP) concentration. Results Organic P mobilization varied markedly among the organic anions. Extraction with 10 mM citrate was most effective and extracted 7.8-fold more total P than the water controls across all soils. Approximately 95% of the extracted P was non-MRP. The organic anions increased both the amount of P extracted and the proportion of the total extracted P that was phosphatase-labile. Phytase was generally the most effective enzyme with up to 60% of the total non-MRP being amenable to hydrolysis by phytase across all extracts. The presence of inositol hexakisphosphates in the extracts, as well as other forms of organic P including nucleic acids and phospholipids, was verified by P-31-NMR with concentrations dependent on both organic anions and soil type. Conclusion The combination of organic anions and phosphatases represents a key mechanism by which plants and microorganisms can enhance the bioavailability of soil P. This has important implications for understanding P dynamics in natural and managed ecosystems and for ongoing efforts to improve the P-acquisition efficiency of agricultural plants.

FX This paper was prepared in specific tribute to Professor Hans Lambers as
   Editor in Chief for Plant and Soil. The data were compiled from historic
   data sets that were generated through a Grains Research and Development
   (GRDC) supported industry-based project awarded to CSIRO (CSP318) that
   was conducted 2001 to 2003. The experimental work was undertaken by Dr
   M. Hens as a post-doctoral scientist under the supervision and in the
   laboratory of the late Dr P. Hocking. We thank Dr Ben Turner for
   coordinating the NMR analyses and providing interpretation of the
   spectral data. The experimental work was conducted as part of the core
   effort of the CSIRO Plant Nutrition Group, who are represented as
   authors of the paper. The long-standing interaction of the Plant
   Nutrition Group with Professor Lambers and his laboratory at University
   of WA is greatly appreciated. In particular, the shared interests in the
   role of organic anions in mobilization of soil P, especially through the
   uniqueness of Australian native plants and in response to P deficiency
   that is very common across most Australian soils is acknowledged. In
   support of Prof Lambers, R. Simpson, P. Ryan, T. George and E. Delhaize
   have contributed to Plant and Soil as Section or Consulting Editors. In
   collaborative work with the Lambers Group, A. Richardson and R. Simpson
   have been adjunct Professors at UWA. Contribution of T George to this
   work was also supported by the Scottish Government. We thank Alex
   Blumenfeld (University of Idaho) for NMR technical support and also the
   many technicians at CSIRO that have supported the plant nutrition work
   conducted by the Group over many years.

AB Aim Macroinvertebrates comprise a highly diverse set of taxa with great potential as indicators of soil quality. Communities were sampled at 3,694 sites distributed world-wide. We aimed to analyse the patterns of abundance, composition and network characteristics and their relationships to latitude, mean annual temperature and rainfall, land cover, soil texture and agricultural practices. Location Sites are distributed in 41 countries, ranging from 55 degrees S to 57 degrees N latitude, from 0 to 4,000 m in elevation, with annual rainfall ranging from 500 to >3,000 mm and mean temperatures of 5-32 degrees C. Time period 1980-2018. Major taxa studied All soil macroinvertebrates: Haplotaxida; Coleoptera; Formicidae; Arachnida; Chilopoda; Diplopoda; Diptera; Isoptera; Isopoda; Homoptera; Hemiptera; Gastropoda; Blattaria; Orthoptera; Lepidoptera; Dermaptera; and "others". Methods Standard ISO 23611-5 sampling protocol was applied at all sites. Data treatment used a set of multivariate analyses, principal components analysis (PCA) on macrofauna data transformed by Hellinger's method, multiple correspondence analysis for environmental data (latitude, elevation, temperature and average annual rainfall, type of vegetation cover) transformed into discrete classes, coinertia analysis to compare these two data sets, and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap tests to evaluate the part of the variance of the macrofauna data attributable to each of the environmental factors. Network analysis was performed. Each pairwise association of taxonomic units was tested against a null model considering local and regional scales, in order to avoid spurious correlations. Results Communities were separated into five clusters reflecting their densities and taxonomic richness. They were significantly influenced by climatic conditions, soil texture and vegetation cover. Abundance and diversity, highest in tropical forests (1,895 +/- 234 individuals/m(2)) and savannahs (1,796 +/- 72 individuals/m(2)), progressively decreased in tropical cropping systems (tree-associated crops, 1,358 +/- 120 individuals/m(2); pastures, 1,178 +/- 154 individuals/m(2); and annual crops, 867 +/- 62 individuals/m(2)), temperate grasslands (529 +/- 60 individuals/m(2)), forests (232 +/- 20 individuals/m(2)) and annual crops (231 +/- 24 individuals/m(2)) and temperate dry forests and shrubs (195 +/- 11 individuals/m(2)). Agricultural management decreased overall abundance by <= 54% in tropical areas and 64% in temperate areas. Connectivity varied with taxa, with dominant positive connections in litter transformers and negative connections with ecosystem engineers and Arachnida. Connectivity and modularity were higher in communities with low abundance and taxonomic richness. Main conclusions Soil macroinvertebrate communities respond to climatic, soil and land-cover conditions. All taxa, except termites, are found everywhere, and communities from the five clusters cover a wide range of geographical and environmental conditions. Agricultural practices significantly decrease abundance, although the presence of tree components alleviates this effect.

AB Plant distribution patterns may indicate habitat specialization either by closely related species with conserved traits or by phylogenetically distant species with converging traits. Lianas represent a large proportion of the overall tropical species diversity and abundance. Despite their importance, little is known about the relationship between habitat specialization and the phylogenetic structure of lianas, especially at the landscape scale where forest disturbances and hydro-edaphic gradients are crucial. To explore this knowledge gap, we used one of the most diverse lineages of Neotropical lianas to test whether (i) landscape environmental gradients explain liana species diversity and composition, (ii) habitat specialization is phylogenetically conserved along ecological gradients, and (iii) closely related liana species have more similar distribution patterns. We hypothesized that hydro-edaphic and forest disturbance gradients determine the compartmentalization of a subset of closely related species in different portions of the ecological gradients. To test our hypothesis, we examined the distribution of the tribe Bignonieae on 34 1-ha permanent plots systematically distributed over a 42 km(2) forested landscape area in Central Amazon. We used proxies for the hydro-edaphic, forest disturbance, and soil nutrient gradients. Liana diversity increased along the hydro-edaphic gradient (i.e., toward dry plateaus), but slightly decreased along the forest disturbance gradient. Further, we found evidence of habitat specialization along the hydro-edaphic gradient on plateaus with deeper water tables, where liana assemblages are subsets of closely related species, exhibiting phylogenetic clustering. The opposite pattern was found on valleys, where liana assemblages were phylogenetically overdispersed. Our results support the role of phylogenetic niche conservatism on plateaus and a stronger environmental filter within the hydrologically dynamic valleys, associated with a functional convergence of more distantly related species. The selection of more distantly related species on hydrologically dynamic areas is a general pattern among trees, palms and now lianas. We conclude that ecological filters and phylogenetic history have played fundamental roles in structuring liana assemblages unevenly at the landscape scale. Fine-scale hydrology determines several aspects of plant community organization, whose mechanisms need to be experimentally investigated in the Amazon basin.

AB Community composition in a given landscape is a complex product of the constituent species' niche requirements, geographic connectivity, environmental properties, species interactions and drift. In this study, we examined niche use of 16 cladoceran species in 81 zooplankton communities that inhabit environmentally variable sites along a strong urbanization gradient. We tested to what extent niche shifts occurred along the urbanization gradient. We also quantified to what extent niche overlap can explain co-occurrence patterns and tested whether alternative processes such as dispersal limitation or environmental heterogeneity impact co-occurrence patterns. Niche use in the study region was size-mediated, with larger species preferring nutrient-rich environments while smaller species were more specialized on distinct niche axes. Our analyses also revealed that mainly generalist species were able to establish in urban sites. While the average niche position for most species was conserved from rural to urban sites, the niches of those species occurring in both rural and urban areas remain partly unfilled in the urban populations. We observed that a relatively small proportion (13%) of species pairs co-occurred more or less often than expected by chance, but also that niche overlap was the only predictor that was strongly and significantly associated with co-occurrence scores in our study. While most of these species pairs showed evidence for a role of environmental filtering, a few common, generalist species pairs displayed segregated co-occurrence patterns and high niche overlap, suggesting a role of limiting similarity relationships as well. Our study highlights the damaging effects on biodiversity of urbanization through biotic homogenization benefitting generalist species, as well as the difficulty species may face in occupying available niche space in urbanized habitats.

AB 1. In thermally extreme environments, it is challenging for organisms to maximize performance due to risks associated with stochastic variation in temperature and, subsequently, over evolutionary time minimizing the exposure to risk can serve as one of the mechanisms that result in organisms preferring suboptimal temperatures.
   2. We tested this hypothesis in a slow-moving intertidal snail on tropical rocky shores, where temperature variability increases with time from 30 min to 20 hr when recorded at 30 min intervals (due to short-term environmental autocorrelation where temperatures closer in time are more similar as compared to temperatures over a long period of time). Failure to accommodate temporal variation in thermal stress by selecting cool habitats can result in mortality.
   3. Thermal performance curves for different traits (heart rate and locomotion) were measured and compared to the snail's thermal preferences in both the field and laboratory. Predicted performances of the snails were simulated based on thermal performance curves for different traits over multiple time-scales and simulated carryover effects.
   4. A strong mismatch was found between physiological and behavioural thermal maxima of the snails (physiological thermal maximum being higher by similar to 7 degrees C), but the snails avoided these maxima and sought temperatures 7-14 degrees C cooler. Such a risk-averse strategy can be explained by their predicted performances where the snails should make decisions about preferred temperatures based on time periods >= 5 hr to avoid underestimating the temporal variation in body temperature.
   5. In extreme and stochastic environments, where the temporal variation in environmental conditions can lead to substantial divergence between instantaneous and time-averaged thermal performances, 'cooler is better' and 'suboptimal' body temperatures are preferred as they provide sufficient buffer to reduce mortality risk from heat stress.

AB Metabolic cooperation is widespread, and it seems to be a ubiquitous and easily evolvable interaction in the microbial domain. Mutual metabolic cooperation, like syntrophy, is thought to have a crucial role in stabilizing interactions and communities, for example biofilms. Furthermore, cooperation is expected to feed back positively to the community under higher-level selection. In certain cases, cooperation can lead to a transition in individuality, when freely reproducing, unrelated entities (genes, microbes, etc.) irreversibly integrate to form a new evolutionary unit. The textbook example is endosymbiosis, prevalent among eukaryotes but virtually lacking among prokaryotes. Concerning the ubiquity of syntrophic microbial communities, it is intriguing why evolution has not lead to more transitions in individuality in the microbial domain. We set out to distinguish syntrophy-specific aspects of major transitions, to investigate why a transition in individuality within a syntrophic pair or community is so rare. We review the field of metabolic communities to identify potential evolutionary trajectories that may lead to a transition. Community properties, like joint metabolic capacity, functional profile, guild composition, assembly and interaction patterns are important concepts that may not only persist stably but according to thought-provoking theories, may provide the heritable information at a higher level of selection. We explore these ideas, relating to concepts of multilevel selection and of informational replication, to assess their relevance in the debate whether microbial communities may inherit community-level information or not.

AB Threats to ecosystems are ever increasing from different drivers mostly being linked to anthropogenic activities. This has brought about various measures to restore/protect the wildlife in these areas. Considering the background of most protected areas in East Africa, small mammals have been given least attention, compared with large mammals, although they play a fundamental role in maintaining ecosystem health. It is therefore necessary to understand how small mammals are distributed in any given ecosystem as a baseline information to enable holistic and informed management. We investigated the diversity and distribution of small mammals in the Selous ecosystem, Tanzania. Two methods were used; Capture Mark Recapture (CMR) using grids of 70 m x 70 m and random placement of havahart traps in the selected habitats. Between July 2018 and June 2020, a total of 887 individuals belonging to 20 species were captured in 28 224 trap nights with 3% trap success. The small mammal species captured consisted of rodents (91.8%), Macroscelidea (3.9%), Carnivores (2.4%) Eulipotyphla (1.6%), and Primates (0.3%). Acomys ngurni (36%) and Aethomys chrysophilus (17%) were the most captured species, whereas Atilax paludinosus (0.23%), Helogale pervula (0.23%), Rattus rattus (0.23%) and Galerella sanguinea (0.11%) were the least contributing species. Acomys ngurui and Lemniscomys rosalia were the most distributed species occurring in all four habitats, whereas Cricetomys ansorgei, Rattus rattus, Mungos mungo and Genetta genetta had low occurrence. Grammomys selousi is reported for the first time in the northern part of the Rufiji River. Acomys ngurni abundance differed significantly (chi(2) = 12, df = 3, p = 0.007) between the four habitats being higher in the seasonal riverine forest and across seasons (chi(2) = 6, df = 2, p = 0.049), with more individuals occurring in the wet season. The Sable Forest habitat had the highest species diversity (H' = 2.065) and the lowest diversity (H' = 1.506) was recorded in perennial riverine forest/thickets. The highest species diversity (H' = 1.65) was recorded in the dry season and the lowest diversity in the wet season (H' = 1.445). Most small mammals were associated with seasonal riverine forest than other habitats. Overall, the results from this study show that, the park is rich in small mammal fauna. Therefore, considerations in updating the General Management Plan (GMP) and other plans to include the small mammals in the park management actions is recommended.

   ANALYSIS
AB Understanding interactions among biogeochemical cycles is increasingly important as anthropogenic alterations of global climate and of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles interactively affect the Earth system. Ecosystem processes in the dryland biome, which makes up over 40% of Earth's terrestrial surface, are often distinctively sensitive to small changes in resource availability, likely because levels of many resources are low. However, data also suggest that simultaneous changes in the availability of multiple resources may be necessary to affect a response in these low-resource systems, offering an opportunity to test patterns and controls of co-limitation, serial limitation, and individual limitation in soil environments. While drylands may play a governing role in key aspects of Earth's C cycle, and while an improved understanding of resource limitation could substantially improve our forecasts of dryland responses to change, our understanding of interacting controls on soil C cycle processes remains notably poor in these dry systems. Here, we address multiple fundamental hypotheses of resource controls over ecosystem function to test how water, C, N, and P regulate soil C cycling individually and interactively in a dryland ecosystem on the Colorado Plateau. Using a series of laboratory incubations, we found that, while water, C, and N limited C cycling through serial limitation, water alone resulted in an extremely small respiratory response from target organisms, whereas water + C resulted in a dramatic increase in soil C cycling, suggesting a degree of functional co-limitation. Nitrogen additions alone resulted in no changes to soil C cycling, but when N was added in concert with water and C, N greatly increased soil C cycling rates relative to additions of water and C without N. Phosphorus additions had no effect on the C cycle either alone or synergistically. These patterns were consistent with the stoichiometry of the system and interactions among resources were surprising in ways that inform our understanding of critical theories in ecology, such as the Transient Maxima Hypothesis, supporting the suggestion that multiple resource limitation explains pulse-dynamic C cycling in drylands better than water limitation alone.

AB Warming and drying from deforestation could amplify carbon storage losses in tropical remaining forests. Here the authors report this value to be extra 5.1% in the Amazon and 3.8% in Congo as compared to the direct biomass loss from deforestation.
   Biophysical effects from deforestation have the potential to amplify carbon losses but are often neglected in carbon accounting systems. Here we use both Earth system model simulations and satellite-derived estimates of aboveground biomass to assess losses of vegetation carbon caused by the influence of tropical deforestation on regional climate across different continents. In the Amazon, warming and drying arising from deforestation result in an additional 5.1 +/- 3.7% loss of aboveground biomass. Biophysical effects also amplify carbon losses in the Congo (3.8 +/- 2.5%) but do not lead to significant additional carbon losses in tropical Asia due to its high levels of annual mean precipitation. These findings indicate that tropical forests may be undervalued in carbon accounting systems that neglect climate feedbacks from surface biophysical changes and that the positive carbon-climate feedback from deforestation-driven climate change is higher than the feedback originating from fossil fuel emissions.

AB Ants consistently rank as the number one household pest, and many species are pests in agricultural and natural habitats. Despite economic and ecological impact of pest ants, effective management still faces many challenges and control failures with liquid spray insecticides are common. The odorous house ant (Tapinoma sessile Say) is an adaptive and widespread pest ant found in North America. This study examined regional variation in T. sessile insecticide susceptibility to three classes of insecticides commonly used in ant control. T. sessile showed significant regional variation in insecticide susceptibility on a relatively small geographic scale. A comparison of colonies collected in urban vs. natural areas showed no significant difference in susceptibility in tests with lambda-cyhalothrin and fipronil. In tests with dinotefuran, urban colonies were significantly more tolerant relative to natural colonies. These results suggest that habitat type and previous insecticide exposure do not reliably predict susceptibility levels in individual populations. Queens were significantly more tolerant relative to their worker counterparts across all insecticides. Higher insecticide tolerance in queens may explain why T. sessile is such a persistent pest in urban environments. The results provide a foundation for the development of more effective and efficient control methods for T. sessile and warrant further investigation of spatial and potentially temporal variability in insecticide susceptibility in ants.

AB Animals and plants trick others in an extraordinary diversity of ways to gain fitness benefits. Mimicry and deception can, for example, lure prey, reduce the costs of parental care or aid in pollination-in ways that impose fitness costs on the exploited party. The evolutionary maintenance of such asymmetric relationships often relies on these costs being mitigated through counter-adaptations, low encounter rates, or indirect fitness benefits. However, these mechanisms do not always explain the evolutionary persistence of some classic deceptive interactions. Sexually deceptive pollination (in which plants trick male pollinators into mating with their flowers) has evolved multiple times independently, mainly in the southern hemisphere and especially in Australasia and Central and South America. This trickery imposes considerable costs on the males: they miss out on mating opportunities, and in some cases, waste their limited sperm on the flower. These relationships appear stable, yet in some cases there is little evidence suggesting that their persistence relies on counter-adaptations, low encounter rates, or indirect fitness benefits. So, how might these relationships persist? Here, we introduce and explore an additional hypothesis from systems biology: that some species are robust to exploitation. Robustness arises from a species' innate traits and means they are robust against costs of exploitation. This allows species to persist where a population without those traits would not, making them ideal candidates for exploitation. We propose that this mechanism may help inform new research approaches and provide insight into how exploited species might persist.

AB Arid ecosystems cover similar to 40% of the Earth's terrestrial surface and store a high proportion of the global nitrogen (N) pool. They are low-productivity, low-biomass, and polyextreme ecosystems, i.e., with (hyper)arid and (hyper)oligotrophic conditions and high surface UV irradiation and evapotranspiration. These polyextreme conditions severely limit the presence of macrofauna and -flora and, particularly, the growth and productivity of plant species.
   Arid ecosystems cover similar to 40% of the Earth's terrestrial surface and store a high proportion of the global nitrogen (N) pool. They are low-productivity, low-biomass, and polyextreme ecosystems, i.e., with (hyper)arid and (hyper)oligotrophic conditions and high surface UV irradiation and evapotranspiration. These polyextreme conditions severely limit the presence of macrofauna and -flora and, particularly, the growth and productivity of plant species. Therefore, it is generally recognized that much of the primary production (including N-input processes) and nutrient biogeochemical cycling (particularly N cycling) in these ecosystems are microbially mediated. Consequently, we present a comprehensive survey of the current state of knowledge of biotic and abiotic N-cycling processes of edaphic (i.e., open soil, biological soil crust, or plant-associated rhizosphere and rhizosheath) and hypo/endolithic refuge niches from drylands in general, including hot, cold, and polar desert ecosystems. We particularly focused on the microbially mediated biological nitrogen fixation, N mineralization, assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and nitrification N-input processes and the denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) N-loss processes. We note that the application of modern meta-omics and related methods has generated comprehensive data sets on the abundance, diversity, and ecology of the different N-cycling microbial guilds. However, it is worth mentioning that microbial N-cycling data from important deserts (e.g., Sahara) and quantitative rate data on N transformation processes from various desert niches are lacking or sparse. Filling this knowledge gap is particularly important, as climate change models often lack data on microbial activity and environmental microbial N-cycling communities can be key actors of climate change by producing or consuming nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas.

AB Climate change is one of the primary agents of the global decline in insect abundance. Because of their narrow thermal ranges, tropical ectotherms are predicted to be most threatened by global warming, yet tests of this prediction are often confounded by other anthropogenic disturbances. We used a tropical forest soil warming experiment to directly test the effect of temperature increase on litter-dwelling ants. Two years of continuous warming led to a change in ant community between warming and control plots. Specifically, six ant genera were recorded only on warming plots, and one genus only on control plots. Wasmannia auropuctata, a species often invasive elsewhere but native to this forest, was more abundant in warmed plots. Ant recruitment at baits was best predicted by soil surface temperature and ant heat tolerance. These results suggest that heat tolerance is useful for predicting changes in daily foraging activity, which is directly tied to colony fitness. We show that a 2-year increase in temperature (of 2-4 degrees C) can have a profound effect on the most abundant insects, potentially favouring species with invasive traits and moderate heat tolerances.

TI Importance of the forest state in estimating biomass losses from

   DISTURBANCES; IMPACT; DEATH; FIRE; CONSEQUENCES
AB Disturbances, such as extreme weather events, fires, floods, and biotic agents, can have strong impacts on the dynamics and structures of tropical forests. In the future, the intensity of disturbances will likely further increase, which may have more serious consequences for tropical forests than those we have already observed. Thus, quantifying above-ground biomass loss of forest stands due to stem mortality (hereafter biomass loss rate) is important for the estimation of the role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle. So far, the long-term impacts of altered stem mortality on rates of biomass loss have not been adequately described.
   This study aims to analyse the consequences of long-term elevated stem mortality rates on forest dynamics and biomass loss rate. We applied an individual-based forest model and investigated the impacts of permanently increased stem mortality rates on the growth dynamics of humid, terra firme forests in French Guiana. Here, we focused on biomass, leaf area index (LAI), forest height, productivity, forest age, quadratic mean stem diameter, and biomass loss rate. Based on the simulation data, we developed a multiple linear regression model to estimate biomass loss rates of forests in different successional states from the various forest attributes.
   The findings of our simulation study indicated that increased stem mortality altered the succession patterns of forests in favour of fast-growing species, which increased the old-growth forests' gross primary production, though net primary production remained stable. The stem mortality rate had a strong influence on the functional species composition and tree size distribution, which led to lower values in LAI, biomass, and forest height at the ecosystem level. We observed a strong influence of a change in stem mortality on biomass loss rate. Assuming a doubling of stem mortality rate, the biomass loss rate increased from 3.2 % yr(-1) to 4.5 % yr(-1) at equilibrium. We also obtained a multidimensional relationship that allowed for the estimation of biomass loss rates from forest height and LAI. Via an example, we applied this relationship to remote sensing data on LAI and forest height to map biomass loss rates for French Guiana. We estimated a countrywide mean biomass loss rate of 3.0 % yr(-1).
   The approach described here provides a novel methodology for quantifying biomass loss rates, taking the successional state of tropical forests into account. Quantifying biomass loss rates may help to reduce uncertainties in the analysis of the global carbon cycle.

AB Ornithophily has been long speculated to occur in the subtribe Maxillariinae (Orchidaceae), relying either solely on micromorphological analyses or scarce field observations of undefined species. In Guatemala we were able to observe regular visits of the azure-crowned hummingbirds feeding on flowers of Ornithidium fulgens. These observations have led us to investigation of floral attractants by means of scanning and transmission microscopy, histochemical and chemical analyses (GC-MS). Conducted investigation revealed that the epidermis of basal protuberance of column-foot has features proving the secretory activity and that secreted nectar is sucrose-dominant. Slight secretion on the middle part of the lip is puzzling. The presence of other potential pollinators has not been reported. Based on the results of this study, we confirmed that the flowers of O. fulgens meet all criteria of ornithophily and thus that the hypothesis about bird pollination in the subtribe Maxillariinae is proven. The presented results confirm that the previously described floral features predicting the bird pollination in this group are justified. This strengthens the theory about floral adaptations to different pollinators and gives valid reasons to consider species with flowers with a certain set of traits as ornithophilous, even in the absence of the pollination observation.

AB Over the past decade public and private actors have been developing a variety of new policy approaches for addressing agriculturally-driven deforestation linked to international supply chains. While payments for environmental services (PES) have been advocated in many contexts as an efficient and pro-poor environmental policy to incentivize conservation, they have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism for leading to mixed and sometimes adverse environmental and social outcomes. It remains unclear whether such an approach is an improvement over existing approaches to govern sustainability in supply chains and especially as a mechanism for reducing ecosystem conversion. Here we conduct an ex-ante analysis to examine the potential outcomes of using a standalone PES scheme versus existing standalone market exclusion mechanisms (MEM) to govern commodity supply chains. The analysis develops a theoretical framework to examine the potential effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, and legitimacy of the two approaches and then applies this framework using qualitative analysis of secondary and interview data. Using this theory-driven evaluation approach we examine the case of the Brazilian Cerrado, where a PES mechanism is currently being proposed to achieve zero-deforestation targets in soy supply chains. We find that both standalone approaches suffer from different strengths and challenges and would be better used in combination. We conclude that a mixture of strict market exclusion with positive incentives and enabling programs that are targeted at the poorest farmers would be more effective, cost-effective, equitable, and legitimate. However, in the future such supply chain focused soy deforestation control efforts in the Cerrado must be complemented by broader jurisdictional approaches to addressing deforestation and sustainable development that include all land use actors, not just soy farmers. These more inclusive and balanced initiatives can help ensure that avoiding deforestation goes hand in hand with supporting sustainable livelihoods for a wider range of actors in the Cerrado.

AB In this study, we analyze the demographic rates and biomass dynamics of Lecythidaceae in a 100-ha permanent forest plot in the Central Amazon. We characterize habitats in the plot, analyze the effect of habitat on tree density, species richness, and biomass and demographic dynamics, and quantify significant species habitat associations. The plot experienced a 13.2 % net loss of Lecythidaceae individuals (n = 1023) but aboveground biomass (AGB; Mg ha(-1)) did not differ between the two censuses. Growth rates averaged 1.2 mm year(-1) with high intraspecific variation and differed significantly among species height classes. Stem density and species richness decreased in all six terra firme habitats and were significantly lower in both years in the flood disturbed habitat. Only the flood disturbed areas experienced a significant loss in AGB, along with the highest annual mortality, recruitment, and growth rates across the plot. The lower-lying habitats experienced higher mortality rates than the slopes and plateaus, suggesting too much moisture is a higher risk to Lecythidaceae individuals than drought in this plot. There were no overlapping habitat associations among sister species, or among the seven most abundant species, which suggests that terra firme habitat association provides a niche partitioning mechanism for closely related Lecythidaceae species. As intended with its establishment, this plot continues to provide integral baseline data for one of the most ecologically dominant and culturally significant tree families in the Amazon region.

   research in the Lecythidaceae plot. Scott Mori (1941-2020) cofounded the
   Lecythidaceae plot and encouraged us to study the ecology and evolution
   of the family. Paulo Ap ' ostolo Assuncao (1956-2020) started as a field
   botanist in the Km 41 plot and became one of the leading field
   taxonomists for Lecythidaceae in the Amazon basin. Maria Aparecida de
   Freitas (1963-2020) carried out phenological studies and herbarium
   collections in the plot, some of which we used in the present study.

AB Delimiting species is a challenge, especially in scenarios of diversification with gene flow and when species are now allopatric where reproductive isolation cannot be directly tested. Continental burrowing crayfishes of the genus Parastacus present a disjoint distribution in southern South America. One of the species is P. nicoleti, which lives in underground waters in swampy and wooded areas of southern Chile. A previous assessment based on mitochondrial DNA sequences suggest that the taxon may represent a species complex. Here, using thousands of nuclear genomic single-nucleotide polymorphisms obtained via RADSeq from 81 specimens collected at 27 localities throughout the distributional range of the species, we apply an integrative species delimitation approach to test species boundaries and to investigate some aspects of the speciation process. Our analyses corroborate previous results; a scenario that we favor suggests that the P. nicoleti encompasses seven distinct species. Additionally, demographic analyses show that the distinct species have followed distinct trajectories in size change during the last 17.5 million years and that speciation in this group occurred both in strict isolation as well as in the presence of gene flow.

AB Studies on seed rain can provide useful information on the spatial distribution, density, and richness of species. This study aimed to sample the seed rain in "capties" with the presence and absence of Copernicia prunifera (Carnatba), characterizing the seeds as for their dispersion syndrome and life forms, and explore the relationship between the monthly rainfall totals and the density and number of species in the seed rain and the seasonality in seed deposition. The research was conducted in 20 capoes, (10 with the presence and 10 with the absence of Copernicia prunifera). Three collectors of 0.50 m(2) were placed in each capao. A total of 1,666 diaspores (55.5 seeds/m(2)), belonging to 17 families and 32 species, were collected. There was a negative relationship between rainfall and the number of seeds (r = -0.73 and p<0.05) and between rainfall and number of species in the seed rain (r = -0.78 and p<0.01). There was an increase in the number of species in the seed rain with an increase in the number of seeds (r = 0.74 and p<0.001). Twelve zoochoric, 12 anemochoric, and 7 autochoric species were recorded, which accounted for 908, 502, and 256 seeds, respectively. Trees had 895 seeds collected, distributed in 12 species, followed by shrubs (574 seeds and 10 species), lianas (133 seeds and 7 species), and palms (61 seeds and 2 species). Anemochoric and zoochoric dispersion syndromes predominated in the dry period, with a predominance of zoochory in all months. There was a difference in the species composition in the seed rain between the capties with the presence and with the absence of Copernicia prunifera. The distance between the capoes did not influence the seed rain composition (Mantel r = -0.11 and p = 0.74). There was no relationship between areas of capoes and the number of seeds in the seed rain (R-2 = 0.013 and p = 0.95).

AB Aims We assessed biodiversity effects of disturbance in meadows and rich fens. We hypothesized that disturbances and their timing affect plant and bryophyte species richness and other indicators of conservation success. More specifically, we expected conservation status to improve with disturbances that mimic natural grazing processes, that is, that extensive year-round grazing with trampling had a more positive effect than intensive summer grazing or mowing. Location Kastbjerg wetlands, Jutland, Denmark. Methods In a three-year field experiment, we applied trampling, season-specific defoliation with biomass removal and burning in a randomized design in nine wetland sites. We recorded species richness and community composition. Bayesian generalized linear mixed-effects models were built with treatment as fixed effect, site as random effect and species richness or species composition as responses. Leaf N and P, and soil moisture were included as covariables. Further, a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) was applied to test for discrimination between treatments based on a set of biodiversity indicators. Results Environmental and biotic differences among sites were considerable and significant indicating a considerable effect of historical contingency (local species pool). We found only minor and mostly insignificant effects of disturbance on vegetation. However, a QDA revealed significant differences among treatments based on five indicators for conservation status. Simulated grazing and trampling were generally associated with higher vascular plant richness, bryophyte richness, number of indicator species and stress-tolerant species and decreasing abundance of competitive species. Conclusion We found small, but positive effects of disturbance on biodiversity indicators of wetland vegetation after three years of experimental treatments. Initial site differences explained most variation, indicating strong historical contingency. Our results support the need for restoration of disturbances in fens and meadows, and the importance of prioritizing areas with near-natural biotas.

AB Understory palms are subject to different ecological pressures than those experienced by canopy palms, but most studies do not distinguish between understory and canopy palms, or include only canopy palms. Much of the variation in the taxonomic composition of understory palms in the Amazon is concentrated in riparian zones. However, abiotic characteristics of the riparian zone that influence this variation are underexplored or have been modeled only through additive relationships. Our objectives were to determine (1) if the abundance of understory palms is related to the abundance of canopy palms, (2) how topographic and soil variables, and their interactions, affect variation in composition of understory-palm assemblages across the entire landscape, which includes riparian and non-riparian zones, and (3) how understory-palm assemblages vary in species composition along streams as a result of variation in abiotic factors and their interactions within the riparian zone. We sampled 40 riparian areas and analyzed the data in combination with existing data from 72 non-riparian plots. Plots (250 m x 4 m) were distributed across 64 km2 of a terra-firme forest (Reserva Ducke) covering two major drainage basins that differ in topography and soil characteristics. Abundances of understory and canopy palms have opposite relationships to the same environmental variables and, therefore, should not be treated as a single group. In addition, interactions among environmental factors at the mesoscale (entire landscape) and at the local scale (riparian zone), generate compositional turnover even among sites with only subtle environmental differences. Stream discharge and soil structure are among the first variables to be affected by human occupation of riparian zones, which indicates that a better understanding of interactions between environmental predictors and a landscape approach will be necessary to conserve Amazonian understory palms.

AB Soil respiration (Rs) plays an important role in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the impacts of plant community functional traits on Rs is a key prerequisite for accurate prediction of the future carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems under climate change. This study examined the relationship of Rs with plants in the Ebinur Lake Basin in the arid desert region. Traditional statistical methods and geostatistical methods were used to study the spatial variation characteristics of Rs and to analyze the effects of plant community functional traits and environmental factors on the spatial heterogeneity of Rs. The variation in Rs in the arid desert area of the Ebinur Lake Basin showed a strong spatial dependence (C-0/(C + C-0) = 0.11) and a medium variation (alpha = 25.50, CV = 86.21%). Principal component analysis revealed that morphological traits of plants and soil water content had great contributions to PC1, soil nutrient had great contributions to PC2, and physiological traits of plants and soil temperature had large contributions to PC3. Multiple regression analysis showed that PC1, PC2, and PC3 can explain 83% of the spatial heterogeneity of Rs (F = 157.41, p < 0.01). In conclusion, maximum height, leaf width, leaf dry matter content, leaf thickness, and soil water content were the principal driving elements of soil respiration heterogeneity.

AB Forest fragmentation is a widespread phenomenon that directly or indirectly affects the processes that take place both in forest ecosystems and in their immediate surroundings. So far, many studies confirm its negative effects, especially on biodiversity. On the other hand, there are few studies that address the effects of forest fragmentation on the amount of accumulated biomass or carbon, as well as on the characteristics of wood resources in managed forests. Therefore, issues related to timber production, which are important from the point of view of multifunctional forest management, are omitted. The aim of our research was to add to the knowledge in this area. In particular, we focused on assessing the impact of forest fragmentation on wood resources based on an analysis of edge effects in forest patches (units formed by combining forest fragments characterized by structural connectivity). Vector data describing the topography of forest fragments in Poland and the results of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) from 2015-2019 were used as material for solving this problem. The results of our research showed that the effects of fragmentation on managed pine stands depend on the age of the stand and the fertility of the habitat. In young stands growing on barren or strongly barren habitats, growing stock volume turned out to be significantly higher in the edge zone. In older stands, especially on moderately fertile habitats, significantly higher resources were found in the interior zone of forest patches. Habitat quality also had a significant effect on the amount of carbon accumulated. In strongly barren habitats, higher carbon mass was found in edge zones, while in moderately fertile habitats, stands had higher carbon volume in the interior zone. Our results illustrate that forest fragmentation is a very complex process that can increase or reduce wood resources, depending on the age of the stand and the quality of the habitat. From the standpoint of measurable benefits, it was concluded that protection from the negative effects of fragmentation should focus primarily on older stands and more fertile habitats.

AB Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy has recently emerged as the technique of choice for obtaining high quality three-dimensional (3D) images of whole organisms, with low photo-damage and fast acquisition rates. Unlike conventional optical and confocal microscopy or scanning electron microscopy systems, it offers the possibility of obtaining multiple views of the sample by rotating it. We show that the use of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, for the analysis of invertebrates, provides a fair compromise compared to scanning electron microscopy in terms of resolution, but avoids some of its drawbacks, such as sample preparation or limited three-dimensional perspectives. In this paper, we will show how LSFM techniques can provide a cheap, high quality, multicolor, 3D alternative to classic microscopes, for the study of the morphological structure of insects and invertebrates in morphogenesis studies of the whole animal.

AB Biodiversity patterns along elevational gradients are generally characterised by monotonic decreases or mid-elevational peaks in species richness, while elevational zones may be characterised by distinct assemblages, or higher zones may be subsets of lowland assemblages. Elevational gradients in diversity have been less studied in the Afrotropical region. This study documents ant diversity patterns in three forest types associated with the tropical mountains of Udzungwa; we hypothesise that: (1) ant diversity and activity will show a monotonic decrease from mid-elevation with increasing elevation and (2) that forests associated with different elevations will have a distinct ant assemblage. Pitfall traps were deployed at three targeted elevations (650-800, 800-1400, and 1400-1500 m a.s.l.). Ant species richness declined with increasing elevation from 650 m a.s.l. and formed three elevational assemblages with lower elevation forests having almost twice as many species as sub-montane forests and three times as many as that of the montane forests. In contrast, overall ant activity peaked at 800-1400 m a.s.l. The ant assemblages associated with the lower elevation forest were very distinct, while assemblages associated with the sub-montane and montane forests shared species. Our study reveals valuable and relevant information for biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning as the species associated with each forest type may be used as indicator species for assessing biodiversity responses to climate change and anthropogenic activities on these mountains.

AB Neotropical forested landscapes have become agricultural areas and human settlements, causing forest fragmentation, land degradation, and habitat loss. Nonetheless, complex tree cover loss and recovery processes may occur even while urban areas expand. Biophysical, social, political, and economic drivers influence forest loss or recovery over time. This study analyzes land-use change dynamics in urban and peri-urban landscapes in the western sector of Xalapa City between 1966-2018 and identifies the primary drivers that have played a significant role in deforestation and forest recovery processes. The main finding denotes the city's expansion between 1966 and 2018, initially covering 8% of the study area and increasing to 27%. However, between 1966 and 2018, 15% of forest cover was lost in net terms, a finding ascribed to forest recovery in some abandoned areas. Social and biophysical variables significantly influenced deforestation and forest recovery trends, and few variables were singular to one process. The deceleration of forest loss and accomplishing tree cover recovery are possible in some urban settings. In this context, green urban and peri-urban landscapes become strategic to achieve more sustainable cities. Among other benefits, green areas provide landscape connectivity, temperature regulation, air quality improvement, noise dampening, and recreational areas.

AB Most grazing lands in Mediterranean ecosystems that support extensive sheep farming systems are characterized by unfavorable edapho-climatic conditions, especially in semi-arid areas. Often, though, their use is far from sustainable, causing erosion and ecosystem degradation impacts. In this paper, we explore the use, productivity, and flora diversity of typical Mediterranean grazing lands in four farms at the Agra locality in the western part of Lesvos Island, Greece. For a period of two consecutive growing seasons (September to June), we recorded herbage biomass on 16 plots of grazing lands with three measurements per season of land cover and plant productivity (biomass) inside small exclosures (cages) protected from grazing. We recorded the species richness of herbaceous plant communities within and outside the cages at the end of every growing season, the period of maximum growth of herbaceous species. We also chemically analyzed the biomass for crude protein at the end of each season. Results show sizable productivity differences among pasture plots as well as seasons and an overall medium to high degree of productivity and species richness considering the relatively intensive grazing, with little differences over the different cages and the degree of grazing intensity. These results suggest that the "history" of the fields is important, as grazing lands that had been used for arable crops in the past, as well as those leveled and in favorable locations, were the most productive and diverse ones, while shallower soils and inclined grazing lands showed signs of overuse and degradation. Overall, though, these ecosystems showed a high degree of resilience despite their intensive use.

AB The rice-crayfish farming model has been rapidly developed and become an economically viable method to supply food in China in recent years. However, its environmental and economic sustainability has not been thoroughly investigated. This study uses a survey in 2016 and a field experiment in 2017 in Qianjiang, Hubei Province, China to assess the relative economics of concurrent rice-wheat (RW), rice-crayfish (RC), and crayfish monoculture (CM) models in waterlogged land areas. The field survey indicated that the RC model had a higher benefit-cost ratio (3.5:1) than the RW (2.0:1) and CM (3.1:1) models and the RC model protected farmers' enthusiasm for grain production facing unfavourable weather conditions. The field experiment aimed to explore nitrogen management strategies in RC fields. In the experiment, four levels of nitrogen concentration gradient -0 kg N ha(-1)(0 N), 75 kg N ha(-1)(75 N), 150 kg N ha(-1)(150 N) and 225 kg N ha(-1) (225 N), were set in a 2-year-old rice-crayfish (RC2) field, an 8-year-old rice-crayfish (RC8) field, and a RW field as a control. The field experiment results suggested that the peak rice yield in RW, RC2, and RC8 occurred when 225 N, 150 N and 75 N were used, respectively. In RC2 and RC8, however, residual feed-nitrogen that was not used by crayfish was utilized by rice plants. Thus, an optimal amount of nitrogen in RC fields was proposed to improve the nitrogen use efficiency and reduce environmental pollution by nitrogen fertilizer. Farmers use less nitrogen but have higher net income in RC than in RW and CM. It is necessary to sustainably develop integrated farming technologies (i.e., proper field configurations for rice fields) to effectively sustain rice production. The results also showed that the RC farming model was a viable diversification option for rice farmers in waterlogged land.

AB Southern Amazonia harbors a wide diversity of aquatic macrophyte species because of its diverse wetland habitats and location in the Amazon-Cerrado transition zone, which spans the two largest biogeographic domains in South America. We investigated the taxonomic diversity of aquatic macrophytes in the region with a focus on endemism, species richness, and life forms. We present new records of aquatic macrophyte species and compare our results with other Brazilian phytogeographic domains. We found a high number of species of aquatic macrophytes for the southern Amazon region, comparable to extensive inventories in southern, northeastern, and northern regions of Brazil. We recorded 709 species of aquatic macrophytes in 313 genera and 97 families, which includes 90 species endemic to Brazil and five species endemic to the Brazilian Amazonia. The macrophyte species list of southern Amazonia showed < 25% similarity to inventories in Amazonia and Cerrado. This high diversity of aquatic macrophytes in southern Amazonia, with endemic species and others with restricted ranges, emphasizes the need for conserving these wetlands and vegetation types.

AB Global changes arouse large-scale fragmentation of forests, which has a profound impact on the balance of the global carbon cycle. However, the effect and process of temperate forest fragmentation on photosynthetic carbon uptake are not clear. We used remote sensing datasets to describe the degree of forest fragmentation and clarify the relationship between fragmentation and photosynthetic carbon uptake in the temperate forests of northeastern China. The results show that forest fragmentation has high spatial heterogeneity and promotes photosynthetic carbon uptake by 14% in the cold temperate zone and 10% in the middle temperate zone. Hydrothermal conditions are the dominant influencing path, explaining 60% of the variation in the cold temperate zone and 49% of the variation in the middle temperate zone. In addition, temperature is the dominant driver of the cold temperate zone, and water is the dominant driver of the middle temperate zone. Our research calls for a deeper understanding of the carbon cycle of fragmented temperate forests, and it is necessary to consider appropriate human intervention in forest management.

AB A new focus on biofiltration has emerged that aims to shape microbial communities to improve treatment ef-ficacy. It is therefore necessary to understand the linkages between microbial community structure and biofilter function. However, the assembly and interaction of microbial communities in biological activated carbon (BAC) filters are unknown. In this study, we selected one coal-based granular activated carbon (GAC), GAC-13, with simultaneously developed micropore and micro-level macropore volume used for a bench-scale BAC column experiment, and compared it with other coal-based GACs and wood-based GAC in terms of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal and microbial community characteristics. The results showed that there was no difference between the DOC removal efficiency of BAC-13 and the other two coal-based BAC filters with high iodine value in the period dominated by adsorption, while the DOC removal efficiency of BAC-13 (64.7 +/- 0.6%) was signifi-cantly higher than that of other BAC filters (36.3 +/- 0.8-54.1 +/- 0.4%) with a difference of 0.3-0.7 mg/L in DOC during the steady state. The bacterial communities were strongly assembled by deterministic rather than sto-chastic factors, where the surface polarity of GAC had a greater effect on the microbial communities than its physical properties. The corresponding co-occurrence network revealed that microbes in the BAC filter may be more cooperative than competitive. The keystone bacterium Hyphomicrobium, which had a relatively low abundance, contributed 0.3-1% more to the most abundant functions and produced 5-21 proteins/(g.GAC) more than the dominant bacterium Sphingobium. The metaproteomic-based approach could provide more accurate information regarding the contributions of different species to metabolic functions. The pore size distribution of GAC was found to be an important factor in determining BAC filter performance; the most important pore sizes were micropores and micro-level macropores (0.2-10 mu m and >100 mu m in diameter), and the latter impacted the abundance of keystone species. Overall, our findings provide new insights into shaping microbial communities by optimizing pore size structure to improve BAC performance, especially the abundance of keystone species.

AB Hummingbird flower mites are assumed to monopolize single host plant species owing to sexual selection for unique mating rendezvous sites. We tested the main assumption of the mating rendezvous hypothesis-extreme host specialization-by reconstructing interactions among tropical hummingbird flower mites and their host plants using DNA barcoding and taxonomic identifications. We collected 10,654 mites from 489 flowers. We extracted DNA from 1,928 mite specimens and amplified the cytochrome c oxidase I (CO1) DNA barcode. We analyzed the network structure to assess the degree of generalization or specialization of mites to their host plants. We recorded 18 species of hummingbird flower mites from three genera (Proctolaelaps, Rhinoseius, and Tropicoseius) interacting with 14 species of plants. We found that generalist mites are common, and congeneric mite species often share host plants. Our results challenge the assumption of strict specialization that supports this system as an example of mating rendezvous evolution.

AB Plant species have different traits for mobilizing sparingly soluble phosphorus (P) resources, which could potentially lead to overyielding in P uptake by plant species mixtures compared to monocultures due to higher P uptake as a result of resource (P) partitioning and facilitation. However, there is circumstantial evidence at best for overyielding as a result of these mechanisms. Overyielding (the outcome) is easily confused with underlying mechanisms because of unclear definitions. We aimed to define a conceptual framework to separate outcome from underlying mechanisms and test it for facilitation and complementarity with respect to P acquisition by three plant species combinations grown on four soils. Our conceptual framework describes both mechanisms of complementarity and facilitation and outcomes (overyielding of mixtures or no overyielding) depending on the competitive ability of the species to uptake the mobilized P. Millet/chickpea mixtures were grown in pots on two calcareous soils mixed with calcium-bound P (CaP) and phytate P (PhyP). Cabbage/faba bean mixtures were grown on both acid and neutral soils mixed with P-coated iron (hydr)oxide (FeP) and PhyP. Wheat/maize mixtures were grown on all four soils. Rhizosphere carboxylate concentration and acid phosphatase activity (mechanisms) as well as plant P uptake and biomass (outcome) were determined for monocultures rhizosphere and species mixtures. Facilitation of P uptake occurred in millet/chickpea mixtures on one calcareous soil. We found no indications for P acquisition from different P sources, neither in millet/chickpea, nor in cabbage/faba bean mixtures. Cabbage and faba bean on the neutral soil differed in rhizosphere acid phosphatase activity and carboxylate concentration, but showed no overyielding. Wheat and maize, with similar root exudates, showed overyielding (the observed P uptake being 22% higher than the expected P uptake) on one calcareous soil. We concluded that although differences in plant physiological traits (root exudates) provide necessary conditions for complementarity and facilitation with respect to P uptake from different P sources, they do not necessarily result in increased P uptake by species mixtures, because of the relative competitive ability of the mixed species.

AB Agricultural expansion is among the main threats to biodiversity and functions of tropical ecosystems. It has been shown that conversion of rainforest into plantations erodes biodiversity, but further consequences for food-web structure and energetics of belowground communities remains little explored. We used a unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal groups studied, most of the taxa had lower litter-calibrated & UDelta;C-13 values in plantations than in rainforests, suggesting that they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' energy channeling) in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy channeling) in rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density, and species richness in plantations, providing guidelines on how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of energy through soil food webs. Our results highlight the strong restructuring of soil food webs with the conversion of rainforest into plantations threatening soil functioning and ecosystem stability in the long term.

AB Studying the basic biology of heavily fished marine species is essential to achieving conservation and sustainable exploitation. Yellow squat lobster (Cervimunida johni) is a demersal crustacean with a long fishing history in the Southeast Pacific. However, knowledge of its reproductive biology is still fragmented, and these traits have never been validated at the gonad level. In this context, we assessed the reproductive traits of this species for the first time based on gonadal development using data from a research survey conducted during 2018 off the Chilean coast. A total of 117 and 376 gonads were assessed based on histological and macroscopic analyses, respectively. The functional and effective criteria (a combination of functional and physiological maturity) were used to estimate the maturity ogives. Using a total of 113 females, fecundity (F) and relative fecundity (RF) at length were estimated using the autodiametric method. We determined that females of yellow squat lobster possess group-synchronous ovary development with indeterminate fecundity. Histological analysis revealed that 59% of non-ovigerous females had mature ovaries and were therefore misclassified as immature based on the functional criterion. Similarly, maturity ogives derived from the effective criterion were displaced to smaller sizes and varied significantly from those estimated using the functional criterion (P < 0.05). In addition, the effects of female size on F and RF were significant (P < 0.05). A warning on the use of functional criteria for assessing maturity status is issued, and the importance of adult females on the per capita contribution to population renewal in this crustacean species is discussed .

AB The leading causes of the worldwide decline in biodiversity are global warming, allied with natural habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we propose an analysis of the synergistic effects of these two factors in 63 species of Amazonian lizards. We predicted that the high-climatic suitability areas of species would be significantly impacted by different deforestation scenarios and the resultant landscape structure and considered that forest-dwelling species would be especially susceptible to deforestation scenarios. We also pointed out species threatened by both drivers and suggested critical areas for their future conservation. According to our results, most species will face future reductions in suitable areas for their occurrence according to five different patterns, two of which represent significant risks for 15 species. Some of these species already deal with severe habitat loss and fragmentation of their current distribution ranges, whereas others will suffer a considerable area reduction related to future range shifts. We emphasize the importance of protected areas (PAs), especially indigenous lands, and the need to plan combined strategies involving PAs' maintenance and possible implementation of ecological corridors. Finally, we highlight eight species of thermoconformer lizards that constitute present and future conservation concerns related to the combined effects of climate change and habitat loss and that should be carefully evaluated in extinction risk assessments.

AB Seed dispersal is critical to the ecological performance of sexually reproducing plant species and the communities that they form. The Mammalian order Carnivora provide valuable and effective seed dispersal services but tend to be overlooked in much of the seed dispersal literature. Here we review the literature on the role of Carnivorans in seed dispersal, with a literature search in the Scopus reference database. Overall, we found that Carnivorans are prolific seed dispersers. Carnivorans' diverse and plastic diets allow them to consume large volumes of over a hundred families of fruit and disperse large quantities of seeds across landscapes. Gut passage by these taxa generally has a neutral effect on seed viability. While the overall effect of Carnivorans on seed dispersal quality is complex, Carnivorans likely increase long-distance dispersal services that may aid the ability of some plant species to persist in the face of climate change.

AB The cloud forest shows a great diversity of groups and has been considered as centers of high richness and endemism, throughout Asia, Africa and mainly in the Americas. To determine the specific and phylogenetic richness as well as the association in the composition of species of amphibians and reptiles in this environment in Mexico, using databases we analyzed species richness, taxonomic distinctiveness and phylogenetic species variability and richness of amphibians and reptiles in 13 regions containing cloud forest in Mexico, and the similarity among the regions. The results show high species richness of both groups (231 amphibians and 310 reptiles) respect another environment in Mexico, mainly in the southern of Mexico in Northern Mountains of Oaxaca, Coastal Sierra Madre del Sur and Sierra Madre of Chiapas. Regarding taxonomic distinctiveness in amphibians, the Basins of Ocosingo, High Huasteca of Hidalgo and Central Veracruz regions presented representatives values from regional diversity, while in reptiles these values were from regions Basins of Ocosingo, Central Veracruz and Northern Mountains of Oaxaca. The regions Northern Mountains of Oaxaca, Coastal Sierra Madre del Sur and Sierra Madre of Chiapas showed the highest values of phylogenetic species richness. In amphibians, the regions Upper Balsas Basin and Eastern Sierra Madre showed the highest values of phylogenetic species variability, and in reptiles was for regions Northern Mountains and Central Highlands of Chiapas, Eastern Sierra Madre, High Huasteca of Hidalgo and Central Veracruz. In both groups, the similarity analysis showed a high relationship between the southeastern regions of Mexico than the rest of regions. The analyzed cloud forest regions present different values of species richness and taxonomic distinctiveness, highlighting the regions of southern of Mexico. These results help us to propose areas for conservation of both groups, and so, to conserve the species richness, taxonomy and phylogenetic diversity in this environment, providing key elements for conservation planners.

AB Hunter decision-making influences prey selection and is key to understanding the impacts of hunting on biodiversity. Optimal foraging theory (OFT) is often used to describe the decision-making and prey selection of subsistence hunters. We examined the behavior and game meat use of hunters in an indigenous Amazonian community and used free listing and generalized linear mixed-effects models under the framework of OFT to assess the decision-making of individuals who hunt for economic gain and subsistence. We found that prey selection generally followed OFT, and was influenced by hunters' skills, patch choice, and characteristics of the prey encountered. Hunters preferred paca (Cuniculus paca), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), and brocket deer (Mazama americana), and only partially preferred tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and large-bodied primates likely due to economic influences such as access to markets and prices, contrary to OFT predictions.

AB In this study, we compared the richness of ground-dwelling ants among three different sugarcane management systems (with the application of the insecticide fipronil and the addition of vinasse; with fipronil and no vinasse; and with vinasse and no fipronil, i.e., an organic production system) to evaluate whether the feeding/foraging types vary according to the management system. We tested the hypothesis that organic management increases species diversity because there is no use of chemical inputs. Estimated species richness was significantly higher in the organic management system than in the systems that used fipronil with vinasse. Generalists species were prevalent in all sugarcane fields, regardless of the production system, whereas predatory and fungivorous species were infrequent. However, the organically managed field had many predatory species. Our results suggest that fipronil with vinasse in sugarcane cultivation alters the ant community, possibly disrupting the functions performed by the edaphic fauna, such as control of arthropod crop pests, due to reduced predator species richness.

AB Despite the ecological importance of fungi, we still know little about their diversity in Canada. One of the largest hurdles to implementing fungal conservation initiatives is the lack of fungal distribution data. As anthropogenic impacts accelerate the speed of environmental change, it is imperative that we fill this major information gap, critical for fungal protection. To gain insight on the conservation status of Canadian macrofungi, we took advantage of the large and growing body of fungal biodiversity data from government research (Wild Species 2020), citizen science, trained independent mycologists, university, and museum biodiversity research. The majority of macrofungi are data deficient; we do not know their geographic distribution or habitat requirements, occurrence, or abundance in Canada. For mushrooms that fruit only a few days of the year and are often difficult to positively identify, there is a lot of work to overcome the uncertainty of distinguishing under-sampling from rarity. Our work stresses the importance of building a strong network of professional and amateur mycologists to develop resources, disseminate information to make educated decisions, and advance conservation actions. We found that several fungi can be prioritized; we present a short list for consideration for formal conservation assessment.

AB Growing concern over rapid species declines and extinctions has led to considerable interest in the role of biodiversity for maintaining ecological processes. However, the loss of particular species has more pronounced effects on ecosystem services than others, highlighting the importance of key functional species traits and their relationships to ecosystem functioning. Human-induced disturbances, such as species invasions, land use changes, or abiotic changes, appear to disproportionally impact larger species rather than smaller ones. The loss of large-bodied species in the community diminishes key ecosystem services like seed dispersal, pest control, pollination and decomposition. Here, we use carrion, a nutrient-rich ephemeral resource, to test the hypotheses that ants positively affect decomposition rates and that their role in the necrophilous community-as predator or decomposer-is mediated by body size. We further investigate the relative contribution of maggots versus ants to biomass decomposition. Our results show that ants contributed positively to the decomposition process. Moreover, decomposition was shaped by an intricate interplay between competition and predation among the guild of decomposer insects. As predicted, larger ants show a double action in increasing decomposition rate and predating on maggots, while small ants are rather inefficient decomposers and did not act as predators on other decomposer species. Our study shows that differentiating key taxonomic groups in function of their body size is key to untangle the diversity and directions of the various roles they play within complex ecological processes.

AB Aim Plant functional traits are broadly used to quantify and predict impacts of climate change on vegetation. However, high intraspecific trait variation can bias mean values when few measurements are available. Here, we determine the extent of individual leaf trait variation and covariation across a highly heterogeneous environmental gradient for a widely distributed subtropical pine. We demonstrate the implications of trait variation for characterising species by assessing data availability and variability across the Pinus genus. Location Central Mountain Range, Taiwan. Taxon Pinus taiwanensis Hayata (Pinaceae). Methods We measured eight functional traits suggested to reflect plant strategies: needle length, area, thickness, dry and fresh mass, stomatal row density (SD), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA). We examined trait variation in response to climatic and physiographic factors across an elevational gradient of 495-3106 m a.s.l. using linear mixed effects models (LMMs). Intraspecific trait covariation was explored using principal component analyses (PCAs) and LMMs. Descriptive statistics were calculated for Pinus records in the global TRY plant trait database. Results Intraspecific variability among traits was high (CV 20%-44%) and predictable with elevation (generally p < 0.05, with declining needle size and LDMC with elevation and increasing SD). However, 41%-92% of variance was un-explained by topography. Sixty-five percent of variation was explained by two trait covariation axes, with predictable changes with elevation (p < 0.001). Pinus data availability in TRY was low. Across traits, only 12.5%-53% of species had sufficient sample sizes for intraspecific analyses. Main conclusions We show substantial trait variation for a single species, here likely driven by temperature differences and additional biotic and abiotic drivers across the elevational range. Improved understanding of the extent and implications of intraspecific variability is necessary for reliable quantifications and predictions of the impacts of environmental change, especially in understudied, hyper-diverse ecosystems such as tropical forests.

AB The Pantanal is the largest wetland in the world and a World Heritage Site. During 2019-2020, the Pantanal has experienced the most severe burning in its history, with vast destroyed areas of vegetation and killed wildlife. Since the long-term damage caused by fire to the Pantanal is still unknown, understanding how the biodiversity responds to post-fire disturbance over a short-term is an important step for conservation initiatives. The authors studied the effects of fire on dung beetle communities, a recognised bioindicator group, in the Brazilian Pantanal. For this, the authors assessed the patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity between unburned and burned sites (16 months post-fire). The authors found that taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles were similar between unburned and burned grasslands, but with a distinct taxonomic composition post-fire. The functional traits composition was similar between unburned and burned sites, demonstrating that this metric is less sensitive to fire effects in the Brazilian Pantanal. The study's results provide evidence that dung beetles exhibit high resistance to the occurrence of fire and fast recovery from its consequences. Thus, due to its ecological functions (secondary seed dispersion, nutrient cycling and others), these insects may assist ecological restoration of burned sites, being useful tools in restoration approaches for areas of the Pantanal that have been affected by fire. Finally, combining traditional taxonomic community attributes with functional diversity measurements provides a more comprehensive picture of responses of dung beetle communities, post-fire, over a short-term in the Brazilian Pantanal.

AB Introduction The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) is undergoing alarming deforestation, land overexploitation, and unregulated occupation. The Coastal Sandy Vegetation of BAF, known as Restinga, is under the most pressure of the BAF ecosystems. Understanding the effects of Restinga deforestation on biodiversity is a conservation priority. Aims/Methods We predicted the effect of landscape modifications on the large-scale spatial distribution of an endangered dung beetle (Dichotomius schiffleri) endemic to the BAF Restinga ecosystem. We tested the hypothesis that almost all the potential distribution area of this species has suffered from landscape modification, and reduced its spatial distribution. We used niche-based modeling approaches to predict the potential species distribution (climate-based models) and the species distribution under the current land-use scenario (landscape-based models). We then combined these models to predict the effects of landscape modification. Results The spatial distribution of D. schiffleri has decreased drastically as a consequence of landscape modification. The decreasing patch size, canopy cover percentage, and functional connectivity, and the increasing edge distance explain the decrease in the potential species distribution as predicted by climate variables. Discussion Suitable sites for this species are isolated in a vast matrix of pasture, tree plantations, and urban areas. D. schiffleri is sensitive to anthropogenic changes such as disturbances of preserved Restinga areas. Therefore, human coastal-plain land uses over the past five centuries pose multiple synergistic threats to the persistence of this species. Implications for insect conservation Our findings suggest an alarming trend toward species extinction in the near future, highlighting the need for specific conservation actions to protect Restinga biodiversity.

AB Pre-dispersal seed mortality caused by premature fruit drop is a potentially important source of plant mortality, but one which has rarely been studied in the context of tropical forest plants. Of particular interest is premature fruit drop triggered by enemies, which-if density dependent-could contribute to species coexistence in tropical forest plant communities. We used a long-term (31 year) dataset on seed and fruit fall obtained through weekly collections from a network of seed traps in a lowland tropical forest (Barro Colorado Island, Panama) to estimate the proportion of seeds prematurely abscised for 201 woody plant species. To determine whether enemy attack might contribute to premature fruit drop, we tested whether plant species abscise more of their fruit prematurely if they (a) have attributes hypothesised to be associated with high levels of enemy attack and (b) are known to be attacked by one enemy group (insect seed predators). We also tested (c) whether mean rates of premature fruit drop for plant species are phylogenetically conserved. Overall rates of premature fruit drop were high in the plant community. Across all species, 39% of seeds were abscised before completing their development. Rates of premature seed abscission varied considerably among species and could not be explained by phylogeny. Premature seed abscission rates were higher in species which are known to host pre-dispersal insect seed predators and species with attributes that were hypothesised to make them more susceptible to attack by pre-dispersal enemies, namely species which (a) have larger seeds, (b) have a greater average height, (c) have temporally predictable fruiting patterns and (d) are more abundant at the study site. Synthesis. Premature fruit drop is likely to be a major source of seed mortality for many plant species on Barro Colorado Island. It is plausible that pre-dispersal seed enemies, such as insect seed predators, contribute to community-level patterns of premature fruit drop and have the potential to mediate species coexistence through stabilising negative density dependence. Our study suggests that the role of pre-dispersal enemies in structuring tropical plant communities should be considered alongside the more commonly studied post-dispersal seed and seedling enemies.

AB Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important pollinators of wild and cultivated plants. Evidence suggests their populations are declining globally, threatening the availability of the free pollination services they provide. Conservation of bumble bees in the US is limited due to a paucity of research on the natural history of most species. The purpose of this exploratory study was to establish baseline data about the Bombus species present in agricultural landscapes in central Georgia, their phenologies and the plants with which they interact. Bombus were captured and identified to species and caste during 10-minute surveys at three sites in 2010 and two sites in 2011. Average weekly captures differed between years, and some phenologies varied from those in published literature. Results suggest that Bombus range maps might need to be updated and that high temperatures might negatively impact foraging. Bumble bees were captured on a variety of plant genera, but were not always carrying pollen, suggesting that some pollens could be more desirable than others. This study is the first record in the peer-reviewed literature of overall B. bimaculatus phenology in the USA. Long-term Bombus research across the United States is urgently needed for conservation of this ecologically critical genus.

AB Begonia jocelinoi Brade (Begoniaceae) is a threatened species, endemic to a small locality in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The species was formerly listed as Wanted in the Red List of Endemic Flora of the state of Rio de Janeiro because it had not been recorded since 1953. After evaluating herbarium collections and conducting fieldwork during May 2019-February 2020, we report the rediscovery of a single population of 65 reproductive individuals of B. jocelinoi, along with numerous seedlings, besides a trail in Itatiaia National Park. This Park is an IUCN category II protected area that permits some tourism activities. Some individuals of B. jocelinoi showed signs of pruning following the maintenance of the trail. We recommend strategies for in situ and ex situ conservation of this narrowly endemic species, including provision of advice to tourists regarding the occurrence of threatened species, and diversion of the trail where the species occurs.

AB Home gardening is an indigenous practice of cultivation that has effectively adapted to local ecological conditions over generations. This study examined the effects of disturbance and garden size on biodiversity to develop a better understanding of vegetation cover and its role in livelihood and provision of forest management in the Vindhyan highlands. Data were collected from 60 gardens which were classified into large (> 650 m(2)), medium (400-650 m(2)), and small (< 400 m(2)), based on size and disturbance gradients viz., high, medium, and low. A total of 133 species from 50 families were recorded, in which trees (47.4%) were dominant followed by shrubs (18%) and herbs (16.5%). With respect to disturbance, the highest number of tree species (39) were found at low disturbance (LD) followed by 33 species in medium disturbance (MD) and 32 species in high disturbhance (HD). The total mean richness of species was greater at LD (20.3 +/- 2.3) and lowest at HD (18.5 +/- 2.2). Tree density was significantly (P <= 0.05) higher at LD (293.75 +/- 16.1 individual ha(-1)) as compared to MD (221 +/- 11.5 individual ha(-1)) and HD (210 +/- 10.3 individual ha(-1)). However, the results for shrubs and herbs density were considerably different, where shrubs density was highest at HD (70 +/- 6.9 individual per 1,000 m(2)) and lowest at LD (62.5 +/- 5.8 individual per 1,000 m(2)), while the maximum density of herbs was recorded at MD (466.25 +/- 29.8 individual per 100 m(2)) and minimum at LD (370 +/- 21.4 individual per 100 m(2)). The summed dominance ratio indicated frequent use of garden plants in bio-fencing, vegetables, ornamental, and ethnomedicine. Diversity (P < 0.01) and species richness (P < 0.05) showed a significant positive correlation with garden size. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the first component (PC1) accounted for 28.6% of variance, whereas the second explained 21.9% of variance in both disturbance and garden size with a cumulative variance of 50.5%. These components depicted the positive association with HD (14.34), SDiv (13.91), TCD (12.47), and HDiv (12.09). We concluded that the diversity of home gardens changed with disturbance, which crucially served as a refuge for native tree species in a degraded landscape. This pattern highlighted the importance of home gardens for plant biodiversity conservation and local livelihood, which must be a viable option for regeneration of deforested dry tropics, while also reducing the burden on dry tropical forest regions.

AB Community-based ecotourism is a type of tourism that takes economic, environmental, and socio-cultural sustainability into account. This research aimed to identify tourism potentials for community-based ecotourism business development and mountain ecosystem conservation for livelihood improvement in the area near Bela Mountain. A cross-sectional study design with the mixed method was employed. Key informants' data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The majority, 88.8% agreed that Bela Mountain has huge natural physical tourism potentials and 91.3% of respondents agreed that the site has huge biological tourism potentials for community-based ecotourism development. Those biological tourism resources have a significant value for ecosystem conservation. The study area is full of man-made ecotourism potentials and the area is gifted with major cultural ecotourism resources. A combination of spectacular land scenery, diversified flora species, amazing cliffs and caves makes Bela Mountain and its environs a rich opportunity for the development of community-based ecotourism.

AB Forest regeneration mechanisms of Pinus tabulaeformis, Pinus armandii, and Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata as the constructive species have been the focus of ecologists and silviculturists, and research to better understand the future of forest community composition, succession patterns, and other aspects of far-reaching influence. However, the influence of nitrogen deposition on the regeneration of different succession stages needs further investigation. In this study, seedlings of the three species of different ages were planted in the pine, pine-oak mixed, and oak forests, and the seedlings which planted by the pot culture with natural soil or fertilization soil, were monitored for two years. Survival and growth indicators, chlorophyll content, and foliar nutritional status of the seedlings were measured. The survival rate and chlorophyll content of P. tabulaeformis, P. armandii, and Q. alien var. acuteserrata seedlings were the lowest in the oak forest, which might be related to the availability of light in the undergrowth at different stages of succession. Regardless of the forest type, after nitrogen addition, the survival rates of P. tabulaeformis and Q. alien var. acuteserrata seedlings were the highest for 4-yearold seedlings, and the survival rate of P. armandii seedlings was the highest for 10-year-old ones. Nitrogen addition had no significant effect on the survival rate of P. tabulaeformis and P. armandii seedlings, but changed the nutrient content in their leaves. However, the addition of nitrogen improved the survival rate of Q. aliena var. acuteserrata seedlings, and their competitiveness. Therefore, it can be inferred that nitrogen deposition may promote the succession of P. tabulaeformis forest- to oak forest-in the Qinling Mountains, China.

   SITE SELECTION; SUCCESS; LANDSCAPE
AB Edge effects occur when the matrix has adverse impacts on the patches of remnant habitat. A widely explored example of this is the hypothesis of a higher predation pressure on bird nests closer to the habitat edge. In parallel with the recent loss of open habitats through afforestation as a climate change mitigation measure, an interest in the impact of forest on species dependent on open habitats has re-emerged. We follow wader nest survival to study the issue of an edge effect in a system of wet grasslands fragmented by forests in a region where it has not been tested before, focussing mainly on northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula), common redshank (Tringa totanus) and southern dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii). To record nest survival, we monitored 753 nests of 10 wader species on coastal grasslands in Estonia for 3 consecutive years. A subset (n = 85) of these nests was equipped with camera traps to record nest predation events and predator association with forest edge. The distance to nearest trees and forest and a forest cover within a 1-km buffer around each nest was measured. We recorded extremely low daily nest survival rates (0.903-0.922 for different species), with most nests lost to predation. We showed that nest survival is lower closer to the forest edge and negatively affected by the proportion of forest within a 1-km buffer around each nest. Based on camera trap recordings, we suggest that the edge effect is caused by elevated nest predation rates by the most common predator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), closer to the forest edge. Future afforestation plans of open habitats need to acknowledge that the resulting fragmentation has a negative impact on nest survival of ground-breeding birds. On the other hand, our results imply that restoration efforts aimed at removal of most damaging forest plantations could benefit breeding waders.

AB Vegetation demographic models (VDMs) endeavor to predict how global forests will respond to climate change. This requires simulating which trees, if any, are able to recruit under changing environmental conditions. We present a new recruitment scheme for VDMs in which functional-type-specific recruitment rates are sensitive to light, soil moisture and the productivity of reproductive trees. We evaluate the scheme by predicting tree recruitment for four tropical tree functional types under varying meteorology and canopy structure at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We compare predictions to those of a current VDM, quantitative observations and ecological expectations. We find that the scheme improves the magnitude and rank order of recruitment rates among functional types and captures recruitment limitations in response to variable understory light, soil moisture and precipitation regimes. Our results indicate that adopting this framework will improve VDM capacity to predict functional-type-specific tree recruitment in response to climate change, thereby improving predictions of future forest distribution, composition and function.

AB The extent to which interspecific competition structures species interactions and coexistence within communities, and the relevant mechanisms, are still debated. We focus on New World wood warblers (Parulidae), beginning with Robert MacArthur's iconic 1958 paper in which he shows how subtle foraging behaviors, purportedly linked to dietary differences, within spruce trees contribute to the coexistence of 5 spruce-woods warbler species. MacArthur coined the phrase "resource partitioning", and profoundly impacted the field of Ecology for subsequent decades in diverse ways. To understand what MacArthur got right and what he missed, we reviewed both ecological and evolutionary approaches to questions of the origin and coexistence of competing species in the context of diet. We argue that an important, underappreciated, mechanism of competition among coexisting migratory warbler species, particularly in winter, is diffuse exploitation competition, based in part on our own studies of warbler diets in relation to foraging behavior, substrate use, bird morphology, and other traits. Our review and synthesis of interspecific competition and coexistence in warblers have important consequences, including our questioning of the importance and effectiveness of resource partitioning in birds. We also suggest a novel hypothesis for the success of warblers today in the Caribbean and other habitats, beginning with their relatively recent adaptive radiation and the ecological opportunity on Caribbean islands.
   Lay Summary center dot Robert MacArthur's pioneering study of New World wood warblers triggered immense interest in how competitor species partition resources to coexist. center dot By reviewing resource competition and use among coexisting warbler species we address MacArthur's impressive legacy and consider what he missed. center dot We integrate ecological and evolutionary information to argue that warblers coexist primarily by specializing on different foraging substrates (i.e., locations where food is sought) rather than partitioning resources themselves, which are diverse and substantially shared by demonstrably competing species. center dot By comparing warbler diets, foraging behavior, and morphology we argue that diffuse exploitative interspecific competition favors substrate specialization; and we suggest a novel evolutionary hypothesis to explain the adaptive radiation of these warblers, particularly in the Greater Antilles islands. center dot Diverse new data-especially diets-and approaches to warbler biology compel innovative perspectives on MacArthur's fundamental contributions to coexistence in competing species.

AB Ecologists have recently accepted the notion that species coexistence involves both niche and neutral processes, but few studies have explained how both of these opposite views can explain coexistence in the same community. Here we focus on competition among sessile organisms and explored first the extent to which species-based niche reflects local "matchups" between nearby individuals, using 726 saplings of 10 temperate tree species, and second the members engaging in the matchups, which have rarely been quantified despite the importance in mixed-species forests. Growth responses to light showed considerable species-level differences, suggesting commonly seen regeneration niches. Outcomes of the individual matchups were basically predictable from the species mean response, but also with substantial contribution of within-species variation. We found strong imbalance in matchup frequencies, such that some individuals meet more individuals of differing species but others meet fewer, as well as many isolated, competition-free ones. The niche and neutral processes appear to reflect, respectively, between- and within-species differences, and our findings suggest that even when niche segregation is discernible, the role of stochasticity for the frequency of local competition, as well as its outcomes, cannot be discounted in species coexistence.

AB Elevational and latitudinal gradients in species diversity may be mediated by biotic interactions that cause density-dependent effects of conspecifics on survival or growth to differ from effects of heterospecifics (i.e. conspecific density dependence), but limited evidence exists to support this. We tested the hypothesis that conspecific density dependence varies with elevation using over 40 years of data on tree survival and growth from 23 old-growth temperate forest stands across a 1,000-m elevation gradient. We found that conspecific-density-dependent effects on survival of small-to-intermediate-sized focal trees were negative in lower elevation, higher diversity forest stands typically characterised by warmer temperatures and greater relative humidity. Conspecific-density-dependent effects on survival were less negative in higher elevation stands and ridges than in lower elevation stands and valley bottoms for small-to-intermediate-sized trees, but were neutral for larger trees across elevations. Conspecific-density-dependent effects on growth were negative across all tree size classes and elevations. These findings reveal fundamental differences in biotic interactions that may contribute to relationships between species diversity, elevation and climate.

AB Soils have a significant role in the formation and heterogeneity of habitats and thus consequently cause changes in vegetation structure and plant diversity. In this paper we evaluated variation in species distribution/association, diversity and forest structure in context to the soil physicochemical properties, addressing ten subtropical forests of Garhwal Himalaya, India. The sample plots in each forest type were laid out using a stratified random approach to calculate the vegetation metrics (density, diversity, total basal cover (TBC), importance value). Soil samples were taken from three different depths, viz., (i) 0-10 cm, (ii) 11-30 cm and (iii) 31-60 cm to analyse the soil metrics [(texture, moisture, water holding capacity, pH, soil organic carbon (hereafter SOC), nitrogen, phosphorus (hereafter P), potassium (hereafter K)]. The tree density and TBC were significantly varied and ranged from 300 +/- 11.55 to 840 +/- 15.55 trees ha(-1) and 12.55 +/- 4.62 to 36.23 +/- 5.77 m(2) ha(-1), respectively. The soil was sandy loam to clay loam and varies from acidic to alkaline (indicated by the pH), which has shown a significant-negative correlation (r = - 0.724) with availability of P. The pH was also indentified as a factor to change the amount of P and K in the soil. The diameter class distribution patterns in most of the forests have revealed a positive skewed curve. The principal component analysis has revealed that sand, pH, SOC and bulk density were the main variables affecting the distribution of vegetation in the study area. However, no direct relationships were recorded between tree diversity and density (Adj R-2 = - 0.1116, P = 0.7637), shrub density and diversity (Adj R-2 = 0.1121, P = 0.1820). On the other hand, SOC was significantly correlated with tree density (Adj R-2 = 0.5747, P = 0.0067) but not correlated with shrub density (Adj R-2 = 0.0033, P = 0.3535). The elevation was also insignificantly correlated with the diversity and density metrics. The results have revealed that specific soil properties were major deciding factor for species association, distribution and subsequently shaping forest structure in foothill regions of the Himalaya.

AB In mesic savannas worldwide, trees experience frequent fires, almost all set by humans. Management fires are set to reduce or enhance tree cover. Success depends greatly on responses of sub-adult trees to such fires. To date, the number of successive years that sub-adult trees can resprout nor the number of years that they must resist being top-killed by successive fires, nor the requisite height, have been reported. In a 6-year experimental field study in Guinean savannas of West Africa, we monitored annually the heights and responses of 1,765 permanently tagged sub-adult trees under annual fires set in three different periods of the long dry season: early-dry season (EDS), mid-dry season (MDS) and late-dry season (LDS). Annual MDS fires are the common local management protocols of Guinean savannas, although EDS fires are common in some of the savannas. Results showed that overall, the proportion of sub-adults that resisted being top-killed differed across fire seasons. Furthermore, resisting one fire gave a better chance of resisting the next. Only sub-adults that were able to resist direct damage for three successive EDS and MDS fires reached sufficient height to be recruited to the adult stage. Resistance height (avoiding topkill) was similar to 1 m for EDS and similar to 2 m for both MDS and LDS fires. Recruitment height (threshold for transition to adult stage) was similar to 3 m for EDS and similar to 3.3 m for MDS fires. No height was great enough for sub-adult trees to be recruited to adult stages in LDS fire. Synthesis and applications. The results of this novel field study showed clearly that successive early- and mi-dry season fires can enhance tree density and that successive late-dry season fires alone reduce tree density in Guinean savannas due to the effects of successive fires on sub-adult trees. The results suggest that a planned regime of these seasons of fire could be used to maintain the desired tree density in Guinean savannas and may inform fire management in other mesic savannas where goals are to increase or decrease tree densities. It also provides relevant information for comparative studies on the mechanisms of recruitment of sub-adult trees to an adult stage in all mesic savannas, a process that ultimately determines savanna physiognomy.

AB Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the most dominant terrestrial organisms worldwide. They are hugely abundant, both in terms of sheer numbers and biomass, on every continent except Antarctica and are deeply embedded within a diversity of ecological networks and processes. Ants are also eusocial and colonial organisms-their lifecycle is built on the labor of sterile worker ants who support a small number of reproductive individuals. Given the climatic changes that our planet faces, we need to understand how various important taxonomic groups will respond; this includes the ants. In this review, we synthesize the available literature to tackle this question. The answer is complicated. The ant literature has focused on temperature, and we broadly understand the ways in which thermal changes may affect ant colonies, populations, and communities. In general, we expect that species living in the Tropics, and in thermally variable microhabitats, such as the canopy and leaf litter environments, will be negatively impacted by rising temperatures. Species living in the temperate zones and those able to thermally buffer their nests in the soil or behaviorally avoid higher temperatures, however, are likely to be unaffected or may even benefit from a changed climate. How ants will respond to changes to other abiotic drivers associated with climate change is largely unknown, as is the detail on how altered ant populations and communities will ramify through their wider ecological networks. We discuss how eusociality may allow ants to adapt to, or tolerate, climate change in ways that solitary organisms cannot and we identify key geographic and phylogenetic hotspots of climate vulnerability and resistance. We finish by emphasizing the key research questions that we need to address moving forward so that we may fully appreciate how this critical insect group will respond to the ongoing climate crisis.

AB The center-periphery hypothesis predicts that species are most abundant at the center of their distribution range. Differential herbivory rates between center and periphery populations can explain this variation in species abundance. However, if the geographic center of a species distribution coincides with its ecological optimum, the resource availability hypothesis predicts higher herbivory rates and tolerances at the center compared to the periphery. Biogeographical studies on herbivory have treated these two mechanisms separately, limiting our mechanistic understanding of the role of herbivory in shaping species range limits. We analyzed the role of resource availability on herbivory variation from center to periphery using data collected across the distribution of Thunberbia atacorensis, a range-limited species of West Africa. We used two types of distances: geographic distance (the distance from each plot to the geographic center of all populations) and climatic distance (the distance from each plot to the preferendum of the species). We found no increase in herbivory toward the periphery of the climatic and geographic ranges. However, herbivory rates increased with soil nitrogen. Soil nitrogen decreased from the center to the periphery of the climatic range. Phylogenetic diversity and competition from surrounding plants did not affect herbivory rates. Our study provides insights into how nutrient limitation can shape species center-periphery distribution by altering spatial variation in herbivory rates.

AB Plant competition may intensify with climate warming, but whether this will occur equally for conspecific and heterospecific competition remains unknown. Competitive shifts have the potential to instigate community change because the relative strengths of conspecific and heterospecific negative density dependence mediate the stabilizing mechanisms underpinning species coexistence. We examined a mature temperate forest to assess both direct and indirect climate effects at multiple scales: individual species, interspecies relationships, and community stability mechanisms. Our coupled approach (1) quantified tree mortality risk dependence on the interactive effects of competition, climatic water deficit, snowpack, and soil moisture for 28,913 trees over 8 years (3149 mortalities), then (2) used a climate-projection ensemble to forecast changes in conspecific and heterospecific competition from 2020 to 2100. We predict that projected climate warming will destabilize the foundational forest community by increasing the strength of heterospecific competition at a greater rate and to a greater degree than conspecific competition for four of five abundant tree species, particularly on dry microsites. Modeling showed that these findings were most pronounced after the year 2038, at which point snowpacks were projected to be too small to ameliorate the effects of drought on competitive interactions. Our finding that heterospecific competition is more sensitive than conspecific competition to climate warming may indicate the impending loss of ecosystem functioning. We join the growing body of work showing a predominance of indirect drought effects, yet coupled climate models still fail to consider how changing community dynamics may impact forest cover and, in turn, disrupt forest-climate carbon feedbacks. Ecosystems sharing characteristics with our example forest-those with low species richness and therefore a limited biodiversity insurance effect-may be similarly vulnerable to climate-mediated destabilization. In such communities, increased heterospecific competition among even a small number of species can more easily destabilize communities without recourse from redundant species. This study of an overlooked but vital mechanism of community change can be adapted by research in a range of ecosystems to improve the understanding of climate change consequences.

AB Microbes inhabit virtually everywhere on and/or in our bodies, including the seminal and vaginal fluids. They have significant importance in maintaining reproductive health and protecting hosts from diseases. The exchange of microbes during sexual intercourse is one of the most direct and significant microbial transmissions between men and women. Nevertheless, the mechanism of this microbial transmission was little known. Is the transmission mode stochastic, passive diffusion similar to the random walk of particles, or driven by some deterministic forces? What is the microbial transmission probability? What are the possible evolutionary implications, particularly from the perspective of sexual reproduction (selection)? We tackle these intriguing questions by leveraging the power of Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity, specifically implemented as the HDP-MSN (hierarchical Dirichlet process approximated multi-site neutral model), which allows for constructing truly multi-site metacommunity models, simultaneously including vaginal and semen microbiomes. By reanalyzing the microbiome datasets of seminal and vaginal fluids from 23 couples both before and after sexual intercourses originally reported by Mandar and colleagues, we found that the microbial transmission between seminal and vaginal fluids is a stochastic, passive diffusion similar to the random walk of particles in physics, rather than driven by deterministic forces. The transmission probability through sexual intercourse seems to be approximately 0.05. Inspired by the results from the HDP-MSN model, we further conjecture that the stochastic drifts of microbiome transmissions during sexual intercourses can be responsible for the homogeneity between semen and vaginal microbiomes first identified in a previous study, which should be helpful for sexual reproduction by facilitating the sperm movement/survival and/or egg fertilization. This inference seems to be consistent with the classic Red Queen hypothesis, which, when extended to the co-evolutionary interactions between humans and their symbiotic microbiomes, would predict that the reproductive system microbiomes should support sexual reproduction.

AB Background: Currently, 58 species are assigned to the genus Allobates, with 70% of its diversity described just in the last two decades, with many additional species likely unnamed. The continuous description of these new species represents a fundamental step for resolving the taxonomy and ensuring the future conservation of the genus.
   Methods: Using molecular, acoustic, and morphological evidences, we describe a new species of Allobates from Teles Pires River region, southern Amazonia, and provide accounts on the population of A. tapajos found sympatrically with the new species.
   Results: The new species is distinguished from its congeners by the coloration of thighs, venter, dorsum, and dark lateral stripe. It has four types of calls, with advertisement calls formed by relatively long trills with a mean duration of 2.29 s +/- 0.65, mean of 39.93 notes +/- 11.18 emitted at a mean rate of 17.49 +/- 0.68 notes per second, and mean dominant frequency of 5,717 Hz +/- 220.81. The genetic distance between the new species and its congeners in a fragment of the 16S mitochondrial fragment ranged between 13.2% (A. carajas) to 21.3% (A. niputidea). The sympatric Allobates population fits its morphology and acoustic with the nominal A. tapajos, but presents a relatively high genetic distance of nearly 6.5%, raising questions on the current taxonomy of this species.

AB Tropical forests experience a relatively stable climate, but are not thermally uniform. The tropical forest canopy is hotter and thermally more variable than the understory. Heat stress in the canopy is expected to increase with global warming, potentially threatening its inhabitants. Here, we assess the impact of heating on the most abundant tropical canopy arthropods-ants. While foragers can escape hot branches, brood and workers inside twig nests might be unable to avoid heat stress. We examined nest choice and absconding behavior-nest evacuation in response to heat stress-of four common twig-nesting ant genera. We found that genera nesting almost exclusively in the canopy occupy smaller cavities compared to Camponotus and Crematogaster that nest across all forest strata. Crematogaster ants absconded at the lowest temperatures in heating experiments with both natural and artificial nests. Cephalotes workers were overall less likely to abscond from their nests. This is the first test of behavioral thermoregulation in tropical forest canopy ants, and it highlights different strategies and sensitivities to heat stress. Behavioral avoidance is the first line of defense against heat stress and will be crucial for small ectotherms facing increasing regional and local temperatures.

AB The effects of climate change may be more evident in mountainous areas. In these areas, an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation can reduce the amount of snow, which represents a source of water for human consumption and vegetation. To analyze the effects of climate change on vegetation, it is possible to examine the climate-vegetation relationship in the past and observe the influence of variation in temperature and precipitation on the dynamics of plant communities. The aim of the present work was to describe the climate-vegetation dynamics of the last 4,500 years in the high subtropical Andes of Chile (30 degrees S). The paleoclimatic reconstruction was carried out through the analysis of fossil pollen and macroscopic carbon obtained from sediment cores from two high Andean lakes. The dynamics of the vegetation was analyzed taking into account the alpha and beta diversity. The pollen and carbon records showed three contrasting periods during the last 4,500 years. From the beginning of the sequences until similar to 1900 cal. yr BP, relatively dry climatic conditions are suggested, with a slight trend toward more humid conditions after 2,700 cal. yr BP. Pollen records from similar to 1900 to similar to 600 cal. yr BP suggest wetter conditions than today. Finally, relatively arid conditions have reappeared in the last similar to 600 years. The diversity analysis showed that the climate mainly influences the composition of taxa in the communities (beta diversity) and not the richness (alpha diversity). In periods of dry/wet transition and vice versa, beta diversity changes. On the other hand, richness remains relatively constant throughout the record.

AB Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and niche partitioning have been proposed to explain species coexistence and community diversity. However, as a potentially important axis of niche partitioning, the role of interannual climate variability in driving local community dynamics remains largely unknown. Here we used a 15-year monitoring data set of more than 53,000 seedlings in a temperate forest to examine (1) what are the relative effects of interannual climate variability, biotic interactions, and habitat conditions on seedling survival; (2) how the effects of biotic interactions change with interannual climate variability, and habitat conditions; and (3) whether the impacts of interannual climate variability, biotic interactions, and habitat conditions differ with plant traits. Interannual climate variability accounted for the most variation in seedling survival at the community level, followed by biotic interactions, and habitat conditions. Increased snowpack and decreased minimum temperature during the non-growing season had positive effects on seedling survival. Effects of conspecific neighbor density were weakened in higher snowpack, effective accumulated temperature, elevation, and soil-resource gradient, but were intensified with increased ultraviolet radiation, maximum precipitation, minimum temperature, and soil moisture. In addition, the relative importance of interannual climate variability versus biotic interactions differed depending on species-trait groups. Specifically, biotic interactions for gravity-dispersed species had a larger effect size in affecting seedling survival than other trait groups. Also, gravity-dispersed species experienced a stronger CNDD than wind-dispersed, probably because wind-dispersed seedlings rarely had adult conspecifics nearby. We found that interannual climate variability was most strongly associated with seedling survival, but the magnitude of climatic effects varied among species-trait groups. Interannual climate variability may act as an inhibitor or accelerator to density-dependent interactions and should be accounted for in future studies, as both a potential direct and indirect factor in understanding the diversity of forest communities.

AB Anthropogenic activities have resulted in habitat loss and fragmentation across different landscapes. Anthropogenic land-uses adjacent to forest patches may further influence the movement and occupancy of a species. Therefore, we investigated how dominant land-uses, i.e. grassland, human settlement and commercial exotic timber plantations surrounding a forest patch and proximity to the forest edge, influenced the occupancy and detectability of mammalian species in selected Southern Mistbelt Forests. Using camera-traps deployed at 200 points per sampling season, we determined the mammalian species richness, occupancy and detection probability in disjunct Southern Mistbelt Forests in southern KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape Provinces, South Africa. We applied the Royle-Nichols multi-session multi-species hierarchical model to estimate species richness and occupancy of 14 mammalian species. The large-spotted genet Genetta tigrina had the highest mean occupancy (0.54), and the bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus had the highest detection probability (0.14) across all sampling areas. Detection probability was low across all mammalian species (<= 0.14), whereas occupancy was more variable (0.044-0.54). For most mammalian species, detectability was not influenced by distance from the edge; however, forest specialists, such as the bushbuck and the tree hyrax Dendrohyrax arboreus were more likely to be detected at the core as predicted. The core is typically associated with a dense connecting canopy and dense vegetation where these species can take shelter and forage with reduced predation risk. Our results highlighted how adjacent land-uses of grassland, human settlements and commercial exotic timber plantations played varying roles in determining mammalian species occupancy and detectability in the Southern Mistbelt Forest patches.

AB Fine roots balance multiple essential plant functions that ultimately fuel plant productivity. The coordination of root functional traits is multidimensional, meaning that some traits are correlated while others can vary independently. This leads to a large variety of adaptive trait combinations and thus functional diversity in plant belowground morphology, anatomy, physiology and symbioses with soil biota. Within forest communities, co-occurrence of such belowground trait combinations may be especially prevalent in tropical forests, not only due to their immense biodiversity but also because their soils are frequently weathered and limited in phosphorus. Phosphorus occurs in different forms (that differ in their mobility and accessibility) that may select for different trait combinations on relatively small spatial scales. While evidence accumulates of the myriad viable nutrient acquisition strategies on poor tropical soils, they are not well conceptualized. In this study, we outline criteria for the identification and investigation of fine-root trait syndromes. We then apply these criteria to a case study of tropical tree species adapted to phosphorus-poor soil and synthesize a range of traits. Five potentially coexisting syndromes are presented that are distinguished by root morphology, mycorrhizal association type, their interactions and implications for fine-root functioning. We connect the functional variation of these species-level syndromes in tropical communities to an established phosphorus partitioning hypothesis. The co-occurrence of fine-root trait syndromes could have implications for root sampling design, species coexistence, community structure and biogeochemical cycling.

AB Conventional agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been criticized for failing to exploit conservation synergies that could be obtained from spatial coordination of conservation efforts. Understanding the design and implementation of novel incentive mechanisms explicitly designed to boost spatial coordination of conservation efforts is, therefore, of critical importance. We conducted the first systematic review of such incentives ('Spatial Coordination Incentives'), including Agglomeration Bonus, Threshold Bonus, and Threshold Payments. The review aims to investigate these incentives' performance and identify the underlying factors affecting their performance. An extensive bibliographic search was carried out and 55 papers were included in the final analysis. Most papers (89%) are theoretical and experimental studies. Real-world applications of these incentives are rare. The theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that these incentives could potentially promote participation, spatial coordination, and environmental effectiveness. However, the results remain a subject of debate in experimental studies. Performance variation is attributed to scheme design features and contextual factors. We highlight the areas where future work would be most warranted to further validate the performance of these incentives. Insights gained from the review provide important implications for the emerging field of conservation science and ongoing efforts to improve the design of AES for better landscape-scale management.

AB For over forty years, Brazil, its subnational governments, Indigenous communities, other nations, non-governmental organizations, corporations, and individuals have worked to conserve the Amazon rainforest through a staggering number of diverse international initiatives. While some initiatives have supported Brazil in decreasing the rate of deforestation over the past fifteen years, the 2019 fires demonstrated that destruction continues. Left unchecked, this irreversible destruction promises to amplify. Fortunately, the long history of global involvement in Amazon conservation provides ample lessons for effective, place-based deforestation prevention. Thoughtful and coordinated international action can address the current lethal combination of destructive factors: Brazil's environmentally hostile federal administration, its national economic recession, and surging international demand for deforestation commodities.
   This Article curates lessons learned from over four decades of international efforts to conserve the Amazon rainforest and synthesizes them into a more effective and efficient strategy. Due to the urgency caused by the climate crisis and the Amazon's impending "tipping point," this Article analyzes the issue through a retrospective lens, drawing insight from past and existing initiatives because what has been done is possible. Because this Article's proposal relies on existing global alliances, political motivation, institutions, and mechanisms, the burden of its implementation is considerably reduced. There simply is no time for starting fresh.

AB Carrion consumption by scavengers is a key component of both terrestrial and aquatic food webs. However, there are few direct comparisons of the structure and functioning of scavenging communities in different ecosystems. Here, we monitored the consumption of 23 fish (seabream Sparus aurata) and 34 bird (yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis) carcasses on a small Mediterranean island (Isla Grosa, southeastern Spain) and surrounding waters in summer to compare the structure of the scavenger assemblages and their carrion consumption efficiencies in terrestrial and shallow water habitats. Scavenging was highly efficient both in marine and terrestrial environments, especially in the presence of a highly abundant vertebrate scavenger species, the yellow-legged gull. The vertebrate scavenger community was richer in the marine environment, whereas the invertebrate community was richer on land. The scavenger network was usually well-structured (i.e., nested), with the exception of the community associated with fish terrestrial carcasses, which were almost monopolized by yellow-legged gulls. In contrast, gulls left conspecific carcasses untouched, thus allowing longer persistence of gull carcasses on land and their exploitation by a diverse insect community. Our study shows important differences in the scavenging process associated with environment and carcass type. Promising avenues for further eco-evolutionary and applied research arise from the comparison of scavenging processes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, from small islands to continents.

AB As deforestation frontiers expand in the tropics, understanding species responses is critical to inform efficient land-use management policies. Here we evaluated lizard responses to changes in landscape, habitat patch, and quality in a deforestation frontier in southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. We first considered overall lizard assemblages and then two species subgroups of contrasting thermoregulation strategies. We sampled lizards at 21 forest patches (42-7,035 ha) subject to moderate habitat disturbance (e.g., cattle intrusion and selective logging). Based on 6,000 pitfall trap-days and 60,000 m of visual surveys, we recorded 215 individuals representing 15 species. Contrary to expectations, species richness and abundance were not explained by any of the variables considered, including matrix quality, proportion of forest cover, forest patch area and shape, age since isolation, arthropod biomass, canopy openness, litter volume, tree density, and fire history. However, the composition of persisting species was determined by the structural complexity of the adjacent matrix. The abundance of species that avoid direct sun exposure to regulate their body temperature increased under more-complex structures of adjacent matrix areas and decreased within patches more intensively affected by past fire events. Disturbance within forest patches likely decreased the patch-matrix contrast, contributing to the absence of forest area effects. Nevertheless, species-specific microhabitat requirements dictated part of the lizard species that were able to persist in the fragmented landscape. Strategies aiming to maximize lizard diversity should embrace retention of the habitat quality within forest patches and forest corridors/high-stature vegetation in at least some sites connecting forest remnants.

AB The systematic degradation of marine ecosystems is a global phenomenon that has important and diverse consequences including biodiversity loss and reduced ecosystem service provisions. In temperate regions, subtidal kelp forests are dominant ecosystems in rocky coasts, subjected to the influence of local-scale stressors and regional environmental variation. For example, kelps within the Humboldt Current System are at risk of degradation from live-harvesting by fisheries. However, limited information exists regarding the long-term consequences of kelp harvesting, which, in turn, limits the ability to provide effective management and conservation efforts. Here, we examined the ecosystem-level consequences of the artisanal subtidal Lessonia trabeculata fishery along the coast of central Chile during a 2-year period, assessing (1) the change in adult and juvenile L. trabeculata density within harvested and nonharvested (control) plots (similar to 90 m(2)), (2) the impact of L. trabeculata harvesting on reef fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages, and (3) the change in density of the most abundant L. trabeculata-associated species. The experiment was conducted over a 2-year period, from December 2016 to May 2019. Approximately 90% of L. trabeculata was removed by an experienced kelp fisherman in experimental plots. After 2 years, L trabeculata and its associated community showed a lack of recovery in the harvested plots. Within these plots, the average abundance of the rock shrimp, Rhynchocinetes typus, and the herbivorous snail, Tegula tridentata, was greater than in nonharvested plots and the pattern persisted over the study period. The difference in abundance of associated species may be key to the (lack of) recovery of L. trabeculata forests. Our study highlights the impact of L. trabeculata harvesting on associated fauna; however, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the capacity and time frame to reestablish the original biomass of L trabeculata, as well as its associated fauna. The management of L. trabeculata fisheries needs to account for ecosystem-wide impacts in order to better manage and protect vital coastal ecosystems.

AB Soil organic phosphorus (P) compounds can be the main P source for plants in P-limited tropical rainforests. Phosphorus occurs in diverse chemical forms, including monoester P, diester P, and phytate, which require enzymatic hydrolysis by phosphatase into inorganic P before assimilation by plants. The interactions between plant interspecific differences in organic P acquisition strategies via phosphatase activities with root morphological traits would lead to P resource partitioning, but they have not been rigorously evaluated. We measured the activities of three classes of phosphatases (phosphomonoesterase, PME; phosphodiesterase, PDE; and phytase, PhT), specific root length (SRL), root diameter, and root tissue density in mature tree species with different mycorrhizal associations (ectomycorrhizal [ECM] or arbuscular mycorrhizal [AM]) and different successional status (climax or pioneer species) in Sabah, Malaysia. We studied nitrogen (N)- and P-fertilized plots to evaluate the acquisition strategies for organic P under P-limited conditions 7 years after fertilization was initiated. P fertilization reduced the PME activity in all studied species and reduced PhT and PDE activities more in climax species than in the two pioneer species, irrespective of the mycorrhizal type. PDE activity increased in some climax species after N fertilization, suggesting that these species allocate excess N to the synthesis of PDE. Moreover, PME and PhT activities, but not PDE activity, correlated positively with SRL. We suggest that climax species tend to be more strongly dependent on recalcitrant organic P (i.e., phytate and/or diester P) than pioneer species, regardless of the mycorrhizal type. We also suggest that trees in which root PME or PhT activity is enhanced can increase their SRL to acquire P efficiently. Resource partitioning of soil organic P would occur among species through differences in their phosphatase activities, which plays potentially ecologically important role in reducing the competition among coexisting tree species in lowland tropical rainforests.

AB Decapod crustaceans are important components of the fauna of marine caves worldwide, yet information on their ecology is still scarce. Mediterranean marine caves are perhaps the best known of the world and may offer paradigms to the students of marine cave decapods from other geographic regions. This review summarizes and updates the existing knowledge about the decapod fauna of Mediterranean marine caves on the basis of a dataset of 76 species from 133 caves in 13 Mediterranean countries. Most species were found occasionally, while 15 species were comparatively frequent (found in at least seven caves). They comprise cryptobiotic and bathyphilic species that only secondarily colonize caves (secondary stygobiosis). Little is known about the population biology of cave decapods, and quantitative data are virtually lacking. The knowledge on Mediterranean marine cave decapods is far from being complete. Future research should focus on filling regional gaps and on the decapod ecological role: getting out at night to feed and resting in caves during daytime, decapods may import organic matter to the cave ecosystem. Some decapod species occurring in caves are protected by law. Ecological interest and the need for conservation initiatives combine to claim for intensifying research on the decapod fauna of the Mediterranean Sea caves.

AB Odonates (Insecta: Odonata) are important insects in the food chains of freshwater environments around the world, being used as a model species for areas of behavior and analysis of environmental quality. In Brazil, especially in the Northeastern region, both knowledge about the distribution and molecular information of odonate species found in the two main biomes of the region is still limited. Aiming to improve these issues, here, we carried out an Odonata survey in two locations and built a DNA barcode database for species from the state of Paraiba. In total, 15 first records were reported for this Brazilian state and 142 specimens from 27 genera and 45 species had their 'Folmer' cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) fragment evaluated. The database we generated includes data for 70% of the Odonata species found in Paraiba state. For 16 species, this is the first DNA barcode available in public sequence repositories. Our results demonstrate that using the COI in the regional scale can help identify and delimit those evaluated. Eight species (17%) showed a low percentage of differentiation (<2%) compared to other species currently deposited in the GenBank or BOLD System; nevertheless, we present morphological traits that reaffirm our identifications. Barcode data provide new insights into Neotropical diversity and deliver basic information for taxonomic analyses.

AB We review the consequences of environmental changes caused by human activities on forest products and forest-dependent communities in the Amazon region-the vast Amazonas River basin and the Guiana Shield in South America. We used the 2018 and 2021 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and recent scientific studies to present evidence and hypotheses for changes in the ecosystem productivity and geographical distribution of plants species. We have identified species associated with highly employed forest products exhibiting reducing populations, mainly linked with deforestation and selective logging. Changes in species composition along with a decline of valuable species have been observed in the eastern, central, and southern regions of the Brazilian Amazon, suggesting accelerated biodiversity loss. Over 1 billion native trees and palms are being lost every two years, causing economic losses estimated between US$1-17 billion. A decrease in native plant species can be abrupt and both temporary or persistent for over 20 years, leading to reduced economic opportunities for forest-dependent communities. Science and technology investments are considered promising in implementing agroforestry systems recovering deforested and degraded lands, which could engage companies that use forest products due to supply chain advantages.

AB Simple Summary Determination of species in the ant genus Odontomachus, which is a venomous group of ants, may require the use of highly trained entomologists. In Thailand, three species are very similar and difficult to distinguish: O. monticola, O. rixosus, and O. simillimus. In such a situation, a complementary technique not requiring highly specialized entomological knowledge is welcome. The geometric morphometric approach has proven to be this sort of tool, especially powerful for morphologically close or even cryptic species. In its most recent development, the geometric method uses the relative position of some anatomical landmarks. However, in worker ants these landmarks are few in number and can be difficult to assess without dissection. Here, therefore, we use the outline-based approach, an alternative geometric technique that has not yet been tested in ants. We show that the simple outline of the head contains a strong taxonomic signal, much stronger than the one obtained from the pronotum shape. The outline technique therefore represents a promising approach to aid in the determination of ant species. All members of the ant genus Odontomachus Latreille, 1804 are venomous ants. Four species in this genus have been identified from Thailand: Odontomachus latidens Mayr, 1867; O. monticola Emery, 1892; O. rixosus Smith, 1757; and O. simillimus Smith, 1758. The three latter species are available and have been used for an outline morphometric study. They display similar morphology, which makes their distinction very difficult except for highly qualified individuals. A total of 80 worker specimens were studied, exploring the contour shapes of their head and pronotum as possible taxonomic characters. The size of each body part was estimated determining the contour perimeter, the values for which were largely overlapping between O. rixosus and O. simillimus; most O. monticola specimens exhibited a significantly larger size. In contrast to the size, each contour shape of the head or pronotum established O. rixosus as the most distinct species. An exploratory data analysis disclosed the higher taxonomic signal of the head contour relative to the pronotum one. The scores obtained for validated reclassification were much better for the head (99%) than for the pronotum (82%). This study supports outline morphometrics of the head as a promising approach to contribute to the morphological identification of ant species, at least for monomorphic workers.

AB The Amazon and the Atlantic Forest are Brazilian biomes that suffered an intense land use and land cover change, marked by the loss of native forest and expansion of agriculture and livestock. This article aims to analyze land use and land cover change history and to propose a sustainable alternative for agriculture and livestock as an opportunity for rural development in these biomes. The statistics of the platform from the Annual Mapping Project for Land Use and Land Cover in Brazil (MapBiomas) were used in an annual historical series from 1985 to 2020. The analysis of land use and land cover changes indicates that the Amazon native forest was reduced by 44.53 million hectares (Mha), while pasture, agriculture and planted forest increased by 38.10, 6.06 and 0.26 Mha, respectively, over the 35 years (1985 to 2020). In the Atlantic Forest, for the same period, forest and pasture reduced by 0.99 and 11.53 Mha, respectively, while agriculture expanded by 8.06 Mha and planted forest by 2.99 Mha. Sustainable land use strategies, such as the Integration Crop-Livestock-Forest (ICLF), can support the increase in agricultural production while recovering and preserving the environment. Policies and programs should consider regional particularities and barriers for more significant adoption of this strategy.

AB Rhododendron arboreum species belonging to the Ericaceae family are found at an altitude of 1500-3000 m in the Himalayan region with bright red to pinkish flowers. These flowers are edible and are harvested for the Rhododendron arboreum processed squash called `buransh' in the native language. This Rhododendron squash provides high ecological and medicinal value as it not only acts as a refreshing drink for the locals but its extraction for commercial utilization provides many livelihood opportunities to the local communities of the Western Himalayas. The Indian state of Uttarakhand has been a rich source of many NTFPs especially Rhododendrons which are extracted for both local and commercial use in the study area. Our research focuses on the Value-chain analysis of Rhododendron arboreum squash 'buransh' as a Non-timber forest product (NTFP) with the case study of Chamoli District in the state of Uttarakhand. The findings of the study reveal that the harvest of R. arboreum for the production of Rhododendron squash provides many economic benefits to the local communities. The average price of freshly harvested R.arboreum flowers ranges from 30 to 60 Rupees (available in both fresh wet and in dry form). The quantum of squash production varies from 2500 to 7500 L in the flowering season depending on the production capacity, size, and location of the processing units/NGOs or cottage industries in the study area. The value chain provides an important source of livelihood enhancement option for the locals of the Himalayas region to target the unemployment in the state of Uttarakhand. The study explores the value-chain from the harvest of the R. arboreum for the Rhododendron squash preparation and its various components, stages, methods and, the opportunities and challenges involved. The forest community groups such as the 'Van-Panchayats' play a significant role in the management of the forest resources in the study area. The study recommends trainings and capacity building for enhancing the knowledge of the locals to adopt sustainable practices for the harvest of the R.arboreum sp. and to maintain the overall vitality and health of the Rhododendron rich forests from high anthropogenic pressures in the study area.

AB Watershed eco-compensation (WEC) is considered a significant environmental policy instrument for watershed ecological protection and management. However, in the legislation and practice of eco-compensation in China, the development of the WEC mechanism is still in the initial stages. In this paper, the institutional opportunities and challenges of WEC are analyzed from the existing policies, laws, and economical instruments. Theoretically, WEC in China has seen a combination of punitive-based "Watershed Ecological Damage Compensation (WEDC)" and incentive-based "Watershed Ecological Protective Compensation (WEPC)". Through a comparative analysis of domestic and foreign watershed compensation practices, the results demonstrate that most of China's WEC projects have an insufficient legal basis, a single compensatory subject, insufficient compensation funds, and an imperfect market-oriented compensation mechanism. To improve watershed eco-compensation in China, it is recommended to strengthen legislation, select diversified eco-compensation approaches, and establish a market-based and systematic eco-compensation mechanism for watersheds.

AB Growth analysis based on tree-ring chronology is difficult in trees in aseasonal tropical rain forests, because annual growth rings may be unclear or completely absent. Fortunately, tree growth history recorded in xylem tissue is capable of providing valuable information on the responses of trees and forests to past and present environmental changes, including global warming. We have developed a new technique for aseasonal tropical forest trees which derives their growth rates from xylem Delta C-14, and verified its accuracy. We also determined, from xylem delta C-13, the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) in the past 50 years. We analysed changes in xylem Delta C-14 and delta C-13 in 23 canopy trees of 12 species in 6 families growing in Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia; each stem diameter at breast height (DBH) was recorded 14 times from 1969 to 2011. We found a significant positive relationship between the growth rates determined by C-14 dating and the past DBH data. On the other hand, leaf-internal CO2 (C-i) content did not change with increasing atmospheric CO2 (C-a). Thus, the iWUE increased significantly over the last 50 years in all the families and species tested. This study showed that the simultaneous measurements of xylem Delta C-14 and delta C-13 could reveal a long-term change in tree growth and iWUE during the past 50 years with high accuracy in various species and/or individuals in aseasonal tropical rainforests exhibiting high species diversity.

AB The impact of deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia is a global concern, and land occupation in public lands contributes to increased deforestation rates. Little is known about the spread of deforestation in landholdings in undesignated public lands located on cattle-ranching frontiers. We use a case of Matupi District, a hotspot of deforestation along the Transamazon Highway in the southern portion of Brazil's state of Amazonas, where spontaneous squatters and land grabbers are the main actors occupying landholdings. We assessed the advance of deforestation and the spatial distribution of landholdings in relation to the main road and to land categories (e.g., protected areas and undesignated public land). Landholdings up to 400 ha were the majority in numbers (52%) and larger landholdings (> 400 ha) were located farther into the forest, contributing to expanding the deforestation frontier. By 2018, 80% of the remaining forest was in larger landholdings (> 400 ha), increasing the susceptibility of this forest to being cleared in the coming years. Thus, greater attention should be given to these larger landholdings to control the spread of deforestation. By analyzing the clearing pattern in the landholdings, deforestation monitoring can focus on specific sizes of landholdings that contribute most to the advance of the deforestation frontier. Brazil's current trend to facilitating the legalization of illegal claims in undesignated public lands, such as the large and medium landholdings we studied, implies vast areas of future deforestation and should be reversed.

AB Bacterioplankton play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling in rivers. The dynamics of hydrologic conditions in rivers were believed to affect geographic pattern and assembly process of these microorganisms, which have not been widely investigated. In this study, the geographic pattern and assembly process of bacterioplankton community in river networks of the Taihu Basin were systematically explored using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The results showed that the diversity, structure, and taxonomic composition of bacterioplankton community all exhibited significant temporal variation during wet, normal, and dry seasons (p<0.01). The neutral community model and null model were applied to reveal the assembly process of bacterioplankton community. The stochastic process and deterministic process both shaped the bacterioplankton community with greater influence of deterministic process. In addition, the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were comparatively analyzed. The abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities exhibited similar temporal dynamics (principal coordinates analysis) and spatial variations (distance-decay relationship), indicating similar geographic patterns. Meanwhile, distinct assembly processes were observed for the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities. Stochastic process (dispersal limitation) shaped the abundant bacterioplankton community while deterministic process (heterogeneous selection) dominated the assembly process of rare bacterioplankton community. Mantel test, redundancy analysis, and correlation analysis together indicated that pH and dissolved oxygen were the major environmental attributes that affected thestructure and assembly process of bacterioplankton community. These results expanded our understanding of the geographic pattern, assembly process, and driving factors of bacterioplankton community in river networks and provided clues for the underlying mechanisms.

AB Interspecific competition can strongly influence community structure and shape niche breadth and overlap. One of the main factors that determines hummingbird community structure is competition for food. Hummingbirds' functional attributes, such as beak length and body mass, influence nectar acquisition in flowers. This study evaluates how functional and behavioral attributes of hummingbirds influence their specialization, as measured by pollen transportation. We tested the following hypothesis: H1) smaller and short-billed hummingbirds will carry higher pollen richness and relatively more pollen grains than long-billed hummingbirds; H2) dominant and territorial hummingbirds carry a lower richness of pollen types and fewer pollen grains when compared to subordinate hummingbirds, and H3) the similarity in the composition of pollen morphotypes, between the hummingbirds species, will be low because we expect to find high specialization in the use of plant species. We conducted the study between September 2018 and March 2019 in a Campo Rupestre (rocky outcrops) in Southeastern Brazil. Hummingbirds were captured with a trap. The pollen adhered to the body parts was collected, counted, and identified in the laboratory. We recorded hummingbirds' beak sizes and body masses. Behavioral responses of hummingbirds to artificial feeders were collected regarding the time and duration of each visit and the outcome of aggressive interactions. An interaction network was built based on the pollen grains found on each hummingbird. Our results showed that neither body size nor aggressive behaviors influenced pollen richness on hummingbirds' bodies. Beak length was the most important hummingbird attribute that influenced pollen richness, but not pollen relative abundance. Short-billed hummingbirds carried the greatest richness of pollen grains. The hummingbird pollen-grain interaction network was generalized in the pollen grains transported. We conclude that hummingbirds' beak length is the central morphological variable related to pollen grain transport in rocky outcrops.

AB Stomata play a central role in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Existing knowledge regarding the roles of stomata in plant stress is centered on abiotic stresses and plant-pathogen interactions, but how stomata influence plant-herbivore interactions remains largely unclear. Here, we summarize the functions of stomata in plant-insect interactions and highlight recent discoveries of how herbivores manipulate plant stomata. Because stomata are linked to interrelated physiological processes in plants, herbivory-induced changes in stomatal dynamics might have cellular, organismic, and/or even community-level impacts. We summarize our current understanding of how stomata mediate plant responses to herbivory and environmental stimuli, propose how herbivores may influence these responses, and identify key knowledge gaps in plant-herbivore interactions.

AB Premise of research. Pollinators are known to impose strong selection on floral shape. Particularly well studied is the relationship between the flowers of hummingbird-pollinated plant species and the bills of their pollinators. However, no studies to date have evaluated whether these relationships vary according to the level of pollination specialization. Here, we quantify the relationship between the corolla shape of Antillean Gesneriaceae and the bills of their hummingbird pollinators for species with a specialist (one functional group of pollinators: hummingbirds) and a generalist (more than one functional group of pollinators: hummingbirds, bats, and insects) pollination strategy.Methodology. We used phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses on linear measurements and phylogenetic two blocks partial least squares on multivariate geometric morphometrics data to test whether and how the variation in the corolla shape of the Antillean Gesneriaceae is correlated to the shape of the bills of their hummingbird pollinators.Pivotal results. We found that corolla shape is correlated with the bill shape of the hummingbird pollinators but that the nature of this relationship differed between pollination specialists and generalists. For example, corolla curvature was positively correlated with bill curvature for specialists but not for generalists.Conclusions. Our study suggests that pollinators affect the evolution of flower shape but that the nature and strength of the selective pressures are affected by the pollinator guild of the pollinators in the Antillean Gesneriaceae.

AB The present study was conducted to better understand the ecology, spatial patterns and associations of Hopea pierrei - a vulnerable plant in the Vietnam Red Book and on the IUCN's Red List - in the medium natural evergreen broadleaved forest of Phu Quoc National Park, Kien Giang Province, Vietnam. Data was collected from all woody tree individuals with a diameter at breast height (dbh) >= 2.5 cm in three 1-ha plots (100 m x 100 m). The spatial point-pattern analysis method was used to analyze the data with Programita Noviembre 2018 and R 4.1.1 software. Our findings suggested that H. pierrei was aggregated and randomly distributed at various scales in the area where it appeared. The spatial patterns of H. pierrei were influenced by environmental heterogeneity. The intraspecific associations of H. pierrei were mainly attraction associations, while its interspecific associations with sixteen dominant species were mainly independent. Processes such as seed dispersal and self-thinning are the main mechanisms underlying the spatial patterns and associations of H. pierrei. Based on the present findings, it is possible to regulate density and choose an appropriate planting-hole distance when restoring forests or planting new forests with H. pierrei and dominant species with which it grows.

AB Bird pollination in Asia is regarded as an uncommon phenomenon and, therefore, only a few investigations on mating pattern and paternity in fruits of Asian bird-pollinated plants have been conducted. Here, we examined spatial genetic structure, pollen dispersal, and multiple paternity in a natural population of Bombax ceiba (B. ceiba) (Malvaceae) in Hainan Island, South China, using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A low genetic diversity (H-e = 0.351 +/- 0.0341 and 0.389 +/- 0.043, respectively, for adults and offspring) and bottleneck effects were observed. Genetic kinship was significant within 400 m or in 1,800-3,800 m. Both the mating pattern and paternity analysis confirmed obligate xenogamy and a low multiple paternity in B. ceiba. There was a strongly negative relationship between the frequency of matings and the distance between mating pairs. The average pollen dispersal distance was 202.89 +/- 41.01 m (mean +/- SE) and the farthest distance of > 1 km was recorded. Realized mating events showed an extremely leptokurtic distribution within 1,200 m, suggesting that the pollen dispersal distance was consistent with the optimal foraging theory of generalist birds such as Zosterops spp. and Pycnonotus spp. Paternity per tree ranged from two to six and the average effective number of pollen donors per maternal plant was 3.773, suggesting a low level of paternity diversity as compared to other bird-pollinated plants. We concluded that optimal foraging behavior by generalist birds could explain the leptokurtic pollen dispersal distribution and predominantly near-neighbor matings in B. ceiba. The limited pollen dispersal distance and low multiple paternity were consistent with low fruit setting rate (3.27 +/- 0.93%) in this self-incompatible tree, which was caused mainly by the restricted flight distance of birds and human disturbances. Low genetic diversity and significant spatial genetic structure might have largely resulted from logging and human collection of fruits.

TI Rewarding More Is Better for Soliciting Help, Yet More So for Cash Than

AB Heyman and Ariely (2004) demonstrated that the expected effectiveness of soliciting help varied depending on the "market", a money market represented by cash rewards versus a social market represented by goods as rewards. They showed that, as cash rewards increase, individuals expected others to be more willing to help, yet, when offering social goods as rewards such as candy, expected willingness to help was insensitive to rewards' monetary worth. We conducted two pre-registered replication studies (total: N = 3302, MTurk/Prolific) of Study 1 in Heyman and Ariely (2004) and found support for one of their main claims that people are more sensitive to worth when the reward is cash than goods. However, the rewards' monetary worth impacted expected willingness to help even in social markets, deviating from the original findings. Extensions further compared between-subject and within-subject designs, examined perceived affect (joy and regret), and added a new control condition. We concluded that higher compensation is generally perceived as better when soliciting help, yet more so for the money market cash rewards than for the social market goods rewards.

AB Purpose This article develops a viable means of assessment of the suitability for disposal of hundreds of national government offices in Jakarta as a facet of the relocation of Indonesia's capital from Java to Borneo. Design/methodology/approach A "disposal assessment model", based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and a bespoke model of office adaptation, is constructed and applied to the population of to-be-vacated public office buildings in Jakarta. Findings In this initial demonstration mode, the disposal assessment model is tested on a live dataset and found able not only to rank buildings for disposal against stated objectives but also to incorporate more complex variables and lead into other forms of business analysis. Practical implications A fit-for-purpose model is shown capable of assisting decision-makers involved in major asset disposal, while also accounting for the stances of project stakeholders. Social implications The model offers the possibility to evaluate and, likely, optimise net social benefit for Jakarta and Indonesia both quantitatively and qualitatively. Originality/value The disposal assessment model builds on prior work in operations research and property management to develop a new construct applicable to a novel asset issue of massive proportions.

AB In the tropical rainforest of Amazonia, phosphorus (P) is one of the main nutrients controlling forest dynamics, but its effects on the future of the forest biomass carbon (C) storage under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations remain uncertain. Soils in vast areas of Amazonia are P-impoverished, and little is known about the variation or plasticity in plant P-use and -acquisition strategies across space and time, hampering the accuracy of projections in vegetation models. Here, we synthesize current knowledge of leaf P resorption, fine-root P foraging, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, and root acid phosphatase and organic acid exudation and discuss how these strategies vary with soil P concentrations and in response to elevated atmospheric CO2. We identify knowledge gaps and suggest ways forward to fill those gaps. Additionally, we propose a conceptual framework for the variations in plant P-use and -acquisition strategies along soil P gradients of Amazonia. We suggest that in soils with intermediate to high P concentrations, at the plant community level, investments are primarily directed to P foraging strategies via roots and arbuscular mycorrhizas, whereas in soils with intermediate to low P concentrations, investments shift to prioritize leaf P resorption and mining strategies via phosphatases and organic acids.

AB Ant suppression experiments have emerged as a powerful method for assessing the role of ants in ecosystems. However, traditional methods have been limited to canopy ants, and not assessed the role of ants on and below ground. Recent advances have enabled whole-ecosystem ant suppression in large plots, but large-scale experiments are not always feasible. Here, we develop a small-scale, whole-ecosystem suppression method. We compare techniques for monitoring suppression experiments, and assess whether habitat complexity in oil palm influences our method's effectiveness. We conducted ant suppression experiments in oil palm agroforestry in Sumatra, Indonesia. We used targeted poison baits, a physical barrier and canopy isolation to suppress ants in 4 m radius arenas around single palms. We sequentially tested three suppression methods that increased in intensity over 18 months. We sampled ant abundance before and after suppression by fogging, using pitfall traps and extracting soil monoliths. We also monitored ants throughout the experiment by baiting. We tested the soil for residual poison and monitored other invertebrates (Araneae, Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Chilopoda) to test for cross-contamination. Plots were established under four oil palm management treatments that varied in their habitat complexity: reduced, intermediate and high understorey complexity treatments in mature plantation, and a recently replanted plantation. Post-treatment ant abundance was 92% lower in suppression than control plots. Only the most intensive suppression method, which ran for the final 9 months, worked. Baiting rarely reflected the other monitoring methods. The treatment negatively affected Orthoptera, but not other taxa. There was no residual poison in the soil. Coleoptera abundance increased in suppression plots post-treatment, potentially due to reduced competition with ants. Our findings were consistent across management treatments. We developed a whole-ecosystem method for suppressing ants on a small scale in oil palm plantations. Our method represents a significant advance; previous reductions in ant abundance have not exceeded 38%. We provide the first example of ants being experimentally suppressed belowground. Baiting alone is not adequate for assessing suppression effectiveness, and testing a range of taxa for confounding impacts is important. Our study can act as a blueprint for developing suppression methods for other taxa, which offer unique insights into community ecology.

AB 1. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has altered biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functioning. As a key process involved in carbon and nutrient cycles in terrestrial ecosystems, litter decomposition is sensitive to external N inputs. However, it remains unclear how the interactions of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, soil biodiversity (bacteria, fungi and invertebrates) and conventional drivers (e.g. litter chemistry and microbial activities) regulate the responses of litter decomposition to continuous N inputs.
   2. Based on a multilevel N addition experimental platform, we conducted a 2-year litter decomposition experiment to examine the relative importance of N-induced changes in biotic and abiotic factors in mediating changes in the decomposition rates of four litter types (three representative species and their mixture) along an experimental N gradient in a Tibetan alpine steppe.
   3. Our results showed that litter decomposition rates exhibited a consistent decrease in response to N enrichment among all species and their mixture. The slowed decomposition rates with increasing N addition were associated with N-induced reductions in UV radiation and soil bacterial diversity. An additional UV radiation manipulative experiment further confirmed that photodegradation had strong effects on plant litter decomposition at our study site.
   4. These results demonstrated that N-induced declines in UV radiation and soil bacterial diversity inhibited litter decomposition, challenging the traditional view that changes in litter chemistry and microbial activities determine the responses of litter decomposition to external N inputs.

AB Invertebrates are important for restoration processes as they are key drivers of many landscape-scale ecosystem functions; including pollination, nutrient cycling and soil formation. However, invertebrates are often overlooked in restoration monitoring because they are highly diverse, poorly described, and time-consuming to survey, and require increasingly scarce taxonomic expertise to enable identification. DNA metabarcoding is a relatively new tool for rapid survey that is able to address some of these concerns, and provide information about the taxa with which invertebrates are interacting via food webs and habitat. Here, we evaluate how invertebrate communities may be used to determine ecosystem trajectories during restoration. We collected ground-dwelling and airborne invertebrates across chronosequences of mine-site restoration in three ecologically disparate locations in Western Australia and identified invertebrate and plant communities using DNA metabarcoding. Ground-dwelling invertebrates showed the clearest restoration signals, with communities becoming more similar to reference communities over time. These patterns were weaker in airborne invertebrates, which have higher dispersal abilities and therefore less local fidelity to environmental conditions. Although we detected directional changes in community composition indicative of invertebrate recovery, patterns observed were inconsistent between study locations. The inclusion of plant assays allowed identification of plant species, as well as potential food sources and habitat. We demonstrate that DNA metabarcoding of invertebrate communities can be used to evaluate restoration trajectories. Testing and incorporating new monitoring techniques such as DNA metabarcoding is critical to improving restoration outcomes.

AB Restoration of tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) landscapes is urgently required. Assisting the regeneration of endangered and shade tolerant tree species is essential for both the recovery of this vulnerable group and of ecological processes. However, there is limited species-specific information regarding tree performance under different disturbance conditions with which to implement effective interventions. We assessed the performance of shade tolerant tree seedlings in restoration plantings under different disturbance settings and determined whether leaf mass area (LMA) and leaf dry mass content (LDMC)-functional traits typically associated with resource capture or stress tolerance-could serve as predictors of survival and growth among species. Since conservative leaf morphological traits can maximize survival, we expected species with higher LMA and LDMC to present higher survival. For a set of eight native cloud forest species, a total of 2,202 seedlings were planted in four pastures, five secondary forests and three forests subjected to traditional selective logging, in TMCF landscapes in Eastern Mexico. Seedling survival was high after 3 years: 62% in pastures, 80% in secondary forests and 88% in logged forests. Growth rates were lowest in pastures, followed by secondary forests and highest in logged forests. LMA was a strong predictor of seedling survival in all of the environments; tree species with higher LMA presented greater survival. LDMC was related to seedling survival in the three environments, although to a lesser extent than LMA. In the pastures, higher LMA and LDMC were linked to lower growth. Synthesis and applications. This study supports the potential of shade tolerant tree species in restoration efforts to assist the recovery of this important functional group and to accelerate succession across altered environments. Our results support the notion that conservative leaf functional traits are linked to a higher probability of survival, not only in the shaded understorey, but also under high solar radiation in transformed habitats. Leaf mass area (LMA) in particular is a reliable predictor of seedling survival for shade tolerant species. Species selection based on LMA could thus improve restoration initiative outcomes: tree species with high LMA present higher survival probability and can be introduced into pastures, secondary forests and selectively logged forests.

AB Coppice forest management impacts understorey vegetation. This is particularly true for habitat specialists (priority elements in conservation) who prefer closed canopy conditions associated with mature forests. Most trait-based studies of forest understorey focus on interspecific differences, which neglect the role of intraspecific variability. Here, we tackled this issue by examining how leaf traits respond (intra- and inter-specifically) to different stages of stand maturity for habitat specialist and generalist species. We measured the leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) for 1,932 individuals belonging to 71 understorey species in 18 beech coppice forests grouped in three stages of stand maturity (i.e., post-logging, n = 5; recovering, n = 5; old stands, n = 8). We assessed leaf trait variation across stages of forest maturity for the entire community, and for specialists and generalists separately using monotonic trend tests. Then, we disentangled the proportion of variation attributable to intraspecific variability and interspecific differences of specialists and generalists using variance decomposition. We found significant positive trends in community-level SLA and negative ones in LDMC with increasing stand maturity. Beech forest understorey specialists (but not generalists) explained these patterns. The contribution of intra- and inter-specific components was dependent upon the trait under consideration and habitat specialization. For specialists, intraspecific variability was significant for all leaf traits and could explain 15.2% of model variance for SLA, 4.2% for LA and 3.1% for LDMC along the stand maturity gradient. Interspecific differences were significant for LDMC (29.8% of variance explained) and SLA (7.6%). For generalists, intraspecific variability was not significant; interspecific differences were significant for LA and explained 26.2 % of variability along the stand maturity gradient. We revealed that the maturity of coppice stands have different effects on generalist and specialist species. Habitat specialists are responsive to subtle changes in forest stand age both intra- and interspecifically, with their prevalence being function- and trait-dependent. Interspecific differences explained most of the LDMC (resource conservation) variance, while intraspecific variability accounted most of the SLA (light capture) variance. Generalists contribute to communitylevel trait variation, yet these species were less responsive to changes in forest stand age. To assess the impact of forest management on understories and refine the effectiveness of monitoring plans, we recommend focusing on habitat specialists, ideally including both trait variability within- and among-species.

Visual records were made while surveying through linear transections in a forest area associated with two important rivers that form the Xingu River in the central region of Mato Grosso State, Brazil. Females were observed with infants in the dry and rainy seasons. Other primate species locally recorded are Alouatta caraya, Mico emiliae, Plecturocebus vieirai, and Sapajus libidinosus. Our records demonstrate the importance of continuous forest areas in maintaining the primate community in landscapes modified by agribusiness activities.

AB Biologists have long been fascinated by the processes that give rise to phenotypic complexity of organisms, yet whether there exist geographical hotspots of phenotypic complexity remains poorly explored. Phenotypic complexity can be readily observed in ant colonies, which are superorganisms with morphologically differentiated queen and worker castes analogous to the germline and soma of multicellular organisms. Several ant species have evolved 'worker polymorphism', where workers in a single colony show quantifiable differences in size and head-to-body scaling. Here, we use 256 754 occurrence points from 8990 ant species to investigate the geography of worker polymorphism. We show that arid regions of the world are the hotspots of superorganism complexity. Tropical savannahs and deserts, which are typically species-poor relative to tropical or even temperate forests, harbour the highest densities of polymorphic ants. We discuss the possible adaptive advantages that worker polymorphism provides in arid environments. Our work may provide a window into the environmental conditions that promote the emergence of highly complex phenotypes.

AB The world's terrestrial biomes are broadly classified according to the dominant plant growth forms that define ecosystem structure and processes. Although the abundance and distribution of different plant growth forms can be strongly determined by factors such as climate and soil composition, large mammalian herbivores have a strong impact on plant communities, thus defaunation (the local or functional extinction of large animals) has the potential to alter the compositional structure of plant growth forms in natural ecosystems. Tropical rainforests sustain a high diversity of growth forms, including trees, palms, lianas, shrubs, herbs and bamboos, all of which play important ecosystem functions. Here, we experimentally evaluate how large mammalian herbivores affect the dominance, diversity and coexistence of these major tropical forest plant growth forms, by monitoring communities of saplings on the understorey in 43 paired exclusion plots in a long-term replicated exclusion experiment in the understorey of the Atlantic forest of Brazil. Over the course of 10 years large herbivore exclusion decreased diversity among growth forms, increased the absolute abundance of palms and trees (22% and 38% respectively) and increased the diversity of species within these two groups, to the detriment of other growth forms. Furthermore, all pairwise relationships between growth forms were positive on plots where herbivores had access, whereas several strong negative relationships emerged in plots where herbivores were excluded. This occurred despite strong background directional temporal trends affecting plant communities in both experimental treatments across the region. Synthesis. Our work indicates that the defaunation alters growth form dominance by favouring palms and trees while eroding diversity among growth forms and coexistence on a temporal scale. Large herbivore mammals promote diversity among growth forms, preventing the hyper-dominance of trees and palms, yet without supressing the diversity of species within growth forms. We argue that large herbivore mammals affect growth forms through several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, including herbivory, seed dispersal and physical disturbance, as well as differential effects linked to the morphological and physiological adaptations of growth forms. We conclude that defaunation might lead to profound impacts on important ecosystem functions underpinned by growth form diversity, and result in vertical and horizontal structural simplification of tropical rainforests.

AB Populations are embedded in communities, but despite their potential to affect individual fitness, it is unknown whether and how species interactions evolve in communities. Evolutionary outcomes are likely more complex in natural communities because (a) the evolution of interactions may not be evenly distributed among all community members and (b) coevolution is conditional on the environmental conditions within which interactions are playing out. To test the evolution of interaction strengths in natural communities, we performed two common garden experiments in grassland communities in Northern California. In each garden, we transplanted individuals of four populations (one local, three foreign) of an annual invasive grass Bromus hordeaceus into natural communities, characterized the interaction neighbourhood around each focal individual, and quantified individual fitness. This method allowed us to fit multispecies competition models to fitness data, estimating interaction strengths between focal B. hordeaceus populations and each of seven species that were common in the interaction neighbourhoods, in each garden. We found that interaction strengths significantly differed among local and foreign source populations, but the direction and magnitude of evolution differed among common gardens and among neighbour species-in neither garden were interactions experienced more strongly by foreign populations compared to local populations. The fitness of local populations (relative to foreign populations) decreased when neighbours were removed, strongly enough in one garden to cause strong local maladaptation, and the local population did not perform the best in either garden. Synthesis. Together, our results demonstrate how species interactions evolve to determine fitness in ecological communities, providing a richer view of adaptation in natural systems. In our study, this richness included the unique challenges populations face in nature: uneven abundances and a diffuseness of species interactions, nonlinear density effects on fitness, and evidence of (mal)adaptation that is conditional on local conditions. We conclude by hypothesizing the causes and consequences of challenges to adaptation and how they help identify priority areas for the field.

AB Plant functioning in response to the environment is an important issue for vegetation reassembly of degraded lands because of both low and excessive sunlight influence the performance of young plants. However, how shade-tolerant tree species deal with excess of light energy remains unclear due to the contrasting results among studies and the subjective classifications of species shade tolerance. From a quantitative classification of shade tolerance of 12 tropical tree species planted in the field under contrasting light conditions, we hypothesized that shade-tolerant species are capable of effective long-term acclimation to high-light conditions. Plant size and survival of species were measured at the beginning and 38 months after planting. We also measured functional traits associated with carbon economy and non-photochemical energy dissipation. Under high-light condition, more light-demanding species showed higher growth rates associated with higher values of functional traits that improve the CO2 assimilation capacity. By contrast, more shade-tolerant species showed higher survival that was associated with higher values of qN, leaf K contents and leaf thickness. The concomitant increase in these traits, as well as their greater plasticity to light in WUEi, F-v/F-m and qN, confers on these species strong photoprotection to avoid high-light stress and to persist under open field conditions. The results challenge the common assumption that only fast-growing and light-demanding tree species are suitable for vegetation reassembly in full sunlight conditions and to improve the environmental conditions for other species.

AB Although edge influence has been studied extensively, there is no consensus on how insect communities respond to edge environments. Studies highlight the importance of an experimental design that considers samples in adjacent matrix and the distance from the edge as a continuous factor. We sampled ants along edges composed by Cerrado vegetation and three types of crop matrix: sugarcane, eucalyptus and pasture. We assessed the response patterns of ant communities to edge contrast and distance using linear models. Ant richness increases linearly towards Cerrado core in edges composed by sugarcane, while it did not change along edges composed by eucalyptus. In both cases, ant composition on both sides of these edges tended to be highly different. In pasture, ant richness is higher than Cerrado, while the composition changes gradually along this edge, indicating that low contrast edges imply a smoother effect of edge influence on communities. Our results suggest that edge influence is dependent on the structural contrast between the habitats that compose the edges. We highlight the importance of the two-sided approach on edge studies and the use of more than a single biodiversity dimension to provide an accurate picture of edge influence on insect communities.

AB Changes in riparian vegetation directly affect the entry of allochthonous material into aquatic systems, which is the main source of food and energy for different functional feeding groups (FFG) of aquatic insects that play important ecological roles in these ecosystems. Thus, reducing the fragmentation of organic matter affecting the energy flow and food network, interfering with important ecosystem processes that sustain biodiversity. We assess the effects of landscape changes on the composition of the FFG of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) communities in streams from the Eastern Amazon, a region that exhibits a mosaic of multiple land uses with the prevalence of pastures. We expected that shredders and collectors (gatherers and filterers), naturally prevalent in preserved first-order streams, would be more affected by the loss of riparian vegetation due to their higher dependence on allochthonous food sources than other FFG. We sampled 30 Amazonian streams (1st to 3rd orders) located in the Capim River Basin, Paragominas, Para, Brazil. The environmental predictors affected the FFG of EPT. Shredders, collector-gatherer, and predators were predominant in streams with more forests that had more living trees in the channel. On the other hand, collector-filter were predominant in streams with more exposed soil and higher water temperatures. We conclude that the preservation of riparian zones is important for the preservation of FFG of EPT and highlighting the effectiveness of using these groups as a tool for biomonitoring environmental quality. Implications for insect conservation Our results show that FFG of EPT are affected by environmental conditions. Therefore, the landscape changes caused by the deforestation of the riparian zone imply changes in the composition of the FFG of EPT communities.

AB Context Climate and landscape structure are predicted to affect pollination and plant reproduction but few studies have tested how these stressors interact. Objectives Using a 9-year dataset we tested whether climate interacts synergistically with forest loss and fragmentation to affect pollination and subsequent reproduction in a tropical understory herb, Heliconia tortuosa. We hypothesized that hot and/or dry conditions might amplify effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, leading to declines in plant reproduction. Methods We collected data on pollen tubes, fruit, and seeds of H. tortuosa in a mensurative experiment representing gradients in forest amount and patch size (N = 40 focal-patch landscapes). We modeled these reproductive metrics as a function of landscape composition, configuration, precipitation, temperature, and statistical interactions among these variables. Results We found little support for synergistic landscape and climate effects. However, H. tortuosa reproduction decreased in wet years, small patches, and, counterintuitively, in landscapes with high forest cover. We speculate that reproduction improved in deforested landscapes because the lack of surrounding forest constrains hummingbird movement, and therefore visitation is focused on plants that remain. Conclusion Although we did not detect synergistic effects, we emphasize the importance of additive effects of climate and landscape structure on plant reproduction. Wet years, small patches, and heavily forested landscapes appear to have negative consequences for Heliconia reproduction. Decline in this common species is likely to have cascading consequences for hummingbird pollinators, and subsequently other hummingbird-dependent plant species.

AB The Peruvian gracile mouse opossum (Gracilinanus peruanus) is known from scattered localities. Very little information is available on its natural history, habitat requirements and geographic distribution. Also, its conservation status has never been evaluated. We provide a new hypothesis on its distribution limits using species distribution models (SDM), and evaluate for the first time the conservation status of the species. The SDM suggested high suitability for G. peruanus in the Brazilian Shield, indicating continuous suitable areas for the species between the disjunct areas of western Brazil and Bolivia/Peru. Voucher records show that Teles Pires River is not a geographic barrier and the eastern limits still need to be delimited. To the south, the species appears to be limited by the Pantanal wetlands and the Chaco biome, and to the west by the Andes mountains. We suggest that G. peruanus should be globally classified as 'Least Concern.' Nevertheless, the species may be considered as Near Threatened in a near future in Brazil, mainly because it occurs in an area with high rates of deforestation and habitat loss in the Cerrado of western Brazil, thus reinforcing the importance of protecting gallery forests to forest dweller species.

AB Nest architecture plays a fundamental role in the adaptation of ants to their habitat, favoring the action of economically important species. Ectatomma ruidum sp. 2 (ruidum species complex) is a biological control agent in Neotropical agroecosystems, exhibiting high bioturbation impact due to high nest densities. The architecture and composition of 152 nests were studied in two Andean populations of southwestern Colombia, 24 of them being cast using the paraffin wax technique. Nest entrance was a single, circular, 4 mm hole at ground level, without any special external structure, connected to a single vertical tunnel communicating with successive half ellipsoidal chambers. Nests were extremely shallow (depth range: 28.7-35.4 cm), with an average of six chambers and an overall volume of 92.2 cm(3) per nest. The deeper the chamber, the smaller its volume. Nest building was independent of plants or roots, and no surface or underground physical connections were found between neighboring nests. Few nests possessed a queen, and neither ergatoids nor microgynes were recorded. Despite significant interactions between localities and the number of both males and workers, queen presence had an overall highly positive effect on the number of workers and larvae and a negative one on the number of gynes. Overall, the studied Colombian populations of E. ruidum sp. 2 retained the simple nest structure described for other species of this species complex and for colonies of the same species from other geographical areas, though they constrasted in their extreme shallowness. Our data suggest that E. ruidum sp. 2, at the local level, does not follow the usual monodomic pattern of this species with facultative polygyny but, rather, has a polydomic pattern with monogyny, perhaps related to the extreme shallowness of the nests due to soil structure, which could significantly enhance the queen's reproductive inhibition previously reported for this species.

Application of syndemic theory and epidemiological methods on patient records at Hospital Schweitzer, the central hospital of the region, explain how a seemingly simple diagnosis of chronic gastrointestinal distress belied a complex web of worsening biological and social outcomes for laborers in the tropical forests of central Gabon. An analysis of the syndemic suffering of GI patients reveals how the dysentery pathogen became tied to the peaks and valleys of the colonial economy, and in particular, the colonial extraction of tropical hardwoods. These processes culminated in the summer of 1929 when the highest number of timber exports coincided with the deadliest months of dysentery outbreak for the patient population at Hospital Schweitzer. This case study proposes syndemics as an effective theoretical framework to research historical precedents of the entanglement of people, pathogens, and illness.

AB Fake controversies have influenced policy making on health and environmental issues for decades, resulting in major implementation setbacks worldwide. As a case study, in this paper we examine fake controversies produced by a small group of active Brazilian researchers that have seriously impacted environmental conservation, particularly in issues related to deforestation and climate change. Based on the literature, we develop a typology of strategies deployed in fake controversies, which include manufacturing uncertainty, misusing scientific credentials, and disregarding scientific literature. Afterwards, we examine the influence of this group of contrarians at the National Congress. We then analyze the fake controversies promoted by these contrarians and argue that, to properly understand them, we need to consider a strategy so far overlooked in the literature: the manufacture of "pseudo-facts", namely, affirmations at odds with the established literature but that strives to appear as scientific facts. Unlike other contexts, in which contrarians have mainly sought to cast doubt on consensual issues by arguing that there are still considerable uncertainties surrounding them, in Brazil pseudo-facts on deforestation have been produced and published outside the peer-reviewed literature. We conclude the study with recommendations on how to oppose fake scientific controversies that threaten environmental conservation in general.

AB Garter snakes (Thamnophis) are a successful group of natricines endemic to North America. They have become important natural models for ecological and evolutionary research, yet prior efforts to resolve phylogenetic relationships have resulted in conflicting topologies and weak support for certain relationships. Here, we use genomic data generated with a reduced representation double-digest RADseq approach to reassess evolutionary relationships across Thamnophis. We then use the resulting phylogeny to better understand how biogeography and feeding ecology have influenced lineage diversification and morphological evolution. We recovered highly congruent and strongly supported topologies from maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, but some discordance with a multispecies coalescent approach. All phylogenomic estimates split Thamnophis into two clades largely defined by northern and southern North American species. Divergence time estimates and biogeographic analyses indicate a mid-Miocene origin of Thamnophis in Mexico. In addition, historic vicariant events thought to explain biogeographic patterns in other lineages (e.g., Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Rocky Mountain Range, and Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt) appear to have influenced patterns of diversification in Thamnophis as well. Analyses of morphological traits associated with feeding ecology showed moderate to strong phylogenetic signal. Nevertheless, phylogenetic ANOVA suggested significant differences in certain cranial morphologies between aquatic specialists and garter snakes that are terrestrial-aquatic generalists, independent of evolutionary history. Our new estimate of Thamnophis phylogeny yields an improved understanding of the biogeographic history and morphological evolution of garter snakes, and provides a robust framework for future research on these snakes.

AB The Cerrado biome is being gradually reduced. Remote sensing has been widely used to investigate spatio-temporal changes in the landscape, which are frequently limited to mapping with orbital sensors, while the Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) proved to be advantageous in terms of spatial resolution and the application of advanced digital processing techniques. In this study, we investigated a vereda (humid area) of a conservation unit in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) was applied to images obtained by RPAS to distinguish the phytophysiognomies of plant strata from the vereda and to diagnose the recovery of native and invasive vegetation after prescribed burning. The study was carried out in the following five stages: biomass collection; quality analysis of the land cover; phytosociological survey; collection of control points using a GNSS receiver (type L1/L2); and the capture of aerial images with an RGB camera coupled to a DJI Phantom 4 Pro, which was performed through overflights in three different periods. Object-Based Image Analysis was subsequently performed using the Nearest Neighbor classifier combined with Feature Space Optimization, obtaining classifications with accuracy and Kappa indexes greater than 80% and 0.80, respectively. The results of image processing allowed us to infer that fire acted as a renewing agent for native vegetation and as an inhibiting agent for invasive vegetation. The classification analyses combined with the phytosociological analysis allowed us to infer that the vereda is in the process of maturation. Therefore, the study demonstrated the potential of data obtained by RPAS for the diagnosis and analysis of vegetation dynamics in small wetlands submitted to Integrated Fire Management (IFM).

ID WILD; DIET; CHINA
AB Simple Summary Captivity is a common conservation method for endangered animals. However, a growing number of recent studies have shown that some animals in captivity might be in sub-health condition. The gut microbiota has been described as a complex, interactive internal system that has effects on diseases of the host with many interactions, and the occurrence of certain diseases is accompanied by changes and disorder of gut microbiota. We used16S rRNA sequencing technology and a mathematical model to find differences in gut microbiota composition and assembly processes. The results show that captivity might be unfavorable for white-lipped deer by shifting the gut microbiota composition and assembly process. White-lipped deer (Cervus albirostris) is a nationally protected wild animal species in China, as well as a unique and endangered species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Captivity may alleviate the pressure from poaching and contribute to the repopulation and conservation of the population in the wild. The gut microbiota is described as a complex, interactive internal system that has effects on diseases of the host, with many interactions. However, the influence of captivity on the composition and assembly process of gut microbiota in white-lipped deer is unclear. This study applied high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing technology to determine differences in the gut microbiota between captive (CW) and wild (WW) white-lipped deer. We used the null model, neutral community model, and niche width to identify whether captivity affects the composition and assembly process of gut microbiota. The results show that WW has a higher number of Firmicutes and a lower number of Bacteroidetes compared with CW at the phylum level, and it has more opportunistic pathogens and specific decomposition bacteria at the genus level. Principal coordinate analysis also indicated significant differences in the composition and function of gut microbiota in CW and WW. Moreover, the results reveal that captivity shifts the ecological assembly process of gut microbiota by raising the contribution of deterministic processes. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that captivity might potentially have an unfavorable effect on white-lipped deer by continually exerting selective pressure.

AB One of the most important drivers for the coexistence of plant species is the resource heterogeneity of a certain environment, and several studies in different ecosystems have supported this resource heterogeneity-diversity hypothesis. However, to date, only a few studies have measured heterogeneity of light and soil resources below forest canopies to investigate their influence on understory plant species richness. Here, we aim to determine (1) the influence of forest stand structural complexity on the heterogeneity of light and soil resources below the forest canopy and (2) whether heterogeneity of resources increases understory plant species richness. Measures of stand structural complexity were obtained through inventories and remote sensing techniques in 135 1-ha study plots of temperate forests, established along a gradient of forest structural complexity. We measured light intensity and soil chemical properties on six 25 m(2) subplots on each of these 135 plots and surveyed understory vegetation. We calculated the coefficient of variation of light and soil parameters to obtain measures of resource heterogeneity and determined understory plant species richness at plot level. Spatial heterogeneity of light and of soil pH increased with higher stand structural complexity, although heterogeneity of soil pH did not increase in conditions of generally high levels of light availability. Increasing light heterogeneity was also associated with increasing understory plant species richness. However, light heterogeneity had no such effects in conditions where soil resource heterogeneity (variation in soil C:N ratios) was low. Our results support the resource heterogeneity-diversity hypothesis for temperate forest understory at the stand scale. Our results also highlight the importance of interaction effects between the heterogeneity of both light and soil resources in determining plant species richness.

AB The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) is severely deforested and the remaining forest fragments are generally reduced and disconnected. Euterpe edulis (Arecaceae) is a native AF palm rarely found in forest fragments inserted in more deforested landscapes. We investigate how forest fragments inserted in landscapes with different levels of deforestation influence both the genetic diversity and physiological traits of E. edulis progenies. For this, we evaluate the genetic diversity and physiological variables associated with carbon balance at leaf and whole-plant leaf scales of E. edulis progenies to light availability. We collected fruits from six mother plants, being three from a forest fragment inserted in a more forested landscape (83% of forest cover) and three from a forest fragment inserted in a more deforested landscape (55% of forest cover). The seeds were germinated and, after reaching the juvenile stage, 17 microsatellite markers were used to perform a genetic diversity analysis. The progenies were subjected to 18 light treatments (0.72-22.1 mol photons m(-2) day(-1)) for the analysis of the carbon balance at leaf and whole-plant scales. We found that the origin of the mother plant proved to affect some genetic parameters, since progenies from mother plants of a forest fragment inserted in the more forested landscape had a greater number of private and effective alleles. In addition, progenies from this forest fragment had a great acclimation capacity to the light levels, with higher growth rates and vigor. Our results provide evidence that conservation actions are necessary for this species, including selecting and replanting progenies from the forest fragments inserted in more forested landscapes. It could be a way for alternative genotypes to raise the levels of alleles and thus avoid the collapse of these populations in fragments inserted in deforested landscapes where a low number of adult and juvenile individuals are found.

AB Coexistence of similar species can be influenced by the intensity of interspecific interactions, which often depends on the availability of limiting resources. Habitat availability varies strongly with tidal phase in many intertidal ecosystems, potentially affecting interspecific interaction strength, particularly for mobile species. Four closely related species of highly mobile intertidal detritivores (talitrid amphipods Megalorchestia californiana, M. corniculata, M. benedicti, M. minor) inhabit sandy beaches in southern California, where they consume wave-cast macroalgal wrack originating on coastal reefs. Their coexistence suggests that mechanisms, such as niche separation, are operating to weaken competition among these species. To evaluate this possibility, we explored how tidal phase may mediate temporal and spatial patterns of habitat use among these closely related congeners. We hypothesized that neap tides that reduce intertidal habitat would strengthen temporal separation between species, whereas spatial separation would be greater during spring tides when more habitat is available. We investigated these questions during spring and neap tide phases using (1) comparisons of intertidal distributions of burrowed amphipods and (2) observations of surface activity of amphipods from pitfall traps and mesocosms. We found significant effects of tide phase and species identity on mean intertidal positions and separation of burrowed amphipods. Intertidal distributions of the four species overlapped during neap tide and were significantly separated during spring tide when more intertidal habitat was available. Surface activity patterns differed among species and were more widely separated in time during neap tide than during spring tide. Consequently, the cumulative activity time of all species on neap tides was twice that observed during spring tides. Our findings suggest that mobile intertidal species, like these sympatric talitrid amphipods, can avoid interspecific competition by shifting their activity patterns with tide phase and beach condition. As rising sea levels reduce beach habitat, interspecific competition among these important intertidal consumers may increasingly influence their behavior and coexistence.

AB Cord-forming (CF) fungi are found worldwide; however, tropical CF fungi are poorly documented. They play an essential role in forest ecosystems by interconnecting nutrient resources and aiding in the decomposition of plant matter and woody litter. CF fungi samples were collected from two forest conservation sites in the Sabah region of Malaysian Borneo. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the ribosomal rRNA gene array 18S to 28S region from cords collected placed all of the collected specimens in Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycetes), specifically within the orders Trechisporales, Phallales, Hymenochaetales, Polyporales, and Agaricales. Comparison of the cord-derived sequences against GenBank and UNITE sequence databases, as well as phylogenetic analyses, revealed they were all novel sequences types. Many of these novel lineages were found to be closely related to other basidiomycetes commonly found in tropical forests, suggesting a large undiscovered tropical fungal diversity in Borneo that has been detected independently of sampling fruiting bodies. We show how these sequence types relate to the morphologies of the cords from which they were sampled. We also highlight how rapid, small-scale sampling can be a useful tool as an easy and relatively unbiased way of collecting data on cord-forming fungi in difficult-to-access, complex forest environments, independently of locating and sampling sporophores.

AB Plant growth is almost always limited by light availability and competition. However, plants are generally plastic and can change their morphology and biomass allocation to optimize growth under suboptimal conditions. We set up a controlled pot experiment with three light availability levels (10%, 20%, and 50%) to study the effect of light and competition on the biomass allocation and leaf morphology in monospecific and mixed pots of recently planted European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) saplings using a quantile regression model. Specific leaf area (SLA) showed the strongest reaction and increased with decreasing light availability. Woody aboveground mass fraction (AMF) increased with decreasing light availability, but the effect of light on biomass allocation was less pronounced than on SLA. The SLA, woody AMF, and root mass fraction (RMF) of the two conifer species and European beech varied greatly, with European beech having a higher SLA and RMF than the two conifer species. The associated effect of plant size on biomass allocation was small, and the strength of the association was not meaningful on a practical level. The competitor's effect on biomass allocation was minor overall and only present for some species, suggesting that species' functional dissimilarity does not greatly affect allocational patterns in early tree development stages.

AB Pheidole fallax is one the most abundant ants in sites where coal mines have undergone rehabilitation and in forests without mine intervention. The impact that this species may have as an ecosystem engineer needs to be assessed. We aimed to test whether P. fallax nests have an effect on soil chemical properties, to characterize the organic debris found in the refuse piles, and to describe nest architecture as proxy of the bioturbation effect. The study was carried out in a coal mine in Colombia, in sites with 16 and 20 years of rehabilitation. Samples were taken from inside the nests, from the external refuse pile, and from a control treatment one meter away from the nest. The three sample types were subjected to chemical analysis and near-infrared spectra (NIRS). The biomass of items from the 20-year site was significantly greater, and P. fallax use food resources of different trophic levels, with arthropods and seeds being the main items in their diet. The NIRS analysis enabled us to distinguish the origin of the sample: refuse pile, interior of nest, or control soil. No statistical differences were found between the soil of the nests and control soil. High contents of organic matter and other parameters contributed to the soil nutrient pool through accumulation of organic debris in the refuse piles. Nest molds presented an asymmetric architecture, with mean volume ranging from 30 to 105.7 cm(3) and an average of 11.8 chambers per nest. The construction and maintenance of nests may play an important role in the reestablishment of ecological and hydrological processes, such as bioturbation and water infiltration, respectively.

AB Given the difficulties for rapid biodiversity assessments in understudied regions, DNA barcoding appears as a suitable alternative. Still, this approach relies heavily on accurate reference sequence databases for correct taxonomic assignments. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of matK, rbcL, and ITS regions for the identification of Myrtaceae species with emphasis on the megadiverse genus Syzygium from Sumatra, Indonesia; and analyzed the applicability of species-tree inference for species assignment using barcode markers. ITS was the most variable barcode region (42.6% of variable sites), followed by matK (25.7%), and rbcL (14.9%). In terms of assignments of sequences using the BLAST algorithm, all markers were effective for genus-level attribution. For assignments at species rank, rbcL was able to attribute 30.15% of the samples at the species level, followed by matK (26.47%), and ITS (17.21%). These results are largely related to the availability of reference sequences for Myrtaceae in the databases since for the 27 species analyzed in this study, only 8 species had reference sequences for all three barcode regions available in GenBank. The species-tree inference based on the combination of matK, rbcL, and ITS markers recovered 41% of the species as monophyletic clades with strong node support. Due to its high level of differentiation, we recommend the ITS region as the most efficient barcode marker for the identification of Syzygium, and the traditional core-barcodes (matK + rbcL) as add-on barcodes.

AB Inefficient management of protected areas (PAs) is often due to ignoring their surrounding matrix in the baseline studies, especially in wooded landscapes. In Iran, the application of landscape structure studies in protection policies and PA management is not prevalent. In this study, land cover changes in Dena Rural District (including parts of inside and outside Dena PA) have analyzed using the process of the Landsat images along with field survey two times (1989 and 2018). The landscape structural integrity was quantified based on the situation of oak forest land and its alteration. The composition and the configuration of oak forest land were assessed by metrics based on the moving extent of the Persian squirrel, Sciurus anomalus (which is an endangered focal endemic species completely dependent on the oak forest). Alterations of landscape structural integrity were compared for inside and outside Dena PA and at different altitudes. The results show connectivity loss and increased fragmentation of oak remnant patches, but this deforestation is more severe near areas facing direct human impacts and interventions. These are among attributes that are to be considered for zoning PA (such as controlling zone and training/participation zone). At higher altitudes, physical protection and strict control are more effective, while training local communities for stewardship is more essential at lower altitudes for conserving woodland integrity.

AB Land use and land cover (LULC) changes strongly affect local hydrology and sediment yields. The current study focused on a basin in the Brazilian Amazon and had the following three objectives: (1) to perform an effective diagnosis of flow and sediment yield, (2) to evaluate the impacts of LULC changes over the last 40 years on the hydro-sedimentological variables, and (3) to investigate the impacts of the possible trends or breaking points in the flow, surface runoff, and sediment yield series. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model validation showed that the simulated results were consistent with the data measured in the dynamic reproduction of flow seasonality. Furthermore, changes in LULC altered surface runoff, sediment yield, and flow according to the Mann-Kendall and Pettitt non-parametric tests. It was also observed that the sub-basins in which pastureland is predominant are more susceptible to increased surface runoff and sediment yield. According to trend and homogeneity tests, these sub-basins had break points in the time series of these variables. On the other hand, in the sub-basins whose land cover is predominantly forest, the time series is homogeneous and trendless. The current study highlighted the impacts that 40 years of LULC changes in an Amazonian basin had on hydro-sedimentological variables, which, in turn, can play an important role in changing the hydrological cycle, consequently these changes can also impact diverse human activities in the region, such as agribusiness, livestock, energy production, food security, and public water supply. Thus, it is concluded that the SWAT model is a good estimator of hydro-sedimentological processes in Amazonian basins and can be used by decision makers in the management of water and environmental resources.

AB Light and water availability are likely to vary over the lifespan of closed-canopy forest trees, with understory trees experiencing greater limitations to growth by light and canopy trees greater limitation due to drought. As drought and shade have opposing effects on isotope discrimination (Delta C-13), paired measurement of ring width and Delta C-13 can potentially be used to differentiate between water and light limitations on tree growth. We tested this approach for Cedrela trees from three tropical forests in Bolivia and Mexico that differ in rainfall and canopy structure. Using lifetime ring width and Delta C-13 data for trees of up to and over 200 years old, we assessed how controls on tree growth changed from understory to the canopy. Growth and Delta C-13 are mostly anti-correlated in the understory, but this anti-correlation disappeared or weakened when trees reached the canopy, especially at the wettest site. This indicates that understory growth variation is controlled by photosynthetic carbon assimilation due to variation in light levels. Once trees reached the canopy, inter-annual variation in growth and Delta C-13 at one of the dry sites showed positive correlations, indicating that inter-annual variation in growth is driven by variation in water stress affecting stomatal conductance. Paired analysis of ring widths and carbon isotopes provides significant insight in what environmental factors control growth over a tree's life; strong light limitations for understory trees in closed-canopy moist forests switched to drought stress for (sub)canopy trees in dry forests. We show that combined isotope and ring width measurements can significantly improve our insights in tree functioning and be used to disentangle limitations due to shade from those due to drought.

AB Absolute growth rates change with tree size and age, shifting throughout species ontogeny. The study on interspecific variation in plant traits has generated important insights into the life-history strategies and their consequences for ecosystem functioning. However, it remains unknown to what extent - and even if - species' functional traits are related to the variation in their growth trajectories. We set out to model growth trajectories of 45 woody species from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest in a secondary subtropical forest under regeneration, aiming to understand if species can be grouped by their growth patterns throughout ontogeny and if these groups could be classified in distinct ecological strategies based on key plant traits. We used a maximum likelihood estimation approach to predict growth trajectories using three ecologically relevant parameters [maximum growth rate (G(max)), diameter at maximum growth rate (D-opt), and the ontogenetic variability in growth rate (K)] followed by multivariate analyses to detect associations among phylogenetic relationships, plant traits, and growth parameters and classify species into growth pattern groups. Across species, growth trajectory parameters varied widely. The cluster analysis identified three distinct groups based on growth trajectories parameters, which were not functionally or ecologically well defined. Our findings supports the idea that traits describing plant size and tree shape, such as maximum height, canopy volume and height to diameter ratio, were generally the best predictors of species growth parameters throughout ontogeny, even though traits representing resource-use and reproductive strategies also played a significant role. Growth-trait framework can be understood as a continuum of multi-trait combinations where, at one end of the gradient, we find trees with higher growth rate and larger diameters supporting a voluminous canopy combined with lower investment in leaf tissue and smaller diaspore; at the other end, taller trees supporting a smaller canopy with higher investment in leaf tissue and longer diaspore. Ultimately, we have shown that tree architecture, leaf and reproductive traits significantly influence growth trajectory along tree ontogeny, which may be the reason why objectively grouping species based on growth-trajectories parameters is ineffective, at least in highly diverse secondary subtropical forests undergoing regeneration.

AB Worldwide, natural ecosystems have been replaced by intensive productive systems. This has led to an extreme simplification of habitat structure and loss of ecosystem heterogeneity but also might reduce the opportunities for species co-occurrence. Anthropogenic disturbances offer an opportunity to explore how the functional diversity of spiders within a highly diverse ecosystem such as a subtropical forest change under intensive productive systems such as monoculture tree plantations. It allows to study the mechanisms underlying the community re-assemblage process. Using a set of morphological and ecological traits of 259 species, the habitat filtering hypothesis was tested on spider communities inhabiting pine monocultures at different ages, where the stabilisation of habitat conditions such as vegetation complexity, maximum temperature/relative humidity and prey availability along the plantation cycle growth will promote spider colonisation of these productive areas. The conversion of native forest to pine monocultures decreased species and trait richness of spiders. Moreover, spiders from both communities differed in their identity but exhibited similar functional traits (low trait replacement). Variation in trait composition of spiders was explained by changes in vertical stratification complexity, tree density and relative humidity, rather than prey availability. The mechanistic processes structuring the spider community were not clear. Spiders from pine plantations might experience frequent changes in composition due to high species replacement levels in space and time. Because pine plantations harbour only a few species and exhibit low functional richness, the pressure for stabilisation of community composition can be low.

AB Examining community responses to habitat configuration across scales informs basic and applied models of ecosystem function. Responses to patch-scale edge effects (i.e., ecological differences between patch edges and interiors) are hypothesized to underpin the effects of landscape-scale fragmentation (i.e., mosaics of multipatch habitat and matrix). Conceptually, this appears justifiable because fragmented habitats typically have a greater proportion of edge than continuous habitats. To critically inspect whether patch-scale edge effects translate consistently (i.e., scale up) into patterns observed in fragmented landscapes, we conducted a meta-analysis on community relationships in seagrass ecosystems to synthesize evidence of edge and fragmentation effects on shoot density, faunal densities, and predation rates. We determined effect sizes by calculating log response ratios for responses within patch edges versus interiors to quantify edge effects, and fragmented versus continuous landscapes to quantify fragmentation effects. We found that both edge and fragmentation effects reduced seagrass shoot densities, although the effect of edge was statistically stronger. By contrast, fauna often exhibited higher densities in patch edges, while fragmentation responses varied directionally across taxa. Fish densities trended higher in patch edges and fragmented landscapes. Benthic fishes responded more positively than benthopelagic fishes to edge effects, although neither guild strongly responded to fragmentation. Invertebrate densities increased in patch edges and trended lower in fragmented landscapes; however, these were small effect sizes due to the offsetting responses of two dominant epifaunal guilds: decapods and smaller crustaceans. Edge and fragmentation affected predation similarly, with prey survival trending lower in patch edges and fragmented landscapes. Overall, several similarities suggested that edge effects conform with patterns of community dynamics in fragmented seagrass. However, across all metrics except fish densities, variability in fragmentation effects was twice that of edge effects. Variance patterns combined with generally stronger responses to edge than fragmentation, warrant caution in unilaterally "scaling-up" edge effects to describe fragmentation effects. Alternatively, fragmentation includes additional factors (e.g., matrix effects, patch number, mean patch size, isolation) that may enhance or offset edge effects. Fragmentation and increased edge are syndromes of habitat degradation, therefore this analysis informs mechanistic models of community change in altered terrestrial and marine systems.

AB Trapliners are pollinators that visit widely dispersed flowers along circuitous foraging routes. The evolution of traplining in hummingbirds is thought to entail morphological specialization through the reciprocal coevolution of longer bills with the long-tubed flowers of widely dispersed plant species. Specialization, such as that exhibited by traplining hummingbirds, is often viewed as both irreversible and an evolutionary dead end. We tested these predictions in a macroevolutionary framework. Specifically, we assessed the relationship between beak morphology and foraging and tested whether transitions to traplining are irreversible and lead to lower rates of diversification as predicted by the hypothesis that specialization is an evolutionary dead end. We find that there have been multiple independent transitions to traplining across the hummingbird phylogeny, but reversals have been rare or incomplete at best. Multiple independent lineages of trapliners have become morphologically specialized, convergently evolving relatively large bills for their body size. Traplining is not an evolutionary dead end however, since trapliners continue to give rise to new traplining species at a rate comparable to non-trapliners.

AB Though being fundamental to global diversity distribution, little is known about the geographic pattern of soil microorganisms across different biotas on a large scale. Here, we investigated soil prokaryotic communities from Chinese northern grasslands on a scale up to 4000 km in both alpine and temperate biotas. Prokaryotic similarities increased over geographic distance after tipping points of 1760-1920 km, generating a significant U-shape pattern. Such pattern was likely due to decreased disparities in environmental heterogeneity over geographic distance when across biotas, supported by three lines of evidences: (1) prokaryotic similarities still decreased with the environmental distance, (2) environmental selection dominated prokaryotic assembly, and (3) short-term environmental heterogeneity followed the U-shape pattern spatially, especially attributed to dissolved nutrients. In sum, these results demonstrate that environmental selection overwhelmed the geographic 'distance' effect when across biotas, overturning the previously well-accepted geographic pattern for microbes on a large scale.

AB Species loss within a microbial community can increase resource availability and spur adaptive evolution. Environmental shifts that cause species loss or fluctuations in community composition are expected to become more common, so it is important to understand the evolutionary forces that shape the stability and function of the emergent community. Here we study experimental cultures of a simple, ecologically stable community of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus plantarum, in order to understand how the presence or absence of a species impacts coexistence over evolutionary timescales. We found that evolution in coculture led to drastically altered evolutionary outcomes for L. plantarum, but not S. cerevisiae. Both monoculture- and co-culture-evolved L. plantarum evolved dozens of mutations over 925 generations of evolution, but only L. plantarum that had evolved in isolation from S. cerevisiae lost the capacity to coexist with S. cerevisiae. We find that the evolutionary loss of ecological stability corresponds with fitness differences between monoculture-evolved L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae and genetic changes that repeatedly evolve across the replicate populations of L. plantarum. This work shows how coevolution within a community can prevent destabilising evolution in individual species, thereby preserving ecological diversity and stability, despite rapid adaptation.

AB Edge effects are caused by the penetration of abiotic and biotic conditions from the nonforest matrix into forest interiors. Edge effects are particularly relevant to studies of lemur conservation biogeography due to the high levels of forest loss and fragmentation on Madagascar. Moreover, climatic seasonality has influenced many aspects of lemur evolutionary ecology (e.g., diet and ranging patterns). Although lemurs are strongly influenced by seasonality and edge habitats are an increasingly dominant feature of their forest habitats, there are few data on whether or not any species exhibit seasonal responses to edge effects. In this study, we evaluated for the first time whether four lemur species (Avahi peyrierasi, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus ranomafanensis, and Microcebus sp.) exhibited seasonal variations in their edge proximities in SE Madagascar. We conducted diurnal (N = 348) and nocturnal (N = 134) lemur surveys along six transects over 3 years in the Vohibola III Classified Forest. The four lemur species exhibited considerable interspecific differences in the overall distribution and shape of their seasonal edge proximities. A. peyrierasi aggregated significantly further away from the forest edge during the warm, wet season than during the cool, dry season. The combination of a highly selected diet in A. peyrierasi and anthropogenic depletion of their preferred food and sleeping trees in edge habitats may explain seasonal changes in edge proximity. Lack of a seasonal edge effect in the other three lemur species likely reflects their ecological flexibility and in H. g. ranomafanensis and E. rubriventer, active defense of home-ranges and territories, respectively, from conspecifics. Further research is needed to better understand this new described pattern of seasonal variations in edge responses in lemurs.

AB Background Predicting how natural and anthropogenic drivers shape different ecological indicators, such as plant populations along environmental gradients, can be a relevant tool for establishing management and conservation criteria of tropical wetlands. We aimed to assess the effects of seasonal flood disturbance, type of grasslands and topographical conditions on Croton trinitatis population distribution in a tropical wetland. Methods The study was carried out in a seasonally flooded grassland (Central-West Brazil). We conducted samplings of soil on the dry and flood hydrophases of the Pantanal. We took the samples in eight seasonal ponds, with 1 km interval between them. Transects were marked during the flood period, observing the water level, one in the lowest zone, in the middle of the pond = low (ca. 60 cm deep), one at the pond edge = mid (ca. 30 cm deep) and one in the higher zone, on the external part = high (ca. 1 cm deep). Results The results showed that the topography, seasonality, and types of grassland determine differences in the abundance patterns of adult plants and seedlings, and seed bank and seed predation. The abiotic factors can shape plant population-related ecological processes and patterns, with outputs (germination and predation) and inputs (local dispersion and from neighbouring areas) of proportional seeds for the population maintenance in this environment. Conclusion We emphasize the importance of these findings, to show that abiotic factors are not the only ones to be considered in ecological studies of distribution and structuring of populations in habitats with extreme seasonal events.

TI Climate change could reduce and spatially reconfigure cocoa cultivation
   in the Brazilian Amazon by 2050
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID THEOBROMA-CACAO; AGRICULTURE; DEFORESTATION; CIRCULATION; SYSTEMS
AB Cocoa is a plant with origins in northwestern South America with high relevance in the global economy. Evidence indicates that cocoa is sensitive to a dry climate, under which crop production is reduced. Projections for future climate change scenarios suggest a warmer and drier climate in the Amazon basin. In this paper, we quantify the potential effects in cocoa production due to its edaphoclimatic suitability changes to the Brazilian Amazon biome and account for regional differences in planning occupation territories. We modeled the suitability of cocoa's geographical distribution using an ensemble of 10 correlative models that were run in the "biomod2" library and projected to two future climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) by 2050. Combining information on climate and soil suitability and installed infrastructure in the macro-regions of the Brazilian Amazon. We defined a zoning system to indicate how cocoa production may respond to climate change according to the current and future suitability model. Our results suggest that a reduction in precipitation and an increase in temperature may promote a reduction in the suitability of cocoa production in the Brazilian Amazon biome. In addition of the areas suitable for cocoa plantation, we found a 37.05% and 73.15% decrease in the areas suitable for intensification and expansion zones under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, compared with the current scenario. We conclude that there may be a need to expand land to cocoa production in the future, or else it will be necessary to plant a cocoa variety resistant to new climatic conditions. Besides, we recommend procedures to combat illegal deforestation to prevent the most critical climate change scenarios from occurring.

AB Purpose In plant-soil systems, phosphorus partitioning during the annual cycle related to nitrogen partitioning remains largely unknown. The present study aims at assessing the soil-plant P allocation patterns of four tree species along four phenological stages and its relationship with tissues and soil N concentrations. Methods Cryptomeria japonica, Larix kaempferi, Fagus crenata and Robinia pseudoacacia trees were selected to sample coarse roots, sapwood, foliage, litter and soil during four phenological stages where total and Olsen extractable P and nitrogen content were measured respectively. Results Intra- and inter plant tissue nitrogen correlated well with phosphorus during the four phenological stages, especially root nitrogen. Fagus and Robinia were phosphorus limited, Larix was nitrogen limited and Cryptomeria co-limited. All species reabsorbed phosphorus and nitrogen from foliage prior to leaf abscission and stored nitrogen in roots and sapwood. Phosphorus storage was solely found in sapwood of Robinia. Soil dissolved ammonium correlated positively with nitrogen reabsorption efficiency during the green leaf stage, while single soil nutrient variables did not correlate with phosphorus reabsorption efficiency. Conclusions Plant tissues nitrogen partitioning correlated well with their respective phosphorus partitioning and the increase of soil NH4+ correlated positively with nitrogen reabsorption efficiency, regardless of tree species during the green leaf stage. The results of this study show the intricate relationship that exists between nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil-plant continuum as well as the tree species specific internal cycling of these nutrients.

AB While moisture availability exerts strong controls on biogeochemical processes in drylands, several studies have found no relationship between litter decay and precipitation. We examined whether interactions between precipitation and photodegradation could play a role in the inconsistent response of decay to precipitation. We assessed mass loss of 4 leaf litter types on the surface of the Sonoran Desert over 9.5 months in a full-factorial experiment consisting of 3 radiation treatments (full sunlight, filtered from photodegrading (UV/violet-blue) sunlight, complete shade) and 2 precipitation levels (ambient, supplemental (2.7 x ambient)). Exposure to photodegrading sunlight nearly doubled (i.e. 1.9) litter mass loss, and in combination with supplemental precipitation accelerated decay by 2.6 times. Surprisingly, supplemental precipitation had no influence on decay of litter that did not receive photodegrading sunlight. That photodegradation was required for supplemental precipitation to accelerate decay could explain past findings that decay is not related to precipitation, as most studies assessed litter shaded by plant canopies. Sunlight or precipitation treatments had no effect on litter microbial respiration, even though concentrations of water-soluble compounds were > 2 times greater in photodegraded litter. In a second experiment, we assessed the mass loss from litter attributable to a 30-min immersion in water. Immersion losses were 2.5 times greater from litter exposed to photodegrading sunlight for 20 months in the field than litter filtered from this sunlight, and these losses were strongly correlated with decay. Our findings demonstrate that photodegrading sunlight greatly accelerates litter decay, precipitation magnifies this effect, and leaching is likely a significant mechanism.

AB The Sapindales are a large order comprised of trees, shrubs, lianas and rarely herbs. This lineage is mostly pantropical with important temperate lineages, inclusing some of the most diverse, highly prized woods in the world, such as mahogany (Swietenia). In this study, we characterized the wood anatomy across eight of the nine Sapindales families, and leverage phylogenetic comparative methods to explore the evolution of wood traits in the order. We delimited 23 characters and reconstructed them onto the most recent time-calibrated phylogeny for the group. We found that ring-porosity is derived within the order, coinciding with the occupation of more seasonal climates; marginal parenchyma is ancestrally present, but largely lost in Anacardiaceae-Burseraceae-Kirkiaceae; vessels in radial chains are ancestrally absent but gained many times; scanty paratracheal parenchyma was ancestrally present with multiple evolutions of more abundant parenchyma. Anacardiaceae-Burseraceae-Kirkiaceae share tyloses and large vessel-ray pits. Radial ducts are exclusive to Anacardiaceae-Burseraceae, while traumatic ducts are exclusive to Meliaceae-Rutaceae-Simaroubaceae. Rays are generally 2-4 cells wide, heterocellular, but with multiple lineages evolving homocellular narrow rays or more heterocellular wide rays. Prismatic crystals are commonly located in rays in Anacardiaceae-Burseraceae while in the other families they are mainly in axial parenchyma. Silica bodies are abundant in Burseraceae, but also present in Anacardiaceae and Meliaceae. Lianas are exclusively in Anacardiaceae and Sapindaceae, with Sapindaceae displaying an enormous diversity of cambial variants. Our work unravels several potential synapomorphies of Sapindales major clades, and evolutionary patterns for the enormous wood anatomical diversity of the order. In addition, our work highlights variable characters worth of more detailed studies within individual families of the Sapindales.

AB Plant-host-parasitoid assemblages can be extremely variable, involving highly specialized trophic interactions. In this regard, Neotropical host-parasitoid networks remain poorly known due to a lack of studies and rearing programs. Here we describe and quantify for the first time the parasitoid network associated with Diaethria anna and Theritas lisus. Both butterfly species were exclusively feeding on Trema micrantha in cloud forest habitats in Southern Mexico. We reared caterpillars and pupae to determine the associated parasitoids, attack proportions and the trophic relations for each butterfly species. Eight parasitic hymenopterans and four dipteran species emerged from the reared pupae. Parasitoid richness and abundance significantly varied among lepidopterans. Species specificity and partner diversity also differed between butterfly species. The Anna's Eighty-eight was parasitized by ten different species, resulting in 44% of death. In contrast, T. lisus was attacked by two natural enemies but caused higher mortality (85%). Our results suggest a trade-off between the diversity of parasitoids and mortality for both butterfly species. Quantitative observations of trophic relationships can help us understand the biological processes and changes occurring in complex but fragile networks.

AB Understanding the effects of random versus niche-based processes on biodiversity patterns is a central theme in ecology, and an important tool for predicting effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity. We investigated the predictive power of random processes to explain species richness and species dissimilarity of amphibian assemblages in a fragmented tropical landscape of the Atlantic Forest of South America. We analyzed a large database of amphibian abundance and occupancy, sampled in 21 forest fragments ranging in size from 1.9 to 619 ha. We compared observed species richness and species dissimilarity with the outcomes of two null (random placement) models: 1- the traditional Coleman's area-based model and 2- an abundance-based model (based on the number of individuals observed in each fragment). We applied these models for all species combined, and separately for forest-dependent and habitat-generalist species. The abundance-based model fitted the observed species richness data better than the area-based model for all species, forest-dependent species, and generalist species. The area-based and the abundance-based models were also able to significantly explain species dissimilarity for all species and for generalists, but not for forest dependent species. The traditional area-based model assigned too many individuals to large fragments, thus failing to accurately explain species richness within patches across the landscape. Although niche-based processes may be important to structuring the regional pool of species in fragmented landscapes, our results suggest that part of the variation in species richness and species dissimilarity can be successfully explained by random placement models, especially for generalist species. Evaluating which factors cause variation in the number of individuals among patches should be a focus in future studies aiming to understand biodiversity patterns in fragmented landscapes.

AB Trees regenerating in the understory respond to increased availability of light caused by gap formation by undergoing a range of morphological and physiological adjustments. These adjustments include the production of thick, sun-type leaves containing thicker mesophyll and longer palisade cells than in shade-type leaves. We asked whether in the shade-regenerating tree Acer pseudoplatanus, the increase in leaf thickness and expansion of leaf tissues are possible also in leaves that had been fully formed prior to the increase in irradiance, a response reported so far only for a handful of species. We acclimated potted seedlings to eight levels (from 1 to 100%) of solar irradiance and, in late summer, transferred a subset of them to full sunlight. Within 30 days, the shaded leaves increased leaf mass per area and became thicker mostly due to elongation of palisade cells, except for the most shaded individuals which suffered irreversible photo-oxidative damage. This anatomical acclimation was accompanied by partial degradation of chlorophyll and a transient decline in photosynthetic efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-M). These effects were related to the degree of pre-shading. The F-v/F-M recovered substantially within the re-acclimation period. However, leaves of transferred plants were shed significantly earlier in the fall, indicating that the acclimation was not fully effective. These results show that A. pseudoplatanus is one of the few known species in which mature leaves may re-acclimate anatomically to increased irradiance. This may be a potentially important mechanism enhancing utilization of gaps created during the growing season.

AB Background The ability of overstory tree species to regenerate successfully is important for the preservation of tree species diversity and its associated flora and fauna. This study investigated forest regeneration dynamics in the Cat Ba National Park, a biodiversity hotspot in Vietnam. Data was collected from 90 sample plots (500 m(2)) and 450 sub-sample plots (25 m(2)) in regional limestone forests. We evaluated the regeneration status of tree species by developing five ratios relating overstory and regeneration richness and diversity. By examining the effect of environmental factors on these ratios, we aimed to identify the main drivers for maintaining tree species diversity or for potential diversity gaps between the regeneration and the overstory layer. Our results can help to increase the understanding of regeneration patterns in tropical forests of Southeast Asia and to develop successful conservation strategies. Results We found 97 tree species in the regeneration layer compared to 136 species in the overstory layer. The average regeneration density was 3764 +/- 1601 per ha. Around 70% of the overstory tree species generated offspring. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, only 36% of threatened tree species were found in the regeneration layer. A principal component analysis provided evidence that the regeneration of tree species was slightly negatively correlated to terrain factors (percentage of rock surface, slope) and soil properties (cation exchange capacity, pH, humus content, soil moisture, soil depth). Contrary to our expectations, traces of human impact and the prevailing light conditions (total site factor, gap fraction, openness, indirect site factor, direct site factor) had no influence on regeneration density and composition, probably due to the small gradient in light availability. Conclusion We conclude that the tree species richness in Cat Ba National Park appears to be declining at present. We suggest similar investigations in other biodiversity hotspots to learn whether the observed trend is a global phenomenon. In any case, a conservation strategy for the threatened tree species in the Cat Ba National Park needs to be developed if tree species diversity is to be maintained.

AB The ecological co-dependency between plants and hummingbirds is a classic example of a mutualistic interaction: hummingbirds rely on floral nectar to fuel their rapid metabolisms, and more than 7000 plant species rely on hummingbirds for pollination. However, threats to hummingbirds are mounting, with 10% of 366 species considered globally threatened and 60% in decline. Despite the important ecological implications of these population declines, no recent review has examined plant-hummingbird interactions in the wider context of their evolution, ecology, and conservation. To provide this overview, we (i) assess the extent to which plants and hummingbirds have coevolved over millions of years, (ii) examine the mechanisms underlying plant-hummingbird interaction frequencies and hummingbird specialization, (iii) explore the factors driving the decline of hummingbird populations, and (iv) map out directions for future research and conservation. We find that, despite close associations between plants and hummingbirds, acquiring evidence for coevolution (versus one-sided adaptation) is difficult because data on fitness outcomes for both partners are required. Thus, linking plant-hummingbird interactions to plant reproduction is not only a major avenue for future coevolutionary work, but also for studies of interaction networks, which rarely incorporate pollinator effectiveness. Nevertheless, over the past decade, a growing body of literature on plant-hummingbird networks suggests that hummingbirds form relationships with plants primarily based on overlapping phenologies and trait-matching between bill length and flower length. On the other hand, species-level specialization appears to depend primarily on local community context, such as hummingbird abundance and nectar availability. Finally, although hummingbirds are commonly viewed as resilient opportunists that thrive in brushy habitats, we find that range size and forest dependency are key predictors of hummingbird extinction risk. A critical direction for future research is to examine how potential stressors - such as habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and introduction of non-native plants - may interact to affect hummingbirds and the plants they pollinate.

TI Integrating ecosystem markets to co-ordinate landscape-scale public
   benefits from nature
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; PAYMENTS; GOODS
AB Ecosystem markets are proliferating around the world in response to increasing demand for climate change mitigation and provision of other public goods. However, this may lead to perverse outcomes, for example where public funding crowds out private investment or different schemes create trade-offs between the ecosystem services they each target. The integration of ecosystem markets could address some of these issues but to date there have been few attempts to do this, and there is limited understanding of either the opportunities or barriers to such integration. This paper reports on a comparative analysis of eleven ecosystem markets in operation or close to market in Europe, based on qualitative analysis of 25 interviews, scheme documentation and two focus groups. Our results indicate three distinct types of markets operating from the regional to national scale, with different modes of operation, funding and outcomes: regional ecosystem markets, national carbon markets and green finance. The typology provides new insights into the operation of ecosystem markets in practice, which may challenge traditionally held notions of Payment for Ecosystem Services. Regional ecosystem markets, in particular, represent a departure from traditional models, by using a risk-based funding model and aggregating both supply and demand to overcome issues of free-riding, ecosystem service trade-offs and land manager engagement. Central to all types of market were trusted intermediaries, brokers and platforms to aggregate supply and demand, build trust and lower transaction costs. The paper outlines six options for blending public and private funding for the provision of ecosystem services and proposes a framework for integrating national carbon markets and green finance with regional ecosystem markets. Such integration may significantly increase funding for regenerative agriculture and conservation across multiple habitats and services, whilst addressing issues of additionality and ecosystem service trade-offs between multiple schemes.

AB Context Conversion of land cover by urban expansion is typically thought to reduce functional diversity by homogenizing species composition, at least in well-studied temperate locations. Studies of highly diverse and disturbance-sensitive tropical ecosystems remain rare. Objectives By exhaustively surveying resident forest bird communities across an urbanizing Neotropical region we aimed to: (1) assess the patterns and landscape-level correlates of species occurrences in forest habitat; (2) identify trait predictors of species occurrences in urban forest patches; and (3) evaluate the associations between urbanization and phylogenetic and functional diversity. Methods We inventoried forest bird communities along the Panama Canal, an area characterized by a strong urbanization gradient from remnant patches surrounded by a densely populated metropolis (Panama City) to extensive tracts of protected rainforest in National Parks. We determined associations of community composition, species traits, and functional and phylogenetic diversity with landscape-level attributes. Results In contrast to most previous studies reporting community homogenization, forest patches in urbanized central Panama contained different subsets of resident bird species. Species in forests within in the most urbanized subregions generally were those with strong dispersal abilities, short developmental periods, and recent evolutionary histories. Although species identities varied among urban patches, functional and phylogenetic diversity were similar. Conclusions Our results are best characterized by community "simplification"-a loss of species without loss of functional or phylogenetic representation. The dissimilarity of bird community composition among forest patches in urbanized regions appears to be a unique outcome and could be influenced by patch-specific attributes.

AB While theory suggests that at conception the sex ratio should be balanced (1:1), this can be variable across space and time in wild populations. Currently, studies of the environmental factors that regulate adult sex ratio (ASR) in species with different life history traits are scarce. Using capture-recapture over a year, we analyzed the influence of habitat type (forest and nonforest) and season (rainy and dry) on variation in ASR, male aggregation and the trajectory movement of 2 dung beetle species with different life history traits: Deltochilum mexicanum (a hornless roller species) and Dichotomius satanas (a tunneler species with horns on its head and thorax). We found opposite tendencies. The D. mexicanum population tends to be female-biased, but the population of D. satanas tends to be predominantly male, and observed values were not related to habitat type or season. However, the 95% confidence intervals estimated were highly variable between seasons depending on habitat. On examining the monthly variation in ASR for both habitats, we found that it depends on the species. In addition, male aggregation differed between species depending on habitat type and season, and species movement patterns were closely related to their habitat preferences. Based on our results, we argue that comparative population studies of species with different life history traits are necessary to understand the variation in demographic parameters as well as its ecological and evolutionary implications in the face of spatial and climatic environmental variation.

AB Niche filtering predicts that abundant species in communities have similar traits that are suitable for the environment. However, niche filtering can operate on distinct axes of trait variation in response to different ecological conditions. Here, we use a trait-based approach to infer niche filtering processes and (a) test if abundant and rare species in grassland communities are differently positioned along distinct axes of trait variation, (b) determine if these trait variation axes, as well as phylogenetic and functional similarities, drive species relative abundance (above-ground cover) within communities, and (c) explore whether these relationships vary across grassland types and macro-climatic gradients.
   We analysed species abundance in vegetation plots from temperate grasslands in Central Europe as a function of species position along three axes of trait variation: the 'Plant Size Spectrum' (PSS), the 'Leaf Economics Spectrum' (LES) and the 'Life span/Clonality Spectrum' (LCS). We also used phylogenetic and functional similarities in the multi-dimensional trait space as predictors of species abundance. We compared our results among alpine, wet, mesic and dry grasslands and tested whether the effect of the predictors on species abundance was significant across macro-climatic gradients.
   Compared to abundant species, rare species in grassland communities were more commonly annual and non-clonal, had lower stature and smaller leaves and seeds, and relied on more acquisitive leaf economics. Our predictors significantly explained species abundance in approximately one-third of the plots. LES was the most important predictor across all plots, with the most prominent effect in alpine and dry grasslands and areas with more extreme temperatures. In contrast, in mesic and wet grasslands and grasslands located in warmer and Correspondence less seasonal regions, species abundance was best predicted by phylogenetic similarities between species, with Poaceae species becoming more abundant.
   Our study explored trait-abundance relationships for different community types across a large area and broad macro-climatic gradients. We conclude that niche filtering, and particularly resource-acquisition trade-offs, drives species abundance in temperate grassland communities of Central Europe. Our findings emphasize the interaction between local environmental conditions and plant function in determining community assembly.

AB The Kadazandusun people of Sabah have practiced traditional forest management of tagal hutan or prohibited forests. An official development assistance (ODA) project under REDD+ implementation scheme targets tagal hutan forests in Sabah, with the participation of the indigenous people. Through the theory of planned behaviour, this study assesses the link between attitude, social norms, customary norms, and perceived behaviour control on Kadazandusun people's intentions to participate in future REDD+ project activities. We found out that attitude and perceived behaviour control affect intentions to participate in future REDD+ project activities meanwhile social norm and customary norm were otherwise. Socio-demographic factors, such as household size, age, and prior experience as leaders or committee members in the village, also influence the intentions to participate in future REDD+ project activities. This study may help predict the acceptance of REDD+ activities among indigenous people in Sabah and help design more effective REDD+ projects.

AB In this paper, we study the general mechanism of Turing-pattern in a tree-grass competition model with cross diffusion and time delay. The properties of four equilibrium points, the existence of Hopf bifurcation and the sufficient conditions for Turing instability caused by cross-diffusion are analyzed, respectively. The amplitude equation of tree-grass competition model is derived by using multi-scale analysis method, and its nonlinear stability is studied. The sensitivity analysis also verified that fire frequency plays a key role in tree-grass coexistence equilibrium. Finally, the Turing pattern of tree-grass model obtained by numerical simulation is consistent with the spatial structure of tree-grass density distribution observed in Hulunbuir grassland, China.

AB Biodiversity conservation has long been a subject of extreme interest to community ecologists, with a particular focus on exploring the underlying causes of species diversity based on niche and neutral theories. This study aims to identify the potential determinants of species diversity in a deciduous broad-leaved forest in the transitional region from subtropical to temperate climate in China. We collected woody plant data and environmental vari-ables in a fully mapped 25-ha permanent forest plot, partitioned the beta-diversity into local contributions (LCBD) and species contributions (SCBD), and then applied multivariate linear regression analysis to test the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on alpha-diversity, LCBD, and SCBD. We used variation partitioning in combination with environmental variables and spatial distance to determine the contribution of environment-related variations versus spatial variations. Our results showed that the indices of alpha-diversity (i.e., species abundance and richness) were positively correlated with soil available phosphorus (P) and negatively with slope. For the beta -diversity, environment and space together explained nearly half of the variations in community composition. Approximately 60% of the variation of LCBD in the understory layer, 40% in the substory layer, and 29% in the canopy layer were jointly explained by topographic, soil and biological variables, with biotic factors playing a dominant role in determining the beta-diversity. Species abundance accounted for a large proportion of the variations in SCBD in each vertical stratum, and niche position (NP) was the ecological trait that significantly affected the variations in SCBD in the substory and canopy layers. Our findings help to gain better understanding on how species diversity in forest ecosystem responds to environmental conditions and how it is influenced by biotic factors and ecological traits of species.

AB Background The increasing demand for local food production is fueling high interest in the development of controlled environment agriculture. In particular, LED technology brings energy-saving advantages together with the possibility of manipulating plant phenotypes through light quality control. However, optimizing light quality is required for each cultivated plant and specific purpose.
   Findings This article shows that the combination of LED gradient set-ups with imaging-based non-destructive plant phenotyping constitutes an interesting new screening tool with the potential to improve speed, logistics, and information output. To validate this concept, an experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of a complete range of red:blue ratios on 7 plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, Euphorbia peplus, Ocimum basilicum, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum, and Setaria viridis. Plants were exposed during 30 days to the light gradient and showed significant, but species-dependent, responses in terms of dimension, shape, and color. A time-series analysis of phenotypic descriptors highlighted growth changes but also transient responses of plant shapes to the red:blue ratio.
   Conclusion This approach, which generated a large reusable dataset, can be adapted for addressing specific needs in crop production or fundamental questions in photobiology.

AB Background: The deforestation caused by road construction is one of the main drivers for both biodiversity and function loss in tropical ecosystems. Terricolous cryptogams are pioneers in colonizing roadside and they are limited by environmental and edaphic factors, thus, cryptogams may act as pioneers for ecosystem rehabilitation at roadside.Methods: This research was aimed at determining the diversity and composition of terricolous cryptogams, as well as their relationship with elevation and soil properties among roadside of the tropical Andes of Ecuador, in order to establish indicator species of this anthropized ecosystems. Five elevations were selected and in each one 50 grids of 20 cm x 30 cm were sampled (250 in total along the road), where occurrence, cover and identification of every cryptogam species were recorded. To evaluate the effect of elevation and soil properties on cryptogam richness, a linear model was conducted. Species composition among elevations was compared by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), and their relationship with the environmental variables through a correla-tion with adjusted axes was performed. A total of 72 species were recorded, those being 44 bryophytes and 28 lichens. Species richness and composition of terricolous cryptogams were influenced by elevation and soil properties, thus the richness is higher at elevations E1, E2 and E3 (2600, 2200 and 1800 m a.s.l.), differing from low elevations E4 and E5 (1400 and 1000 m a.s.l.). Higher elevations with specific soil conditions (e.g bulk density, nitrogen and silt) harbored different cryptogam communities than those in lower elevations.Conclusions: A combination of both elevation and soil properties are shaping the colonization by terricolous cryptogams commnunities. As such, 18 species were identified as the best indicators for all sets of environmental conditions at the roadside, which can therefore be considered for monitoring ecological processes in tropical areas. Use of biocrusts for restoration is an emerging field. If implemented in the study region, elevation and soil drivers may help to better chose the more suitable cryptogam species to manage and stabilize roadside in tropical roads.

AB Background: Urban remnant forests are embedded in urban areas and are threatened directly and indirectly by urbanization. The direct effects (e.g., loss of area) have been well studied. However, knowledge about the indirect influence of urbanization through edge effects on the biodiversity in remnant forests is limited.Methods: In this study, we surveyed woody plant species in 72 plots in nine remnant forest patches in Guiyang, China. We examined the influences of urbanization and edge effects on the species diversity and composition of woody plants in remnant forests. We compared alpha diversities and quantified compositional dissimilarities in interior and edge sites at different levels of urbanization. We also measured the niche width of the recorded plant species and assessed whether high levels of urbanization and edge effects increased the number of generalist species.Results and conclusions: The Shannon index, the Simpson index and the Pielou index of adult trees were lowest in the edge habitat under high levels of urbanization. Significant differences in the Shannon index and the Simpson index of sapling/seedling were detected between interior and edge sites under low urbanization. The edge effects on the species composition of adult trees were intensified by high levels of urbanization. Woody plant species with wide niche widths were more abundant at edge sites under high levels of urbanization. Therefore, we recommend that urban expansion surrounding remnant patches should be strictly controlled to alleviate edge effects on biodiversity.

AB We investigate the impact of anthropogenic noise on the foraging efficiency of leafcutter ants (Acromyrmex octospinosus) in a controlled laboratory experiment. Anthropogenic noise is a widespread, pervasive and increasing environmental pollutant and its negative impacts on animal fitness and behaviour have been well documented. Much of this evidence has come from studies concerning vertebrate species with very little evidence for terrestrial invertebrates, especially social living invertebrates. We compare movement speed, forage fragment size, and colony activity levels of ants exposed to intermittent elevated noise and in ambient noise conditions. We use intermittent and temporally unpredictable bursts of white noise produced from a vibration speaker to create the elevated noise profile. Ant movement speed increased under elevated noise conditions when travelling to collect forage material and when returning to the colony nest. The size of individually measured foraged material was significantly reduced under elevated noise conditions. Colony activity, the number of ants moving along the forage route, was not affected by elevated noise and was consistent throughout the foraging events. Increased foraging speed and smaller forage fragments suggests that the ants had to make more foraging trips over an extended period, which is likely to affect energy expenditure and increases exposure to predators. This is likely to have significant fitness impacts for the colony over time.

AB Windthrows are common, natural disturbances in forest ecosystems. One of the effects of these disturbances is the exposure of mineral soil, which is gradually colonised by plants and other organisms via secondary succession. The aim of this research, conducted in the windthrows in the Kampinos National Park (central Poland), was to determine the changes in composition, richness, and abundance of the bryophytes and lichens inhabiting the mineral habitats of uprooted trees and to identify the level of its distinctiveness from the surrounding forest floor. The largest number of species (28) was found in pits; fewer species were found on the lower part of the uproot mounds (21), and in the vicinity of the uprooted trees (16). Many species differed in abundance and in their fidelity to the selected habitat types. Significant changes in the species richness and composition of the habitat types were observed between the first and third year after the dis??? turbance. A large number of species inhabited the pits, and there was a gradual increase in the lower parts of the uproot plates. The communities of the pits and lower parts of the mounds were similar in the first year after the windthrow. After three years the pits became more similar to the undisturbed sites, whereas the opposite tendency was observed in relation to lower parts of the mounds. There were important differences in (a) condition between the studied habitats as estimated using ecological indicator values, and (b) the share of species with different types of growth forms and life strategies.

AB Ants are an abundant and diverse group with worldwide distribution. Given their omnipresence, ecosystem services, and potential applications, ants may be excellent models for multiple lines of research such as physiology. However, the focus and worldwide distribution of ant physiology research are unknown. Given the evidence of scientific colonialism in multiple scientific areas -where credit and reward are not given to local scientists from developing nations when scien-tist s from wealthier nations travel for research -we examined the potential for such trends in studies of ant physiology. We investigated the frequency of studies and collaborations across countries during 2015 -2019, which simultaneously allowed us to estimate the most studied taxa. We found that the largest proportion of studies was done in Europe and North America. Collaboration trends were mainly among high-income countries. Nearly one third of the countries that served as sampling sites were not represented in authorship (mostly low-and middle-income). Furthermore, low-and middle-income countries show a lower proportion of authorship or co-authorship when these countries served as sampling sites, as compared with high-income countries. This disparity might indicate scientific colonialism in the field. However, collaborations between institutions from the sampling country and their foreign counterparts increased with the per capita Gross Domestic Product, suggesting a link between country's participation in international collaboration and its economic prosperity. How publications are circulated may further influence trends in scientific colonialism. Both the probability that a study reaches the public sphere (Altmetric) and the number of citations increase with the impact factor (IF) of the journal in which the article was published. Unfortunately, high-IF journals often show the highest Article Processing Charges, which can be a financial impediment for institutions in low-and middle-income countries. Our study highlights factors that influence the process of research in this field. The evidence of scientific colonialism in ant physiology that we highlight in this study calls for urgent measures to promote more equitable collaborative efforts.

Evidence suggests that governance may play a critical role in influencing deforestation, and while a number of studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between national-level governance and deforestation, much remains to be known about the relative importance of subnational governance to deforestation outcomes. With a focus on the Brazilian Amazon, this study aims to understand the relationship between governance and deforestation at the municipal level. Drawing on the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) as a guiding conceptual framework, and incorporating the additional dimension of environmental governance, we identified a wide array of publicly available data sources related to governance indicators that we used to select relevant governance variables. We compiled a dataset of 22 municipal-level governance variables covering the 2005-2018 period for 457 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon. Using an econometric approach, we tested the relationship between governance variables and deforestation rates in a fixed-effects panel regression analysis. We found that municipalities with increasing numbers of agricultural companies tended to have higher rates of deforestation, municipalities with an environmental fund tended to have lower rates of deforestation, and municipalities that had previously elected a female mayor tended to have lower rates of deforestation. These results add to the wider conversation on the role of local-level governance, revealing that certain governance variables may contribute to halting deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB This study is based on the studies of herbaceous plants, birds and coleoptera that were carried out between 1998 and 2001 in the Lachay National Reserve, and is based on the interest of generating a biological early warning of the El Nino event. The present study incorporated two samples for beetles in 2002 and two samples for each group in 2010. The objective of the research was to evaluate the variation of the biotic variables of the three biological groups under the El Nino Event between 1998-2001 and 2010, to identify indicator variables of the El Nino Event. In the plots, composition, abundance, diversity, and functional groups were estimated. In addition, for herbaceous plants, vegetation cover, density, IVI and Cinv were evaluated. Some variables (C-inv Abundance, C-inv Coverage, C-inv IVI native and/or endemic and in vegetation coverage) suggest a positive relationship with the Global Nino because they increase after its manifestation, from a very strong to moderate El Nino event, favoring the appearance of endemic herbaceous species. Other variables proposed for monitoring are the abundance and richness of beetles, alpha diversity and richness of birds, as well as the percentage of abundance of chamaephytes, the percentage of abundance of nanophanerophytes, and the abundance of predatory group. Some key species are Croton ruizianus, Trixis cacalioides, Crassula connata, Fuertesimalva peruviana, Nicotiana paniculata, and IVIg as key variable.

AB Phosphorus (P) cycling is an important yet poorly studied aspect of the macronutrient balance in tropical rainforest ecosystems. As soil P occurs in different organic and inorganic forms (fractions) with varying degrees of lability, we hypothesized that these fractions will vary between soil types, and temporally within soil types. Additionally, we hypothesized a direct influence of leaf litterfall P input on soil total P and soil P fractions. We collected soil and leaf litter samples from three soil types in a central Amazonian lowland rainforest in Brazil over five months, and used a modified Hedleys fractionation method to determine six organic and inorganic soil P fractions, and also total, labile and residual P. Leaf litterfall P concentrations were determined colorimetrically. Soil inorganic and organic P fractions varied between soil types and across months, but soil type and month interactions were mostly non-significant. Some inorganic P fractions (P-i-NaOH) peaked while the organic fractions (P-o-NaOH) fell and vice versa. Leaf litterfall production and leaf litterfall P input peaked around two months following the wettest month. Leaf litterfall P input was a significant predictor of P-o-NaHCO3, a bioavailable P fraction. Future studies on P cycling in terrestrial ecosystems should examine the roles played by individual soil P fractions as they cycle asynchronistically and differently across soil types.

AB S. macrophylla is an important forest species with economic value, however its main problem is its ecological vulnerability to the attack of H. grandella. In this sense, the objective in this study was to determine the effect of A. indica and J. curcas in reducing the attack of H. grandella on S. macrophylla plants planted in agroforestry systems. For this, the basal diameter (mm), height of plant (cm), attacked plants (%), attacked stems (%), apices attacked (%), leaves attacked (%), survival and mortality of larvae were evaluated (%). The lowest percentage of attack of H. grandella in S. macrophylla plants was registered in the association S. macrophylla with T. cacao and A. indica and also in S. macrophylla with T. cacao and J. curcas, planted at 1 m x 3 m, with 0.95 and 2.85%, respectively. However, the greater survival and mortality of larvae of H. grandella was registered in the association S. macrophylla with T. cacao and in S. macrophylla with T. cacao and J. curcas with 90.20 and 88.89% respectively. Thus, the use of A. indica and J. curcas significantly promote the reduction of H. grandella attack on S. macrophylla plants planted in agroforestry systems.

AB The parental effect on wood anatomy and growth rings of Cordia trichotoma trees was studied. Tree seeds of two provenances (Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes) were collected in 1986. Seedlings were planted, and after 25 years, twelve wood disks were collected from six trees from each provenance. Anatomical features and growth rings were analyzed according to standard techniques. Qualitative anatomy of wood indicated similarities between the two provenances, except for the presence of geniculate vessels found in woods from the Cerrado. However, the greatest differences in wood anatomy were quantitative. Provenances from Cerrado had wood with shorter vessel and fibers elements, less fiber lumen, less parenchyma per mm 2 , and more vessels per group than did provenances from the Atlantic Forest. Cross dating among the radial growth ring series was performed through visual and statistical procedures. The relationships between tree rings and meteorological records were performed through Pearson's correlation, and through dendro-climatic analysis that identified the end summer precipitation as the major factor affecting tree growth at inter annual timescale. The standard chronologies of tree-ring width series showed similarity between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest provenances, but with small differences in the juvenile period of live of trees. The rains that decreased between April and June associated with the gradual decrease in temperature may have reduced the cambial activity and caused the formation of tree rings with small differences between the two provenances. The results of this study are relevant for climate adaptive forestry: they emphasize the importance of heritability in the plasticity of certain features of wood anatomy related to the environmental conditions in which they grow, while the growth rate and its year-by-year variability show small differences.

AB Although fire occurrence plays a central role in the dominance of the super-dominant bracken fern Pteridium arachnoideum in Neotropical forests, it is unclear whether this applies to the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), which vegetation is naturally adapted to fire. We assessed fire effects on the aboveground biomass of P. arachnoideum in the Cerrado Ecological Reserve in Central Brazil. We measured frond height, density, standing biomass, and litter biomass before and for two years following a prescribed fire, and also sampled a control site to control for other mortality events and for seasonal variation. The average P. arachnoideum frond height and aboveground biomass decreased over three times in the burnt site 18 months after the fire. The frond density decreased both in the burnt and control site, indicating that this may have been caused in another way than by fire. Conversely, litter biomass decreased shortly after the fire in the burnt site, but returned to pre-fire levels in one year. Possible explanations for the lasting negative effects of fire on the height and biomass of P. arachnoideum include the implementation of the prescribed fire early in the dry season, which likely limited immediate clonal regrowth, and the herbivory by leaf-cutting ants. Nevertheless, the effective clonal growth of P. arachnoideum apparently precluded the fire from having stronger effects and hence this species was not excluded from the site. We conclude that direct and indirect fire effects may cause the decline of P. arachnoideum in Cerrado, so that prescribed fires may be applied as a management strategy in Cerrado sites where this species is super-dominant, ideally in combination with other control measures.

AB Forests are an important natural resource that provides to society several valuable goods and services that include timber, fuel, food, chemicals, medicines, climate regulation, and soil protection. Forests in several developing countries are however being destroyed at a rapid rate with adverse impacts such as increased soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and increased emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. The causes of deforestation are complex and diverse and depend on the socio-economic, political, cultural, legal and institutional contexts of the countries in which the affected forests are located. This paper examines the deforestation trends in developing countries and discusses the key drivers of deforestation in these countries. The paper also identifies and discusses some approaches that can be used to reduce deforestation. The insights provided by the paper can be practically applied to formulate policies, strategies and action plans for improving forest management and enhancing both their economic contribution and role in sustainable development.

TI Genetic divergence and demography of pudu deer (Pudu puda) in five
   provinces of southern Chile, analyzed through latitudinal and
   longitudinal ranges
SO NEOTROPICAL BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Pudu deer (Pudu puda) is endemic to the temperate rainforests of Chile. Genetic studies at different geographic scales for this species are required to better determine the genetic divergence within and among populations and their demography across the distribution range. These data can provide unique insights into the species or population status for conservation plans and decision-makers. We analyzed the mtDNA control region (CR) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) sequences of pudu deer in five provinces of southern Chile located at different latitudinal locations (Cautin, Valdivia, Osorno, Llanquihue and Chiloe Island) and three geographic areas within the studied provinces, representative of different longitudinal sites (Andes range, Central Valley and Coastal Range), to understand their genetic divergence and demography. The haplotype (H) and nucleotide (Pi) diversities of CR and Cyt b ranged from 0.64286 to 0.98333 and from 0.00575 to 0.01022, respectively. CR diversity was significantly different among provinces, with Valdivia showing higher values than Llanquihue and Chiloe Island (H = 0.98333 vs. 0.64286-0.92727, P < 0.05). Cyt b variation also showed significant differences among provinces, particularly, among Cautin and Llanquihue (H = 1.000 vs. 0.222, P < 0.05). Genetic structuring among provinces was relatively high, as indicated by the F-ST index (F-ST = 0.41905). Clustering analysis indicated the presence of a distinctive cluster for Chiloe Island individuals. Fu's F-S and Tajima's D based on CR revealed significant, negative deviations from equilibrium for Chiloe Island (D =-1.65898), Valdivia (Fs =-7.75335) and Llanquihue (Fs =-3.93267), suggesting population expansion in these provinces. Analysis at the longitudinal range showed significant differences among areas based on Pi (P < 0.05), with the Andes range and Central Valley showing higher diversity than the Coastal Range. Neither population structuring (F-ST = 0.01360, P > 0.05) nor distinctive clusters in the longitudinal range were observed. Fu's Fs and Tajima's D were negative and significant for the Coastal Range based on CR (Fs =-6.64752, P < 0.001) and Cyt b (D =-1.74110, P < 0.05), suggesting the existence of population expansion. Our results suggest that pudu deer in the analyzed provinces is a genetically structured species, which could be associated with reduced panmixia among populations. The genetic divergence pattern and the population expansion recorded are likely to be associated with past processes of recolonization after Pleistocene glaciation events.

AB Monitoring restoration practices is an expensive process, but essential to verifying their success. One way to reduce sampling costs is using biodiversity indicators, a term used for a functional or taxonomic group that is in agreement with another group. The objective of this work was to evaluate the agreement between the richness and composition of regenerating plants, ants and other arthropods under the canopy of four tree species in a restoration area in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, as well as to determine the relationship of biological communities with parameters environmental and spatial. It was found that environmental variables, often linked to the tree's identity, are preponderant in determining the relationship between ants, other arthropods and regenerating plants. In addition, ants proved to be weak indicators of regenerating plants and other arthropods diversity and composition and this relationship was not guided by environmental and spatial variables. Thus, the results found here recommend caution when using ants as indicators of plant biodiversity and other arthropods in monitoring programs in the Atlantic Forest.

AB It is estimated that human body is inhabited by approximately 380 trillions of viruses, which exist in the form of viral communities and are collectively termed as human virome. How virome is assembled and what kind of forces maintain the composition and diversity of viral communities is still an open question. The question is of obvious importance because of its implications to human health and diseases. Here we address the question by harnessing the power of Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) in terms of three neutral models including standard Hubbell's neutral model (HNM), Sloan's near-neutral model (SNM) and Harris et al. (2017) multi-site neutral model (MSN), further augmented by Ning et al. (2019) normalized stochasticity ratio (NSR) and Hammal et al. (2015) power analysis for the neutral test (PNT). With the five models applied to 179 virome samples, we aim to obtain robust findings given both Type-I and Type-II errors are addressed and possible alternative, non-neutral processes are detected. It was found that stochastic neutral drifts seem prevalent: approximately 65-92% at metacommunity/landscape scales and 67-80% at virus species scale. The non-neutral selection is approximately 26-28% at community scale and 23% at species scale. The false negative rate is about 2-3%, which suggested rather limited confounding effects of non-neutral process on neutrality tests. We postulate that prevalence of neutrality in human virome is likely due to extremely simple structure of viruses (stands of DNA/RNA) and their inter-species homogeneities, forming the foundation of species equivalence-the hallmark of neutral theory.

AB Tropical forests have been rapidly deforested and degradation worldwide has outpaced biodiversity field sampling. No study to date has assessed the effects of insular habitats induced by hydroelectric dams on Amazonian understory plants. Fern community responses to anthropogenic effects on tropical forest islands can be revealed at a faster pace by using simple and cheap, yet informative, protocols that could be applied by non-specialists. This study seeks to both understand the drivers of fern and lycophytes assemblages on forest islands and investigate the relative costs and effectiveness of a simplified sampling protocol that can be applied by non-specialists. Fern species were sampled by a non-specialist who photographed all ferns and lycophytes within seventeen 0.25-ha plots on 10 forest islands at the lake of Balbina Hydroelectric dam, central Amazonia. Sampling was carried out opportunistically during a field expedition planned to conduct tree inventories. As predictors, we used locally measured or GIS-derived descriptors of plot and landscape conditions. We used multivariate and linear models to further assess the influence of predictors on patterns of species richness and composition of ferns assemblages. A total of 286 photographed individual ferns or lycophytes represented at least 23 species and 14 genera. The average number of taxa per plot was 6.1 in the islands and 14.3 in the mainland. The species pool found on islands was a nested subset of the mainland fern community. Species richness was positively related to island size and negatively related to isolation and fire severity. Area, isolation and fire severity also significantly explained variation in community composition. The relative cost of the picture-based fern protocol applied was very modest (only 4% of the total expedition budget), even compared to the typically low cost of alternative field campaigns. We conclude that fern community structure in this forest archipelago was primarily driven by island size, isolation and fire disturbance. Moreover, we show that a simple sampling protocol carried out by a non-specialist can lead to inexpensive and highly reliable ecological data. This opens an avenue for crowdsourcing ecological fern data collections using a citizen science approach.

AB The Atlantic Forest harbors 7% of global biodiversity and possesses high levels of endemism, but many of its component taxa remain unstudied. Due to the importance of tropical forests and the urgency to protect them, there is a compelling need to address this knowledge gap. To provide more information on its arthropod fauna, a Malaise trap was deployed for 12 months in a semi-degraded area of the southern Upper Parana ecoregion of the Atlantic Forest. All specimens were DNA barcoded and the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system was employed to assign each specimen to a species proxy. DNA barcodes were obtained from 75,500 arthropods that included representatives of 8,651 BINs. Nearly 81% of these BINs were first records, highlighting the high rates of endemism and lack of study of arthropods from the Atlantic Forest. Diptera was the most abundant order, followed by Hemiptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. Diptera was also the most species-rich order, followed by Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera, a result consistent with studies in other biogeographic regions. Insects were most abundant in winter and most diverse in autumn and winter. This pattern, however, was caused mainly by the dynamics of dipteran diversity as other orders differed in their seasonal variation. The BIN composition of the insect community varied sharply through the year and also differed between the two consecutive summers included in the sampling period. The study of the 38 commonest BINs showed that seasonal patterns of abundance were not order-specific. Temperature had the strongest impact on seasonal abundance variation. Our results highlight the striking and understudied arthropod diversity of the highly fragmented Atlantic Forest, the predominance of dipterans, and the fact that abundance and richness in this insect community peak in the coolest months. Standardized studies like this generate fast and reliable biodiversity inventories and unveil ecological patterns, thus providing valuable information for conservation programs.

AB The habitat loss is the main threat for many parrot species worldwide. However, the disturbed environments can influence the occurrence of the species positively or negatively, depending on its structure and potential use as an alternative environment. Therefore, this work aims to determine the relationship between land use types and the occurrence of the threatened Red-browed Amazon, identifying the land use types related to species' occurrence and the direction of these relationships. Seven land use types were significantly associated with the species' occurrence: Primary/Secondary Advanced/Medium Natural Forest, Secondary Natural Vegetation, Pasture, Outcrop/ Bare Soil, Mangroves, Rivers and Urban Areas. We found that some land use types that are structurally different from the original environments (Pasture, Outcrop/Bare Soil and Urban Areas) positively affected the occurrence of the species. The relationship between intensity of occurrence and highly anthropized land use types, suggests a plasticity of the species in habitat use that may be contributing to the maintenance of Red-browed Amazon populations in highly disturbed habitats. Therefore, we proposed that the management of disturbed areas, along with usual conservation strategies (e.g., conservation of forest remnants, restoration of degraded areas), could contribute to Red-browed Amazon conservation.

TI Chymotrypsin is a molecular target of insect resistance of three corn

AB The Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, is a serious insect pest that can infest corn leaves and stems. Due to its internal feeding behavior, its larvae are not exposed to insecticides that are usually sprayed for pest control. To minimize crop damage caused by O. furnacalis, improving insect resistance trait of corn has been considered as an optimal control tactic. This study screened 27 corn varieties for their insect resistance trait and selected three varieties of Ilmichal (IM), P3394, and Kwangpyeongok (KP) that showed insect resistance trait. O. furnacalis larvae did not show any significant difference in preference between these three insect-resistant corn varieties and a control susceptible variety. However, these resistant varieties after ingestion significantly interfered with larval development of O. furnacalis. This suggests that the insect resistance trait is induced by antibiosis, but not by antixenosis. Indeed, larvae fed with these varieties suffered from low chymotrypsin (CHY) activities in the midgut juice. To determine the target CHY inhibited by resistant corn varieties, a total of nine CHY genes (Of-CHY1~Of-CHY9) were predicted from the transcriptome of O. furnacalis. Six genes (Of-CHY1~Of-CHY6) were expressed in all developmental stages and tissues. Especially, Of-CHY3 was highly expressed in the midgut of O. furnacalis larvae. RNA interference (RNAi) using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to Of-CHY3 (2 mu g of dsRNA injected to each L5 larva) resulted in significant reduction of Of-CHY3 expression level at 24 h post-treatment. Feeding L3 larvae with this dsRNA also significantly suppressed the expression level of Of-CHY3 and reduced its enzyme activity at 24 h post-treatment. A recombinant Escherichia coli expressing dsRNA specific to Of-CHY3 was constructed using L4440 vector. Feeding such recombinant bacteria suppressed the expression level of Of-CHY3 and prevented larval development of O. furnacalis. These results suggest that the three resistant varieties can produce a resistance factor(s) to inhibit the CHY activity of O. furnacalis and suppress larval growth. This study suggests that CHY might be an inhibition target in O. furnacalis for breeding insect-resistant corns.

AB We analyzed the seasonal variation in the diet, trophic niche breadth (Levins index), the partitioning of food resources (Pianka's symmetric index) and trophic level (weighed average of trophic level of each prey determined in FishBase and SeaLifeBase platform) of Plagioscion squamosissimus (Heckel, 1840) and Hydrolycus scomberoides (Cuvier, 1819) in the Machado River, Rondonia, Brazil. Fish samplings were conducted bimonthly from June 2013 to May 2015 in five sites, using eight sets of gillnets. The occurrence frequency and volumetric frequency were used to quantify the food items. We analyzed the stomach contents of 283 individuals, 134 of H. scomberoides and 149 of P. squamosissimus. Fish were the most consumed food item by both piscivorous species. However, H. scomberoides mostly ingested pelagic fish (e.g. Characiformes fishes and Prochilodus nigricas Spix & Agassiz, 1829), while P. squamosissimus mostly consumed benthic fish [e.g. Pimelodus blochii Valenciennes, 1840 and Tenellus trimaculatus (Boulenger, 1898)]. Hydrolycus scomberoides presented the trophic level 3.55 for both periods analyzed, while P. squamosissimus 4.01 in the flood period and 3.82 in the drought period. Seasonal variations in the diet of H. scomberoides and P. squamosissimus were observed (PERMANOVA). Specifically, P. squamosissimus consumed mainly "Siluriformes" fishes and P. blochii in the drought period. The trophic niche breadth of P. squamosissimus was greater than that of H. scomberoides in the flood period. The species P. squamosissimus and H. scomberoides had low (0.35) food niche overlap in both seasons analysed. The data indicated that P. squamosissimus has a generalist feeding habit, while H. scomberoides is specialized in prey selection. The overlap of food niche between the species in both periods of the hydrological cycle was low, indicating that niche partitioning was probably the main mechanism of coexistence of these species, with little relationship with variations of the hydrological cycle.

AB In this study, we evaluated the isolated effects of interannual and decadal time scales on the water balance of the Amazon basin. This research is interesting because it brings the dynamical response of water balance components to a particular ocean-scale variability. For this, we used the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) and SST filtering techniques. The impact of isolated interannual and decadal time scales was quantified for episodes of ENSO and the Atlantic dipole (AD). The results show that isolated interannual scales weaken the impacts of El Nino and La Nina on water balance components in the northern Amazon and northeastern Brazil. Such weakening is more evident in episodes of El Nino than in those of La Nifia. This indicates that El Nino is more dependent on other time scales (in addition to interannual) than is La Nina. In relation to the Atlantic, a positive AD increases (decreases) precipitation in the northern (southern) Amazon basin in the experiment with all SST time scale variabilities. On the other hand, when the decadal scale is isolated, an increase in precipitation in the northern basin is not observed, losing the dipole pattern in the precipitation anomaly between the northern and southern Amazon basin. BAM is not sensitive to a negative AD when SST is isolated in the decadal scale. These results are important for monitoring the climate of humid tropical regions, mainly for the study of ENSO, since, according to recent research, these extreme events will be increasingly frequent and intense.

AB This study presents an updated checklist of angiosperms from the Inhamum Municipal Environmental Protection Area (IMEPA), municipality of Caxias, a strategic area for understanding the Cerrado flora in the State of Maranhao, Brazil. The data presented provides information on the most representative taxa, number of collections, physiognomies of occurrence, life forms, endemicity to Brazil, new records for the State and a floristic similarity analysis with other Cerrado areas in this State. A total of 16 field excursions were carried out from January 2018 to June 2019, with random collections of fertile specimens made mostly on trails. We found 228 species of angiosperms distributed in 148 genera and 50 families. The most representative family was Leguminosae, with 54 species and 33 genera. Cyperus (Cyperaceae) was the most representative genus with seven species. A total of 40 species are endemic to Brazil, and ten are new occurrences for the State of Maranhao. The similarity analysis showed that the composition of angiosperm species from IMEPA is closer to that from the Buriti do Meio Environmental Protection Area, another conservation unit located in the same mesoregion within the State of Maranhao. Nonetheless, low similarity values were recorded, demonstrating an exclusive local richness in the analyzed areas. This study contributed to the knowledge of the Cerrado flora from the State of Maranhao, filling in the Cerrado diversity gaps in Northern Brazil.

AB The objectives of the study were to determine and compare species richness and abundance of weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) from leaf litter of oak forests from 3 isolated mountain ranges with different disturbance regimes in the state of Queretaro, Mexico. A total of 1,099 weevils were collected from 639 litter samples with total weevil densities averaging 1.72 +/- 1.31 individuals per 0.5 m(2). Nineteen genera and 49 species were recorded with an estimated richness of 69.23 (Chao 1). All but 2 weevil genera have been previously reported from cloud forests of southern Mexico, and most species (88%) represented undescribed taxa. Fewer than 25% of the species were shared among the 3 sites. The differences in species richness and abundance between paired plots with different disturbance regimes were most marked in the least disturbed sites in Final de Amoles and San Joaquin. Results indicate that leaf litter weevil communities in oak forests of central Mexico are similar in taxonomic composition and richness to cloud forests from southern Mexico and that even small, moderately disturbed fragments may be sufficient to maintain their populations.

AB Cybistax antisyphilitica (Bignoniaceae) is extensively distributed in the Cerrado biome, from typical savannas to forest formations. In these areas, light varies widely in both time and space. The aim of this study was to investigate the initial growth and physiological responses of potted C. antisyphilitica seedlings to natural light conditions. To this end, we cultivated one group of seedlings under full sunlight (FS), a second group under a small gap with medium transmittance (MT) and a third group under canopy shade with low transmittance (LT), in an urban fragment of a tropical semideciduous forest. The daily course of chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured at the beginning, middle and end of the dry season. Also, at the end of the experiment, measurements of leaf gas exchange and growth were carried out. Dynamic photoinhibition was found in seedlings under FS. The photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance and transpiration rates were higher under FS compared to seedlings under LT conditions. Overall, the stem diameter, the dry mass of leaves and stem, total dry mass and relative growth rate were higher in plants under FS and MT than plants under LT. Cybistax antisyphilitica allocated less biomass to stems and leaves and more to the roots, independent of growth conditions. The plasticity at leaf level suggests that C. antisyphilitica can exploit the heterogenous light environment of the semideciduous forest, but the massive development of the roots can contribute to its tolerance to dry periods typical of the Cerrado biome.

AB Aims The Iberian oak wood-pastures are unique agroforestry systems supporting high levels of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Small rocky outcrops are geological features commonly found in these systems and constitute biodiversity reservoirs, protecting sensitive species from grazing and farming activities. We aimed to assess the relevance of including rocky outcrop conservation within wood-pastures to increase biodiversity. To achieve this goal, we studied the plant communities occurring within the outcrops and in the wood-pasture matrix to evaluate the impact of rocky outcrops on the overall plant taxonomic and functional diversities of these systems. Location Montemor-o-Novo (Alentejo, Portugal). Methods We sampled 102 plant communities occurring in outcrops and the adjacent wood-pasture matrix, and analysed alpha, beta, gamma and functional diversities. We identified the main intrinsic factors affecting outcrop plant composition and their functional groups using Linear and Generalized Linear Mixed models, and characterized the effect of outcrop size through Generalized Additive Models. Results We found plant richness to be similar in wood-pasture matrix and outcrops. However, beta-diversity analysis revealed a high species turnover between both communities. Functional indices indicated higher plant functional diversity in outcrops and trait analyses identified three functional groups dissimilarly distributed in both communities: (a) perturbation- and stress-sensitive plants, with outcrops constituting an important refuge for this group; and (b) grazing-tolerant and (c) weedy herbs dominating the wood-pastures. Finally, we also found increased plant richness in outcrops with a longer length for their minor axis, i.e. wider outcrops, and greater rock cover area. Conclusions Our results indicate that the presence of small rocky outcrops in evergreen oak wood-pastures greatly increases their gamma and functional diversities. Consequently, outcrop protection strongly impacts overall wood-pasture biodiversity and underlines the suitability of including outcrop conservation as a cost-effective solution capable of increasing biodiversity in these agroforestry systems.

AB We explored a 320-km transect in the Tumucumaque mountain range along the border between southern French Guiana and Brazil, sampling all trees and lianas with DBH >= 10 cm in seven 25 x 25-m plots installed near seven boundary milestones. We isolated DNA from cambium tissue and sequenced two DNA barcodes (rbcLa and matK) to aid in species identification. We also collected fertile herbarium specimens from other species (trees/shrubs/herbs) inside and outside the plots. The selected DNA barcodes were useful at the family level but failed to identify specimens at the species level. Based on DNA barcoding identification, the most abundant families in the plots were Burseraceae, Fabaceae, Meliaceae, Moraceae, Myristicaceae and Sapotaceae. One third of the images of sampled plants posted on the iNaturalist website were identified by the community to species level. New approaches, including the sequencing of the ITS region and fast evolving DNA plastid regions, remain to be tested for their utility in the identification of specimens at lower taxonomic levels in floristic inventories in the Amazon region.

AB Large-scale patterns of biodiversity and the underlying mechanisms that regulate these patterns are central topics in biogeography and macroecology. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau serves as a natural labo-ratory for studying these issues. However, most previous studies have focused on the entire Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, leaving independent physical geographic subunits in the region less well understood. We studied the current plant diversity of the Kunlun Mountains, an independent physical geographic subunit located in northwestern China on the northern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We integrated measures of species distribution, geological history, and phylogeography, and analyzed the taxonomic richness, phylogenetic diversity, and community phylogenetic structure of the current plant diversity in the area. The distribution patterns of 1911 seed plants showed that species were distributed mainly in the eastern regions of the Kunlun Mountains. The taxonomic richness, phylogenetic diversity, and genera richness showed that the eastern regions of the Kunlun Mountains should be the priority area of biodiversity conservation, particularly the southeastern regions. The proportion of Chinese endemic species inhabiting the Kunlun Mountains and their floristic similarity may indicate that the current patterns of species diversity were favored via species colonization. The Hengduan Mountains, a biodi-versity hotspot, is likely the largest source of species colonization of the Kunlun Mountains after the Quaternary. The net relatedness index indicated that 20 of the 28 communities examined were phylo-genetically dispersed, while the remaining communities were phylogenetically clustered. The nearest taxon index indicated that 27 of the 28 communities were phylogenetically clustered. These results suggest that species colonization and habitat filtering may have contributed to the current plant diversity of the Kunlun Mountains via ecological and evolutionary processes, and habitat filtering may play an important role in this ecological process.

AB The Brazilian government intends to complete the paving of the BR-319 highway, which connects Porto Velho in the deforestation arc region with Manaus in the middle of the Amazon Forest. This paving is being planned despite environmental legislation, and there is concern that its effectiveness will cause additional deforestation, threatening large portions of forest, conservation units (CUs), and indigenous lands (ILs) in the surrounding areas. In this study, we evaluated environmental degradation along the BR-319 highway from 2008 to 2020 and verified whether highway maintenance has contributed to deforestation. For this purpose, we created a 20 km buffer adjacent to the BR-319 highway and evaluated variables extracted from remote sensing information between 2008 and 2020. Fire foci, burned areas, and rainfall data were used to calculate a drought index using statistical tests for a time series. Furthermore, these were related to data on deforestation, CUs, and ILs using principal component analysis and Pearson's correlation. Our results showed that 743 km(2) of forest was deforested during the period evaluated, most of which occurred in the last four years. A total of 16,472 fire foci were identified. Both deforestation and fire foci occurred mainly outside the CUs and ILs. The most affected areas were close to capital cities, and after resuming road maintenance in 2015, deforestation increased outside the capital cities. Current government policy for Amazon occupation promotes deforestation and will compromise Brazil's climate goals of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and deforestation.

AB The bryophytes form a conspicuous group of the planet's flora, their ecological contribution in terms of species richness and coverage in many habitats is essential for the balance of ecosystem. In Colombia there is an approximate record of 715 species of Marchantiophyta (liverworts), which present their greatest richness in the Andean region. The study was carried out in the Chingaza National Natural Park -Suasie sector given its ecological and water importance for the surrounding municipalities. The main objective of this study was to determine the diversity of the liverwort community in the Suasie sector of the Chingaza NNP. For this, three surveys were made in transects of 2x50 m in an altitude gradient, in each transect the liverworts present from four phorophytes (trees and shrubs), chosen at random were sampled. The collected samples were identified for analysis of composition and diversity of the community. As a result, it was possible to demonstrate the variation in the composition and abundance of liverworts along the gradient, based not only on the estimated indices, but also on the association with the vegetation cover of each sampling site. With a total of 47 registered species, the high diversity of the sector under study is supported. In this way, the richness found in this gradient contributes to current and future conservation strategies for the park.

AB This study represents an unprecedented effort to assess the diversity of rocky infralittoral decapods Brachyura and Anomura from the Marine State Park of Laje de Santos, a preserved and protected area located in the southeastern Brazilian coast. Sampling was carried out quarterly for 1 year, using the combination of artificial refuge substrate (ARS) for the passive capture of specimens, and SCUBA diving for active capture. A total of 987 individuals distributed into 32 species, 22 genera, and 11 families were determined. We present a taxonomic account of the species and their distribution records are discussed. The hermit crab Pagurus brevidactylus and the crab Mithraculus forceps were the most common species of Anomura and Brachyura, respectively. As expected, the combination of the sampling methodologies showed a higher Shannon diversity index value (H = 5.7), than the individual methods of ARS (H = 5.6) and active capture (H = 4.4). This study provides the first record of decapod crustaceans for the park, therefore it can be used as a baseline for local fauna monitoring programs and conservation planning.

AB The two mammalian carnivores, puma (Puma concolor) and South American grey fox (Lycalopex griseus) were studied, in a remote area located in the humid temperate forest of the coastal range of southern Chile. A total of six locations were selected in three landscapes: pre-mountain range, mountain range, and coast. The chosen study locations are relevant because they correspond to threatened areas with different levels of human intervention., so they offer the ideal setting for studying how different species of carnivores respond to both human presence and activities. A dataset was collected for 24 months during 2016-2018 through photo-trapping (13 camera traps placed along 50 photo-trap stations). Wes estimated the apparent occurrence and relative abundance index (RAI) of the fauna registered, by means of generalized linear models to contrast those of an apex predator, such as the puma and a sympatric mesopredator, the South American grey fox, across the three landscapes. The ecological variables assessed were the RAI of the other carnivore considered, exotic carnivores such as dogs and cats, human intervention, farmland effect, prey availability, and habitat quality. The primary hypothesis was that the apparent occurrence and RAI of puma and fox would be positively associated with the RAI of prey and livestock and negatively with human intervention. On the other hand, the secondary hypothesis dealt with the interactions between puma and fox faced with different degrees of human intervention. The results showed that the apparent occurrence of the puma was statistically explained by location only, and it was highest at the mountain range. The apparent occurrence of foxes was explained by both puma apparent occurrence and relative integrated anthropization index (INRA), being highest in the pre-mountain range. Concerning the RAI of pumas, high values were yielded by location and fox RAI. For the RAI of foxes, they were location, puma RAI, and INRA. It can be suggested that eucalyptus plantations from the pre-mountain range could offer an adequate habitat for the puma and the fox, but not the coastal range, as the mountain range could be acting as a biological barrier. Due to the nature of the data, it was not possible to detect any relevant effect between the two carnivores' considered, between their respective preys, or the very abundant presence of dogs.

AB Density dependence and habitat heterogeneity have been recognized as important driving mechanisms that shape the patterns of seedling survival and promote species coexistence in species-rich forests. In this study, we evaluated the relative importance of density dependence by conspecific, heterospecific, and phylogenetically related neighbors and habitat heterogeneity on seedling survival in the Lienhuachih (LHC) Forest, a subtropical, evergreen forest in central Taiwan. Age-specific effects of different variables were also studied. We monitored the fates of 1,642 newly recruited seedlings of woody plants within a 25-ha Forest Dynamics Plot for 2 years. The effects of conspecific, heterospecific, and phylogenetically related neighbors and habitat heterogeneity on seedling survival were analyzed by generalized linear mixed models. Our results indicated that conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) had a strong impact on seedling survival, and the effects of CNDD increased with seedling age. Heterospecific positive density dependence (HPDD) and phylogenetic positive density dependence (PPDD) had a significant influence on the survival of seedlings, and stronger HPDD and PPDD effects were detected for older seedlings. Furthermore, seedling survival differed among habitats significantly. Seedling survival was significantly higher in the plateau, high-slope, and low-slope habitats than in the valley. Overall, our results suggested that the effects of CNDD, HPDD, PPDD, and habitat heterogeneity influenced seedling survival simultaneously in the LHC subtropical forest, but their relative importance varied with seedling age. Such findings from our subtropical forest were slightly different from tropical forests, and these contrasting patterns may be attributed to differences in abiotic environments. These findings highlight the importance to incorporate phylogenetic relatedness, seedling age, and habitat heterogeneity when investigating the impacts of density dependence on seedling survival that may contribute to species coexistence in seedling communities.

AB Introduced grasses can aggressively expand their range and invade native habitats, including protected areas. Miscanthus sinensis is an introduced ornamental grass with 100+ cultivars of various invasive potential. Previous studies have demonstrated that the invasive potential of M. sinensis cultivars may be linked to seed viability, and some of the physiological traits, such as growth rate. Little is known, however, about whether these traits are associated with response of M. sinensis to insect herbivory, and whether plant tolerance and resistance to herbivory vary among its cultivars; which, in turn, can contribute to the invasive potential of some of M. sinensis cultivars. To address this issue, in our study we explored the response of five cultivars of M. sinensis to herbivory by Melanoplus grasshoppers. We demonstrated that plant responses varied among the cultivars during a season; all the cultivars, but "Zebrinus", demonstrated a significant increase in plant tolerance by the end of the growing season regardless of the amount of sustained leaf damage. Different patterns in plant responses from "solid green" and "striped/spotted" varieties were recorded, with the lowest plant resistance detected for "Autumn Anthem" in the cage experiment. Our results have important applications for monitoring low-risk invaders in protected areas, as well as for biotic resistance of native communities to invasive grasses.

AB Background: Tropical montane forests are important reservoirs of carbon and biodiversity but are threatened by deforestation and climate change. It is important to understand how forest structure and aboveground biomass change along gradients of elevation and succession. Questions: What are the interactive effect of elevation and two stages of succession on forest structural parameters? Studied species: Tree communities. Study site and dates: Cofre de Perote, Veracruz, Mexico. August to December 2015. Methods: We studied four sites along an elevational gradient (500, 1,500, 2,500, and 3,500 m). At each elevation and each forest type, we established five 20 x 20 m plots (n = 40 plots). Within each plot, we measured stem density, mean diameter at breast height (dbh), and tree height and derived basal area and aboveground biomass (AGB). Results: AGB peaked at 2,500 m and was significantly related to elevation and succession, with higher values in old-growth forests than in secondary forests at higher altitudes. Lower values of mean dbh and basal area were found at higher elevations. At the lowest elevation, both successional stages had the same values of stem density and AGB. At both lower elevations, secondary forests had higher values of dbh and basal area. There were high biomass stocks in the old-growth forest at 2,500 and 3,500 m. Conclusions: Old-growth forests at higher elevations are threatened by deforestation, consequently these remaining fragments must be preserved because of their storage capacity for biomass and their ability to mitigate climate change.

AB Environmental factors and dispersal can influence the structure of biological communities. Their effects can depend on the functional features of the species in the community. Since species belonging to the same trophic level, such as phytoplankton, may show functional differences, we investigated whether the effects of environment and dispersal differ among phytoplankton species from different functional groups. We analyzed data from a rainy and a dry period in 30 reservoirs in a subtropical region. In both periods, the environment as well as high and limited dispersal influenced the metacommunity structure. The functional groups had a low correspondence in their response to both dispersal and environment. Our results showed that the influence of the processes underlying the structure of the metacommunities, such as species sorting (environment influence), mass effect (high dispersal), and neutral dynamics (limited dispersal), depended on the functional characteristics of the organisms and could vary even among species of the same trophic level. These findings suggested that species at the same trophic level could not be considered ecological equivalents. This paper includes a Portuguese and Spanish version of the abstract in the online resources.

AB Limited groundwater resources and their overexploitation have become major challenges for sustainable development worldwide. In this study, an innovative hybrid approach was proposed to generate a groundwater spring potential map (GSPM) from the Sarab plain located in Lorestan Province, Iran, which includes the new best-worst method (BWM), stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA), support vector machine learning method (SVR), Harris hawk optimization (HHO), and bat algorithms (BA). The first step involved the inventory of a map prepared to contain 610 spring locations. Randomly, 70% of the spring points were selected as training data, and the remaining 30% were selected for validation. Based on the review of the literature and available data, thirteen factors were generated as independent variables. The BWM and SWARA methods were used to identify correlations between the occurrence of springs and factors. Finally, using SVR-BA and SVR-HHO hybrid models, potential maps of groundwater springs were generated and then evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and several statistical evaluators such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa index. Validation of the training data set showed that the success rates for the SWARA-SVR-BA, SWARA-SVR-HHO, BWM-SVR-BA, and BWMSVR-HHO models were 92.6%, 93.7%, 95.9%, and 96.4%, respectively. The results revealed that with a small difference, BWM-SVR-HHO performed better in training compared to other models. Evaluation of the prediction rate showed that the values of the area under the ROC curve for SWARA-SVR-BA, SWARA-SVR-HHO, BWM-SVR-HHO, and BWM-SVR-BA were 91.7%, 92.4%, 93.3%, and 94.7%, respectively. According to the results, although all models had excellent performance with more than 90% accuracy, BWM-SVR-BA was more accurate in predicting. The hybrid models presented in this study can be used as an accurate and effective methodology to improve the results of spatial modeling of the probability of groundwater occurrence.

AB Biogeographic patterns in microorganisms are poorly understood, despite the importance of microbial communities for a range of ecosystem processes. Our knowledge of microbial ecology and biogeography is particularly deficient in rare and threatened ecosystems. We tested for three ecological patterns in microbial community composition within ephemeral wetlands-vernal pools-located across Baja California (Mexico) and California (USA): (1) habitat filtering; (2) a latitudinal diversity gradient; and (3) distance decay in community composition. Paired water and soil samples were collected along a latitudinal transect of vernal pools, and bacterial and archaeal communities were characterized using 16S rDNA sequencing. We identified two main microbial communities, with one community present in the soil matrix that included archaeal and bacterial soil taxa, and another community present in the overlying water that was dominated by common freshwater bacterial taxa. Aquatic microbial communities were more diverse in the north, and displayed a significant but inverted latitudinal diversity pattern. Aquatic communities also exhibited a significant distance-decay pattern, with geographic proximity, and precipitation explaining part of the community variation. Collectively these results indicate greater sensitivity to spatial and environmental variation in vernal pool aquatic microbial communities than in soil microbial communities. We conclude that vernal pool aquatic microbial communities can display distribution patterns similar to those exhibited by larger organisms, but differ in some key aspects, such as the latitudinal gradient in diversity.

AB This article explores the distributional data of 2440 occurrence records for 1415 Tipulomorpha (Insecta: Diptera) species to search endemism patterns in the Afrotropical region and to propose a regionalisation scheme. The results were compared to areas of endemism proposed in previous works for other taxa. Areas of endemism were established using NDM/VNDM based on a grid size of 8 degrees and consensus cut-off of 24%. In this study, five subregions were found: Arabian, Atlantic, Indian, Southern Africa and Central Africa. These subregions are divided into 12 dominions: Arabian Peninsula, Atlantic Islands, Central Africa, Central Madagascar, Eastern Africa, Indian Ocean, Northwestern Africa, Southeastern Africa, Southern Africa, Southern Madagascar, Southwestern Africa and Western Africa. There is a general congruence of the dominions with the distribution of the main hydrographic basins and divisions of the forests of Madagascar.

AB Landscape conversion of natural environments into agriculture and pasture are driving a marked biodiversity decline in the tropics. Consequences of fragmentation might depend upon habitat amount in the landscape, while the quality of remnants can also affect some species. These factors have been poorly studied in relation to different spatial scales. Furthermore, the impacts of these human-driven alterations may go beyond species loss, possibly causing a loss of ecosystem function and services. In this study, we investigated how changes in landscape configuration (patch size and isolation), habitat loss (considering a landscape gradient of 10, 25, and 40% of remnant forest cover), and habitat quality (forest structure) affect small mammal abundance, richness, taxonomic/functional diversity, and species composition in fragmented landscapes of semideciduous forests in the Brazilian Cerrado. Analyses were performed separately for habitat generalists and forest specialists. We live-trapped small mammals and measured habitat quality descriptors four times in 36 forest patches over the years 2018 and 2019, encompassing both rainy and dry seasons, with a total capture effort of 45,120 trap-nights. Regression analyses indicated that the effect of landscape configuration was not dependent on the proportion of habitat amount in the landscape to determine small mammal assemblages. However, both patch size and habitat loss impacted different aspects of the assemblages in distinct ways. Smaller patches were mainly linked to an overall increase in small mammal abundance, while the abundance of habitat generalists was also negatively affected by habitat amount. Generalist species richness was determined by the proportion of habitat amount in the landscape. Specialist richness was influenced by patch forest quality only, suggesting that species with more demanding habitat requirements might respond to fragmentation and habitat loss at finer scales. Taxonomic or functional diversity were not influenced by landscape structure or habitat quality. However, patch size and habitat amount in the landscape were the major drivers of change in small mammal species composition in semideciduous forests in the Brazilian savanna.

AB Seed dispersal and predation are critical processes for plant recruitment which can be affected by fire events. We investigated community composition of small mammals in gallery forests with distinct burning histories (burned or not burned similar to 3 years before) in the Cerrado (neotropical savanna). We evaluated the role of these animals as seed removers of six native tree species, potentially mediated by the occurrence of fire. We sampled four previously burned sites and four unburned ones. Seed removal was assessed using two exclusion treatments: exclusive access of small rodents and access of all seed-removing vertebrates. The previous burning changed the structural characteristics of the forests, increasing the density of the understory vegetation and herbaceous cover, which determined differences in species composition, richness, and abundance of small rodents (abundance in the burned forests was 1/6 of the abundance in the unburnt ones). Seed removal rates across the six species were reduced in burnt forests in both treatments and were higher for the "all vertebrates" treatment. Other vertebrates, larger than small rodents, played a significant role as seed removers for five of the six species. The effects of fire were consistent across species, but for the two species with the largest seeds (Hymenaea courbaril and Mauritia flexuosa) removal rates for both treatments were extremely low in the burned forests (<= 5%). The observed decline in small rodent seed predation in the burned forests may have medium to long-term consequences on plant communities in gallery forests, potentially affecting community composition and species coexistence in these forests. Moreover, fire caused a sharp decline in seed removal by large mammals, indicating that the maintenance of dispersal services provided by these mammals (mainly the agouti Dasyprota azarae) for the large-seeded species may be jeopardized by the burning of gallery forests. This burning would also affect several small mammal species that occur in the surrounding typical savanna habitats but also use these forests. Fire events have been increasing in frequency and intensity because of human activities and climate changing. This current scenario poses a serious threat considering that these forests are fire-sensitive ecosystems within the Cerrado.

AB Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) is a widespread feature of life, but it is an open question how ITV affects between-species coexistence. Recent theoretical studies have produced contradictory results, with ITV promoting coexistence in some models and undermining coexistence in others. Here we review recent work and propose a new conceptual framework to explain how ITV affects coexistence between two species. We propose that all traits belong to one of two categories: niche traits and hierarchical traits. Niche traits determine an individual's location on a niche axis or trade-off axis, such that changing an individual's trait makes it perform better in some circumstances and worse in others. Hierarchical traits represent cases where conspecifics with different traits have the same niche, but one performs better under all circumstances, such that there are winners and losers. Our framework makes predictions for how intraspecific variation in each type of trait affects coexistence by altering stabilizing mechanisms and fitness differences. For example, ITV in niche traits generally weakens the stabilizing mechanism, except when it generates a generalist-specialist trade-off. On the other hand, hierarchical traits tend to impact competitors differently, such that ITV in one species will strengthen the stabilizing mechanism while ITV in the other species will weaken the mechanism. We re-examine 10 studies on ITV and coexistence, along with four novel models, and show that our framework can explain why ITV promotes coexistence in some models and undermines coexistence in others. Overall, our framework reconciles what were previously considered to be contrasting results and provides both theoretical and empirical directions to study the effect of ITV on species coexistence.

AB The adoption of diverse resource acquisition strategies is critical for plant growth and species coexistence. Root phosphatase is of particular importance in the acquisition of soil phosphorus (P), yet it is often overlooked in studies of root trait syndromes. Here, we evaluated the role of root phosphatase activity (RPA) within the root economics space and the order-based variation of RPA, as well as the correlations between RPA and a suite of leaf traits and soil properties over a range of evergreen tree species in a subtropical forest. Root phosphatase activity exhibited a high degree of inter-specific variation. We found that there were two leading dimensions of the multidimensional root economics space, the root diameter-specific root length axis (collaboration trait gradient) and the root tissue density-root nitrogen concentration axis (classical trait gradient), and RPA aligned with the former. Root phosphatase activity is used as a 'do it yourself' strategy of soil P acquisition, and was found to be inversely correlated with mycorrhizal colonization, which suggests a trade-off in plant P acquisition strategies. Compared with soil and foliar nutrient status, root traits mattered most for the large inter-specific changes in RPA. Furthermore, RPA generally decreased from first- to third-order roots. Taken together, such diverse P-acquisition strategies are conducive to plant coexistence within local forest communities. The use of easily measurable root traits and their tight correlations with RPA could be a feasible and promising approach to estimating species-specific RPA values, which would be helpful for better understanding plant P acquisition and soil P cycling.

AB Just as the aboveground tree organs represent the interface between trees and the atmosphere, roots act as the interface between trees and the soil. In this function, roots take-up water and nutrients, facilitate interactions with soil microflora, anchor trees, and also contribute to the gross primary production of forests. However, in comparison to aboveground plant organs, the biomass of roots is much more difficult to study. In this study, we analyzed 19 European datasets on above- and belowground biomass of juvenile trees of 14 species to identify generalizable estimators of root biomass based on tree sapling dimensions (e.g. height, diameter, aboveground biomass). Such estimations are essential growth and sequestration modelling. In addition, the intention was to study the effect of sapling dimension and light availability on biomass allocation to roots. All aboveground variables were significant predictors for root biomass. But, among aboveground predictors of root biomass plant height performed poorest. When comparing conifer and broadleaf species, the latter tended to have a higher root biomass at a given dimension. Also, with increasing size, the share of belowground biomass tended to increase for the sapling dimensions considered. In most species, there was a trend of increasing relative belowground biomass with increasing light availability. Finally, the height to diameter ratio (H/D) was negatively correlated to relative belowground biomass. This indicates that trees with a high H/D are not only more unstable owing to the unfavorable bending stress resistance, but also because they are comparatively less well anchored in the ground. Thus, single tree stability may be improved through increasing light availability to increase the share of belowground biomass.

AB Large-scale deforestation leads to habitat loss and fragmentation with major consequences for biodiversity. However, the impacts of these environmental disturbances can be mitigated by forest regeneration. We evaluated the effects of forest fragmentation and vegetation recovery on arthropod assemblages in human-modified landscapes in the Amazon. Arthropods were sampled in 10-ha forest fragments, continuous primary forests, and secondary forests using Malaise traps. We identified arthropods in multiple taxonomic resolutions from order to species. We collected 25,230 arthropods belonging to 17 orders. Coleoptera and Hemiptera were more abundant in secondary forests compared to other habitats. A dipteran family (Clusiidae) and a horse fly species (Dichelacera cervicornis-Tabanidae) were identified as indicators of forest fragments and continuous forests, respectively. Similar levels of taxonomic diversity between habitats were documented. The taxonomic composition also was similar between studied habitats in all taxonomic resolutions. Although the studied landscapes suffered strong environmental disturbances four decades ago, the vegetation has been in continuous regeneration since then, favouring the dispersal of arthropods throughout habitats. Forest fragments and old secondary forests contribute to the maintenance of a rich and diverse arthropod assemblage in landscapes composed of large tracts of continuous primary forests.

AB Overhunting typically increases during and after armed conflicts, and may lead to regional-scale defaunation. The mitigation of hunting impacts is complex because, among other reasons, several intrinsic and extrinsic motivations underpin the elevated deployment of hunting practices. Here we present the first study focusing on these motivations in a post-war zone. Following persistently heavy hunting pressure during the 27-year Angolan civil war, the offtake of small to medium-bodied species has increased recently as a result of large mammal depletion. However, prey choice associated with different motivations varied in terms of species trophic level and body size. While most residents hunted large-bodied species to maximize revenues from wildlife trade, many low-trophic level smaller species were harvested to meet local subsistence demands because they were more palatable and could be captured using artisanal traps near hunters' households. Mainly low-trophic level species were killed in retaliation for crop-raiding or livestock depredation. Considering all game species sampled in this study, 96% were captured to attend two or more motivations. In addition, hunting associated with different motivations was partitioned in terms of age and gender, with prey acquisition for the wildlife trade primarily carried out by adult men, while hunting to meet local subsistence needs and inhibit human-wildlife conflicts were carried out by adult men and women, children and even the elderly. In natural savannah areas lacking fish as a source of protein, a higher number of species was selected to supply both the meat trade and subsistence, while more species in forest areas were targeted for trade in animal body parts and conflict retaliation. Finally, local commerce in bushmeat and other body parts accrued higher domestic revenues compared to any alternative sources of direct and indirect income. However, these financial benefits were at best modest, largely unsustainable in terms of prey population collapses, and generated high long-term costs for the local to regional scale economy and native biodiversity.

AB A mechanistic understanding of how tropical-tree mortality responds to climate variation is urgently needed to predict how tropical-forest carbon pools will respond to anthropogenic global change, which is altering the frequency and intensity of storms, droughts, and other climate extremes in tropical forests. We used 5 years of approximately monthly drone-acquired RGB (red-green-blue) imagery for 50 ha of mature tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to quantify spatial structure; temporal variation; and climate correlates of canopy disturbances, i.e., sudden and major drops in canopy height due to treefalls, branchfalls, or the collapse of standing dead trees. Canopy disturbance rates varied strongly over time and were higher in the wet season, even though wind speeds were lower in the wet season. The strongest correlate of monthly variation in canopy disturbance rates was the frequency of extreme rainfall events. The size distribution of canopy disturbances was best fit by a Weibull function and was close to a power function for sizes above 25 m(2). Treefalls accounted for 74 % of the total area and 52 % of the total number of canopy disturbances in treefalls and branchfalls combined. We hypothesize that extremely high rainfall is a good predictor because it is an indicator of storms having high wind speeds, as well as saturated soils that increase uprooting risk. These results demon-strate the utility of repeat drone-acquired data for quantifying forest canopy disturbance rates at fine temporal and spatial resolutions over large areas, thereby enabling robust tests of how temporal variation in disturbance relates to climate drivers. Further insights could be gained by integrating these canopy observations with high-frequency measurements of wind speed and soil moisture in mechanistic models to better evaluate proximate drivers and with focal tree observations to quantify the links to tree mortality and woody turnover.

AB Genetic variation in foundation tree species can strongly influence communities of trophic-dependent organisms, such as herbivorous insects, pollinators, and mycorrhizal fungi. However, the extent and manner in which this variation results in unexpected interactions that reach trophic-independent organisms remains poorly understood, even though these interactions are essential to understanding complex ecosystems. In pinyon-juniper woodland at Sunset Crater (Arizona, USA), we studied pinyon (Pinus edulis) that were either resistant or susceptible to stem-boring moths (Dioryctria albovittella). Moth herbivory alters the architecture of susceptible trees, thereby modifying the microhabitat beneath their crowns. We tested the hypothesis that this interaction between herbivore and tree genotype extends to affect trophic-independent communities of saxicolous (i.e., growing on rocks) lichens and bryophytes and vascular plants beneath their crowns. Under 30 pairs of moth-resistant and moth-susceptible trees, we estimated percent cover of lichens, bryophytes, and vascular plants. We also quantified the cover of leaf litter and rocks as well as light availability. Four major findings emerged. (1) Compared to moth-resistant trees, which exhibited monopodial architecture, the microhabitat under the shrub-like susceptible trees was 60% darker and had 21% more litter resulting in 68% less rock exposure. (2) Susceptible trees had 56% and 87% less cover, 42% and 80% less richness, and 38% and 92% less diversity of saxicolous and plant communities, respectively, compared to resistant trees. (3) Both saxicolous and plant species accumulated at a slower rate beneath susceptible trees, suggesting an environment that might inhibit colonization and/or growth. (4) Both saxicolous and plant communities were negatively affected by the habitat provided by susceptible trees. The results suggest that herbivory of moth-susceptible trees generated litter at high enough rates to reduce rock substrate availability, thereby suppressing the saxicolous communities. However, our results did not provide a causal pathway explaining the suppression of vascular plants. Nonetheless, the cascading effects of genetic variation in pinyon appear to extend beyond trophic-dependent moths to include trophic-independent saxicolous and vascular plant communities that are affected by specific tree-herbivore interactions that modify the local environment. We suggest that such genetically based interactions are common in nature and contribute to the evolution of complex communities.

AB Years of fire suppression, decreases in herbivores, and global climate change have led to shifts in savannas worldwide. Natural open vegetation such as grasslands and shrublands is increasing in wood density, but the effects for small mammals are not well understood. While most of the mammal studies from the Brazilian Cerrado are concentrated in the core area of this large Neotropical savanna, its southern portions are suffering from biome shifting through woody encroachment. Herein, we surveyed a small mammal community from the southeastern boundary of Cerrado (Santa Barbara Ecological Station) and evaluated the micro and macro environmental variables shaping community structure in order to investigate how the woody encroachment in the last 15 years may have influenced this assemblage. We recorded 17 species of marsupials and rodents along five distinct habitats in a gradient from grasslands to woodlands. Although richness was not affected by microhabitat variables, total and relative abundance varied according to habitat type and in relation to herbaceous, shrub, and tree density. Rodents such as Calomys tener and Clyomys laticeps were positively affected by increasing herb cover, Cerradomys scotti and Oligoryzomys nigripes by shrub cover, while the marsupial Didelphis albiventris had higher association with increasing tree cover. We detected an increase of 27.4% in vegetation density (EVI) between 2003 and 2018 in our study site, and this woody encroachment negatively affected the abundance of some small mammals. The open-area specialists Cryptonanus chacoensis and C. scotti had a decrease in abundance, while D. albiventris and O. nigripes were favored by woody encroachment. Our data suggest that woody encroachment is shifting community composition: small mammals often associated with grasslands and open savannas are likely to be negatively affected by woody encroachment; while species that rely on tree-covered habitats are likely to benefit from an increasing woody landscape. Therefore, forest-dwellers are gradually replacing open-vegetation inhabitants. Active management of open formations (e.g., with prescribed burning) may be needed to maintain Cerrado biodiversity, especially considering the open-area endemics.

AB A long-standing puzzle in ecology is coexistence of many species despite relatively few limiting resources. Studies using competitive community models have found that temporal environmental stochasticity (TES) can provide a solution by providing a rare-species advantage, for example by creating temporal niches. However, this appears to contradict studies using population models, which have found that TES-induced temporal fluctuations in species abundances increase the chance of species becoming rare and hence increase their extinction risk. Here, we clarified how TES affects species richness by analysing a competitive community model using a novel mean-field approach. We found that when temporal correlation in TES was weak, the dominant effect of TES was to create temporal niches by decreasing the strength of interspecific competition via a temporal averaging effect, thereby increasing species richness relative to the neutral case without TES. In contrast, when temporal correlation was strong, the dominant effect of TES was to increase the strength of selection and hence interspecific competition, thereby decreasing species richness. Compared with these indirect community effects of TES, the direct effects of TES on species richness via temporal fluctuations in abundances of species populations were relatively minor.

AB Snappers are marine fishes that inhabit reef ecosystems and have a wide distribution throughout tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. These species are resources of economic importance, there is a lack of biological and ecological knowledge about these species in the studied area, and their meat is highly valued for human consumption. To contribute to the ecological knowledge, this work reports on the feeding habits of four species of snapper: Lutjanus synagris, Lutjanus griseus, Lutjanus analis and Lutjanus apodus, through the identification of stomach contents and a similarity analysis for the diets. Results showed that the most important prey items were crustaceans. Differences were found in the consumption of specific prey: Portunus were mainly consumed by L. griseus; Cronius was consumed by L. apodus; and Pitho was consumed by L. analis and L. synagris. Identification of prey species to genus and species levels allowed the characterization of the feeding habits of these sympatric species and highlighted the need for research programmes focused on crustaceans that guarantee their availability and abundance in the ecosystem.

AB Despite noticeable concern about the deforestation rate worldwide, the forest surface in Europe has considerably expanded over the past centuries as a consequence of the rural exodus and abandonment of agrarian practices. Tree recruitment associated with forest regrowth is a multi-stage process influenced by several biotic and abiotic factors. Yet, it is uncertain whether their influence on recruitment patterns and dynamics varies along a gradient of forest expansion. Similarly, for dioceious species, the influence of tree sex in recruitment is not entirely un-derstood. Here, we aim to elucidate what drives Spanish juniper recruitment in expanding forests. Specifically, we hypothesized that facilitation by conspecifics and heterospecific woody species would occur at the expanding front, where environmental conditions are harsher and that recruitment would be preferably associated to female trees because of the likelihood of mature cones produced by them germinating in the nearby area. The study was conducted in Mediterranean forests of Juniperus thurifera in central Spain. A total of 17 plots were delimited along a gradient of forest expansion including three stages: i) old forests, ii) an intermediate zone and iii) novel forests at the expanding front. Within each plot all J. thurifera individuals (saplings and adults) were mapped. We also recorded bio-volumetric characteristics and tree sex for all adult trees and estimated the percentage of cover of heterospecific woody species within the area of influence of each adult individual. We analysed the spatial pattern of J. thurifera individuals for each stand (plot). Using a novel spatial approach, we evaluated how conspecific (female and male tree sizes) and heterospecific (woody cover) vegetation influenced sapling density along a forest expansion gradient. We also studied the effects of the stage of the forest expansion gradient and the sex of adult trees on the spatial association between adults and saplings. Our results showed that sapling recruitment was negatively influenced by conspecific adult size along the whole gradient, while the effect of heterospecific woody vegetation was always positive. Conspecific facilitation of recruitment in J. thurifera forests occurred at their expanding front where saplings were associated to male adult trees. Despite having been overlooked in conservation policies, recently colonised areas in extreme environments are key targets to implement management measures aimed at achieving forest restoration, which aligns with the Aichi targets and the biodiversity policies of the European Union.

AB The high-elevation Tibetan Plateau (western China) is inhabited by a unique, though not particularly species-rich, community of organisms. We explored the species content and evolutionary history of the Tibetan Plateau endemic freshwater snail genus Tibetoradix. Phylogenetic relationships within the genus were reconstructed based on available sequence data. We used a single-rate Poisson Tree Processes approach for species delimitation and compared putative species-level clades with already described taxa. We found that the genus consists of at least 6 species, of which we described 4 as new to science. Shell and soft body morphology was examined and the radula in Tibetoradix was described for the first time. Based on our findings, the diversification of the genus did not result in a prominent morphological differentiation and a number of species can be regarded as morphologically cryptic. Single species found in different drainage areas indicate relatively good passive dispersal abilities of the snails. The allopatric distribution of the species could result from competitive exclusion between them. The absence of Tibetoradix spp. outside the Tibetan Plateau could be explained by a scenario of an "evolutionary trap", where adaptations to high elevation conditions prevented the taxa from a successful colonization of lower elevations.

AB The concept of a root economics space (RES) is increasingly adopted to explore root trait variation and belowground resource-acquisition strategies. Much progress has been made on interactions of root morphology and mycorrhizal symbioses. However, root exudation, with a significant carbon (C) cost (c. 5-21% of total photosynthetically fixed C) to enhance resource acquisition, remains a missing link in this RES. Here, we argue that incorporating root exudation into the structure of RES is key to a holistic understanding of soil nutrient acquisition. We highlight the different functional roles of root exudates in soil phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) acquisition. Thereafter, we synthesize emerging evidence that illustrates how root exudation interacts with root morphology and mycorrhizal symbioses at the level of species and individual plant and argue contrasting patterns in species evolved in P-impoverished vs N-limited environments. Finally, we propose a new conceptual framework, integrating three groups of root functional traits to better capture the complexity of belowground resource-acquisition strategies. Such a deeper understanding of the integrated and dynamic interactions of root morphology, root exudation, and mycorrhizal symbioses will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying species coexistence and how to explore belowground interactions for sustainable managed systems.

AB Temporal taxonomic changes have been noted in bird communities in protected tropical forests. However, it is not known whether these changes compromise the conservation of functional diversity. Here we monitored bird communities in an Atlantic Forest Protected Area in southern Brazil annually during 10 years. We assess temporal trends in taxonomic and functional diversity metrics and compare the observed functional diversity values with expected values to identify the mechanisms that drive community assembly. We also verified temporal beta diversity and the prevalence of its components. We found variations in species richness over time when assessing the entire community, passerines, non-passerines, and specialized insectivorous passerines. Taxonomic turnover was predominant in the temporal beta diversity of these groups. Nonetheless, no significant variations in functional richness were recognized, indicating functional redundancy between the changing species. However, functional nestedness was predominant in the group of specialist insectivorous passerines, which indicates functional erosion in this group. There were also increases in the dispersion of the entire community and functional divergence in non-passerines. These alterations seem to reflect the occurrence of rare species with unique functional traits and the optimization of the use of available resources. Our data suggest that the communities had random functional structures. Consequently, taxonomic alterations are possible due to random substitution generated by dispersal processes however, the redundancy between species allows overall functional stability of community. We also highlight that different groups of species can present different temporal trajectories and their evaluations are necessary to unveil silent alterations in their functional roles.

AB Wildfire risk is latent in Chilean metropolitan areas characterized by the strong presence of wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs). The Concepcion metropolitan area (CMA) constitutes one of the most representative samples of that dynamic. The wildfire risk in the CMA was addressed by establishing a model of five categories (near zero, low, moderate, high, and very high) that represent discernible thresholds in fire occurrence, using geospatial data and satellite images describing anthropic-biophysical factors that trigger fires. Those were used to deliver a model of fire hazard using machine learning algorithms, including principal component analysis and Kohonen self-organizing maps in two experimental scenarios: only native forest and only forestry plantation. The model was validated using fire hotspots obtained from the forestry government organization. The results indicated that 12.3 % of the CMA's surface area has a high and very high risk of a forest fire, 29.4 % has a moderate risk, and 58.3 % has a low and very low risk. Lastly, the observed main drivers that have deepened this risk were discussed: first, the evident proximity between the increasing urban areas with exotic forestry plantations and, second, climate change that threatens triggering more severe and large wildfires because of human activities.

AB Background The potential benefits of intercropping are manifold and have been repeatedly demonstrated. Intercropping has the potential to create more productive and resilient agroecosystems, by improving land utilisation, yield and yield stability, soil quality, and pest, disease and weed suppression. Despite these potential benefits, significant gaps remain in the understanding of ecological mechanisms that govern the outcomes when crop species are grown together. A major part of plant-plant interactions takes place belowground and these are often overlooked. Scope This review synthesises current evidence for belowground plant-plant interactions of competition, niche differentiation and facilitation, with the aim of identifying root traits that influence the processes contributing to enhanced performance of intercrops compared with monocultures. We identify a suite of potentially complementary root traits for maximising the benefits of intercropping. These traits underpin improved soil exploration, more efficient resource use, and suppression of soil-borne pathogens and pests in intercrops. Conclusion This review brings together understanding of the mechanisms underpinning interactions between intercropped roots, and how root traits and their plasticity can promote positive outcomes. Root trait 'ideotypes' for intercropped partners are identified that could be selected for crop improvement. We highlight the importance of examining belowground interactions and consider both spatial and temporal distribution of roots and rhizosphere mechanisms that aid complementarity through niche differentiation and facilitation. Breeding of crop ideotypes with specific beneficial root traits, combined with considerations for optimal spatio-temporal arrangement and ratios of component crops, are essential next steps to promote the adoption of intercropping as a sustainable farming practice.

AB Aims Plant-soil feedback (PSF) is a key mechanism that can facilitate tree species coexistence and diversity. Substantial evidence suggests that species-specific soil-borne pathogens around adult trees limit the performance of home (conspecific) seedlings relative to foreign (heterospecific) seedlings. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely elusive. Methods Here, we conducted a reciprocal transplant pot experiment using seedlings and from two tree species, Pinus massoniana and Lithocarpus glaber that are dominant and coexist in a subtropical, evergreen, broad-leaf forest in Gutianshan, Zhejiang Province of eastern China. We examined how seedlings from the two tree species responded to soils originating from underneath their own versus the other tree species, using a full-factorial design. Additionally, we added a fungicide (benomyl) to half of the pots to evaluate the role of soil-borne fungi on seedling growth. Important Findings We found that the seedlings from L. glaber grew better in soils that were collected from beneath the canopy of P. massoniana, while seedling growth of P. massioniana was not affected by soil origin. The addition of fungicide benomyl resulted in a shift towards more positive PSF effects for L. glaber, indicating that L. glaber seedlings performed better in their own soils than in soils from P. massoniana in the absence of fungi. Our findings highlight the importance of soil-borne pathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in driving PSF, and indicate that PSF may promote the coexistence of two subtropical tree species by reducing the performance of L. glaber in own soils.

AB Understanding the factors that explain animals' diet diversity is important to comprehend niche partitioning, co-existence, biotic interactions, and the vulnerability of species populations to habitat transformation. Species body mass and their geographical range are positively related to the diversity of food items they consume and consequently with their potential ecological niche occupied. However, the relative weight of these factors to explain diet diversity in mammals is poorly known. Using Artibeina frugivorous bats as a biological model, we evaluate the importance of body mass and ecoregions occupied to explain the diet diversity of these bats. We analyzed our data using phylogenetic correlations and Bayesian statistics techniques. Our results show a stronger phylogenetic correlation between bats' diet diversity with the number of ecoregions they occupied than with their body mass. These results suggest Neotropical frugivorous bats that occupy different habitats had a major possibility to have a higher diet diversity. In addition, these results are related with the 'bottom-up' diet diversity hypothesis that postulates that diet diversity in frugivorous bats is related to ecosystem plant diversity.

AB Forest conservation and management programs rely on precise knowledge of local tree diversity. Distinguishing tree species is a major concern in tropical forest inventories as morphology alone may not be sufficient for species identifications in those highly diverse environments. Therefore, a multi-evidence approach is desirable to avoid subjective interpretations. We tested the contribution of a low-cost integrative protocol for delimiting sympatric species of the taxonomically challenging genus Myrcia (Myrtaceae) in the central Amazon region. We classified specimens into local species by morphotyping them and then validated our hypotheses using two additional sources of evidence: i) near-infrared spectroscopic data, consisting of 1557 absorbance values obtained from dried leaves; and, ii) morphometric data of leaf blade contours, translated into Fourier descriptors and summarized by principal component analysis (PCA), together with four additional leaf characters. The morphotypes were validated using linear discriminant analyses (LDAs) of the raw NIR spectra, stepwise-selected spectral regions, PCA-reduced spectra, as well as the morphometric data. A taxonomic name was assigned to each validated species based on comparisons with herbarium specimens and/or the technical literature. We delimited 38 species of Myrcia, and our hypotheses were well-supported by the LDAs (81-99% accuracy), evidencing that inexpensive tools can be effectively used to discriminate species in large-scale projects, and that integrative approaches are fundamental in that regard. Although vegetative traits were sufficient for species discrimination, fertile samples were crucial for obtaining taxonomic names for them. Thirteen species delimited by us belong to four species complexes, each treated under single species names in the current systematics of the genus. We therefore argue that species delimitations prior to individual identifications are essential for robust species definition in forest plot research because local species do not necessarily match global circumscriptions. This type of approach may greatly alter how local community structures are viewed and consequently modify the results of downstream analyses of ecological studies. We also emphasize that local species delimitations may contribute to the field of taxonomy by identifying potential inconsistencies in global species definitions.

AB Simple Summary There is little information available about the species diversity and distribution patterns of Nepalese ants, as well as their importance in maintaining forest health. A survey of forest ants was conducted in Nepal to learn about their diversity, distribution, and role in forest management. Ants were collected using vegetation beating, sweeping, and hand collection methods in eastern, central, and western Nepal. Seventy ant species from thirty-six genera and six subfamilies were recorded in the study. The research also discovered five genera and nine species new for the country, as well as eight tramp species, four of which are major ecological, agricultural, and/or household pests. The study discovered that western Nepal and the Siwalik region have a relatively high ant diversity. Ant diversity was found to decrease with increasing elevation. The assessment of ant diversity using multiple sampling methods that cover all seasons and forest types may be useful in obtaining complete ant diversity data. Early intervention through sustainable forest management initiatives would aid in preventing invasive ant incursions in the forests of Nepal. The information available on the diversity of ant species and their distribution and interaction with forest health in Nepal remains limited. As part of a nationwide project on forest health, we conducted inventories to assess the diversity and distribution of forest ants and their role in forest management in Nepal. Ants were collected from 187 plots of 10 m x 10 m size along the north-south belt transects in eastern, central, and western Nepal. We used vegetation beating, sweeping, and hand collection methods in selected forest types. In each transect, we designed six plots in each major forest type (Sal, Schima-Castanopsis, and broadleaf mixed forests) and three plots each in deodar, Alnus, riverine, and Cryptomeria forests. We recorded 70 ant species from 36 genera and six subfamilies. This includes five genera and nine species new for the country, as well as eight tramp species, four of which are major ecological, agricultural, and/or household pests. Our study indicates that forest ant species richness is high in western Nepal and the Siwaliks, and it decreases as elevation increases. The high diversity of ant species in the forests of Nepal needs to be assessed with further exploration using multiple sampling methods covering all seasons and forest types. Ants can be useful indicators for ecosystem management and human impacts on forests. Reports of invasive ants in Nepalese forests indicate the relevance of urgent interventions through sustainable forest management initiatives to prevent future incursions.

AB Successional processes in abandoned pastures in the Amazon region have been well-documented for the floristic component; however, soil succession has been poorly studied. This study assessed the physical, chemical and biological responses of soils in the Amazon region during the natural succession process in two main landscapes of the Colombian Amazon. Soil data on soil physico-chemical (bulk density, macroaggregates, pH and minerals) and biological (soil macrofauna) composition were evaluated along chronosequence with four successional stages: (i) degraded pastures, (ii) young (10-20-year-old), (iii) middle-age (25-40-year-old) and (iv) mature forests, in two different landscapes (hill and mountain). Individual soil variables and a synthetic indicator of soil quality (GISQ) were evaluated as tools for natural succession monitoring. The results corroborated the negative impact that cattle ranching has on Amazon soils. After 10 years of natural succession, the physico-chemical and biological soil components were widely restored. Less soil compaction and organic carbon occurred in older successional stages. Soil macrofauna richness and density increased along the chronosequence, with an evident association between the macrofauna composition and the macroaggregates in the soil. None of the individual soil properties or the GISQ indicator discriminated among natural succession stages; therefore, new soil quality indicators should be developed to monitor soil quality restoration in natural successions.

AB center dot Key message We identified the significant spatial relationships between tree species mingling and size inequality in various species-rich natural forests in South China. Forest communities with low species mingling, or segregation of heterospecific trees, exhibited increased segregation of trees with dissimilar sizes. Large trees were more likely to be associated with high species mingling, and variation in neighboring tree sizes would also increase neighborhood species diversity. center dot Context Numerous hypotheses such as Janzen-Connell and herd immunity effects have been proposed to explain the coexistence of diverse species in plant communities. However, these mechanisms for maintaining diversity have been studied primarily through the lens of species diversity, whereas tree size diversity or relationships between size and species diversity resulting from local interactions have rarely been investigated. center dot Aims We aimed to identify relationships between spatial species mingling and tree size inequality using extensive plot data from species-rich forest ecosystems. center dot Methods We applied neighborhood-based methods and explored relationships between spatial species mingling and size inequality indices in 22 large forest plots (30 ha in total) in subtropical and tropical China. center dot Results Forest communities with low species mingling, or segregation of heterospecific trees, exhibited increased segregation of trees with dissimilar sizes. In most plots, large trees (e.g., dbh > 30 cm) were extensively associated with high species mingling, and individual-tree neighborhood species and size diversity were closely correlated. center dot Conclusion Our findings suggest that both the spatial patterns of conspecific dispersal and neighborhood interactions play an important role in determining the spatial patterns of tree size and species diversity and eventually in shaping the structure of forest communities.

AB Legumes in dryland ecosystems face the challenge of maintaining energetically costly symbiosis with N-2-fixing rhizobia, in a water- and nutrient-limited environment. Controlled experiments showed a strong reduction in symbiotic N-2 fixation in response to elevated levels of nitrogen availability, but this regulation of N-2 fixation was not found in dryland field settings. Here, we ask whether regulation of N-2 fixation occurs in the field and what are the possible consequences for dryland soil nitrogen. We measured plant investment in root nodules and rates of bacterial activity, in seedlings and adults of a common N-2-fixing shrub, Calicotome villosa, in five field sites naturally varying in soil nitrogen and phosphorus availabilities. Additionally, we measured nitrogen concentrations and availabilities in the soil under C. villosa and a reference non-fixing shrub. Biomass investment in root nodules was significantly reduced in response to elevated levels of soil nitrate in adult shrubs, but no such effect was found for seedlings. Soil nitrogen concentration under C. villosa shrubs was low compared to the soil under a non-fixing reference shrub. We provide evidence that symbiotic N-2-fixing plants in drylands tightly regulate their investment in symbiotic N-2 fixation, therefore controlling nitrogen inputs into the soil. These findings challenge the long-held notion that the growth of N-2-fixing plants necessarily leads to the accumulation of soil nitrogen in their surroundings over time.

AB Environmental conditions and the spatial arrangement of habitats are thought to play a major role in shaping community assembly during habitat construction and may be key in establishing time lags between habitat establishment and species colonization (colonization credits), and between local species extinction and habitat loss (extinction debts). Despite the importance of soil organisms in ecosystem functioning and their limited dispersal ability, these kinds of shifts in microarthropod communities have rarely been explored. We assessed the roles of the environment and connectivity in soil microarthropod community composition during habitat regeneration in Mediterranean forests. We selected three different forest patches in six study areas: one long-established (pre-1956; LONG) control forest patch, and two recent forest patches (post-1956), one connected (CONN) to and one isolated (ISOL) from the LONG. In each patch, we determined soil temperature, moisture, pH, and fertility and collected soil samples for microarthropod extraction. Our results indicate that the densities of fauna such as oribatid mites and proturans with limited mobility were lower in ISOL than in other forest types; as well, oribatid populations in ISOL were less diverse. Arthropods with greater mobility than the precedent groups, such as collembolans and non-oribatid mites, were present in lower densities in LONG than in other forest types. Oribatid assemblages in the two recent forest patches were more similar to one another than to those in the LONG. Recent forests were mostly dominated by known pioneer species, while LONG was dominated by the typical species found in well-developed organic soils. In conclusion, oribatid density and richness had recovered surprisingly well in CONN, more so than in ISOL and to a similar extent as LONG. However, oribatid assemblages in the recent forests are different from those in long-established forests due to the potential colonization credits and extinction debts triggered by soil development.

AB Understanding the contributions of participants from management practices and those from the local community to protected areas (PAs) as nature reserves, is crucial for forest protection and resource conservation. Thus, empirical studies have usually investigated whether patrolling has significantly improved forest protection action. Many previous studies have exhaustively examined the contributions to forest protection by rangers or local persons, but there has been little research on the contribution of both sides to patrol efforts with separate consideration given to each. This paper explores insights into the patrol efforts in the Nam Tien forest station. The total number of patrollers, walking distances, and working days across years were significantly different between the ranger and local person patrol groups. There was a considerable variation in the number of patrollers (Z = 2.02; p < 0.01), distance (Z = 2.45; p < 0.01) and working days (Z = 2.37; p < 0.01) between rangers and local persons related to monthly patrolling. For the traditional patrols in the various PAs, it is shown that, for long-term forest protection, local persons patrolling should be considered more, in order to achieve the sustainable conservation.

AB The response of tropical trees to the change of light intensity has been reported to be varied among different species. Some reports argued that the growth was increasing parallel to the increasing of light intensity, but other reports mentioned that the sensitivity to the light intensity was depending on the species. Another environmental factor that has been scientifically proven to affect tree growth is humidity. While humidity itself also directly affected by the light intensity in the forest ecosystems. Therefore, it is possible that the growth pattern of trees under different light intensities is also affected by air humidity under the canopy. This research aimed to study the growth response of a light-demanding Alstonia scholaris and a shade-tolerant Eusideroxylon zwageri to the different levels of air humidity and light intensity. The experiment was conducted in Jambi, Indonesia from April to November 2019. The experiment was carried out using split plot design with factorial treatments. The main plot was the air humidity with three levels and the sub plots was light intensity with five levels. Four replicates were applied. In general, the A. scholaris tends to be more sensitive to the humidity and light intensity compared to E. zwageri. In particular, A. scholaris tends to be more sensitive to the light intensity while, E, zwageri is more sensitive to the humidity. However, there is also strong indication that the effects of light intensity to the growth, especially for A. scholaris, was affected by the humidity level.

AB Understanding the direct and indirect effects of niche and neutral processes in structuring species diversity is particularly challenging because environmental factors are often geographically structured. Here, we used Structural Equation Modeling to quantify direct and indirect effects of geographic distance, the Amazon River's opposite margins, and environmental differences in temperature, precipitation, and vegetation density (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI) on ant beta diversity (Jaccard's dissimilarity) across Amazon basin. We used a comprehensive survey of ground-dwelling ant species from 126 plots distributed across eight sampling sites along a broad environmental gradient. We found that geographic distance and NDVI differences were the major direct predictors of ant composition dissimilarity. The major indirect effect was that of temperature through NDVI, whereas precipitation neither had direct or indirect detectable effects on beta diversity. Thus, ant compositional dissimilarity seems to be mainly driven by a combination of isolation by distance (through dispersal limitation) and selection imposed by vegetation density, and indirectly, by temperature. Our results suggest that neutral and niche processes have been similarly crucial in driving the current beta diversity patterns of Amazonian ground-dwelling ants.

AB Insect diversity and biomass have been declining around the world. This might have severe consequences on the environment since insects provide many crucial ecosystem services. One major driver behind the decline is continuous pesticide use which also affects nontarget organisms. Even at low doses, chronic exposure to pesticides may have negative long-term effects. Ants have not received much attention in this context, despite their importance in terrestrial ecosystems. A full factorial experimental design was used to test how ingestion of two widely used pesticides influence colonies of the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior. Colonies were exposed for 12 weeks to the herbicide glyphosate and the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid, separately and in combination. Brood production and the size of new workers and queens produced in these colonies were measured. In addition, the relative densities of two endosymbionts were quantified and immunocompetence tested by measuring survival after fungal infection. The two pesticides in combination decreased brood production, which was measured as the number of produced eggs and pupae. Workers and queens produced in pesticide-exposed colonies differed in body size from individuals produced in control colonies. Furthermore, endosymbiont densities decreased after glyphosate exposure. Neither pesticide influenced survival after fungal infection. The results show that chronic exposure to two widely used pesticides causes apparent trade-offs in reproduction and other physiological traits of ants, potentially decreasing fitness. Even low levels of pesticides in the environment may therefore have negative effects on ant colonies, contributing to the worldwide insect decline.

AB Privately protected areas with voluntary forest protection are promoted as an innovative solution for biodiversity conservation across the globe, particularly in regions where high biological diversity is threatened by agricultural expansion and human disturbance such as the tropical Andes. Colombia alone has over 2000 privately protected areas, but how well private reserves achieve conservation goals is largely unknown. To understand the attributes of reserves that determine success and the types of species conserved, we evaluated regional diversity of medium and large mammals with camera trapping over two years in the western Andes of Colombia. We examined how mammal occupancy was influenced by the size and land use of privately protected areas, landscape-scale variables, and anthropogenic disturbance. We used a multi-species hierarchical framework to assess responses of species and functional groups to environmental covariates. We found that forest in this reserve network retains a diverse mammal assemblage, but low occurrence and restricted species distributions suggest high vulnerability. Forest-restricted species and large species had higher occupancy in larger sites and sites with a higher proportion of forest, regardless of whether a site was designated as a reserve. However, landscape-level measures of connectivity and human disturbance were the strongest predictors of occupancy. Our research indicates that conservation of biodiversity within reserve networks in the Andes will be effective only if these efforts are linked to landscape-level conservation initiatives that conserve large areas of native forest and limit human disturbance across the landscape.

AB Andean forests, a hotspot of biodiversity, have suffered extensive fragmentation, yet we have little understanding of how this process has affected biodiversity. We surveyed bird communities across a gradient of fragment sizes (10-170 ha) and a continuous forest reference site in the Colombian Western Andes. Using a multi-species occupancy model to combine survey data from audio-visual transect surveys, mist netting, and playbacks for owls, we estimated alpha and beta taxonomic and functional diversity. We asked whether (1) habitat amount (patch size), edge effects, or selective logging affect bird occupancy and drive changes to diversity, (2) functional and taxonomic diversity respond similarly to fragmentation, and (3) compositional changes result from species turnover or nested species loss. Species richness declined with decreasing habitat amount, increasing edge density, and increasing disturbance through selective logging. These effects were driven by the loss of forest-dependent species, which were also area sensitive: 30 such species were absent from fragments, even the largest ones (>150 ha). Area-sensitive species were also edge sensitive and increased in occupancy in unlogged forest. We further found high beta diversity (0.78) driven by species turnover (85% of dissimilarity) along the gradient. Despite extensive turnover to non-forest species within functional groups, functional trait richness and dispersion significantly declined with habitat amount. Small fragments may mimic the structure and composition of early-successional Andean forests, driving spatial turnover patterns favoring disturbance-adapted species at the expense of primary-forest specialists. Large forest reserves are therefore required to conserve forest-dependent Andean birds.

AB Human activities are affecting habitats and wildlife populations worldwide. Tropical forests are one of the most affected environments, mainly due to deforestation and poaching. Since high levels of anthropogenic pressure on forest ecosystems, including illegal logging and hunting, occur in southwest Myanmar (Rakhine State), we analyzed the effects of human disturbance on medium to large mammals in this region. We used camera-trapping data collected over three consecutive years to investigate occurrence probabilities of 10 species: five common species exploited for bushmeat consumption, and five threatened species targeted by the illegal wildlife trade. We used a hierarchical single-species multi-season occupancy model implemented in a Bayesian framework to evaluate the effects of human disturbances and persistent habitat characteristics, such as the proportion of remaining pristine evergreen forest and the elevation, on occurrence probabilities. We found that occupancy probabilities of three out of five target species for the illegal wildlife trade were positively linked to forest habitats, whereas among common species hunted for bushmeat consumption the Northern red muntjak and the Malayan porcupine were negatively affected by human presence. The effects of human and habitat covariates were varied for other species of both groups. We confirmed results from previous studies that human disturbance is a driver of occurrence probabilities for some species in tropical areas. Our findings suggest that as protection of rainforest habitat is fundamental to the conservation of tropical ecosystems, law enforcement, patrolling, and local engagement activities are also recommended to mitigate forest and species exploitation. Finally, camera trapping could be a first step to identify areas where human presence affects species occupancy and help local authorities to develop more fine-tuned conservation plans.

AB A growing body of research highlights the decisive role that justice claims play in creating sustainable payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs. Employing Sikor et al.'s approach to the study of justice claims in ecosystem governance along three dimensions-distribution, procedure and recognition-we study the negotiation process behind China's flagship interprovincial PES agreement: the Xin'anjiang River eco-compensation agreement between Huangshan (Anhui province) and Hangzhou (Zhejiang province) prefectures. We find that divergent claims between stakeholders on matters of distributive and procedural justice undercut one party's commitment to the agreement. Local officials in the upstream locality (Huangshan) see themselves as having been disadvantaged in both procedural and distributive aspects of negotiation. They claim to have been insufficiently included in a bargaining process that involved not only the downstream locality (Hangzhou) but also the central government. Huangshan stakeholders also see themselves as largely excluded from the benefits of cleaner water and bearing too much of the pollution abatement cost. For their part, Hangzhou stakeholders have advanced a 'polluters pay' view of distributive justice and found partial support for this claim from Beijing. Our findings suggest that attending to environmental justice considerations should be given top priority in China's design of PES schemes.

AB Existing global regionalization schemes for plants consider the compositional affinities among biotas, but these have not explicitly considered phylogenetic information. Here, we present for the first time, a phytogeographical delineation of the global vascular flora based on species-level evolutionary relationships. We analysed 8737 820 geographical occurrence records for vascular plants together with a time-calibrated phylogeny including 67 269 species. We constructed a global phylogenetic regionalization by estimating species composition and phylogenetic beta diversity among 200 km x 200 km grid cells across the world. We identified de novo 16 phytogeographical units that are deeply split into two clusters: Laurasian and Gondwanan. Our regionalization broadly matches previous schemes, but also highlights the separation of the Gondwanan biota into an Holotropical cluster and an Australian-Neozealandic-Patagonian cluster. In contrast, no clear split among Laurasian and Gondwanan biotas was retrieved when omitting phylogenetic information. The integration of phylogenetic and geographical information provides new insights into the delineation of phytogeographical areas and their historical relationships, enabling the identification of three large, clearly differentiated biotas, here referred to as kingdoms: Holarctic, Holotropical, and Austral. Our results provide further evidence for delineating transition zones and show a clear latitudinal pattern of increasing evolutionary distinctiveness towards the poles.

AB The effect of two drought acclimation treatments-high (HS) or moderated (MS) drought stress-on seedling growth was assessed in the two tree species Caesalpinia platyloba S.Watson (Fabaceae) and Ipomoea wolcottiana Rose (Convolvulaceae) in order to prepare them for dry spells. These species are mainly distributed in mature and disturbed sites, respectively, in a seasonal tropical dry forest in Jalisco, Mexico. Without acclimation, the seedlings of C. platyloba showed low values in both Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), suggesting a conservative biomass allocation, while in I. wolcottiana, the high Relative Growth Rate (RGR), Root: Shoot ratio (R:S), and low SLA suggested seedling drought evasion. After the acclimation period, the seedlings of both species showed reduced biomass allocation to leaves, as indicated by the decrease in Leaf Mass Ratio (LMR). Additionally, increases in R:S suggested greater allocation to water capture during the short growth season. After the dry spell simulation, the control seedlings of C. platyloba showed negative NAR, but the relatively high NAR observed in the seedlings subjected to HS and MS suggested that these treatments were sufficient to endure drought stress. In I. wolcottiana, a sigmoid relationship described that seedlings' RGR rapidly increased when NAR was raised. Contrastingly, in C. platyloba seedlings, the constant RGR increase related to the raise in NAR suggested a conservative use of water. In the I. wolcottiana seedlings, the HS treatment induced leaf abscission. Both species were plastic enough to acclimate to short periods of drought, but different levels of drought stress were necessary to acclimate the seedlings of each species. Suggested drought-acclimation treatments are to water the C. platyloba seedlings at 25% (HS) and I. wolcottiana seedlings at 50% (MS) of field capacity.

AB European bee-eater (Merops apiaster Linnaeus, 1758; Coraciiformes: Meropidae) is known as a bee-predator, but its food spectrum is variable and depends on the current supply. This is the first study focused on the ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) as important prey in the diet of the European bee-eater. In 2017, 9,604 insect prey was obtained from pellets gained from two colonies breeding: (1) underground of a grazed sand dune (Radvan nad Dunajom) and (2) in the sandy wall (Gabcikovo) without pasture, both in southern Slovakia. Five ant taxa were identified, the list of ants in the bee-eater's diet was expanded by three taxa Lasius sp., Camponotus vagus (Scopoli, 1763) and Liometopum microcephalum (Panzer, 1798). In summary, ants represent the second most abundant family (12.35 %) of total prey. Compared to adults, nestlings (15.04 %) ate significantly more ants than adults (10.97 %). To study the ants' composition in the diet of bee-eater near to different types of habitats, the pellets of nestlings were chosen because they more accurately reflect the sources of insect during the breeding season. Differences in the feeding of the European bee-eater nestlings between the grazed and the non-grazed locality were confirmed, where Lasius sp. and Tetramorium sp. highly correlated with grazing site. Moreover, nestlings ate significantly more ants in the area, where an open habitat was managed by grazing (6.55 vs. 15.04 %). The presented research indicates the importance of traditional pastures in the country for ants and also for bee-eaters. These ecosystem engineers are likely to find more microhabitats on the pastures, which has also been reflected in the diet of the nestlings breeding on the grazed site.

AB Genomic data continue to advance our understanding of species limits and biogeographic patterns. However, there is still no consensus regarding appropriate methods of phylogenomic analysis that make the best use of these heterogeneous data sets. In this study, we used thousands of ultraconserved element (UCE) loci from alligator lizards in the genus Gerrhonotus to compare and contrast species trees inferred using multiple contemporary methods and provide a time frame for biological diversification across the Mexican Transition Zone (MTZ). Concatenated maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses provided highly congruent results, with differences limited to poorly supported nodes. Similar topologies were inferred from coalescent analyses in Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography and SVDquartets, albeit with lower support for some nodes. All divergence times fell within the Miocene, linking speciation to local Neogene vicariance and/or global cooling trends following the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. We detected a high level of genomic divergence for a morphologically distinct species restricted to the arid mountains of north-eastern Mexico, and erected a new genus to better reflect evolutionary history. In summary, our results further advocate leveraging the strengths and weaknesses of concatenation and coalescent methods, provide evidence for old divergences for alligator lizards, and indicate that the MTZ continues to harbour substantial unrecognized diversity.

AB Accurate identification of species from timber is an essential step to help control illegal logging and forest loss. However, current approaches to timber identification based on morphological and anatomical characteristics have limited species resolution. DNA barcoding is a proven tool for plant species identification, but there is a need to build reliable reference data across broad taxonomic and spatial scales. Here, we construct a species barcoding library consisting of 1550 taxonomically diverse timber species from 656 genera and 124 families, representing a comprehensive genetic reference data set for Chinese timber species and international commercial traded timber species, using four barcodes (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, and ITS2). The ITS2 fragment was found to be the most efficient locus for Chinese timber species identification among the four barcodes tested, both at the species and genus level, despite its low recovery rate. Nevertheless, the barcode combination matK+trnH-psbA+ITS2 was required as a complementary barcode to distinguish closely related species in complex data sets involving internationally traded timber species. Comparative analyses of family-level discrimination and species/genus ratios indicated that the inclusion of closely related species is an important factor affecting the resolution ability of barcodes for timber species verification. Our study indicates that although nuclear ITS2 is the most efficient single barcode for timber species authentication in China, complementary combinations like matK+trnH-psbA+ITS2 are required to provide broader discrimination power. These newly-generated sequences enrich the existing publicly available databases, especially for tropical and subtropical evergreen timber trees and this current timber species barcode reference library can serve as an important genetic resource for forestry monitoring, illegal logging prosecution and biodiversity projects.

AB A range of hypotheses seek to explain why conifers are infrequent in tropical rainforests. Here, we explore how the conifer, Podocarpus neriifolius, persists at low density in tropical lower montane rainforests of northern Thailand. Recruitment, growth and survival of seedlings and small saplings was monitored for 3.5 years in plots near and away from putative parent trees, and for large saplings and trees in a 16 ha forest plot over 8 years. Seeds and strobili were collected in litterfall traps for 2 years, and pollen rain extracted from forest floor moss samples. Demographic rates and ecophysiological traits of saplings were compared with co-occurring angiosperms Castanopsis acuminatissima and Calophyllum polyanthum. Survivorship was higher in the conifer for all size classes > 30 cm ht (0.97-0.99 y(-1) vs. 0.92-0.98). Growth rate was similar for small saplings (9.3-12.6 cm y(-1) ht), higher in P. neriifolius for large saplings (0.21 cm y(-1) dbh vs. 0.11-0.12), but lower for trees (0.10 cm y(-1) vs. 0.16-0.45). Canopy openness above saplings was similar amongst species (3.2-4.2%), whilst leaf N was lower (1.33% vs. 1.43-1.49%), and mass leaf per area (1.96 vs. 1.88) and delta 13C higher (- 33.4 parts per thousand vs. - 34 to 34.9 parts per thousand) for P. neriifolius. Pollen rain varied between plots, as did strobilus and seed fall between both plots and years, with highest pollen density, strobilus and seed fall close to parent trees, as were areas with highest seedling density and recruitment. High survivorship, high recruitment near parent trees and more widespread recruitment in mast years, offsets slower growth to ensure population persistence of P. neriifolius in angiosperm-dominated rainforest. Low stand density and patchy distribution is best explained by pollen limitation on seed production, with strong recruitment only where male and female trees occur in close proximity, and in mast seed years.

AB Four species of spotted skunks (Carnivora, Mephitidae, Spilogale) are currently recognized: Spilogale angustifrons, S. gracilis, S. putorius, and S. pygmaea. Understanding species boundaries within this group is critical for effective conservation given that regional populations or subspecies (e.g., S. p. interrupta) have experienced significant population declines. Further, there may be currently unrecognized diversity within this genus as some taxa (e.g., S. angustifrons) and geographic regions (e.g., Central America) never have been assessed using DNA sequence data. We analyzed species limits and diversification patterns in spotted skunks using multilocus nuclear (ultra conserved elements) and mitochondrial (whole mitogenomes and single gene analysis) data sets from broad geographic sampling representing all currently recognized species and subspecies. We found a high degree of genetic divergence among Spilogale that reflects seven distinct species and eight unique mitochondrial lineages. Initial divergence between S. pygmaea and all other Spilogale occurred in the Early Pliocene (similar to 5.0 million years ago). Subsequent diversification of the remaining Spilogale into an "eastern" and a "western" lineage occurred during the Early Pleistocene (similar to 1.5 million years ago). These two lineages experienced temporally coincident patterns of diversification at similar to 0.66 and similar to 0.35 million years ago into two and ultimately three distinct evolutionary units, respectively. Diversification was confined almost entirely within the Pleistocene during a time frame characterized by alternating glacial-interglacial cycles, with the origin of this diversity occurring in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States of America. Mitochondrial-nuclear discordance was recovered across three lineages in geographic regions consistent with secondary contact, including a distinct mitochondrial lineage confined to the Sonoran Desert. Our results have direct consequences for conservation of threatened populations, or species, as well as for our understanding of the evolution of delayed implantation in this enigmatic group of small carnivores.

AB Seed dispersal and predation by animals often drive plant regeneration. In tropical savannas, such as the Cerrado of Brazil, fire is also a key process in ecosystem dynamics, consuming the lower vegetation strata and killing wildlife, but how fire affects seed-animal interactions is virtually unknown. We investigated the effects of prescribed fires on the removal of diaspores from Miconia rubiginosa and sunflower Helianthus annuus in Cerrado from southeast Brazil. Using plots burned one month or one year before sampling and unburned controls, we assessed the effect of prescribed fire on microhabitat structure and diaspore removal by vertebrates and ants. Covered microhabitats experienced higher seed removal by vertebrates than open microhabitats, but microhabitat features did not influence seed removal by ants. Prescribed fire did not change the total amount of seed removal, and ants were responsible for most removals in burned and control plots. However, fire increased the importance of ants as agents of removal compared to vertebrates. These changes were probably mediated by changes in microhabitat cover. It is likely that species, whose seeds are often preyed upon by vertebrates, benefit from fire to escape predation, while the opposite would be true for those removed by granivorous ants. By changing microhabitats composition and frequency of seed removal by different agents, fire may create pulses of opportunities for certain plant species to increase their populations and enlarge their spatial distribution, while constraining others. However, how different fire intensities and frequencies influence seed fate of different species is still to be investigated. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

AB Heterospecific pollen deposition (HPD) is ubiquitous across plant communities, especially for generalized species which use a diversity of pollinators, and may have negative effects on plant reproduction. However, it is unclear whether temporal changes in the co-flowering community result in changes in HPD patterns. Moreover, community-level studies are required to understand which factors influence HPD and how the reproduction of different species is affected. We investigated the temporal variation of HPD, its relationship with level of specialization on pollinators and floral phenotypic specialization, and its association with reproductive success (pollen limitation and fruit set) in 31 hummingbird-pollinated plant species in a tropical Campo Rupestre. We found seasonality in HPD, with species flowering in the dry season having greater diversity of heterospecific pollen on stigmas and a higher frequency of stigmas containing heterospecific pollen, compared to the rainy season. Stigmas of ecologically generalized species had more heterospecific pollen, while the relationship for ecologically specialized species depended on floral phenotype. Surprisingly, and in contrast to theory, we found a positive relationship between HPD and reproductive success. Our results indicate benefits of generalization and facilitation, in which sharing pollinators brings greater reproductive success via increased conspecific pollen deposition, even if it incurs more HPD. We demonstrated how assessing HPD at a community-level can contribute to understanding the ecological causes and functional consequences of pollinator sharing.

AB Irrespective of controversies and frustrated efforts, carbon forestry-the sequestering of greenhouse gases in forests-remains a key element of climate change mitigation. Carbon forestry drives regularly rely on a market-based conservation framework, where forest dwellers are remunerated for their service of maintaining forests through dedicated financial instruments routing global funds. In this article, I turn to India's first large-scale carbon forestry project, situated in the hills of Himachal Pradesh, and trace how carbon forestry plots are subjected to different temporal trajectories on different levels. I show that the marketing of emission reduction certificates (CER), underpinning carbon forestry, posits emergent forests as permanent sinks. The administrative procedures of this Indian carbon forestry project, however, aim at providing for these forests for sixty years. Finally, I show that villagers perceive a sense of closure, suspending dedicated care and governance routines as the project appears to dismantle and future payments become uncertain. I argue that these different temporal registers not only reveal contradictions within carbon forestry approaches but they also highlight the fragility of attempts to economize forests through supposedly green financial instruments and, therefore, the limited impact of what might appear as neoliberal agendas, in time.

AB Studies conducted in forests have resulted in much of the ecological theory we build upon today. However, our basic understanding of forest ecology comes almost exclusively from the study of trees, even though they represent only a small fraction of the plant diversity present in forests. In recent decades there has been an increasing number of studies of forest herbs, broadening our understanding of plant community ecology in forest ecosystems. Here we highlight ten recent studies examining patterns and drivers of, as well as threats to, herbaceous plant diversity in forests. We first examine local, regional, and global patterns of herbaceous diversity in forests and how such patterns differ for woody versus herbaceous species. We then focus on ecological mechanisms that contribute to forest herb diversity, including the role of abiotic and biotic interactions. We end by discussing some major anthropogenic impacts on forest herb diversity, identifying where herbs are particularly susceptible or particularly resilient to current and predicted changes in comparison to trees. The studies we feature demonstrate that patterns and drivers of diversity often differ between woody and herbaceous plant communities. To facilitate cross-site comparisons, there is great need for more standardized survey methods for herbaceous plants, for simultaneous measurements of multiple plant growth forms, and for incorporating herbs into long-term forest monitoring networks. In addition, the selected studies reveal how land-use history, overabundant herbivores, invasive species, and climate change are all impacting forest herb communities. Some common characteristics of herbaceous plants, such as limited dispersal and small stature, may make forest herb communities more susceptible to these anthropogenic impacts, while others (e.g., resprouting ability, clonal reproduction) may make them more resilient compared to forest trees. More research is needed from both plant ecologists and applied forest practitioners to predict how herbaceous forest diversity will change in the future.

AB Human-induced wildfires are increasing in frequency in tropical forests, and their deleterious consequences for biodiversity include decreases in seed rain, which may be affected directly by fire or indirectly by the creation of edges between forest and non-forest environments. Understanding seed rain is key to assess the potential for natural regeneration in plant communities. We assessed the impact of fire and fire-created edges on seed rain species richness, abundance, size, weight, and dispersal syndromes in Atlantic Forest remnants in Bahia, Brazil. We assessed seed rain at monthly intervals for an entire year along seven 300 m-long transects placed perpendicular to the edge. We installed seed traps at the edge and at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 150 m into the burnt area and into the forest from forest edge. We recorded a total of 9050 seeds belonging to 250 morphospecies. We did not observe edge influence; however, we detected a lower abundance and proportion of animal-dispersed seeds in the burnt than in the unburnt areas. The seed abundance in the burnt areas was lower and seeds were smaller and lighter than those in the unburnt area. Seed rain in the burnt area was not greater near to the forest than far from it. The abundance and richness of seed rain was positively correlated with tree density. Our findings highlight the lack of seed rain in burnt areas and differences in community composition between the burnt and unburnt areas. Collectively, these results indicate negative consequences on natural regeneration, which can lead to permanent secondarization of the vegetation and challenges for early regeneration of burnt areas, which will initially have impoverished forests due to low seed richness.

AB The distribution and organisation of benthic organisms on tropical reefs are typically heterogenous yet display distinct zonation patterns across depth gradients. However, there are few datasets which inform our understanding of how depth zonation in benthic community composition varies spatially among and within different reef systems. Here, we assess the depth zonation in benthic forereef slope communities in the Central Indian Ocean, prior to the back-to-back bleaching events in 2014-2017. We compare benthic communities between shallow (5-10 m) and deep (20-25 m) sites, at two spatial scales: among and within 4 atolls. Our analyses showed the variation in both major functional groups and hard coral assemblages between depth varied among atolls, and within-atoll comparisons revealed distinct differences between shallow and deep forereef slope communities. Indicator taxa analyses characterising the hard coral community between depths revealed a higher number of coral genera characteristic of the deep forereef slopes (10) than the shallow forereef slopes (6). Only two coral genera consistently associated with both depths across all atolls, and these were Acropora and Porites. Our results reveal spatial variation in depth zonation of benthic communities, potentially driven by biophysical processes varying across depths and atolls, and provide a baseline to understand and measure the impacts of future global climate change on benthic communities across depths.

AB Boron (B) deficiency influences sugar beet development and productivity. A hydroponic set up of experiment was conducted by utilizing different B concentrations to study the impact of different morphological and physiological responses of sugar beet seedlings under B deficiency. The results showed that B deficiency (14 days of stress) inhibited the growth of different plant parts of sugar beet. The B deficiency significantly increased the leaf specific weight (SLW) and the root-shoot ratio of sugar beet seedlings. The activities of peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed a decreasing tendency under B deficiency, while the contents of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O-2(-)) increased with B concentration. Malonaldehyde (MDA) and proline contents were induced at B deficiency. In conclusion, B deficiency significantly reduced dry weight and leaf area, resulting in stunted sugar beet seedlings. It was manifested by a significant decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities and accumulation of ROS in the plant cells, inducing oxidative stress. The current study revealed that B deficiency affects plant growth and various morpho-physiological processes.

AB 1. With ongoing climate change, the probability of crossing environmental thresholds promoting abrupt changes in ecosystem structure and functioning is higher than ever. In drylands (areas where it rains <65% of what could be potentially evaporated), recent research has shown how the crossing of three aridity thresholds [at aridity (1-Aridity Index) values of 0.54, 0.70 and 0.80] leads to abrupt changes on ecosystem structural and functional attributes. Despite the importance of these findings and their implications to develop effective monitoring and adaptation actions to combat climate change and desertification, we lack a proper understanding of the mechanisms unleashing these abrupt shifts.
   2. Here we review multiple mechanisms that may explain the existence of aridity thresholds observed across global drylands, and discuss the potential amplification mechanisms that may underpin hypothetical abrupt temporal shifts with climate change.
   3. We propose that each aridity threshold is caused by different and specific mechanisms. The first threshold is mainly caused by physiological mechanisms of plant adaptation to water shortages. The second threshold is unleashed by different mechanisms involving soil processes and plant-soil interactions such as soil erosion, plant community shifts and nutrient cycling and circulation. The collapse of vegetation observed once the third aridity threshold (0.8) is crossed is caused by the mechanisms related to the survival limits of plants that may cause sudden cover and diversity losses and plant-atmospheric feedbacks that link vegetation collapse with further climate aridification.
   4. By identifying, revising and linking relevant mechanisms to each aridity threshold observed, we provide a set of specific hypotheses and identify knowledge gaps concerning the study of threshold emergence in drylands. We were also able to establish plausible factors that are context dependent and may influence the occurrence of abrupt ecosystem changes in time. Our review may help to focus future research efforts on aridity thresholds and to develop strategies to monitor, adapt to or even revert abrupt ecosystem changes across global drylands.

AB Unravelling the drivers of forests dynamics is one of the main challenges in tree community ecology. These drivers include niche differentiation, dispersal limitation and stochasticity. Previous work has demonstrated that these mechanisms likely interact such that no one process is responsible for forest dynamics. One possibility is that the functional composition in a forest changes in a deterministic fashion, but the abundances of individual species that are functionally similar and have similar life-history strategies drift in a neutral fashion. This framework aligns with the functional group-based version of the neutral theory proposed more than 30 years ago, but it has remained poorly understood and is not well-integrated in tree community ecology. To investigate the possibility that determinism and neutrality may operate on the functional and species levels, respectively, we studied the long-term dynamics of trees on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Specifically, we sorted tree species into functional groups. We defined them as groups of species that cluster together based upon continuous functional trait measurements that are believed to reflect key life-history trade-offs. This information was then used to quantify the observed species and functional group dynamics in the forest and to compare them to that expected from neutral simulations. We found that forest dynamics are likely governed by deterministic processes at the between-functional group level where species relative abundances change or drift through time within group. Species rank distributions for each functional group remained relatively stable suggesting that these groups may act as broad adaptive zones for both common and rare species that may promote species coexistence. Moreover, we found that these functional groups associate with different habitats in the forest. Synthesis. The results indicate that deterministic processes control the relative proportion of each functional group in the tropical forest studied and that individual species within groups may have apparently neutral dynamics. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that observed stable functional group relative proportions can be produced by deterministic or neutral dynamics, which underscores the importance of comparing the observed functional dynamics to that expected under neutral dynamics.

AB Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that as immigration increases, ecological communities transition from a niche-structured regime to an immigration-structured regime. The niche-structured regime is the domain of classic niche models; the immigration-structured regime is the domain of island biogeography and related theories. A recent unified model predicted a biphasic species-area relationship (SAR) arising from the transition between the two regimes, but the generality and scope of this relationship remain unclear. Here we study the transition further to address three key questions: (1) Can MacArthur and Wilson's classic graphical paradigm of intersecting immigration and extinction curves be adapted to capture the niche-structured regime that occurs at low-immigration rates? (2) Do different ecological models predict a similar biphasic SAR? (3) Can the biphasic island SAR be reconciled with the classic triphasic SAR observed in mainland biogeography? On the first point, we find that the transition can be incorporated into MacArthur and Wilson's graphical paradigm by forcing the extinction curves sharply downwards at low species richness, reflecting the stabilizing effect of niche processes. On the second point, we confirm that a variety of simple ecological models produce qualitatively similar biphasic SARs. On the third point, we find that a unified model predicts an overall four-phase SAR with the second phase being a shallow niche-structured phase that is rarely observed in mainland SARs, which we hypothesize is because local communities on mainlands are usually in the immigration-structured regime.

AB Ecological restoration has emerged as a key strategy for conserving tropical forests and habitat specialists, and monitoring faunal recovery using indicator taxa like birds can help assess restoration success. Few studies have examined, however, whether active restoration (AR) achieves better recovery of bird communities than natural regeneration, or how bird recovery relates to habitat affiliations of species in the community. In rainforests restored over the past two decades in a fragmented landscape (Western Ghats, India), we examined whether bird species richness and community composition recovery in 23 actively restored (AR) sites were significantly better than recovery in paired naturally regenerating (NR) sites, relative to 23 undisturbed benchmark (BM) rainforests. We measured eight habitat variables and tested whether bird recovery tracked habitat recovery, whether rainforest and open-country birds showed contrasting patterns, and assessed species-level responses to restoration. We recorded 92 bird species in 460 point-count surveys. Rainforest bird species richness was highest in BM, intermediate in AR and lowest in NR. Contrastingly, open-country bird species richness was least in BM, intermediate in AR and highest in NR. Bird community composition varied significantly across treatment types with composition in AR in transition from NR to BM. Bird community dissimilarity between sites was positively related to dissimilarity in habitat structure and floristics, and geographical distance between sites. Variance partitioning indicated that structural and floristic dissimilarity explained 90% of the variation in community composition. Indicator species analysis revealed significant associations of 34 species with one or more treatment types. Species associated with BM and AR treatment types were all rainforest species, while only 38% of species associated with AR and NR treatment types were rainforest species. Synthesis and applications. We show that active restoration (AR) of degraded fragments benefits rainforest birds and reduces the infiltration of open-country birds, and highlight the importance of considering rainforest and open-country species separately. In human-modified tropical rainforest landscapes, AR of degraded fragments fosters partial recovery and complements protection of mature forests for bird conservation.

AB A decrease in habitat amount and connectivity causes immediate or delayed species extinctions in transformed landscapes due to reduced functional connections among populations and altered environmental conditions. We assessed the effects of present and historical grassland amount and connectivity as well as local habitat factors typical of the present landscape on the current species richness of grassland specialist and generalist plants and arthropods in grassland fragments. We surveyed herbaceous plants, ants, orthopterans, true bugs and rove beetles in 60 dry grassland fragments in Hungary. We recorded the area of the focal grassland, the slope and the cover of woody vegetation. By using habitat maps of the present and historical landscape, we calculated grassland amount and connectivity for four time periods covering 158 years (1858-2016). We found evidence for an unpaid extinction debt in specialist plants, suggesting that they have not come to equilibrium with the grassland amount and connectivity of the present landscape yet. This localised and typically long-lived group responded slowly to the landscape changes. Specialist arthropod taxa with short generation times responded much faster to habitat loss than plants and did not show an extinction debt. Generalist plants and animals adapted to a wide range of habitats were affected by the landscape-scale decline of grassland habitats. Despite decreased habitat connectivity, grassland fragments with dry environmental conditions and high environmental heterogeneity can sustain specialist plants in transformed landscapes. Unpaid extinction debt should be considered an early warning signal: Restoration of grassland connectivity is necessary to halt ongoing extinction processes.

AB Low mortality rates and slow growth differentiate shade-tolerant from shade-intolerant species and define the survival strategy of juvenile trees growing in deep shade. While radial stem growth has been widely used to explain mortality in juvenile trees, the leaf area ratio (LAR), known to be a key component of shade tolerance, has been neglected so far. We assessed the effects of LAR, radial stem growth and tree height on survival time and the age-specific mortality rate of juvenile Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech), Acer pseudoplatanus L. (sycamore maple) and Acer platanoides L. (Norway maple) in a primeval beech forest (Ukraine). Aboveground and belowground biomass and radial stem growth were analysed for 289 living and 179 dead seedlings and saplings. Compared with the other species, F. sylvatica featured higher LAR, slower growth and a lower mortality rate. The average survival time of F. sylvatica juveniles (72 years) allows it to reach the canopy more often than its competitors in forests with low canopy turnover rate. In contrast, a combination of lower LAR, higher growth rate and higher age-specific mortality rate of the two Acer species resulted in their shorter survival times and thus render their presence in the canopy a rare event. Overall, this study suggests that shade tolerance, commonly defined as a relationship between sapling mortality and growth, can alternatively be formulated as a relationship between survival time and the interplay of growth and LAR.

AB The existence of degraded forests is common in the Eastern Amazon. The maintenance of these forests standing and the recovery of their productivity play an important role in the conservation of biodiversity, storage and carbon sequestration. However, the management techniques currently employed are designed for natural forests in the first harvest cycle or lightly explored and do not apply adequately to forests that have gone through several harvest cycles. Therefore, adaptations and the establishment of new management criteria that take into account other characteristics of these types of forests are necessary to ensure their sustainability. The objective of this study was to propose a silvicultural management system that has the potential to recover and perpetuate the productivity of an intensively logged tropical forest. A forest census was carried out on 535.6 ha for trees with dbh >= 25 cm. With these data, the following two treatments were designed: (1) criteria: the BDq method was applied from B = 9.8 m(2) ha(-1), D = 100 cm and q = 2. The criteria for standing wood commercialization were, in this order, first, Health; second, Tree Stem; third, Tree Density and fourth, dbh >= 105 cm. (2) Control: the planning was in accordance with Brazilian regulations. For the cost-benefit and sensitivity analysis, the Net Present Value (NPV) was used and a projection of +/- 20% was made in the commercial price of standing wood. In the criteria treatment, a higher number of trees and species destined for the commercialization of standing wood was verified in relation to the control treatment, showing a greater diversity of species. In the criteria treatment, NPV was positive and superior to the control treatment in all scenarios. The proposed silvicultural management system with an object of an explored and enriched forest, with criteria for harvesting trees with a minimum cut diameter of 25 cm, proved to be viable to generate economic returns and with conservationist potential for the continuous supply of forest products and maintaining biodiversity.

AB This paper studies the differences in the trophic resource use in the breeding time between the snow goose Anser caerulescens that is the most abundant in the Arctic and the most widespread brant goose Branta bernicla under the conditions of the main part of the snow goose nesting range (Colville River Delta, Alaska). It was found that the diets of these species consist mainly of grasses and shrubs and to a lesser extent of mosses, sedges, horsetails and forbs, having almost no differences in the composition of resource items. It also was found that both species have the highest foraging costs in coastal habitats and the lowest ones have in marsh habitats. Without significant differentiation of trophic niches, the snow goose has significantly lower foraging costs than the brant goose. A probable transformation mechanism of communities including the species based on their trophic interactions was suggested.

AB Simple Summary: Regenerating forests represent over half of all tropical forests. While regeneration processes of trees and animal groups have been studied, there is surprisingly little information about how the diversity and community composition of fungi and other microorganisms change and what ecological roles play in tropical forest regeneration. In this study, we compared the diversity and community composition of trees and soil fungi among primary forests and regenerating forests of different ages in two sampling areas in southern Costa Rica. Our study shows that while forest age has a significant influence, environmental factors, such as mesoclimate and soil chemistry, have stronger effects on both fungal and tree communities. Moreover, we observed that the more dissimilar tree communities are between any two sites, the more dissimilar the composition of fungal communities. The results presented here contribute to a better understanding of the successional processes of tropical forests in different regions and inform land use and forest management strategies, including, but not limited to, conservation, restoration, and sustainable use.
   Successional dynamics of plants and animals during tropical forest regeneration have been thoroughly studied, while fungal compositional dynamics during tropical forest succession remain unknown, despite the crucial roles of fungi in ecological processes. We combined tree data and soil fungal DNA metabarcoding data to compare richness and community composition along secondary forest succession in Costa Rica and assessed the potential roles of abiotic factors influencing them. We found a strong coupling of tree and soil fungal community structure in wet tropical primary and regenerating secondary forests. Forest age, edaphic variables, and regional differences in climatic conditions all had significant effects on tree and fungal richness and community composition in all functional groups. Furthermore, we observed larger site-to-site compositional differences and greater influence of edaphic and climatic factors in secondary than in primary forests. The results suggest greater environmental heterogeneity and greater stochasticity in community assembly in the early stages of secondary forest succession and a certain convergence on a set of taxa with a competitive advantage in the more persisting environmental conditions in old-growth forests. Our work provides unprecedented insights into the successional dynamics of fungal communities during secondary tropical forest succession.

AB Tropical forests are biodiversity hotspots, but it is not well understood how this diversity is structured and maintained. One hypothesis rests on the generation of a range of metabolic niches, with varied composition, supporting a high species diversity. Characterizing soil metabolomes can reveal fine-scale differences in composition and potentially help explain variation across these habitats. In particular, little is known about canopy soils, which are unique habitats that are likely to be sources of additional biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling in tropical forests. We studied the effects of diverse tree species and epiphytes on soil metabolomic profiles of forest floor and canopy suspended soils in a French Guianese rainforest. We found that the metabolomic profiles of canopy suspended soils were distinct from those of forest floor soils, differing between epiphyte-associated and non-epiphyte suspended soils, and the metabolomic profiles of suspended soils varied with host tree species, regardless of association with epiphyte. Thus, tree species is a key driver of rainforest suspended soil metabolomics. We found greater abundance of metabolites in suspended soils, particularly in groups associated with plants, such as phenolic compounds, and with metabolic pathways related to amino acids, nucleotides, and energy metabolism, due to the greater relative proportion of tree and epiphyte organic material derived from litter and root exudates, indicating a strong legacy of parent biological material. Our study provides evidence for the role of tree and epiphyte species in canopy soil metabolomic composition and in maintaining the high levels of soil metabolome diversity in this tropical rainforest. It is likely that a wide array of canopy microsite-level environmental conditions, which reflect interactions between trees and epiphytes, increase the microscale diversity in suspended soil metabolomes.

AB Understanding the effect of nitrogen addition on species trait-abundance relationships is one of the central focuses of community ecology and can offer us insights into the mechanisms of community assembly under atmospheric nitrogen deposition. However, few studies have focused on desert ecosystems. In this study, we measured the abundance and ecological stoichiometric traits, leaf carbon content (LCC), nitrogen content (LNC), and phosphorus content (LPC) for all annual ephemerals in all plots subjected to nitrogen addition in early spring in Gurbantunggut Desert, northern Xinjiang, China. We found a significant relationship between traits (LNC, N:P, and C:N) and abundance, indicating that ecological stoichiometry is a good proxy for explaining and predicting species abundance. We further found that significant trait-abundance relationships still existed under different nitrogen addition levels. The result suggests that trait-based niche-assembly theory plays an important role in determining species abundance under atmospheric nitrogen deposition.

AB The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis predicts that conspecific negative density dependence contributes to the maintenance of plant diversity by lowering the recruitment of locally abundant plant species. The JC hypothesis is a widely evoked explanation for the high species diversity in tropical forests, but remains poorly tested in other species-rich systems such as Mediterranean woodlands. As such, we tested if the JC operates and the role of soil-borne oomycetes in a species-rich Mediterranean woodland of Western Australia, where post-fire recruitment can lead to high seedling densities, using the common Banksia attenuata as a case study. We attempted to decipher the effects of oomycete pathogens and distance from conspecific trees on intraspecific seedling survival and growth. Contrary to the JC hypothesis, we found little evidence of negative density dependence, but our results suggest positive density dependence survival under conspecific trees. Oomycete-driven mortality in seedlings was also found regardless of the type of tree. Our results suggest that short-term seedling recruitment patterns in this species-rich, fire-prone ecosystem do not follow the JC hypothesis. Future studies should explore whether negative conspecific density and distance dependence could play a greater role in later stages of the post-fire recovery process.

AB Tropical land-use change for agricultural expansion is the primary driver of global biodiversity decline. Efforts to stem this decline often focus on protecting pristine habitats or returning farmland to forest, yet such approaches fail to protect vulnerable taxa reliant on habitats within low-intensity farmland. We assess the economic viability of carbon-based payments for ecosystem services (PES) to protect farmland trees and fallowing in Ghana, which provide vital wintering sites for imperiled Afro-palearctic migrant birds and enhance landscape-level carbon storage. We estimate the carbon breakeven prices (BEPs) associated with alternative agricultural management scenarios that protect existing farmland trees. BEPs associated with tree protection on existing farmland were very low, ranging from US$2.49 to US$6.45 t(-1) CO2. Extending and reintroducing fallow periods also carried competitive BEPs, US$4.67-US$15.45 t(-1) CO2, when combined with the protection of 50 trees per hectare. Accounting for leakage and economic uncertainty increased BEPs considerably, but scenarios protecting farmland trees and extending fallow periods remained below EU Emissions Trading Scheme prices. Protecting low-intensity farmland habitats and associated biodiversity is cost-effective under carbon-based PES. Implementation should be combined with efforts to close yield gaps, providing greater local food security and resilience.

AB In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on generating cutting-edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I-VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.

AB Interactions between species can influence successful reproduction, resulting in reproductive character displacement, where the similarity of reproductive traits - such as flowering time - among close relatives growing together differ from when growing apart. Evidence for the overall prevalence and direction of this phenomenon, and its stability under environmental change, remains untested across large scales. Using the power of crowdsourcing, we gathered phenological information from over 40 000 herbarium specimens, and investigated displacement in flowering time across 110 animal-pollinated species in the eastern USA. Overall, flowering time displacement is not common across large scales. However, displacement is generally greater among species pairs that flower close in time, regardless of direction. Furthermore, with climate change, the flowering times of closely related species are predicted, on average, to shift further apart by the mid-21(st) century. We demonstrate that the degree and direction of phenological displacement among co-occurring closely related species pairs varies tremendously. However, future climate change may alter the differences in reproductive timing among many of these species pairs, which may have significant consequences for species interactions and gene flow. Our study provides one promising path towards understanding how the phenological landscape is structured and may respond to future environmental change.

AB The Amazon region is expected to become an amplified fire-prone system, but the mechanism of fire occurrence is not fully understood. Here, we employed more than 300,000 Sentinel-2 images acquired during 2016-2019 and compiled a high-resolution inventory of active fires (AFs) over the Amazon. We found that the fire activities in the Amazon in 2019 did not stand out compared with those in 2017 as a whole. However, the number of fires increased in 2019 in the absence of an exceptional drought, suggesting increased human disturbance in the Amazon. The high-resolution AF inventory further demonstrated that over 90% of detected AFs were associated with humans clearing deforested fields on forest fringes for agricultural land expansion. Additionally, our inventory indicated that satellite sensors with coarser spatial resolution could miss considerable small fires, especially at the sensitive agriculture-forest interface, which therefore should be targeted as a priority conservation area.
   Plain Language Summary The Amazon region is a globally important biodiversity hotspot and carbon reservoir. In the context of increasing deforestation in the Amazon, high-resolution satellite monitoring is essential for detecting small spatially fragmented fires and for developing more targeted forest conservation strategies. Here, we compiled a high-resolution active fire inventory by processing more than 300,000 Sentinel-2 images. First, we found that most fires burn over shrublands, grasslands, and croplands near the fringes of the rainforest. Second, the headline-grabbing fires in 2019 did not stand out compared with those in 2017 as a whole. However, the 2019 fires occurred in the absence of droughts, and more fires were observed deeper in the forest, suggesting that human disturbance was increasing in the Amazon. Finally, our inventory allows spatially explicit matches with fire-affected land covers. Evidence from high-resolution observations indicated that the fires in the Amazon are closely interlinked with deforestation and agricultural land expansion and form an interactive circle. This leads to forest fragmentation and stimulates more fragmented fires in turn. Our findings improve the understanding of fire-climate-land cover change interactions at a fine spatial resolution.
   Key Points
   The fire dynamics in 2019 without an exceptional drought indicated an increase in human disturbance in the Amazon
   Over 90% of detected fires were associated with human clearing deforested fields on the forest fringes for agricultural purposes
   Small fires are well recorded in Sentinel-2 images, providing a vital supplement to active fire products from coarser resolution sensors

AB Land use changes affect the abundance of plants, and even when plants are spared in agroecosystems, they are further impacted by management practices. Knowing how populations are impacted and the factors affecting them in the landscape is a major challenge in ecosystems under intense land use conversion, an even more important task when the plant is important for livelihoods. To understand how anthropogenic and environmental factors affect plant abundance and the population structure of Annona crassiflora, an important wild fruit tree of Cerrado, we evaluated populations in a gradient of anthropogenic and environmental conditions. Our sampling ranged from well-preserved sites, in natural areas, to highly disturbed pastures in the agroecosystems, covering an extensive area of the Cerrado biome. Results indicate that vegetation thinning and the presence of cattle negatively affect the abundance of small plants. High frequency of thinning and large cattle herds prevent recruitment of small plants in pastures, which may drive populations to local extinction in these sites. Reducing the frequency and intensity of vegetation thinning and cattle herd size may allow the recruitment of small plants into higher life stages. Fruit harvesting, which is positively associated with plant abundance, can continue to be practiced.

AB Due to increasing human transformation of virtually all habitats on Earth, setting global priorities for conservation is essential. The emerging disciplines of macroecology and macroevolution (MEE) can provide a global perspective and information for such prioritization but remain relatively separated from conservation prioritization, partly because MEE researchers are unaware of the requirements for effective conservation prioritization and existing approaches implementing these. Indeed, existing approaches for conservation prioritization at large scale are scattered across literature. Here, we systematically review this literature and provide a guideline for researchers in MEE as to which of approaches might be suitable for their needs. From >11 000 scientific publications, we identified 134 methods suitable for commonly used MEE data and geographic scale. Furthermore, we use a 'trait matrix' to identify families of similar approaches and to design a guideline to select the most suitable method, given a user-defined set of data and analysis scope. The guidelines are freely available via the conserveR R-package (<>). Finally, we used our review to identify increasing scalability, continuous monitoring and the integration of molecular, remote sensing and animal movement data as key areas for future impacts of MEE in conservation prioritization. We anticipate that our review can serve as a guide to MEE researchers interested in linking their data to conservation as well as for conservation scientists interested in using MEE approaches.

Ants as keystone species are essential elements of terrestrial ecosystems; thus, it is important to understand the factors influencing their presence. In a large-scale multi-site study, we surveyed ant assemblages using sweep netting and D-vac sampling on 158 ancient burial mounds preserving grassland habitats in agricultural landscapes in East-Hungary. We asked the following questions: (1) How do habitat factors and landscape composition affect species richness and functional diversity of ants? (2) Which ant traits are affected by habitat factors and landscape composition? Despite their small sizes, mounds as permanent and relatively undisturbed landscape elements could provide safe havens for diverse ant assemblages even in transformed agricultural landscapes. The complex habitat structure of wooded mounds supported high species and functional diversity of ant assemblages. Ant species on wooded mounds had small or medium-sized colonies, enabling the co-existence of more species. The effect of landscape composition on ant assemblages was mediated by habitat factors: steep slopes buffered the negative effect of the cropland matrix and enabled higher ant diversity.

AB Deforestation often results in landscapes where remaining forest habitat is highly fragmented, with remnants of different sizes embedded in an often highly contrasting matrix. Local extinction of species from individual fragments is common, but the demographic mechanisms underlying these extinctions are poorly understood. It is often hypothesized that altered environmental conditions in fragments drive declines in reproduction, recruitment, or survivorship. The Amazon basin, in addition to experiencing continuing fragmentation, is experiencing climate change-related increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts and unusually wet periods. Whether plant populations in tropical forest fragments are particularly susceptible to extremes in precipitation remains unclear. Most studies of plants in fragments are relatively short (1-6 years), focus on a single life-history stage, and often do not compare to populations in continuous forest. Even fewer studies consider delayed effects of climate on demographic vital rates despite the importance of delayed effects in studies that consider them. Using a decade of demographic and climate data from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the Central Amazon, we assess the effects of climate on populations of an understory herb (Heliconia acuminata, Heliconiaceae). We used distributed lag nonlinear models to understand the delayed effects of climate (measured as standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI) on survival, growth, and flowering. We detected delayed effects of climate up to 36 months. Extremes in SPEI in the previous year reduced survival, drought in the wet season 8-11 months prior to the February census increased growth, and drought two dry seasons prior increased flowering probability. Effects of extremes in precipitation on survival and growth were more pronounced in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. The complex delayed effects of climate and habitat fragmentation in our study point to the importance of long-term demography experiments in understanding the effects of anthropogenic change on plant populations.

AB Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is believed to be one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides or exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We found that conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence was more common at the seedling stage. Only 30% of studies showed significant conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence. Among those studies, applying fungicides significantly reduced the effect of conspecific negative distance-dependent mortality. Excluding large mammals reduced the effect of conspecifics, but with only marginal significance (p < 0.1). Our study confirms that plant pathogens have a significant impact on distance-dependent mortality and suggests that the impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed stage, large and small mammals, respectively, appear to weaken and enhance negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different enemy types, and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.

AB Premise Plant responses to herbivores and their elicitors include changes in traits associated with phenology, defense, and reproduction. Induced responses by chewing herbivores are known to be hormonally mediated by the jasmonate pathway and can cascade and affect late-season seed predators and pollinators. Moreover, herbivore-induced plant responses can be transmitted to the next generation. Whether herbivore-induced transgenerational effects also apply to phenological traits is less well understood. Methods Here, we explored responses of wild lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) to herbivory and jasmonate treatment and possible transgenerational effects of herbivore-induced early flowering. In a controlled field experiment, we exposed lima bean plants to herbivory by leaf beetles or methyl jasmonate sprays (MJ). We then compared plant development, phenology, reproductive fitness and seed traits among these treatments and undamaged, untreated control plants. Results We found that MJ and leaf herbivory induced similar responses, with treated plants growing less, flowering earlier, and producing fewer seeds than undamaged plants. However, seed size, phenolics and cyanogenic glycosides concentrations did not differ among treatments. Seed germination rates and flowering time of the offspring were similar among maternal treatments. Conclusions Overall, the results confirm that responses of lima bean to herbivory by leaf beetles are mediated by jasmonate; however, effects on phenological traits are not transmitted to the next generation. We discuss why transgenerational effects of herbivory might be restricted to traits that directly target herbivores.

AB Forest cover change is having an enduring link with climatic factors. This study was designed to study the impact of forest cover change in the Western Ghats on meteorological parameters like rainfall and land surface temperature (LST) between 2000 and 2019 using Landsat images. Land use land cover (LULC) data were extracted from Landsat images, and rainfall data of 53 stations were obtained from tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data. Mann-Kendall trend test, a nonparametric test, was adopted to evaluate the long-run trends in rainfall for North East (NE) and South West (SW) monsoon during the selected time period. The test results indicate that 19 stations in the North of Kerala show a positive trend in SW monsoon and 3 stations show a negative trend in NE monsoon. The breakpoint analysis of the rainfall dataset with time and with the elevation from mean sea level (MSL) is performed and the results show a breakpoint in the rainfall for the year 2008 and at 47 m elevation (MSL) from the coast of the Arabian Sea. Forest cover data show that there is a loss of 12.65% in the region for two decades span and also a significant increase in minimum LST from 8.308 to 9.208 degrees C and increase in maximum LST from 41.51 to 46.29 degrees C during the selected time period. Forest cover loss could be an important factor responsible for the increase in LST. The research outcomes would help the policymakers in improvising the measures for land management policies including plantation and urbanization.

AB Understanding how land-use change affects biodiversity is a fundamental step to develop effective conservation strategies in human-modified tropical landscapes. Here, we analyzed how land-use change through tropical small-scale agriculture affects endemic, exotic, and non-endemic native ant communities, focusing on vanilla landscapes in north-eastern Madagascar, a global biodiversity hotspot. First, we compared ant species richness and species composition across seven land-use types: old-growth forest, forest fragment, forest-derived vanilla agroforest, fallow-derived vanilla agroforest, woody fallow, herbaceous fallow, and rice paddy. Second, we assessed how environmental factors drive ant species richness in the agricultural matrix to identify management options that promote endemic and non-endemic native while controlling exotic ant species. We found that old-growth forest, forest fragment, and forest-derived vanilla agroforest supported the highest endemic ant species richness. Exotic ant species richness, by contrast, was lowest in old-growth forest but highest in herbaceous fallows, woody fallows, and rice paddy. Rice paddy had the lowest non-endemic native ant species richness. Ant species composition differed among land-use types, highlighting the uniqueness of old-growth forest in harboring endemic ant species which are more sensitive to disturbance. In the agricultural matrix, higher canopy closure and landscape forest cover were associated with an increase of endemic ant species richness but a decrease of exotic ant species richness. We conclude that preserving remnant forest fragments and promoting vanilla agroforests with a greater canopy closure in the agricultural matrix are important management strategies to complement the role of old-growth forests for endemic ant conservation in north-eastern Madagascar.

AB Shifts in hydrological regimes alter river flow rates and flood pulses, decrease environmental heterogeneity and the floristic-structural complexity of associated plant communities. We tested the hypothesis that drought events affect plant community composition and structure at a small-scale within a riparian fragment towards a reduction in floristic-structural complexity. The tree community was sampled in three habitats (wet, transitional and dry) and monitored in seven inventories carried out between 1991 and 2018. Hydrological variations were evaluated through annual rainfalls, river flow rates and water level data. The species richness and the detrended correspondence analysis axes were used to characterise the temporal modifications in floristic composition. Community structure was described in terms of biomass: accumulated, growth of survivors, mortality and recruitment. Generalised linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate the effects of time and environment in community. It was concluded that the climate has become drier in recent years due to declining precipitation that has affected flow rates and water levels. The floristic-structural complexity of the study fragment was maintained during the monitoring period. However, prolonged and extreme drought events displayed the potential to impact floristic-structural patterns.

AB The dramatic increased rates of uncontrolled urbanisation in various parts of the World have resulted in loss of native species and overall threats to biodiversity. Over the last few decades Saudi Arabia has witnessed a remarkably rapid population growth and unparalleled levels of urbanisation, leading to threats to biodiversity. In this study we focused on arid city (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) where ant assemblages cross an urban-rural gradient. Ants were collected by pitfall traps from 15 sites along three different urbanisation gradients at 3-monthly intervals throughout 1 year. Ant abundance, species richness, evenness, and alpha diversity were consistent across the urbanisation gradient. However, significant differences were observed in ant beta diversity and assemblage composition between rural and urban, suburban and urban, but not between rural and suburban sites. Eleven ant species were identified as indicator species (IV values between 50.7% and 80.7%). These ant assemblages were influenced by flora, ground cover, soil variables, and urbanisation characteristics. To conclude, we found a significant effect of urbanisation on the beta diversity and composition of ant assemblages.

AB The purpose of the study is to assess the ability of three different grain legume species to facilitate phosphorus (P) uptake by intercropped wheat and to evaluate the differences in root exudation and phosphatase activity that each grain legume species can induce in the soil. In a pot experiment under controlled climatic conditions, lupin, pea, and faba bean intercropped with durum wheat and respective sole crops were grown at high and low phosphorus availability. At the flowering time of each grain legume, intercrop and sole crops were sampled. Intercropping favored wheat P uptake more at low P availability than at high P availability. Compared to the sole crop, wheat P uptake was greater in intercropping with pea both without and with the addition of phosphorus and with lupin when phosphorus was not added. Phosphatase activity, which was generally high, was highest in soil with lupin and faba bean sole crops. In the rhizosphere of faba bean, the highest total carboxylate concentration was also measured, followed by pea and lupin. Root exudation was favored by P supply, showing greater values in intercropped wheat than in the respective sole crops. P uptake by wheat was not directly linked to greater root exudation in the tested intercropping systems. Even if root exudation and available phosphorus were generally greater with legumes both in sole crop and in intercropping, other interactions such as complementarity and competition were involved, hiding potential facilitation exerted by faba bean and bringing out the benefits from the wheat/pea combination.

AB Purpose The tropical phosphorus cycle and its relation to soil phosphorus (P) availability are a major uncertainty in projections of forest productivity. In highly weathered soils with low P concentrations, plant and microbial communities depend on abiotic and biotic processes to acquire P. We explored the seasonality and relative importance of drivers controlling the fluctuation of common P pools via processes such as litter production and decomposition, and soil phosphatase activity. Methods We analyzed intra-annual variation of tropical soil phosphorus pools using a modified Hedley sequential fractionation scheme. In addition, we measured litterfall, the mobilization of P from litter and soil extracellular phosphatase enzyme activity and tested their relation to fluctuations in P- fractions. Results Our results showed clear patterns of seasonal variability of soil P fractions during the year. We found that modeled P released during litter decomposition was positively related to change in organic P fractions, while net change in organic P fractions was negatively related to phosphatase activities in the top 5 cm. Conclusion We conclude that input of P by litter decomposition and potential soil extracellular phosphatase activity are the two main factors related to seasonal soil P fluctuations, and therefore the P economy in P impoverished soils. Organic soil P followed a clear seasonal pattern, indicating tight cycling of the nutrient, while reinforcing the importance of studying soil P as an integrated dynamic system in a tropical forest context.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat fragmentation, edge effects, biological invasions, and selective logging, can affect abiotic conditions and biotic interactions that influence the likelihood of seed germination, an important bottleneck for plant regeneration. However, there is no research synthesis evaluating the impact of those disturbances on germination. We performed a global meta-analysis comparing seed germination on disturbed and undisturbed sites. We evaluated the influence of disturbance type, vegetation, plant growth form, dispersal syndrome, seed mass, climate region and phylogeny on germination responses to disturbance. We obtained information about 74 plant species from 25 studies. We found an overall negative effect of anthropogenic disturbance on seed germination. Biological invasion and habitat fragmentation presented a negative impact, whilst edge effects, selective logging and grazing had no consistent effect on seed germination. Anthropogenic disturbances decreased germination of forest species, but plants from open physiognomies (savannas, shrublands and grasslands) were not consistently affected. Disturbed conditions decreased germination of understory forest herbs and shrubs from open physiognomies. Germination of abiotic-dispersed plants was decreased in disturbed areas, whilst there was no consistent effect on biotic-dispersed ones. Seed mass had no effect on species responses, but the interactions between seed mass and growth form and dispersal syndrome affected germination responses. Species responses did not differ between tropical and temperate regions. Phylogenetic relationships among species did not drive the results. Anthropogenic disturbances generally decrease seed germination, and non-trees, small-seeded and abiotic dispersed plants are the most affected. Therefore, conservation practices or restoration efforts focusing on early recruitment, such as direct sowing of seeds, should pay special attention to decreases in seed germination due to habitat alterations following disturbances. Amelioration of disturbed conditions, such as control of invasive species, should be considered to maintain germination rates and plant regeneration in long-term.

AB Studies in the area of functional ecology not only aid in our understanding of the dynamics and structure of communities, but also help elucidate the mechanistic consequences of habitat changes and their implications for species conservation, the nature of biological interactions and the provision of ecosystem services. However, trait selection and measurement are usually not standardized between studies, even for groups that have been widely studied, such as the Drosophilidae (Diptera). In order to suggest a standardized framework for trait selection and measurement for the Drosophilidae, here we reviewed the literature published between September 2018 and June 2021. The review returned 52 relevant papers, and based on the traits presented, we organized three categories of functional traits which we suggest need to be analyzed in order to understand functional pattern of the Drosophilidae: habitat perception, flight performance, and ecophysiological responses. Habitat perception includes those traits that provide the ability to recognize an environment and access its available resources. Flight performance includes those traits related to flight and mobility, while ecophysiological responses include those traits related to energy allocation, survival, and reproductive efficiency. Based on these categories, we projected the expected results for a broad application of the traits we selected in studies with Drosophilidae in natural environments, for example, using the functional approach for a comprehensive diagnosis of the relationship between Drosophilidae and their environments. We encourage a wide use of our framework for both basic and applied studies of Drosophilidae, particularly for those that seek to test hypotheses regarding community structure.

AB A diversity of phenological strategies has been reported for tropical tree species. Defoliation and seasonal dormancy of cambial activity inform us on how trees cope with water stress during the dry season, or maximize the use of resources during the rainy season. Here, we study the matching between leaf phenology (unfolding and shedding) and cambial activity for Prioria balsamifera, a key timber species in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In particular, we (i) evaluated the seasonality of cambial activity and synchrony of phenology among trees in response to climate and (ii) identified the seasonality of leaf phenology and its relation with cambial phenology. The study was conducted in the Luki Man and Biosphere Reserve, located in the Mayombe forest at the southern margin of the Congo Basin. Historic defoliation data were collected every ten days using weekly crown observations whereas recent observations involved time-lapse cameras. Cambial pinning was performed on ten trees during 20 months and radius dendrometers were installed on three trees during 13 months. Tree rings were measured on cores from 13 trees and growth synchrony was evaluated. We found that P. balsamifera defoliates annually with a peak observed at the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season. The new leaves unfolded shortly after shedding of the old leaves. The peak defoliation dates varied across years from September 12 to November 14 and the fraction of number of trees that defoliated at a given time was found to be negatively correlated with annual rainfall and temperature; during the dry season, when precipitation and temperatures are the lowest. Wood formation (radial growth), was found to be highly seasonal, with cambial dormancy occurring during the dry season and growth starting at the beginning of the rainy season. Individual ring-width series did not cross date well. The within species variability of leaf phenology and cambial rhythms provides indication about resistance of the population against climatic changes.</p>

AB Understanding how biodiversity is distributed is increasingly becoming important under ongoing and projected human land use. Measures of beta diversity, and its partitions, can offer insights for conservation and restoration of biodiversity. We ask how different species, functional groups, and land use contribute to beta diversity, and whether invasive species have a negative influence on beta diversity. We address these questions using ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) at 277 sites distributed across five geomorphic land use types in Goa, India. We recorded 68 species (35 genera, 7 subfamilies) of which 5 were invasive. We classified them into eight functional groups. Oecophylla smaragdina-a common tropical arboreal species, and Anoplolepis gracilepis-a globally significant invasive, contributed the most to beta diversity. Large-bodied omnivores which may influence soil functions contributed more to beta diversity than small-bodied predators. Lateritic plateaus contributed most to beta diversity, whereas human-influenced plantations contributed the least. Beta diversity across sites was related to species turnover, whereas nestedness was more prominent for functional groups. This indicates how species replace one another with change in land use, but functional roles are lost despite such turnover. Sites with human land use had higher incidence of invasive species, and invaded sites contributed less to beta diversity than non-invaded sites. Human land use strongly influences diversity and distribution of ant assemblages. Land use may spare local species richness, but not functional groups. A small number of invasive species exert negative influence even in very speciose communities.

AB Background Tropical forests are repositories of much of the world's biodiversity and are critical for mitigation of climate change. Yet, the drivers of forest dynamics are poorly understood. This is in large part due to the lack of long-term data on forest change and changes in drivers. Methodology We quantify changes in tree abundance, diversity, and stand structure along transects first enumerated in 1978 and resampled 2019 in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We tested five predictions. First, based on the purported role of seed dispersal and herbivory and our quantification of changes in the abundance of frugivores and herbivores, we tested two predictions of how faunal change could have influenced forest composition. Second, based on an evaluation of life history strategies, we tested two predictions concerning how the forest could have changed following disturbance that happened prior to written history. Finally, based on a 50-year climate record, we evaluate the possible influence of climate change on forest dynamics. Results More trees were present on the assessed transects in 2019 (508) than in 1978 (436), species richness remained similar, but diversity declined as the number of dominant species increased. Rainfall increased by only 3 mm over the 50 years but this had not significant effect on forest changes measured here. Annual average monthly maximum temperature increased significantly by 1.05 degrees C over 50 years. The abundance of frugivorous and folivorous primates and elephants increased over the 50 years of monitoring. Neither the prediction that an increase in abundance of seed dispersing frugivores increases the abundance of their preferred fruiting tree species, nor that as an increase in folivore abundance causes a decline in their preferred species were supported. As predicted, light-demanding species decreased in abundance while shade-tolerant species increased as expected from Kibale being disturbed prior to historical records. Finally, while temperature increased over the 50 years, we found no means to predict a priori how individual species would respond. Conclusions Our study revealed subtle changes in the tree community over 40 years, sizable increases in primate numbers, a substantial increase in the elephant population and an increase in local temperature. Yet, a clear picture of what set of interactions impact the change in the tree community remains elusive. Our data on tree life-history strategies and frugivore/herbivore foraging preferences suggest that trees species are under opposing pressures.

AB Dryland ecosystems can be constrained by low soil fertility. Within drylands, the soil nutrient and organic carbon (C) cycling that does occur is often mediated by soil surface communities known as biological soil crusts (biocrusts), which cycle C and nutrients in the top ca. 0-2 cm of soil. However, the degree to which biocrusts are influencing soil fertility and biogeochemical cycling in deeper, subsurface mineral soils is unclear. The movement of dissolved resources from biocrusts to deeper soil layers in leachate may be one of the main mechanisms through which biocrust fertility is transferred downward towards deeper microbial communities and plant roots occurring within mineral soil. Here we examined the role of biocrust leachate in contributing to subsurface nutrient and soluble C pools and subsurface microbial cycling. We collected biocrusts from three biocrust successional stages and explored resource pools in situ at multiple soil depths, while collecting leachate and measuring nutrient and organic C concentrations and metabolite composition from each successional stage in the laboratory. After four leachate collections, we conducted an incubation of mineral soil collected from below each biocrust successional stage to measure heterotrophic microbial CO2 flux and biomass. Overall, our findings observed that the degree of nutrient and C connectivity between biocrusts and the sub-crust mineral soil depended on the biocrust successional stage and the element being considered, and the influence of biocrust successional stage on mineral soil CO2 flux is likely related to long-term resource build up. Together, our results suggest that the influence of biocrust leachate on subsurface mineral soil is complex and context dependent, but, over longer time periods and at later successional stages, can have measurable effects on dryland soil biogeochemical cycling with feedbacks to resource availability and CO2 flux.

AB Thyroid carcinoma is a common endocrine organ cancer associated with abnormal hormone secretion, leading to the disorder of metabolism. The intestinal microbiota is vital to maintain digestive and immunologic homeostasis. The relevant information of the microbial community in the gut and thyroid, including composition, structure, and relationship, is unclear in thyroid carcinoma patients. A total of 93 samples from 25 patients were included in this study. The results showed that microbial communities existed in thyroid tissue; gut and thyroid had high abundance of facultative anaerobes from the Proteobacteria phyla. The microbial metabolism from the thyroid and gut may be affected by the thyroid carcinoma cells. The cooccurrence network showed that the margins of different thyroid tissues were unique areas with more competition; the stabilization of microcommunities from tissue and stool may be maintained by several clusters of species that may execute different vital metabolism processes dominantly that are attributed to the microenvironment of cancer.

AB Diversity and its maintaining mechanism (community assembly) shift along resource availability gradients at local and regional levels. It is necessary to identify key natural factors shaping community assembly or diversity patterns, so that understanding the patterns of diversity and assembly along these factors across local to regional scales. In this study, we investigated the six local sites of plant community in Qinling Mountains region. Based on the relative importance of environmental factors in shaping the phylogenetic diversity, a complex resource availability gradient was established to assess taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and assembly patterns along it at local or regional scale separately. Phylogenetic analyses and the biodiversity index were estimated along environmental gradients as well, to assess the difference between change tendencies along natural environmental and resource availability gradients. We found that 1) elevation was the most important regional-scale environmental predictor of phylogeny of community; 2) taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity studies showed similar patterns along both resource and elevational gradients at regional scale, and that diversity at local scale may differ regardless of gradients; 3) at the regional level, phylogenetic structures revealed convergent tendencies along the elevational gradient across different species pools. Phylogenetic assembly patterns along the elevation gradient at the local scale differed from the patterns at the regional scale, with consistent clustering tending to overspread along the resource availability gradient. In conclusion, resource availability shaped community assembly at the regional level. Local patterns of diversity influenced regional patterns differently because of variation in the colonization history or assembly process. Owing to varying assembly patterns along simple environmental gradients, it is vital to establish a complex resource availability gradient to dissect the real assembly mechanism or biodiversity patterns operating in local to regional-scale processes. These findings may provide valuable reference about forest restoration and management.

AB High species diversity, large area, and taxonomically under-studied groups are some of the explanations for the frequent discovery of new species of plants during ecological field campaigns in the Amazon region. Some of these new species are already being threatened from unplanned urban expansion associated with deforestation and habitat loss. Here we describe Tovomita cornuta, a new species discovered during ecological studies in the whitesand campinaranas of the Amazon, which is also threatened. The species is endemic to the state of Amazonas, Brazil, where it occurs in the understory of forested campinaranas physiognomies and is easily recognized by its narrowly obovoid fruits with dilated free styles. We provide a description, taxonomic and ecological comments, assessment of conservation status, geographic distribution, phenology, and illustrations for the new species.

AB In tropical semi-deciduous forests, where 20-50 % of canopy trees shed their leaves in the dry season, species with varying degrees of leaf deciduousness share the same space and resources. Here, we describe the tree community in a 10.24-ha plot to assess whether small-scale variation in canopy structure and soil conditions are associated with changes in tree community structure, diversity, and composition. We sampled 11,585 individuals with diameter at breast height >= 4.8 cm belonging to 146 species. Plot density (1,129 trees ha-1) and basal area (24.81 m2 ha-1) were smaller than other similar forests, which may be due to an old wind disturbance. For 8.96 ha, we evaluated the relationship between abiotic factors and community descriptors using regression models. Results varied within size classes, but canopy openness was associated with changes in the community structure and diversity, and soil fertility did not affect species diversity. Tree density, basal area, and diversity were smaller in areas with more canopy gaps. Tree density and basal area increase with phosphorus availability, while the density of deciduous trees increased with canopy openness and base saturation. Thus, we found evidence that canopy openness and soil can explain small-scale variations of forest structure and diversity.

AB Light availability is a crucial resource determining seedling survival, establishment, and growth. Competition for light is asymmetric, giving the taller individuals a competitive advantage for obtaining light resources. Species-specific traits, e.g., shade tolerance, rooting depth, and leaf morphology, determine their strategical growth response under limited resource availability and different competitive interactions. We established a controlled pot experiment using European beech, Norway spruce, and Douglas fir seedlings and applying three different light availability levels-10%, 20%, and 50%. The experiment's main aim was to better understand the effects of light availability and competition type on the growth, growth allocation, and biomass production of recently planted seedlings. We planted four seedlings per pot in either monocultures or mixtures of two species. Relative height and diameter growth and aboveground woody biomass of seedlings increased with increasing light availability. All seedlings allocated more growth to height than diameter with decreasing light availability. Seedlings that reached on average greater height in the previous year allocated less growth to height in the following year. Additionally, there were general differences in growth allocation to the height between gymnosperms and angiosperms, but we did not find an effect of the competitor's identity. Our mixture effect analysis trends suggested that mixtures of functionally dissimilar species are more likely to produce higher biomass than mixtures of more similar species such as the two studied conifers. This finding points towards increased productivity through complementarity.

AB Although soil phosphorus is essential for vegetation growth it is not always found in labile forms, hampering its absorption by plants, and is limited in forest ecosystems. This study explores soil P state and availability in calcareous soils, determining which processes affect its different pools and which soil parameters influence forest productivity of a Mediterranean pine species. We used a sequential fractionation method to determine P fractions in the soil according to their lability and their organic or inorganic nature. Those fractions were related to different soil and climatic parameters and to the site index in 32 Pinus halepensis plots of the National Spanish Forest Inventory. Soil texture, carbonates content, water retention capacity and organic matter substantially affected P fractions in the calcareous soils studied. Membrane extractable P was mainly influenced by organic matter-related parameters while the predominant P fraction in these soils, the primary P, was linked to the carbonates content. The biological mineralization processes played a key role in the soil P cycle. Total P, carbonates content, soil texture and water availability drove forest productivity in the studied plots.

AB Secondary cloud forests (SCFs), those that regenerate naturally following abandonment of human activities in previously deforested land, are of great value as refuges of high species diversity and for their critical role in hydrological regulation. This opinion paper analyzes the main environmental, socio-economic, and regulatory aspects that currently hamper the sustainable use and conservation of SCFs in Mexico for the provision of timber and ecosystem services. The main constraints identified include contradictory norms and policies and the marginalization of smallholders in timber production activities. Developing economic incentives for forest product harvesting and provision of ecosystem services derived from SCFs, while also addressing legal and normative aspects related to their sustainable use, is paramount. Given the high heterogeneity in floristic composition and stand structure of SCFs among localities, technical and social norms for sustainable use should be sufficiently flexible to allow adaptive management approaches. Future research areas should be focused on monitoring the response of SCFs to silvicultural interventions, documenting existing traditional practices as well as conducting socio-economic analyses of timber production and associated ecosystem services. This is essential for developing sound policies and approaches for the sustainable use and long-term management of SCFs in Mexico.

AB Understanding how perturbations to trophic interactions influence virus-host dynamics is essential in the face of ongoing biodiversity loss and the continued emergence of RNA viruses and their associated zoonoses. Herein, we investigated the role of predator exclusion on rodent communities and the seroprevalence of hantaviruses within the Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayu (RNBM), which is a protected area of the Interior Atlantic Forest (IAF). In the IAF, two sympatric rodent reservoirs, Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes, harbor Jabora and Juquitiba hantavirus (JABV, JUQV), respectively. In this study, we employed two complementary methods for predator exclusion: comprehensive fencing and trapping/removal. The goal of exclusion was to preclude the influence of predation on small mammals on the sampling grids and thereby potentially reduce rodent mortality. Following baseline sampling on three grid pairs with different habitats, we closed the grids and began predator removal. By sampling three habitat types, we controlled for habitat-specific effects, which is important for hantavirus-reservoir dynamics in neotropical ecosystems. Our six-month predator exclusion experiment revealed that the exclusion of terrestrial mammalian predators had little influence on the rodent community or the population dynamics of A. montensis and O. nigripes. Instead, fluctuations in species diversity and species abundances were influenced by sampling session and forest degradation. These results suggest that seasonality and landscape composition play dominant roles in the prevalence of hantaviruses in rodent reservoirs in the IAF ecosystem.</p>

AB Riparian Ecological Infrastructures are networks of natural and semi-natural riparian areas located in human-dominated landscapes, crucial in supporting processes that directly or indirectly benefit humans or enhance social welfare. In this study, we developed a novel multimetric index, termed Habitat Ecological Infrastructure's Diversity Index (HEIDI), to quantify the potential of Riparian Ecological Infrastructures in supporting biodiversity, and related ecosystem services, in three managed landscapes: Intensive Agriculture, Extensive Agriculture, and Forest Production. Metrics describing the structure, composition, and management of riparian vegetation and associated habitats were used to derive the potential of Riparian Ecological Infrastructures in supporting three distinct biological dispersal groups: short-range dispersers (ants), medium-range dispersers (pollinators), and long-range dispersers (birds, bats, and non-flying small mammals). The composition of floristic resources, assessed by identifying trees and shrubs at the species and genus level, and herbaceous plants at the family level, was used as a proxy to evaluate the potential of Riparian Ecological Infrastructures in promoting seed dispersal and pollination ecosystem services provided by the three biological communities. Our research evidenced that Riparian Ecological Infrastructures located in the Forest Production and Intensive Agriculture landscapes exhibited the highest and lowest potential for biodiversity-related ecosystem services, respectively. The Forest Production landscape revealed higher suitability of forage resources for short- and medium-range dispersers and a higher landscape coverage by Riparian Ecological Infrastructures, resulting in more potential to create ecological corridors and to provide ecosystem services. The Riparian Ecological Infrastructures located in the Extensive Agriculture landscape seemed to be particularly relevant for supporting long-ranges dispersers, despite providing less habitat for the biological communities. Land-use systems in the proximity of Riparian Ecological Infrastructures should be sustainably managed to promote riparian vegetation composition and structural quality, as well as the riparian width, safeguarding biodiversity, and the sustainable provision of biodiversity-related ecosystem services.

AB Tropical montane landscapes harbor diverse flora and fauna, and many species there are ecological specialists with narrow elevational distributions, limited geographic ranges, and small global populations. Along elevational gradients, environmental conditions and community composition change dramatically over small spatial scales. As forests are disturbed and edges formed with modified habitat, natural communities could be affected differently across elevations by the many physical and biotic changes at edges. We asked whether forest edges produced altered patterns of avian species composition along a cloud forest - dry forest gradient on the Pacific slope of the Tilar ' an mountains in Monteverde, Costa Rica. A strong moisture gradient produces cloud forests near the ridgetops, with a concentration of species endemic to the Costa Rica - Panama highlands that are habitat specialists. We conducted 552 point counts across 110 locations from 1100 to 1800 m elevation, yielding 6586 detections of 115 species in 10 km2 of montane forest. We analyzed differences in species composition and single-species abundances between interior and near-edge forest habitats for species grouped by geographic range size. Species composition changed markedly from forest edge to interior in cloud forest habitats, but not in drier forests downslope. Endemic species, especially in cloud forest, were detected less frequently in mature forest near edges than in mature forest interior, and this difference was more pronounced than for cosmopolitan species. On tropical mountainsides, we can expect habitatspecialist endemic species to be more sensitive to further habitat modification. This sensitivity could limit the resilience of tropical bird communities.

AB Background: Sites of overlap in the species distribution among regions are known as transition zones. Their floristic and biogeographic complexity is rarely discussed.
   Questions: Is it possible to identify transition zones amid the biogeographic provinces of Mexico? Can transition zones also be considered areas of endemism?
   Study species: 315 Asteraceae taxa endemic to Mexico.
   Study site: Volcanic Belt, Balsas Depression and Sierra Madre del Sur biogeographic provinces.
   Methods: For species of Asteraceae endemic to three biogeographic provinces of central Mexico, we characterized the province to which each species belonged and estimated the distance it could penetrate the neighboring province. We defined transition zones between biogeographic provinces as the average penetration distances of the species. We also evaluated the presence of species with restricted distribution to transition zones.
   Results: Two transition zones were identified in the Balsas Depression, first, at the junction with the Volcanic Belt with a width of 13 km, and second, with the Sierra Madre del Sur, with a width of 12.3 km. There were 45 species whose distribution was restricted to those transition zones.
   Conclusions: Understanding how richness and endemism are exchanged from one region to another is essential to explain how their floras have been assembling and evolving. This analysis has allowed us to better understand the relationships among regions as complex as those studied here.

AB Over the past 25 years research concerning the effects of climatic fluctuations on past human societies has shifted focus considerably, with most recent hypotheses emphasizing shorter-term variability over longer-term change. Definitions of change and variability, however, remain subjective and vary considerably between researchers. It is suggested that white noise, due to its inherent unpredictability, provides a theoretically robust model of variability that accords with perceptions of variability conveyed by the existing literature. The use of white noise as a model for variability enables the development of an algorithm that objectively decomposes an empirical climatic signal into change and variability components. The algorithm, which combines singular spectrum analysis and Fourier methods, is validated via an extensive series of simulations and applied via two empirical case studies. It is shown that the algorithm has the potential to produce genuine advances by isolating features of interest and facilitating more rigorous hypothesis testing. Its use will therefore aid researchers studying palaeoclimatic effects on prehistoric human societies as well as those studying the nature and effects of contemporary climate change.

AB Alpine grasslands harbor diverse groups of flora and fauna, provide important ecosystem functions, and yield essential ecosystem goods and services, especially for the development of nature-based tourism. However, they are experiencing increasing anthropogenic perturbations such as tourist trampling. Although negative effects of tourist trampling on alpine vegetation have been frequently reported, previous studies have focused mainly on changes in taxonomic diversity after trampling, and rarely provide a mechanistic elucidation of trampling effects from a trait-based perspective. The present study evaluates the impacts of simulated trampling on taxonomic and functional diversity of a typical alpine grassland community in Shangri-La, China using a standardized protocol. The results showed that although taxonomic diversity was not statistically significantly affected by trampling, some functional attributes responded rapidly to trampling disturbance. Specifically, functional divergence decreased with an increase in trampling intensity, and characteristics of community-weighted mean trait values changed towards shorter species with reduced leaf area and lower leaf dry matter content. Such strong shifts in functional attributes may further affect ecosystem goods and services provided by alpine grasslands. Our inclusion of functional diversity in the analysis thus adds an important caution to previous studies predominantly focusing on taxonomic diversity, and it is urgent to keep alpine grasslands well managed and ecologically coherent so that their valuable functions and services can be safeguarded.

AB Interspecific differences in species abundances are one of the oldest and most universal patterns in ecology, yet little is known about how these differences are generated over evolutionary time. In this study, we test whether there is evidence for phylogenetic signal in population densities of four large groups of terrestrial vertebrates, namely birds, mammals, amphibians, and squamates. In addition, we test the hypothesis that the relative number of species in a clade might be a predictor of the abundance of its constituent species. However, given that the number of species in a clade is the outcome of both its age and diversification rate, and each of these factors was tested separately. Our results provide strong support for phylogenetic signal in species densities for all clades, regardless of differences in how species density was computed, or phylogenetic uncertainty. On the other hand, there was no evidence for a relationship between species abundance and the diversity of its encompassing clade. The implications of phylogenetic signal are discussed in the context of models of species abundance distributions, including Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography.

AB Persistence and colonization by tree species in an environment following a fire depends on the effects on seed germination and seedling development. We used seeds of Kielmeyera coriacea and Qualea parviflora as a model to test the effects of high temperatures on germination and initial development of tree seedlings. We exposed the seeds to heat flow (70, 100, 130, 150 or 170 degrees C) for 2 or 5 min and compared the germination with that of unheated seeds (control). Seedlings were then harvested after 3, 7 or 15 days to evaluate aerial and root mass, root:shoot ratio, presence of cotyledon opening, true leaves, and secondary roots. We found no effect on germination for seeds exposed to temperatures >= 150 degrees C. However, germination was significantly reduced for seeds exposed to 100 degrees C for both 2 and 5 min. The mass of 15-day-old K. coriacea seedlings was smaller when seeds were heated at 70 degrees C for 5 min or at temperatures higher or equal to 100 degrees C. Qualea parviflora seedlings did not show any difference in mass, but there were marginal differences in the presence of roots and the opening of cotyledons. Kielmeyera coriacea seedlings allocated biomass faster than Q. parviflora. High temperatures affect both quantity and quality of germinable seeds, as well as biomass allocation during initial seedling development. These factors may explain the decrease in seedlings observed after fire, suggesting a bottleneck effect that influences population dynamics and species persistence in systems with frequent fires.

AB Species coexistence is a result of biotic interactions, environmental and historical conditions. The Janzen-Connell hypothesis assumes that conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is one of the local processes maintaining high species diversity by decreasing population growth rates at high densities. However, the contribution of CNDD to species richness variation across environmental gradients remains unclear. In 32 large forest plots all over the Japanese archipelago covering > 40,000 individual trees of > 300 species and based on size distributions, we analysed the strength of CNDD of individual species and its contribution to species number and diversity across altitude, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and maximum snow depth gradients. The strength of CNDD was increasing towards low altitudes and high tree species number and diversity. The effect of CNDD on species number was changing across altitude, temperature and snow depth gradients and their combined effects contributed 11-18% of the overall explained variance. Our results suggest that CNDD can work as a mechanism structuring forest communities in the Japanese archipelago. Strong CNDD was observed to be connected with high species diversity under low environmental limitations where local biotic interactions are expected to be stronger than in niche-based community assemblies under high environmental filtering.

AB The vast majority of empirical studies on regional mammal defaunation across the Atlantic Forest biome of South America are concentrated in Southeastern and Northeastern regions. Thus, the lack of empirical information on the medium- to large-bodied mammal population declines across the subtropical region of this tropical biome and its major causes are paramount to conservation efforts. We investigate the influence of land use on mammal defaunation across the subtropical Atlantic Forest by sampling 91 points using 65 camera-traps installed for five consecutive years-totaling an effort of 30,189 camera-trap-days. We observed that the average defaunation across the Devonian Kniferidges Environmental Protection Area meta-region (spanning over subtropical Atlantic Forest plateaus) was 42% (D = 0.42; +/- 0.17) when compared to presumed assemblages of historical times going back to the Pre-Columbian era (ca. 500 years ago). The main landscape predictors of regional defaunation were silviculture and agriculture, once the highest defaunation indexes were concentered in sites intensely human-modified by these features. Protected areas had significantly lower defaunation indexes in comparison with the unprotected areas. Although our results of defaunation were 29.2% lesser than the average for the entire biome, the negative consequences of regional defaunation on ecosystem services are already occurring, once two in each five local species presumably are locally extinct or present low abundances (i.e. functionally extinct). Given that habitat conversion is the primary cause of global biodiversity decline, our results reinforce that biodiversity conservation is still strongly dependent on natural protected areas networks.

AB Brazilian beef systems contribute 14.9% of global beef production, therefore given climate change concerns, there is a clear need to reduce environmental impacts while maintaining economic viability. This study evaluated the hypothesis that steroid implant use in Brazilian beef cattle would reduce resource use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic costs of production, thereby improving environmental and economic sustainability. A deterministic model based on beef cattle population demographics, nutrition and performance was used to quantify resource inputs and GHG emissions per 1.0 x 10(6) kg of hot carcass weight (HCW) beef. System boundaries extended from cropping input manufacture to cattle arriving at the slaughterhouse. Beef systems were modeled using herd population dynamics, feed and performance data sourced from producers in four Brazilian states, with additional data from global databases. Implants were used in calves, growing and finishing cattle at low (LI), medium (MI), and high (HI) levels of performance enhancement, compared to non-implanted (NI) controls. Feed use results were used in combination with producer-derived input costs to assess the economic impacts of implant use, including production costs and returns on investment. Improved FCE, ADG, and carcass weights conferred by implant use reduced the number of cattle and the time taken to produce 1.0 x 10(6) kg HCW beef. Compared to NI controls, the quantities of feed, land, water and fossil fuels required to produce 1.0 x 10(6) kg HCW beef was reduced in implanted cattle, with reductions proportional to the performance-enhancing effect of the implant (HI > MI > LI). Implant use reduced GHG emissions per 1.0 x 10(6) kg HCW beef by 9.4% (LI), 12.6% (MI), or 15.8% (HI). Scaling up the MI effects to represent all eligible Brazilian cattle being implanted, revealed avoided GHG emissions equivalent to the annual exhaust emissions of 62.0 x 10(6) cars. Economic impacts of implant use reflected the environmental results, resulting in a greater margin for the producers within each system (cow-calf through to finishing). The 6.13% increase in kg of HCW beef produced generates a cost reduction of 3.76% and an increase in the return on invested capital of 4.14% on average. Implants offer the opportunity for Brazilian beef producers to demonstrate their dedication to improving environmental and economic sustainability through improved productivity, although care must be taken to avoid negative trade-offs.

AB Premise Primates are important seed dispersers, especially for large-seeded (>1 cm long) tropical species in continuous and fragmented rainforests. Methods In three forest fragments within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, southern Mexico, we investigated the effect of seed passage through the gut of howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) on the germination rate and maximum germination (%) of native, large-seeded species. One group of howler monkeys, per fragment, was followed and fresh feces collected. Large seeds were removed to compare their germination success with non-ingested seeds of the same species collected underneath parent plants. Results Feces contained large seeds from seven tree species (Ampelocera hottlei, Castilla elastica, Dialium guianense, Garcinia intermedia, Pourouma bicolor, Spondias mombin, Trophis racemosa) and one liana species (Abuta panamensis). Except for G. intermedia, ingested seeds germinated significantly faster than non-ingested seeds, which had negligible germination. Ingested seeds of D. guianense, P. bicolor, S. mombin, T. racemosa, and A. panamensis had significantly greater germination, while G. intermedia had significantly lower germination and seed ingestion had no apparent effect for A. hottlei and C. elastica. Conclusions In general, seed ingestion by howler monkeys confers faster germination compared with non-ingested seeds. Faster germination reduces predation probabilities and increases seedling establishment in forest fragments. Primate dispersal services contribute to germination heterogeneity within plant populations of old-growth forest species and to their persistence in forest fragments.

AB Recent waves of illegal deforestation for cattle pasture are damaging the Indio Maiz Biological Reserve and Rama-Kriol Territory of Nicaragua, with negative consequences to aquatic ecosystems and the people they support. This study creates a framework for how deforestation from cattle ranching causes shifts in stream community structure, mediated by changes in stream habitat over time. It integrates temporally explicit land use information with stream habitat, macroinvertebrate, freshwater shrimp, and fish community data to assess impacts of cattle ranching on 15 headwater streams. The deforestation history measure (DHM), a product of deforestation amount and time since deforestation for each catchment, strongly predicted stream habitat and biotic responses. Delayed effects of land-use change such as decreased allochthonous inputs (large wood, debris) and increased bank destabilization, sedimentation, flashiness, and the scouring effect were apparent in longer deforested catchments, causing lower richness and density and higher evenness of macroinvertebrates; lower shrimp abundance; and distinct changes in fish and invertebrate community composition. Both recently and longer deforested catchments had degraded riparia and smaller sized game fish. Otherwise, recently deforested catchments were more similar to forested catchments. Nicaragua's understudied primary rainforest ecosystems should be high priority for research and conservation before they are lost.

AB Tropical forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems and home to numerous tree species competing for resources in space and time. Functional traits influence the ecophysiological performance of tree species, yet the relationship between traits and emergent long-term growth patterns is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel 3D forest stand model in which growth patterns of individual trees and forest stands are emergent properties of leaf traits. Individual trees are simulated as 3D functional-structural tree models (FSTMs), considering branches up to the second order and leaf dynamics at a resolution of one cubic meter. Each species is characterized by a set of leaf traits that corresponds to a specific position on the leaf economics spectrum and determines light-driven carbon assimilation, respiration and mortality rates. Applying principles of the pipe model theory, these leaf scale processes are coupled with within-tree carbon allocation, i.e., 3D tree growth emerges from low-level processes. By integrating these FSTMs into a dynamic forest stand model, we go beyond modern stand models to integrate structurally detailed internal physiological processes with interspecific competition and interactions with the environment in diverse tree communities. For model calibration and validation, we simultaneously compared a large number of emergent patterns at both the tree and forest levels in a pattern-oriented modelling framework. At the tree level, the specific leaf area and correlated leaf traits determined the maximum height and age of trees, as well as their size-dependent growth rate and shade tolerance. Trait variations along the leaf economics spectrum led to a continuous transition from fast-growing, short-lived and shade-intolerant to slow-growing, long-lived and shade-tolerant trees. These emerging patterns resemble well-known functional tree types, indicating a fundamental impact of leaf traits on long-term growth patterns. At the forest level, a large number of patterns taken from lowland Neotropical forests were reproduced, indicating that our forest model simulates structurally realistic forests over long time spans. Our ecophysiological approach improves the understanding of how leaf level processes scale up to the tree and the stand level, and facilitates the development of next-generation forest models for species-rich forests in which tree performance emerges directly from functional traits.

AB Periwinkles (Littorinidae: genus Littoraria) are one of the very few molluscan clades showing an adaptive radiation closely associated to the mangrove habitat. However, pervasive land use changes associated to urbanization is prompting mangrove loss or degradation, with unknown consequences for mangrove-associated fauna. In the southern Colombian Caribbean, mangrove ecosystems have been encroached by human settlements and different populations of Littoraria angulifera (Lamarck, 1822) now inhabit anthropogenic intertidal substrates in urban areas, but the demographic traits of populations thriving in these novel environments are unknown. We studied the relative abundance and size structure of L. angulifera in remnant mangrove patches, woody debris and anthropogenic substrates (boulder seawalls and built structures) in 13 locations throughout the Uraba Gulf, a human-transformed tropical estuarine system. The abundance of L. angulifera was up to two orders of magnitude higher in anthropogenic than in quasi-natural or natural substrates. Snails also displayed a significant preference for wave protected positions in boulder seawalls and built structures exposed to heavy wave action, which was not previously reported in mangrove forests. Moreover, snail populations in anthropogenic substrate were consistently dominated by individuals of small sizes in comparison with mangroves or driftwood. We argue that the anthropogenic disturbances caused by the expansion of Turbo city during nearly one century in a coast formerly dominated by mangrove forests are providing novel and expanding habitats, whose quality might be good enough as to support high-density populations of L. angulifera. However, we hypothesize that shifted thermal regimes in hard and novel wave-exposed urban seascapes might also be prompting behavioral adjustments and the selection of smaller size ranges than those observed in mangrove forests.

AB Interactions between soil fauna and soil microorganisms are not fully recognized, especially in extreme environments, such as long-term metal-polluted soils. The purpose of the study was to assess how the presence of Lasius niger ants affected soil microbial characteristics in a long-term metal-polluted area (Upper Silesia in Poland). Paired soil samples were taken from bulk soil and from ant nests and analysed for a range of soil physicochemical properties, including metal content (zinc, cadmium, and lead). Microbial analysis included soil microbial activity (soil respiration rate), microbial biomass (substrate-induced respiration rate), and bacteria catabolic properties (Biolog(R) ECO plates). Soil collected from ant nests was drier and was characterized by a lower content of organic matter, carbon and nitrogen contents, and also lower metal content than bulk soil. Soil microbial respiration rate was positively related to soil pH (p = 0.01) and negatively to water-soluble metal content, integrated into TIws index (p = 0.01). Soil microbial biomass was negatively related to TIws index (p = 0.04). Neither soil microbial activity and biomass nor bacteria catabolic activity and diversity indices differed between bulk soil and ant nests. Taken together, ant activity reduced soil contamination by metals in a microscale which support microbial community activity and biomass but did not affect Biolog (R) culturable bacteria.

AB The Phyllostomidae is arguably the most diverse family-level clade of mammals. Associated with this high diversity is considerable heterogeneity in resource utilisation among species and across locales of the Neotropics. Despite heterogeneity, few attempts have been made to synthesise dietary patterns even for smaller regions within the Neotropics. Atlantic Forest is a large dynamic ecoregion in the southern Neotropics that is distinct from other Tropical forests because of its extensive latitudinal extent, elevated climatic heterogeneity, biodiversity and long history of anthropogenic modification. I obtained data on dietary affinities of 34 species of bats from 35 different sites spanning the entire Atlantic Forest. In Atlantic Forest, as in other places in the Neotropics, phyllostomids consumed arthropods, vertebrates, fruits, nectar and blood. Frugivores consumed and dispersed the fruits of 99 different species of plants and nectarivores pollinated an additional nine others. Dietary overlap was modest, yet significantly greater than expected based on a null model. The main axis of variation in diet separated species that primarily consumed animal material from those that primarily consumed plant material and this axis was significantly related to phylogenetic affinities of species. Unlike in other places in the Neotropics, frugivorous bats did not exhibit a core structure related to genus-to-genus matching of bat genera with plant genera. Generality of diets of frugivorous bats, further indicated by non-randomly high dietary overlap, is likely to degrade core structure in these primarily Subtropical communities. Co-occurrence of a large number of generalist bat species, seasonal climates and ubiquitous anthropogenic modification may serve to promote generality of resource utilisation of bats in Atlantic Forest. The Neotropics is vast and the bats that live within it are diverse. Future studies should explore spatial dynamics of dietary affinities and resource overlap to increase understanding of the context of strong and weak core structure of phyllostomid bat communities.

AB Studies addressing the impact of herbivory in carnivorous plants are scarce, despite loss of tissue being expected to be costly, as leaves are involved in both energy and nutrient acquisition. We evaluated the effect of simulated herbivory in a population of the carnivorous plant Pinguicula moranensis. We predicted an overall negative impact of herbivory by reducing growth, flowering probability and survivorship. Specifically, we expected that the increase in the negative effect should be related to the amount of leaf area removed. We performed simulated herbivory in plants growing in situ (2015) and ex situ (greenhouse, 2016) using a paper punch (herbivory ranging from 0 to 50%). In the ex-situ experiment, we also tested the effect of availability of resources by implementing a prey addition trial where half of the plants were supplemented with prey (one fruit fly per week). In both experiments, our hypothesis was not supported, as growth, flowering probability and survivorship were not influenced by herbivory treatments. Plants subjected to prey addition did not show higher performance than plants deprived of prey, contradicting our prediction that availability of resources could ameliorate the effect of herbivory. Overall, the lack of differences in performance between undamaged (control) and damaged plants indicate an unexpected short-term ability of P. moranensis to tolerate herbivory, even at high levels of damage.

AB The diversity of tropical forests is strongly shaped by mutualistic interactions involving plants and frugivores that disperse their seeds. However, it is little known how decreases in the diversity of frugivores can affect seed dispersal patterns, plant community composition and species' coexistence in tropical forest landscapes. Here, we investigated the effects of bird frugivore diversity on seed dispersal of rare plant species and on the magnitude of equalizing effects on the seed rain in open areas within 12 fragmented landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We monitored the production of bird-dispersed seeds and bird abundance in forest fragments, and sampled the seed rain and the activity of birds attracted to experimental tree nuclei established in neighboring pastures. The activity of frugivores in tree nuclei was positively correlated with the diversity of birds recorded in nearby forest fragments, and the seed rain diversity increased with frugivore activity. The proportion of seeds dispersed more frequently than expected by chance in tree nuclei increased linearly with the species' richness of birds. The richness and abundance of active frugivores in deforested areas promoted a seed rain with evenness and diversity up to five times greater than the seed pool available in forest fragments due to the proportional increase in the dispersal of rare plant species and a concomitant proportional decrease in the dispersal of dominant fruiting plants. Furthermore, every additional bird species detected in a site was associated with a 10% increase in the equalizing effect on dispersed seeds' relative abundance. Our results show that the aggregated behavior of avian frugivore communities on deforested areas results in higher species richness in the seed rain of plant communities and underscore the urgency to reduce bird species' loss and the simplification of their communities in tropical landscapes.

AB The Philippines, as a tropical archipelagic country, is particularly vulnerable to environmental changes affecting coastal and marine settings. However, there are limited studies investigating how these changes are perceived by the local populations who depend directly on the marine environment for their livelihoods, health, and well-being, and who are the most vulnerable to such changes. To explore these issues, we conducted an in-home face-to-face structured survey in 10 coastal communities in Palawan, Philippines (n = 431). As part of the survey, respondents were asked to comment on how important they believed a list of 22 drivers/pressures (e.g., "land-use change") were in affecting their local marine environment. Statistical analysis of this list using Exploratory Factor Analysis suggested the 22 drivers/pressures could be categorized into 7 discrete groups (or in statistical terms "factors") of drivers/pressures (e.g., "urbanization," "unsustainable fishing practices" etc.). We then used ordinary least squared regression to identify similarities and differences between the perspectives within and across communities, using various socio-demographic variables. Results suggested that among the seven identified factors, four were perceived by the local communities as making the marine environment worse, two were perceived as having no impact, and one was perceived to be making the marine environment better. Perceptions differed by gender, education, ethnicity, and study site. A subsequent survey with 16 local coastal resource management experts, suggested that public perceptions of the most critical drivers/pressures were broadly consistent with those of this expert group. Our findings highlight how aware local coastal communities are of the drivers/pressures underpinning the threats facing their livelihoods, health, and well-being. Ultimately, this information can support and inform decisions for the management of local marine resources.

AB Fire is a natural phenomenon that affects the Earth's biogeochemical cycle. Wildland fires are increasing in frequency and magnitude, possibly owing to climate change. In addition, fire is applied as a tool in agroecosystem management. However, several detrimental effects on soil properties, particularly on soil aggregate stability, might occur. A general explanation is that "the effects of fire on soil aggregate stability in soil with high clay content, calcium carbonate, and Fe and Al oxides as the principal cementing substances cause gradual improvement in aggregate stability, following fire-heating severity." In short, the higher the fire severity, the higher is the aggregate stability. A meta-analysis was conducted for assessing the laboratory and field studies to verify this concept. The Scopus (R) platform was used to search for the literature related to "soil aggregate stability" AND fire OR heating AND clay OR "clayey soil." A total of 10 studies were selected with 16 soil types, 244 burned or heated samples, and 160 control samples. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Metaanalysis was delineated according to the following assumptions: a) field and laboratory studies were tested as two independent subgroups, and a pooled effect was subsequently calculated; b) a random-effects model was used; c) mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for continuous variables. Laboratory and field measurements showed dissimilar effects on soil aggregate stability and evidenced positive effects in the laboratory experiments compared with those in the field. Aggregate stability measured in the laboratory increased by 2.80% after heating. Fire effects measured in the field did not show a significant increase in soil aggregate stability (-0.16%). The overall effects of combined subgroups showed an aggregate stability improvement of 1.49% (confidence intervals 0.80% to 2.17%). However, the weight of the results from the laboratory studies played an important role in the overall effect. The soil clay content was found to be inversely associated with aggregate stability, i.e., the lower the clay content the higher the aggregate stability in soil subjected to fire heating. In conclusion, the aggregate stability of clayey soils rich in Al and Fe oxides does not necessarily improves following fire heating.

AB Root-associated fungal communities modify the climatic niches and even the competitive ability of their hosts, yet how the different components of the root microbiome are modified by habitat loss remains a key knowledge gap. Using principles of landscape ecology, we tested how free-living versus host-associated microbes differ in their response to landscape heterogeneity. Further, we explore how compartmentalisation of microbes into specialised root structures filters for key fungal symbionts. Our study demonstrates that free-living fungal community structure correlates with landscape heterogeneity, but that host-associated fungal communities depart from these patterns. Specifically, biotic filtering in roots, especially via compartmentalisation within specialised root structures, decouples the biogeographic patterns of host-associated fungal communities from the soil community. In this way, even as habitat loss and fragmentation threaten fungal diversity in the soils, plant hosts exert biotic controls to ensure associations with critical mutualists, helping to preserve the root mycobiome.

AB A challenge in biogeography is to understand what are the factors and how they regulate soil microbial communities. To explore the coexistence pattern of bacterial community and the factors shaping agricultural soil bacterial community at spatial scale, 135 soil samples were collected from a typically agricultural province in the North China Plain and analyzed with high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. As expected, bacterial community dissimilarity showed significant distance-decay relationships with 42.2% variation explained by geographic distance and physicochemical factors. Bacterial phyla abundance showed different responses to environmental factors among which soil pH was the primary factor shaping soil bacterial community structure. Bacterial communities in acidic soils suggest lower phylotype richness and phylogenetic diversity and its associated network structure showed greater connectivity and stability compared to those in neutral and alkaline soils. Soil bacterial community diversity was also varied with soil type. Unlike the simplest topological features of co-occurrence network in Cinnamon soil, bacterial community structure was more connected and stable in Lime concretion black soil and Kallotenuales but not the predominant taxa were identified as kinless hub. However, Neisseriales, Anaerolineaceae and Nannocystaceae from Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi with higher relative abundance might support higher levels of ecosystem functions in Fluvo-aquic soil. Taken together, our results suggest that geographic distance and pH variation strongly shaped bacterial community structure with correspondingly diverse co-occurrence patterns observed in different soil pH ranges and types.

AB Functional traits are measurable characteristics that affect an organism's fitness under certain environmental conditions. The use of functional traits in microbial ecology holds great promise for improving our ability to develop biogeochemical models and predict ecosystem responses to global changes. Notably, functional traits could be decoupled from taxonomic relatedness, owing to horizontal gene transfer among microorganisms and adaptive evolution. In recent years, our knowledge about microbial functional traits has been substantially enhanced, thereby revealing the multitude of ecological processes in driving community assembly and dynamics. Here, I summarize the emerging patterns of how microbial functional traits respond to changing environments, which considerably differ from better-studied microbial taxonomy. I use niche and neutral theories to explain microbial functional traits. Finally, I highlight future challenges to analyze, elucidate, and utilize functional traits in microbial ecology.

AB Highly diverse plant communities growing on nutrient-impoverished soils are test beds for theories on species coexistence. Here, neighbouring mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants compete for limited phosphorus. The impact of below-ground interactions on community dynamics is underexplored. We used an experimental approach to investigate effects of inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and a phosphorus supply gradient on competitive and facilitative interactions among mixed assemblages of woody plants in microcosms. The plant species, one cluster root-forming (CR) species and four AM species, are native to jarrah forest that grows on nutrient-impoverished soils in south-western Australia. We measured plant growth in microcosms, with and without inoculation with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis, and across a gradient of P supply: 0, 9, 27 and 243 mg P per kg of soil. Our data show evidence of plant-plant facilitation at low P supply and competition at high P supply. Growth of the CR species, Hakea undulata, was highest in microcosms with 0P and without AM inoculation. One AM species, Bossiaea aquifolium, also performed better at lower P levels, possibly benefitting from P mobilised by H. undulata. The other three AM species, one strongly obligates, performed better at higher P levels. Data for Acacia celastrifolia suggested it was facultatively mycotropic, and because there was no correlation between AM colonisation and the relative inoculum effect, we suggest positive effects of AM inoculation at 9P might be due to benefits other than P acquisition, such as pathogen defence. Benefit of AM inoculation diminished for three of four mycorrhizal species at the highest P level as we had predicted. The fourth species, Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah), had higher growth in microcosms that were not inoculated with AM, perhaps because the species benefits more from ectomycorrhizas. Synthesis. Our experimental data suggest spatial heterogeneity of soil P, coupled with a diversity of nutrient-acquisition strategies, and plasticity among plant-plant and plant-AM fungi interactions, contributes to plant species coexistence in the nutrient-impoverished jarrah forest. Our research highlights the importance of below-ground mechanisms for understanding factors determining community structure including a potential role of AM fungi in plant pathogen defence.

AB As the most remote archipelago in the world, the Hawaiian Islands are home to a highly endemic and disharmonic biota that has fascinated biologists for centuries. Forests are the dominant terrestrial biome in Hawai'i, spanning complex, heterogeneous climates across substrates that vary tremendously in age, soil structure, and nutrient availability. Species richness is low in Hawaiian forests compared to other tropical forests, as a consequence of dispersal limitation from continents and adaptive radiations in only some lineages, and forests are dominated by the widespread Metrosideros species complex. Low species richness provides a relatively tractable model system for studies of community assembly, local adaptation, and species interactions. Moreover, Hawaiian forests provide insights into predicted patterns of evolution on islands, revealing that while some evidence supports "island syndromes," there are exceptions to them all. For example, Hawaiian plants are not as a whole less defended against herbivores, less dispersible, more conservative in resource use, or more slowgrowing than their continental relatives. Clearly, more work is needed to understand the drivers, sources, and constraints on phenotypic variation among Hawaiian species, including both widespread and rare species, and to understand the role of this variation for ecological and evolutionary processes, which will further contribute to conservation of this unique biota. Today, Hawaiian forests are among the most threatened globally. Resource management failures - the proliferation of non-native species in particular - have led to devastating declines in native taxa and resulted in dominance by novel species assemblages. Conservation and restoration of Hawaiian forests now rely on managing threats including climate change, ongoing species introductions, novel pathogens, lost mutualists, and altered ecosystem dynamics through the use of diverse tools and strategies grounded in basic ecological, evolutionary, and biocultural principles. The future of Hawaiian forests thus depends on the synthesis of ecological and evolutionary research, which will continue to inform future conservation and restoration practices.

AB Cross-habitat spillover (i.e. the movement of individuals between different habitat types) occurs very often in agricultural landscapes, following temporary crop resource pulses that work as complementary resources for biodiversity. We tested how avian spillover at edges of forest fragments is affected by the adjacent agricultural matrix contrast (sun coffee plantations or pastures), forest fragment size, and forest cover at the landscape scale. We performed paired mist netting at forest edges (forest/sun coffee plantations and forest/pastures; N = 24) and estimated the spillover ratio and the dissimilarity of birds moving in- and out- forest fragments. We found that avian spillover in highly fragmented landscapes is a bidirectional process regardless of species habitat association or feeding guild. Matrix type is a key driver of spillover, and most spillover occurred when the matrix is of less contrast (i.e. sun coffee plantations). Spillover ratio at coffee interfaces increased with forest cover and also with fragment size, meanwhile at pasture interfaces spillover only increased at high values of forest cover and fragment size. Finally, we found that the dissimilarity between bird species entering and leaving the fragments was higher in pasture matrices, while at coffee interfaces the dissimilarity was lower. Landscape management aimed at reducing the contrast between matrix and habitat, increasing habitat cover and maintaining large fragments can intensify spillover movements across natural and anthropogenic habitats, and potentially, promote more ecosystem service provision by those species that are performing spillover movements.

AB Environmental filters and functional adjustments of species to local conditions are major determinants of plant communities in stressing habitats. We set out to understand the role of different substrates in functional trait variation in wood plants by investigating key functional traits at the community and intraspecific levels in different types of Brazilian savanna: two sites of alluvial savannas (lowland savannas that occur in old alluvial deposits in riverbeds with sandy soils and low water-holding capacity), and two sites of typical savannas (upland savannas that occur in interfluvial zones, far from the influence of rivers, in which clay soils with higher fertility and water-holding capacity predominate). We conducted this study in four sites with savanna vegetation in the northeast region of the Cerrado Biome, nearby the transition with the Amazon. In each site we sampled six functional traits for each tree species: leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area (SLA), stem-specific density, relative bark thickness and maximum plant height. We sampled 101 wood species, ranging from 26 to 62 species within each site. In both community and intraspecific levels, alluvial savanna plants showed higher SLA and specific-stem density, and lower leaf area, leaf thickness, bark thickness, and plant height compared with the typical savanna. We also found that, at a given leaf thickness, species from typical savanna exhibited -20% higher SLA. In addition, at a given plant height, typical species showed -56% higher bark thickness and -20% lower specific-stem density. Our findings suggest that savanna tree species growing on alluvial savannas tend to adopt strategies related to water acquisition while species growing on typical savannas invest in both water conservation strategies and protection against high-intensity fires. We conclude that water deficit and fire, both related to substrate properties, play a key role in determining the woody plant communities functioning in savannas.

AB Ecosystem engineers (EEs) are present in every environment and are known to strongly influence ecological processes and thus shape the distribution of species and resources. In this study, we assessed the direct and indirect effect of two EEs (perennial shrubs and ant nests), individually and combined, on the composition and function of arid soil bacterial communities. To that end, topsoil samples were collected in the Negev desert highlands during the dry season from four patch types: (1) barren soil; (2) under shrubs; (3) near ant nests; or (4) near ant nests situated under shrubs. The bacterial community composition and potential functionality were evaluated in the soil samples (14 replicates per patch type) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing together with physico-chemical measures of the soil. We have found that the EEs affected the community composition differently. Barren patches supported a soil microbiome, dominated by Rubrobacter and Proteobacteria, while in EE patches Deinococcus-Thermus dominated. The presence of the EEs similarly enhanced the abundance of phototrophic, nitrogen cycle, and stress-related genes. In addition, the soil characteristics were altered only when both EEs were combined. Our results suggest that arid landscapes foster unique communities selected by patches created by each EE(s), solo or in combination. Although the communities' composition differs, they support similar potential functions that may have a role in surviving the harsh arid conditions. The combined effect of the EEs on soil microbial communities is a good example of the hard-to-predict non-additive features of arid ecosystems that merit further research.

AB Light condition and neighbor effects are important environmental factors that need to be considered for restoration of mangroves, especially when introduced species are mixed with native species. To evaluate different mangrove species performance under various light intensities and different planting systems, we selected three native mangrove species (Avicennia marina, Aegiceras corniculatum, and Kandelia obovata) and grew them with Sonneratia apetala in multispecies plots and in monospecies plots without S. apetala under three light conditions in Futian Nature Reserve, south China. After 10 months of the experiment, plant functional traits were measured. The results showed that S. apetala was a light-demanding species and A. corniculatum and A. marina were suitable for growth under the medium light condition. The native species were inhibited by S. apetala. Specifically, the height and basal diameter of the native species were lower in the multispecies plots than in the monospecies plots. In the multispecies plots, native species changed their functional growth traits, with higher-specific leaf area and chlorophyll content, and reduced leaf thickness, leaf dry-mass content, and carotenoid content compared to those in the monospecies plots. These results indicated trade-offs between traits that enhance light interception and traits that stimulate plant growth in native species. Our findings revealed that S. apetala is an adequate species with good invasion capability for restoration in open-degraded areas, but its ecological impact on the inhibited growth of native species should be carefully considered in mangrove restoration.

AB Societal Impact Statement Crop wild relatives (CWR) are plant taxa closely related to crops and are a source of high genetic diversity that can help adapt crops to the impacts of global change, particularly to meet increasing consumer demand in the face of the climate crisis. CWR provide vital ecosystem services and are increasingly important for food and nutrition security and sustainable and resilient agriculture. They therefore are of major biological, social, cultural and economic importance. Assessing the extinction risk of CWR is essential to prioritise in situ and ex situ conservation strategies in Mesoamerica to guarantee the long-term survival and availability of these resources for present and future generations worldwide. Ensuring food security is one of the world's most critical issues as agricultural systems are already being impacted by global change. Crop wild relatives (CWR)-wild plants related to crops-possess genetic variability that can help adapt agriculture to a changing environment and sustainably increase crop yields to meet the food security challenge. Here we report the results of an extinction risk assessment of 224 wild relatives of some of the world's most important crops (i.e. chilli pepper, maize, common bean, avocado, cotton, potato, squash, vanilla and husk tomato) in Mesoamerica-an area of global significance as a centre of crop origin, domestication and of high CWR diversity. We show that 35% of the selected CWR taxa are threatened with extinction according to The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List demonstrates that these valuable genetic resources are under high anthropogenic threat. The dominant threat processes are land use change for agriculture and farming, invasive and other problematic species (e.g. pests, genetically modified organisms) and use of biological resources, including overcollection and logging. The most significant drivers of extinction relate to smallholder agriculture-given its high incidence and ongoing shifts from traditional agriculture to modern practices (e.g. use of herbicides)-smallholder ranching and housing and urban development and introduced genetic material. There is an urgent need to increase knowledge and research around different aspects of CWR. Policies that support in situ and ex situ conservation of CWR and promote sustainable agriculture are pivotal to secure these resources for the benefit of current and future generations.

AB Prior to European settlement the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem covered over 92 million hectares in the southeastern United States. Historically, fire was an important driver of species composition in the longleaf pine ecosystem, but fire exclusion since the early 20th century has led to the degradation of longleaf pine communities and has had a detrimental effect on the large number of rare and endemic species found within this system. Thus, accurate estimates of fire history are important for better informed management of longleaf pine communities. Recently, satellite imagery has been used to identify burned areas. However, results have been inconsistent across physiographic regions and vegetation types (e.g. wetlands under high canopy). We developed a model using Landsat satellite imagery, coupled with a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, to identify burned areas and estimate the fire history from 1991 to 2019 for Fort Bragg, NC, one of the largest contiguous areas of longleaf pine ecosystem remaining. We calculated six spectral indices from the Landsat band values, including the Mid-Infrared Burn Index (MIRBI) and the change in MIRBI through time (Delta MIRBI), and used them as predictors in our RF model. We used the developed RF model to estimate the fire history for all known populations of 24 rare upland and wetland plant species found on Fort Bragg. We compared our results to a recent continental U.S. fire occurrence dataset, as well as the prescribed fire records from Fort Bragg. The overall AUC (area under the curve) for our RF model (0.74) compared favorably to the continental U.S. dataset results for Fort Bragg (0.69), and was able to capture the reduced fire frequency in wetlands. The most important predictor in our RF model was Delta MIRBI. Depending on the model, individual plant species were estimated to have experienced significant differences in fire frequency relative to the prescribed fire records. For our RF model, we estimated that 50% of wetland and 25% of upland species experienced a lower fire frequency relative to that represented in the prescribed fire records. The burn probability and classification tool generated in this paper provides land managers in the southeastern U.S. with a novel approach for accurately identifying burned areas and estimating local fire frequency across landscapes.

AB Biological communities may be assembled by both niche-based and dispersal-based (= historic) processes with the relative importance of these processes in community assembly being scale- and context-dependent. To infer whether (a) niche-based or dispersal-based processes play the main role in the assembly of flea communities parasitic on small mammals and whether (b) the main processes of flea community assembly are scale-dependent, we applied a novel permutation-based algorithm (PER-SIMPER) and the dispersal-niche continuum index (DNCI), to data on the species incidence of fleas and their hosts at two spatial scales. At the larger (continental) scale, we analysed flea communities in four biogeographic realms across adjacent continental sections. At the smaller (local) scale, we considered flea communities across two main regions (lowlands and mountains) and seven habitat types within Slovakia. Our analyses demonstrated that species composition of fleas and their small mammalian hosts depended predominantly on historical processes (dispersal) at both scale. This was true for the majority of biogeographic realms at continental scale (except the Nearctic) and both regions at local scale. Nevertheless, strong niche-based assembly mechanism was found in the Nearctic assemblages. At local scale, the intensity of dispersal processes was weaker and niche-driven processes were stronger between habitats within a region than between mountain and lowland regions. We provide historical and ecological explanations for these patterns. We conclude that the assembly of compound flea communities is governed, to a great extent, by the dispersal processes acting on their hosts and, to a lesser extent, by the niche-based processes.

AB Brazil faces its greatest period of environmental setback, where "ruralists" (large landholders and their representatives) gain access to government land in the Amazon. New roads are being paved, such as Highway BR-319 connecting Porto Velho in Brazil's notorious "arc of deforestation" to Manaus in relatively intact central Amazo<SIC>nia. This highway acts as a spearhead penetrating one of the Amazon's most preserved forest blocks. Here we report how the Brazilian government has been favoring land grabbing (grilagem) in the Amazon and how BR319 has given access to public lands and encouraged the invasion of these areas together with land grabbing and deforestation. This is not just a process linked to the highway, as it also involves the actions of government agencies such as the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA). Illegal logging is rampant and areas of government land are being marked out by land grabbers (grileiros) for illegal sale to arriving migrants. Despite environmental legislation requiring an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for "Lot C," which is one of stretches where deforestation is advancing, a judge has authorized paving this stretch without an EIA. Opening BR-319 and its associated side roads represents a path with no return to a tipping point of selfdegradation and loss of Amazonia's vital biodiversity and climate-stabilization functions.

AB Plant trait-based ecology is a powerful extension of the attempt of community ecologists to unveil assembly mechanisms. However, the two main expected determinants of community assembly, niche and neutral processes, can be confused under this framework. Here, we propose to move from trait-based to phenotype-based community ecology, accounting for the variation between individuals (phenotypes affected by the abiotic and biotic environment, and vice versa), and explicitly considering their ability to compete with or facilitate its neighbours. This would shift our focus from species' niche responses to niche specialization of phenotypes, reducing the space for neutrality at the finest scales. The current assembly framework, based mainly on niche complementarity and using species-average functional traits, has been developed exploring mega-diverse communities, but it fails at describing poor plant communities. Under this framework, monospecificity would be interpreted as an arena where functionally similar individuals compete, consequently leading to regular patterns, which are rarely found in nature. Our niche specialization framework could help explaining coexistence in rich plant communities, where the higher fraction of functional variation is found between species, whereas the intraspecific trait variation dominates in poor species and monospecific communities. We propose a guide to conduct massive phenotyping at the community scale based on the use of visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. We also discuss the need to integrate the so-called plant's eye perspective based on the use of spatial pattern statistics in the current community ecology toolbox.

AB Questions To gain insights into the role of species-by-species replacements in cloud forest community structuring, we asked: (1) What are the effects of the spatial distribution of standing individuals on the seed rain, soil seed bank, and sapling density and survival in this cloud forest?; and (2) What is the prevalence of conspecific vs heterospecific replacements in the regeneration of this forest? Location Santo Tomas Teipan, Oaxaca State, southern Mexico. Methods In a 1-ha cloud forest plot, we assessed seed rain, seed bank, and sapling density and survival of four canopy tree species (Chiranthodendron pentadactylon, Cornus disciflora, Quercus laurina and Oreopanax xalapensis). All standing individuals of these and other tree species (diameter at breast height [DBH] >= 2.5 cm) were mapped. We used neighbourhood models to examine the spatial patterns of the three life cycle stages relative to the spatial distribution of adults. The neighbourhood effect was assessed through the Neighbourhood Index, which integrates information on size (DBH) and distance to adults. Data analysis was based on maximum likelihood and model selection procedures. Results We found large between-species differences regarding the spatial patterns of seeds and saplings. Three species showed evidence for the Janzen-Connell effect operating at the seed (Chiranthodendron pentadactylon and Quercus laurina) or sapling (Oreopanax xalapensis) stage. We also found support for a critical role of specific microsite factors (i.e. niche differentiation) in the regeneration of two species (Chiranthodendron pentadactylon and Cornus disciflora). Conclusions Seed and sapling distribution patterns suggest the prevalence of heterospecific replacements and that both Janzen-Connell and niche differentiation effects contribute to this pattern. Our results largely support the notion that the prevalence of heterospecific replacements among canopy species promotes species co-existence in cloud forests.

AB Questions Understanding spatial variation in floristic composition is crucial to quantify the extent, patchiness and connectivity of distinct habitats and their spatial relationships. Broad-scale variation in floristic composition and the degree of uniqueness of different regions remains poorly mapped and understood in several areas across the globe. We here aim to map vegetation heterogeneity in Amazonia. Location Middle Jurua river region, Amazonas State, Brazil. Methods We mapped four plant groups by applying machine learning to scale up locally observed community composition and using environmental and remotely sensed variables as predictors, which were obtained as GIS layers. To quantify how reliable our predictions were, we made an assessment of model transferability and spatial applicability. We also compared our floristic composition map to the official Brazilian national-level vegetation classification. Results The overall performance of our floristic models was high for all four plant groups, especially ferns, and the predictions were found to be spatially congruent and highly transferable in space. For some areas, the models were assessed not to be applicable, as the field sampling did not cover the spectral or environmental characteristics of those regions. Our maps show extensive habitat heterogeneity across the region. When compared to the Brazilian vegetation classification, floristic composition was relatively homogeneous within dense forests, while floristic heterogeneity in rainforests classified as open was high. Conclusion Our maps provide geoecological characterization of the regions and can be used to test biogeographical hypotheses, develop species distribution models and, ultimately, aid science-based conservation and land-use planning.

AB The U-net is nowadays among the most popular deep learning algorithms for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping; nevertheless, it has rarely been used with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral (MS) imagery. On the other hand, the discrimination between plantations and forests in LULC maps has been emphasized, especially for tropical areas, due to their differences in biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. In this study, we trained a U-net using different imagery inputs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, MS, SAR and a combination of both (MS + SAR); while a random forests algorithm (RF) with the MS + SAR input was also trained to evaluate the difference in algorithm selection. The classification system included ten classes, including old-growth and secondary forests, as well as old-growth and young plantations. The most accurate results were obtained with the MS + SAR U-net, where the highest overall accuracy (0.76) and average F1-score (0.58) were achieved. Although MS + SAR and MS U-nets gave similar results for almost all of the classes, for old-growth plantations and secondary forest, the addition of the SAR band caused an F1-score increment of 0.08-0.11 (0.62 vs. 0.54 and 0.45 vs. 0.34, respectively). Consecutively, in comparison with the MS + SAR RF, the MS + SAR U-net obtained higher F1-scores for almost all the classes. Our results show that using the U-net with a combined input of SAR and MS images enabled a higher F1-score and accuracy for a detailed LULC map, in comparison with other evaluated methods.

AB Forest degradation continues to increase globally, threatening biodiversity and the survival of species. In this context, identifying intact, old-growth forest stands is both urgent and vital to ensure their existence and multiple contributions to society. Despite the global ecological importance of the Valdivian temperate rainforests, they are threatened by forest degradation resulting from constant and intense human use in the region. Identification of remnant intact forests in this region is urgent to global forest protection efforts. In this paper, we analyzed whether forests-canopy alterations due to logging produce a distinctive canopy gap structure (e.g., a gap area and a fraction of canopy gaps in the forest) that can be used to remotely distinguish intact from altered forests. We tested this question by comparing the canopy gap structure of 12 old-growth temperate rainforests in south-central Chile (39-40 degrees S), with different levels of canopy alterations due to logging. At each stand, we obtained aerial or satellite very high spatial-resolution images that were automatically segmented using the Mean-Shift segmentation algorithm. We validated the results obtained remotely with ground data on the canopy gap structure. We found that the variables, canopy gap fraction, gap area frequency distribution, and mean gap area could be measured remotely with a high level of accuracy. Intact forests have a distinct canopy gap structure in comparison to forests with canopy alterations due to logging. Our results provided a fast, low-cost, and reliable method to obtain canopy gap structure indicators for mapping and monitoring intact forests in the Valdivian ecoregion. The method provided valuable information for managers interested in maintaining and restoring old-growth forest structures in these southern-temperate rainforests.

AB Climate drying could have transformed ecosystems in southern Madagascar during recent millennia by contributing to the extinction of endemic megafauna. However, the extent of regional aridification during the past 2000 years is poorly known, as are the responses of endemic animals and economically important livestock to drying. We inferred similar to 1600 years of climate change around Lake Ranobe, SW Madagascar, using oxygen isotope analyses of monospecific freshwater ostracods (Bradleystrandesia cf. fuscata) and elemental analyses of lake core sediment. We inferred past changes in habitat and diet of introduced and extinct endemic megaherbivores using bone collagen stable isotope and C-14 datasets (n = 63). Extinct pygmy hippos and multiple giant lemur species disappeared from the vicinity of Ranobe during a dry interval similar to 1000-700 cal yr BP, but the simultaneous appearance of introduced cattle, high charcoal concentrations, and other evidence of human activity confound inference of drought-driven extirpations. Unlike the endemic megafauna, relatively low collagen stable nitrogen isotope values among cattle suggest they survived dry intervals by exploiting patches of wet habitat. Although megafaunal extirpations coincided with drought in SW Madagascar, coupled data from bone and lake sediments do not support the hypothesis that extinct megafauna populations collapsed solely because of drought. Given that the reliance of livestock on mesic patches will become more important in the face of projected climate drying, we argue that sustainable conservation of spiny forests in SW Madagascar should support local livelihoods by ensuring that zebu have access to mesic habitat. Additionally, the current interactions between pastoralism and riparian habitats should be studied to help conserve the island's biodiversity.

AB Maqui (Aristotelia chilensis [Mol.] Stuntz) is a native berry of the Patagonia Andean forests, which has one of the highest antioxidant levels currently known. This biochemical characteristic strongly depends on the phenolic profile and is highly influenced by the growing environment. The objective of this study was to characterize natural maqui populations in the immediate lee (Argentina) of the Northern Patagonian Andes, distributed in a latitudinal gradient and associated with coihue (Nothofagus dombeyi) and cypress (Austrocedrus chilensis) forests, humid and xeric environments, respectively. Twenty-five natural populations that spanned the geographical distribution of the species in Argentina, were identified. The sites were associated with two forests (coihue and cypress) and three latitudinal groups (north, center and south). Canopy cover and light interception were measured in the selected sites, as well as plant morphology, fruit yield components, phenolic profiles and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of mature berries. Maqui populations associated to cypress are exposed to greater incident total solar radiation and lesser rainfalls, and showed shorter plants with several main stems, multiple branching and smaller specific leaf area (SLA) as compared to those of coihue forest. Maqui populations associated to coihue presented an increase in the number of berries per bunch, and also in the accumulation of phenols and ORAC. The evaluation of the acclimation responses of the natural populations by different envi-ronments can contribute to the development of high-yield and quality maqui crops as source of bioactive compounds.

AB Biodiversity contributes to the ecological and climatic stability of the Amazon Basin(1, 2), but is increasingly threatened by deforestation and fire(3, 4). Here we quantify these impacts over the past two decades using remote-sensing estimates of fire and deforestation and comprehensive range estimates of 11,514 plant species and 3,079 vertebrate species in the Amazon. Deforestation has led to large amounts of habitat loss, and fires further exacerbate this already substantial impact on Amazonian biodiversity. Since 2001,103,079-189,755 km(2) of Amazon rainforest has been impacted by fires, potentially impacting the ranges of 77.3-85.2% of species that are listed as threatened in this region'. The impacts of fire on the ranges of species in Amazonia could be as high as 64%, and greater impacts are typically associated with species that have restricted ranges. We find close associations between forest policy, fire-impacted forest area and their potential impacts on biodiversity. In Brazil, forest policies that were initiated in the mid-2000s corresponded to reduced rates of burning. However, relaxed enforcement of these policies in 2019 has seemingly begun to reverse this trend: approximately 4,253-10,343 km(2) of forest has been impacted by fire, leading to some of the most severe potential impacts on biodiversity since 2009. These results highlight the critical role of policy enforcement in the preservation of biodiversity in the Amazon.

AB Aims Understanding the contributions of abiotic and biotic conditions to soil microbial diversity, structure, and function, remains a central focus in soil biology and biogeochemistry. Here we aim to determine how geography and host plant identity influence these different components of rhizosphere bacterial communities and endosymbionts associated with Acacia heterophylla on Reunion island (Mascarene archipelago, Indian Ocean) and A. koa in the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaiian archipelago, Pacific Ocean). These two tree species are remarkable: they are each other's closest living relatives despite their habitats being more than 16 000 km apart. Methods Using 16S rRNA amplicon next-generation sequencing data we show that the structure of rhizosphere communities of these two acacias is largely driven by dispersal limitation between sites and local soil chemical conditions within sites. Results Despite high taxonomic turnover in soils collected from different sites, we found their predicted functions to be largely similar, suggestive of functional redundancy. We also identify a core of rhizosphere taxa associated with both Acacia species in both archipelagos, which included potential nitrogen-fixing mutualists. Isolation and characterisation of rhizobia from root nodules of both acacias further supported strong selection by these plants for the same Bradyrhizobium endosymbionts. Conclusions Overall, our data suggest that phylogenetically-closely related plants may show remarkably similar selectivity for bacterial mutualists over vast geographic distances.

AB 1. Fire is commonly identified as strong driver of alternative stable states such as adjacent open- versus closed-canopy vegetation types. The absence of open-canopy species from closed-canopy understoreys, where light availability is low and dynamic, however, suggests shade tolerance is an integral determinant of such vegetation boundaries. While the importance of light dynamics between alternative stable states has been acknowledged, the physiological mechanisms behind sun versus shade tolerance are unclear. Here we investigated the differences in light interception and carbon assimilation of open- and closed-canopy species, and whether this contributes to the maintenance of alternative stable states.
   2. Evergreen forest and fynbos species were grown under three light availability treatments (24%, 54% and 100%) in a glasshouse with their photosynthetic response to continuous and fluctuating light, dark respiration, root respiration, biomass and leaf traits quantified.
   3. Fynbos species displayed smaller, thicker and tightly aggregated leaves compared to forest species. Under low light, fynbos species experienced some mortality, and showed lower light-use efficiency with fluctuating light and lower in situ photosynthetic rates under the 54% light treatment compared to forest species (0.8 vs. 3.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)).
   4. Synthesis. Contrasting light availability in forest and fynbos selects for dissimilar traits, where fynbos species are unable to efficiently intercept light and maintain a positive carbon balance under low, dynamic light compared to forest species. This shade intolerance is exacerbated by divergent nutrient and fire regimes in forest and fynbos environments, requiring incompatible trait specialisations that promote the emergence and maintenance of alternative stable states.

AB This study assesses the incremental impact of the first transboundary Payments for Watershed Services (PWS) scheme on water quality in China. Due to the absence of a control situation without the PWS scheme, the synthetic control method (SCM) is applied to construct a counterfactual for the prefecture city Huangshan in Eastern China where the PWS is implemented based on the socio-economic characteristics of more than 75 other prefecture cities. The creation of such a counterfactual is crucial in view of the declining trend in water pollution observed before implementation of the PWS scheme. Despite this downward trend in water pollution, an additional effect of the PWS scheme is observed. This result is not obtained when using any of the other prefecture cities as a placebo to test the robustness of this outcome. The application of the SCM in this study is a promising new avenue for the evaluation of PWS schemes elsewhere where similar control conditions are lacking. However, as we show, its applicability depends crucially on the availability of relevant water quality monitoring data.

AB The canga of the Serra dos Carajas, in Eastern Amazon, is home to a unique open plant community, harboring several endemic and rare species. Although a complete flora survey has been recently published, scarce to no genetic information is available for most plant species of the ironstone outcrops of the Serra dos Carajas. In this scenario, DNA barcoding appears as a fast and effective approach to assess the genetic diversity of the Serra dos Carajas flora, considering the growing need for robust biodiversity conservation planning in such an area with industrial mining activities. Thus, after testing eight different DNA barcode markers (matK, rbcL, rpoB, rpoC1, atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI, trnH-psbA, and ITS2), we chose rbcL and ITS2 as the most suitable markers for a broad application in the regional flora. Here we describe DNA barcodes for 1,130 specimens of 538 species, 323 genera, and 115 families of vascular plants from a highly diverse flora in the Amazon basin, with a total of 344 species being barcoded for the first time. In addition, we assessed the potential of using DNA metabarcoding of bulk samples for surveying plant diversity in the canga. Upon achieving the first comprehensive DNA barcoding effort directed to a complete flora in the Brazilian Amazon, we discuss the relevance of our results to guide future conservation measures in the Serra dos Carajas.

AB Amazonian flooded (varzea) and upland (terra firme) forests harbor distinct assemblages of most taxonomic groups. These differences are mainly attributed to flooding, which may affect directly or indirectly the persistence of species. Here, we compare the abundance, richness and composition of butterfly assemblages in varzea and terra firme forests, and evaluate whether environmental gradients between and within these forest types can be used to predict patterns of assemblage structure. We found that both total abundance and number of species per plot are higher in varzea than in terra firme forests. Varzea assemblages had a higher dominance of abundant species than terra firme assemblages, in which butterfly abundances were more equitable. Rarefied species richness for varzea and terra firme forests was similar. There was a strong turnover in species composition from varzea to terra firme forests associated with environmental change between these forest types, but with little evidence for an effect of the environmental gradients within forest types. Despite a smaller total area in the Amazon basin, less defined vegetation strata and the shorter existence over geological time of floodplain forests, Nymphalid-butterfly assemblages were not more species-poor in varzea forests than in unflooded forests. We highlight the role of flooding as a primary environmental filter in Amazonian floodplain forests, which strongly determines the composition of butterfly assemblages.

AB Aim In an increasingly anthropogenic world, species face multiple interacting threats. Habitat fragmentation and domestic dogs are two perturbations threatening terrestrial mammals globally. Our aim was to determine whether (a) the spatial use of domestic dogs increases with habitat destruction, and (b) domestic dogs and habitat destruction drive the spatial use of native carnivores in a heavily degraded agricultural landscape. Location Central valley/Andean foothills transition of Los Lagos, Chile. Methods We implemented a camera trap survey in a fragmented landscape comprised of native forest patches amidst a matrix of pastureland. We used single-species occupancy models to assess the impact of domestic dogs and habitat destruction on three mesocarnivores-the foxes, culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) and chilla (Lycalopex griseus) and the wild cat guina (Leopardus guigna). Additionally, we compared temporal activity of all study species including domestic dogs. Results Detection rates for both the foxes increased with domestic dog occupancy, while factors driving occupancy differed for each of the native species. We found that a 12% projected increase in domestic dog occupancy negatively impacted the spatial use of the culpeo. Habitat loss and fragmentation were positive drivers for chilla and domestic dog occupancy. The guina did not respond to fragmentation and other habitat covariates or domestic dog occupancy. All native carnivore species were primarily nocturnal, while the domestic dog was almost entirely diurnal. Main Conclusions We highlight that domestic dog occupancy was positively correlated with habitat loss. Native species showed varied tolerance to domestic dog occupancy and no negative response to habitat destruction. Future conditions of increased fragmentation and habitat loss will likely increase the potential contact between domestic dogs and native carnivores.

AB The systematics of Megalopodidae is not adequately known, in spite of it being a relatively small group of phytophagous beetles. The first phylogenetic analysis of Megalopodidae with a comprehensive generic representation (25 genera of 30 described, 10 subgenera and 77 species) is undertaken. A parsimony analysis under equal and implied weights was carried out based on 147 adult and larval morphological characters. Subfamilies Palophaginae and Zeugophorinae were recovered as monophyletic, by contrast with Megalopodinae, which proved to be paraphyletic. Atelederinae are proposed as a new subfamily. Also, three tribes and three subtribes within Megalopodinae are proposed: Leucasteini trib.n., Sphondyliini trib.n. and Megalopodini, the latter including Macrolophina subtrib.n., Temnaspidina subtrib.n. and Megalopodina. The genera Macrolopha, Kuilua, Poecilomorpha, Temnaspis, Antonaria, Agathomerus, Megalopus and Bothromegalopus were recovered as non-monophyletic. New delimitations of the polyphyletic genera Poecilomorpha and Macrolopha are proposed, Clythraxeloma is resurrected, and the subgenera of Agathomerus are suppressed. The following new combinations are proposed: Kuilua apicata (Fairmaire), K. nyassae (Jacoby), Poecilomorpha cribricollis (Pic), P. minuta (Pic), Clythraxeloma assamensis (Jacoby), C. bipartita (Lacordaeri), C. discolineata (Pic), C. downesii (Baly), C. gerstaeckeri (Westwood), C. laosensis (Pic), C. maculata (Pic), C. mouhoti (Baly), C. nigrocyanea (Motschulsky), C. pretiosa (Reineck), Temnaspis tricoloripes (Pic) and Barticaria faciatus (Dalman). Clythraxeloma cyanipennis Kraatz is a restored combination. Distribution patterns of Megalopodidae largely conform to the breakup of Gondwanaland, with its main clades having particular distributions: Andean-Australian (Palophaginae), Ethiopian (Leucasteini, Sphondyliini, and Macrolophina), Neotropical (Ateledrinae and Megalopodina) and Ethiopian-Oriental-Palaearctic (Temnaspidina the result of a secondary expansion. Zeugophorinae present a worldwide distribution, except for the Neotropical and Andean regions, which may be the result of geodispersal. The findings of the present study also shed light on groups with taxonomic issues, where phylogenetic analyses are strongly needed.

AB Climate, topography and edaphic characteristics are important factors for plant community dynamics when considering spatial and temporal scales. Efforts on vegetation dynamics in tropical regions are mostly focused on forests, with far less attention dedicated to open vegetation ecosystems. This study aimed to understand how demographic rates (based on models and maps) are affected by climate, soil and terrain variables in the Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado, which is a hotspot for the world biodiversity conservation. To do so, we used forest inventory data collected from 354 plots (10 x 100 m) distributed in the savanna of Minas Gerais State, southeast of Brazil, in the years of 2005-2006 and 2010-2011. Next, we calculated the rates of mortality, recruitment, net change in number of individuals, basal area loss and gain, and net change in basal area for the plots. We used the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to model the demographic rates in function of climate, soil and terrain variables obtained from the WorldClim 2, Harmonized World Soil Database and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), respectively. The models presented good performance with coefficient of determination (R-2) values ranging from 0.68 to 0.84, mean absolute error (MAE) between 0.32 and 0.96%.year(-1), and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 60 a 160%. The recruitment was higher than mortality, and the basal area gain was greater than the basal area loss, resulting in positive net change rates. The most important variables for the model and best predictors of vegetation dynamics rates of Brazilian savanna were the terrain variables, since they encompass characteristics such as soil water content, erosion, altitudes and slope. We showed that the gain in number of individuals and basal area were greater at low regions, that is, near drainage lines and with higher humidity. The losses in number of individuals and basal area were higher in boundary regions of the savanna vegetation, that is, regions of higher altitude and consequently, low humidity. Therefore, our findings provide support for conservation and management strategies of the biome, since from the vegetation dynamics drivers identification, we may identify priority areas as well as the vegetation vulnerability.

AB Secondary forest succession may restore microclimatic refugia for ectotherms and play a fundamental role in mitigating the combined effects of deforestation and climate warming on biodiversity; however, empirical evidence remains limited by short-term, coarse-scale, and solely taxonomic-based approaches. We hypothesize that ant assemblage composition will respond differently to an increased frequency of extreme heat events between sites with and without microclimatic refugia provided by secondary forest's regrowth. We test this hypothesis by integrating comprehensive historic surveys (1992-1994) and contemporary resampling (2015-2017) of ant assemblages to investigate how soil surface temperatures (estimated by microclimatic models [30 x 30 m]) and physical parameters (e.g., canopy cover) over the past >20 yr drive changes in their taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity for open (grasslands and shrublands) and closed (secondary forests) habitat types. Our results show a significant spatial turnover in the ant assemblage composition in both habitat types over the past two decades. Furthermore, for taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic spatial beta diversity, temperature became the primary variable explaining the differences in species composition among sites in open habitats, but not in closed habitats. Nevertheless, leaf litter cover may, to a certain extent, provide some thermal buffer for litter-dwelling species exposed to extreme heat. On the contrary, within forests, canopy cover mitigated the adverse impact of extreme heat on ant assemblages, with a shift toward smaller body size observed over time only in sites with lower canopy cover. These findings highlight the importance of restored canopy in providing thermal buffering for understory ectotherms. While tropical forest restoration represents an essential component in enhancing species resilience under climate warming, additionally we considered that the restoration of microclimatic regimes across different land use types is essential to conserve tropical biodiversity across the deforested landscape.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances, including land use change and exotic species, can alter the diversity and dynamics of ant communities. To examine foraging behavior in an urbanized habitat in northern California, we surveyed the presence of 9 ant species on 876 trees across 4 seasons during both day and night in a 9.5-hectare urbanized oak-exotic woodland. Ants were more likely to be observed on native, evergreen trees, suggesting that native evergreen species may help maintain ant diversity. Species showed clear patterns of temporal partitioning of foraging activity. Ant species varied in their use of native evergreen Quercus agrifolia trees across season and day/night axes. Of the 3 ant species most frequently observed, Camponotus semitestaceus was most active during spring and summer nights, Formica moki was most active during spring and summer days, and Prenolepis imparis was most active during both day and night during fall and winter. Liometopum occidentale was the second most active species during summer day and night, and winter day. Our findings demonstrate that an oak-exotic urban woodland in Northern California was able to maintain a native ant community, and strong temporal partitioning within that community.

AB Forests play an important role in climate change, acting as a source or sink of carbon. There is, however, a lack of data regarding the carbon production from litterfall in tropical forests. The Atlantic Forest is one of the most distinguished forest types in Brazil, encompassing the Araucaria Forest. In this study, we assessed the seasonal carbon production from litterfall. Data were collected every season from 27 litter traps. Dry matter and carbon fraction were investigated and confronted with meteorological variables. Litterfall components were stratified into Brazilian pine leaves and twigs: broadleaved leaves, twigs, bark, reproductive material, and other material (miscellaneous). The Tukey test indicated significant differences among the carbon fractions for litter components. Seven key species were determinant in litterfall production. Brazilian pine leaves and twigs were the primary carbon source to the forest, followed by leaves and twigs from broadleaved species. Most carbon input from litterfall comes during spring and summer. We concluded that litterfall is a source of carbon and nutrient to the ecosystem. This study contributes to improving the Brazilian national greenhouse inventory and related reports addressed to climate change mitigation.

AB Crop pollination is one of Nature's Contributions to People (NCP) that reconciles biodiversity conservation and agricultural production. NCP benefits vary across space, including among distinct political-administrative levels within nations. Moreover, initiatives to restore ecosystems may enhance NCP provision, such as crop pollination delivered by native pollinators. We mapped crop pollination demand (PD), diversity of pollinator-dependent crops, and vegetation deficit (VD) (vis-a-vis Brazilian legal requirements) across all 5570 municipalities in Brazil. Pollinator-dependent crops represented similar to 55% of the annual monetary value of agricultural production and similar to 15% of the annual crop production. Municipalities with greater crop PD (i.e., higher degree of pollinator dependence of crop production) also had greater VD, associated with large properties and monocultures. In contrast, municipalities with a greater diversity of pollinator-dependent crops and predominantly small properties presented a smaller VD. Our results support that ecological restoration prompted by legal requirements offers great potential to promote crop productivity in larger properties. Moreover, conservation of vegetation remnants could support food security in small properties. We provided the first steps to identify spatial patterns linking biodiversity conservation and pollination service. Using Brazilian legal requirements as an example, we show that land-use management policies may be successfully used to ensure agricultural sustainability and crop production.

AB Antagonistic interactions between plants and soil biota promote species diversity in many plant communities but little is known about how these plant-soil interactions influence herbaceous species in temperate forests. To assess the potential for soil biota to affect the growth of forest herbs, I conducted a greenhouse experiment in which seedlings of nine focal herb species common in Wisconsin (USA) forests were grown in soil derived from conspecific and heterospecific plants. This soil origin treatment was crossed with a subsequent treatment in which half of the soils were pasteurized to eliminate soil biota. The presence and origin of soil biota had variable effects on plant growth among the nine focal species. Thalictrum dioicum, Elymus hystrix, and Solidago flexicaulis growth were inhibited by the presence of soil biota in unpasteurized soils. Thalictrum dioicum seedlings grown in conspecific, unpasteurized soil accumulated 30% less biomass than seedlings grown in heterospecific, unpasteurized soil indicating that host-specific effects of microbial pathogens restrict seedling growth. Similarly, E. hystrix seedlings were 11% smaller in conspecific-trained soils. The remaining herb species showed no significant response to experimental treatments manipulating soil biota. These variable growth responses highlight the potential for differences in plant-soil interactions among plant species to influence local plant distributions and community dynamics. Janzen-Connell effects, like those observed in T. dioicum and E. hystrix, could promote coexistence among certain species and contribute to high local plant diversity in temperate forest understories.

AB Using 2,733 longitudinal vaginal microbiome samples (representing local microbial communities) from 79 individuals (representing meta-communities) in the states of healthy, BV (bacterial vaginosis) and pregnancy, we assess and interpret the relative importance of stochastic forces (e.g., stochastic drifts in bacteria demography, and stochastic dispersal) vs. deterministic selection (e.g., host genome, and host physiology) in shaping the dynamics of human vaginal microbiome (HVM) diversity by an integrated analysis with multi-site neutral (MSN) and niche-neutral hybrid (NNH) modeling. It was found that, when the traditional "default" P-value = 0.05 was specified, the neutral drifts were predominant (>= 50% metacommunities indistinguishable from the MSN prediction), while the niche differentiations were moderate (<20% from the NNH prediction). The study also analyzed two challenging uncertainties in testing the neutral and/or niche-neutral hybrid models, i.e., lack of full model specificity - non-unique fittings of same datasets to multiple models with potentially different mechanistic assumptions - and lack of definite rules for setting the P-value thresholds (also noted as P-t-value when referring to the threshold of P-value in this article) in testing null hypothesis (model). Indeed, the two uncertainties can be interdependent, which further complicates the statistical inferences. To deal with the uncertainties, the MSN/NNH test results under a series of P-values ranged from 0.05 to 0.95 were presented. Furthermore, the influence of P-value threshold-setting on the model specificity, and the effects of woman's health status on the neutrality level of HVM were examined. It was found that with the increase of P-value threshold from 0.05 to 0.95, the overlap (non-unique) fitting of MSN and NNH decreased from 29.1 to 1.3%, whereas the specificity (uniquely fitted to data) of MSN model was kept between 55.7 and 82.3%. Also with the rising P-value threshold, the difference between healthy and BV groups become significant. These findings suggested that traditional single P-value threshold (such as the de facto standard P-value = 0.05) might be insufficient for testing the neutral and/or niche neutral hybrid models.

AB Forest soil organic matter (SOM) is derived from both above- and belowground plant inputs, with a significant portion of this plant-derived organic carbon being processed by fungal communities prior to becoming SOM. Despite the central role of fungi in the processing of litter and root inputs, little is known about the relationship between fungal community composition and the relative conversion of aboveground litter versus root inputs into SOM. The Detrital Input and Removal Treatment (DIRT) experiments offer a system in which to test such questions, wherein aboveground litter and root inputs to forest soils are chronically excluded independently and in combination. In this study, we characterized fungal biomass (ergosterol), community composition (ITS2 metabarcoding), and community assembly (via null modeling) under root and litter exclusion treatments in a northern temperate forest DIRT experiment, and we related fungal community parameters to soil carbon. Root, but not litter, presence significantly differentiated fungal community composition and drove a more stochastic community assembly. Roots were associated with higher fungal biomass, particularly that of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi, and with higher soil carbon stocks. The resulting strong positive correlation between fungal biomass and soil carbon appeared to be driven by saprotroph biomass in particular. We suggest that fungal communities are important mediators of the conversion of above- and belowground plant inputs into SOM, and that characterizing their composition may aid in understanding the relative importance of these plant input sources to SOM.

AB Plants and their soil microbial symbionts influence ecosystem productivity and nutrient cycling, but the controls on these symbioses remain poorly understood. This is particularly true for plants in the Fabaceae family (hereafter legumes), which can associate with both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen (N) -fixing bacteria. Here we report results of the first manipulated field experiment to explore the abiotic and biotic controls of this tripartite symbiosis in Neotropical canopy gaps (hereafter gaps). We grew three species of Neotropical N-fixing legume seedlings under different light (gap-full light, gap-shadecloth, and understory) and soil nitrogen (20 g N center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) vs. 0 g N center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) conditions across a lowland tropical forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We harvested the seedlings after 4 months of growth in the field and measured percent AMF root colonization (%AMF), nodule and seeding biomass, and seedling aboveground:belowground biomass ratios. Our expectation was that seedlings in gaps would grow larger and, as a result of higher light, invest more carbon in both AMF and N-fixing bacteria. Indeed, seedlings in gaps had higher total biomass, nodule biomass (a proxy for N-fixing bacteria investment) and rates of AMF root colonization, and the three were significantly positively correlated. However, we only found a significant positive effect of light availability on %AMF when seedlings were fertilized with N. Furthermore, when we statistically controlled for treatment, species, and site effects, we found %AMF and seedling biomass had a negative relationship. This was likely driven by the fact that seedlings invested relatively less in AMF as they increased in biomass (lower %AMF per gram of seedling). Taken together, these results challenge the long-held assumption that high light conditions universally increase carbon investment in AMF and demonstrate that this tripartite symbiosis is influenced by soil nutrient and light conditions.

AB Climate and land management are important environmental drivers that affect the structure of terrestrial plant communities worldwide. Demographic studies allow a mechanistic understanding of the pathways in which environmental factors change population size. Climate and land management might interactively influence vital rates and growth rates of populations, however, demographic studies have not heretofore considered both factors in combination. We used the Global Change Experimental Facility as a platform to study the effect of climate (ambient climate conditions vs. future climate conditions) and land management (sheep grazing vs. mowing) on the demography of the common grass, Bromus erectus growing in semi-natural grassland communities. Using an integral projection model, we found positive population growth rates for B. erectus under all treatment combinations, and an interactive effect of climate and land management. Under ambient climate conditions, population growth of B. erectus was higher in mowed than grazed grassland plots, while population growth rates were similar across both management types under future climatic conditions. This interaction was primarily due to between-treatment changes in seedling recruitment, a vital rate to which the population growth rate is particularly sensitive. The interaction found in this study highlights the importance of considering multiple environmental drivers in demographic studies, to better predict future plant population dynamics and ultimately changes in community structure.

AB Numerous molecular studies emphasized how past climatic oscillations in the Sahara-Sahel have left strong imprints on current biodiversity patterns and identified the Atlantic coast and the Northwest African Mountains as refugia and speciation hotspots. Yet, the biodiversity inventory in the region is still far from complete. We use an integrative taxonomy framework to revise the systematics of the Mesalina olivieri species complex; integrating molecular, morphological, and environmental data, we evaluated levels of genetic and phenotypic differentiation among species/lineages and revised the species distribution limits of the M. olivieri complex, refining the distribution of Mesalina simoni, and Mesalina pasteuri. Our study confirmed one previously unidentified speciation event, leading to the description of Mesalina adrarensis sp. nov. Together with this new species, we also describe the south-western Moroccan populations of M. olivieri as Mesalina simoni saharae ssp. nov. Mesalina adrarensis sp. nov. is sympatric with M. pasteuri and parapatric with M. simoni saharae ssp. nov. in Mauritania and southern Morocco. Based on our revised taxonomy, M. simoni now includes most populations of the M. olivieri complex in Morocco, M. olivieri being restricted in Morocco to the east and southeast of the country. We also build on these results to provide further insight on the biogeography of North Africa. Our results point to a diversification of the complex during the late Miocene, that led to the formation of the four species M. simoni, M. olivieri, M. pasteuri, and M. adrarensis sp. nov. After these four speciation events, high intraspecific diversification processes occurred since the beginning of the Plio-Pleistocene transition, in parallel with the beginning of the humid and arid cycles. Through our phylogenetic analysis, we highlight the existence of high levels of undescribed intraspecific diversity in M. olivieri and M. pasteuri that will need to be addressed in future studies. Moreover, we uncover instances of cytonuclear discordances, stressing the need of considering both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA for integrative taxonomic studies to explore biodiversity.

AB Land use changes and accelerating deforestation rates impact biodiversity on a global scale. While it is well established that the loss of primary forests is devastating, considerably less is understood about the conservation value of sacred forests (e.g. Feng shui woods in China) as local biodiversity reservoirs in human influenced landscapes. When these forests were assessed, the focus was generally on floral diversity, while faunal aspects were neglected. Here we address this knowledge gap by evaluating several dimensions of faunal biodiversity in Hong Kong Feng shui woods. We compare taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional elements of the leaf litter dwelling ant fauna collected over five years among Feng shui woods and two woody habitats corresponding to two distinct successional stages. Ant assemblages in Feng shui woods presented higher species richness that were more resilient to invasions by tramp species, and encompassed specialist species with a distinct set of traits. Phylogenetic diversity was similar in Feng shui and successional woods, while functional diversity was clustered in early successional habitats. The scarcity of tramp species and presence of specialists in Feng shui woods despite their close proximity to human settlements highlights their conservation value for native species in highly degraded landscapes. Our results provide much needed insight on the faunal biodiversity of Feng shui woods. We highlight the conservation value and urgent need for a better protection of these widely overlooked sacred forests in highly disturbed landscapes.

AB When an ecosystem undergoing restoration does not follow the desired trajectory, management interventions may be warranted. Where the initial steps towards restoration include tree planting at high densities, reduction of stand basal area (BA) by overstory thinning is a potential adaptive management tool to stimulate natural regeneration, although it can also damage young plants. We ask how tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest responds to different intensities of thinning. We applied two intensities of thinning to a 22-yr-old restored forest in southeastern Brazil and then sampled seedlings and saplings before and over an eight year period after thinning; unthinned plots were retained as controls. Thinning impacts on the woody understory were negligible, far below annual mortality in control plots. Positive responses to thinning were stronger in the treatment with low remaining basal area (ca. 30% below the reference forests), with increases in seedling density, numbers of recruits, and seedling-to-sapling and sapling-to-tree transitions. Understory dynamics were clearly intensified by gap opening, with a pulse of natural regeneration in the first years after thinning. These changes, however, were not simultaneous and did not usually persist over time. Rarefied richness of the understory increased over time after all treatments and changes in species composition of saplings were enhanced by thinning. Our study gives support to selective timber harvests from restored tropical forests insofar as thinning did not threaten the understory and stimulated natural regeneration. Frequency and intensity of thinning operations, however, should be locally adjusted based on monitoring data.

AB The effects of mound building ants on soil and vegetation have been described worldwide; however, few studies have explored their effects in salt marsh communities. Here, we studied the effects of the black fire ant Solenopsis richteri on the cordgrass Spartina densiflora in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh. We found that S. richteri nests are more abundant in the high marsh than in the low marsh and in the terrestrial environment. Sediment characteristics were examined in the above-ground and below-ground portions of nests, and in the surrounding soil apart from them. Nests' sediment had lower organic matter content, lower bulk density and higher pH values than the non-nest soil. These differences were in general more marked in the above-ground portion of nests. Grain size distribution was biased towards coarser grain particles in nests, with the smallest particles being more abundant in the non-nest soil. Ammonium content was higher in the nests than in the non-nest soil, despite nitrate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were not different. Phosphate content was higher in the below-ground portion than in the above-ground portion of nests. Samplings and transplant experiments showed that plants growing in contact with mounds grew longer, had wider stems and higher root biomass than plants apart from mounds. These results indicate that by affecting sediment characteristics, ants indirectly and positively affect plants condition, with potential cascading up effects on community structure and dynamics. Because mounds are relocated every similar to 3.5 months, bioturbation impacts may extend over time through the whole high marsh, highlighting the role that black fire ants may have in the ecology of southwestern Atlantic marshes.

AB Collecting interaction data to build frugivory or seed dispersal networks is logistically challenging in ecosystems that have very high plant and animal diversity and/or where fieldwork is difficult or dangerous. Consequently, the majority of available networks are from ecosystems with low species diversity or they represent a subset of the community. Here, we propose an approach applying local ecological knowledge (LEK) of indigenous communities to build quantitative interaction databases and networks that would otherwise be difficult to achieve with direct observations. Indigenous communities live in many hyper-diverse ecosystems and the people within these communities often have detailed knowledge of ecological processes. Working in a Sundaland biodiversity hotspot-Royal Belum State Park, Peninsular Malaysia-we used visually oriented interviews with indigenous people (Orang Asli, in the Jahai and Temiar ethnic subgroups), field data and published records to collate interactions, and their estimated frequency of occurrence, of animal fruit consumption and seed dispersal. We documented 2,063 fruit consumption and 1,360 seed dispersal interactions among 164 plant species and 34 animal taxa, the latter representing groups of closely related species or individual species. The majority of the interactions (97%) were identified by the LEK interviews, with the additional methods (field data and published records) used to support and marginally expand the interview data. The metrics for the networks we built reflect those of networks structured by biological mechanisms, supporting the validity of our novel approach. LEK is highly relevant for building detailed databases for ecological interactions in hyper-diverse and/or challenging ecosystems. Such ecosystems are among the most vulnerable on earth, harbouring ecological interactions that are often poorly documented at a community level. We show how LEK can broaden our knowledge of such sensitive ecosystems, but our approach is useful for any ecosystem in which people hold rich LEK.

AB Rodents of the genus Hylaeamys, are a group of cryptic species previously included in the Oryzomys capito complex. In Brazil are represented by six species, distributed in different biomes. However, the limits of their geographic distributions and taxonomy have not yet been well defined. In particular, the taxonomy for Hylaeamys seuanezi is unstable. Based on the analysis of bony structures and supported with geometric morphometric techniques, we characterize and compare the average shape from populations in four localities from Southern Bahia, Brazil. We review 145 individuals and we create morphological landmarks in skulls, mandibles, scapulae, and pelvis. In all the structures there were statistically significant differences between populations, in which the average shape from the Igrapiuna population was the most differentiated. Our results also showed differences between the pelvis of males and females, reporting for the first time sexual dimorphism for H. seuanezi. Finally, we provide a morphological diagnosis between the populations and postulate that such differences may be correlated with environmental and climatic factors that could be exerting negative pressures on H. seuanezi; as has been evidenced with other species of rodents and other mammals.

AB Species are disappearing worldwide with increasing rates through the time, especially in the tropics. The human-induced impacts have a pivotal role in the discussion about the cause of these extinctions events. Although researchers are nearly unanimous about the current biodiversity crisis, there is still a debate about how these human-induced impacts affect biodiversity across different geographical scales. While our perception about landscape modification promoted by deforestation occurs at local scales, we treat the increase of greenhouse gas emissions and its consequences in a global perspective. This diffuse view about different processes but potential assembling properties illustrates the importance of combining small and broad-scales to improve our conservation actions and decelerate extinction events. Here, we propose an integrated framework (Ecoland) combining landscape ecology and macroecology for niche modelling applications, aiming to disentangle the effects of human-induced impacts on biodiversity and guide conservation tasks at multiple scales. We demonstrated the EcoLand application using a dataset of fruit-feeding butterfly species occurrence from the Atlantic Forest. Our findings highlight the impact of the land-use modification on the number of butterfly species. Finally, we discuss the method implications, its limitations and perspectives, and how it the Ecoland can help us to design conservation strategies aiming at the maintenance of biodiversity and its related policy practices.

AB Spatial patterns of plant diversity matter. Identifying areas of high species richness and endemism are crucial for understanding the evolution of plant diversity and community assemblages as well establishing sustainablility and conservation priorities. Lycianthes is the third most species-rich genus in the Solanaceae with 187 taxa (152 species, 10 subspecies and 25 varieties) native to the Americas and Asia-Pacific region. However, the distributions of the taxa are uneven and usually concentrated along mountain ranges in the Neotropic. In Mexico, the main mountain chains are known as the Mexican Transition Zone (MTZ), so we expected the highest species richness and endemism to be found there. Our aims were twofold; first, to determine the Lycianthes species richness in Mexico; and second, to analyze the spatial patterns. We used 2305 georeferenced records obtained from specimens examined in herbaria, electronic specimen databases and specimens cited in the literature. Then, we analyzed species richness and endemism using a grid-cell of 50 x 50 km, political divisions, biogeographic provinces, vegetation types, and elevation. In addition, endemism was quantified using weighted endemism (WE) and corrected weighted endemism (CWE). In Mexico, there were 48 taxa of Lycianthes, which included 44 species and four varieties. Of these, 20 species and two varieties were endemic. We found 14 cells of high species richness and eight centers of endemism, all located across the MTZ. The pine-oak forest resulted in the richest plant community followed by the cloud forest along an elevational gradient of 1000-2000 m. Likewise, endemism was found within the pine-oak forest of the MTZ, between 1000-2000 m of elevation. The geological history and climatic conditions of the MTZ could explain the diversity of Lycianthes there.

AB The Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay has experienced extensive recent deforestation. Less than one-third of the region is forested, and the remaining forest largely consists of isolated remnants with potentially disrupted connectivity for forest fauna. We used a graph theory approach to identify those forest remnants that are important in maintaining landscape structural connectivity for mammals in this fragmented forest. We quantified structural connectivity for forest remnants over the period 2000-2019 at three levels: the entire network of Atlantic Forest remnants in eastern Paraguay; at 10 smaller, nested spatial scales (40-10,000 m) encompassing a range of potential mammalian dispersal abilities; and at the level of individual remnants. We used 10 graph theory metrics to assess aspects of network complexity, dispersal-route efficiency, and individual remnant importance in supporting structural connectivity. We identified forest remnants that serve as important structural connectivity roles as stepping stones, hubs, or articulation points and that should be prioritized for connectivity conservation. Structural connectivity was constrained for organisms incapable of travelling at least 9-12 km (farthest distances between nearest-neighboring forest remnants depending on whether smaller remnants were included or not) and was particularly limited for area-sensitive forest-specialist mammals. With the increased forest loss and fragmentation that is occurring, the connectivity of this system will likely be further compromised, but most of the remnants that we identified as playing important roles for structural connectivity were outside of the country's proposed "green corridor," indicating additional areas where conservation action can be directed.

AB Apart from frugivory, we have limited knowledge of the ecological consequences of primate herbivory. We aimed to ascertain the effects of spring folivory and winter bark/bud herbivory by Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) on tree species and succession patterns of cool-temperate forests with heavy snow. To evaluate the impact of herbivory on individual trees, we assessed the growth and mortality of trees consumed by simulating herbivory on nine tree species over 4 years. Additionally, we assessed the cumulative impacts of bark/bud herbivory observed at the tree community level by monitoring the patterns of natural herbivory for almost a decade and evaluating the structure of tree assemblages in places with different cumulative impacts of herbivory. The results of simulated herbivory showed that the mortality caused by both spring and winter herbivory was limited (<20%) for almost all tree species monitored; however, the simulated folivory led to delayed tree growth and/or weakening of tree architecture. In contrast, the simulated bark/bud herbivory sometimes resulted in overcompensation of the tree consumed. The multiyear monitoring of natural herbivory demonstrated that, while bark/bud herbivory did not reduced the diversity and biomass of tree assemblages, the cumulative impacts of natural herbivory could have affected the tree succession pattern, resulting in increasing the availability of bark/buds preferably fed by macaques. The key cause for this feedback effect of herbivory on available foods of macaques might be heavy snow conditions, which could physically and physiologically restrain the excessive bark/buds herbivory by macaques.

AB The capacity of highly diverse systems to prevail has proven difficult to explain. In addition to methodological issues, the inherent complexity of ecosystems and issues like multicausality, non-linearity and context-specificity make it hard to establish general and unidirectional explanations. Nevertheless, in recent years, high order interactions have been increasingly discussed as a mechanism that benefits the functioning of highly diverse ecosystems and may add to the mechanisms that explain their persistence. Until now, this idea has been explored by means of hypothetical simulated networks. Here, we test this idea using an updated and empirically documented network for a coffee agroecosystem. We identify potentially key nodes and measure network robustness in the face of node removal with and without incorporation of high order interactions. We find that the system's robustness is either increased or unaffected by the addition of high order interactions, in contrast with randomized counterparts with similar structural characteristics. We also propose a method for representing networks with high order interactions as ordinary graphs and a method for measuring their robustness.

AB Background Ecological processes such as seedling establishment, biotic interactions, and mortality can leave footprints on species spatial structure that can be detectable through spatial point-pattern analysis (SPPA). Being widely used in plant ecology, SPPA is increasingly carried out to describe biotic interactions and interpret pattern-process relationships. However, some aspects are still subjected to a non-negligible debate such as required sample size (in terms of the number of points and plot area), the link between the low number of points and frequently observed random (or independent) patterns, and relating patterns to processes. In this paper, an overview of SPPA is given based on rich and updated literature providing guidance for ecologists (especially beginners) on summary statistics, uni-/bi-/multivariate analysis, unmarked/marked analysis, types of marks, etc. Some ambiguities in SPPA are also discussed. Results SPPA has a long history in plant ecology and is based on a large set of summary statistics aiming to describe species spatial patterns. Several mechanisms known to be responsible for species spatial patterns are actually investigated in different biomes and for different species. Natural processes, plant environmental conditions, and human intervention are interrelated and are key drivers of plant spatial distribution. In spite of being not recommended, small sample sizes are more common in SPPA. In some areas, periodic forest inventories and permanent plots are scarce although they are key tools for spatial data availability and plant dynamic monitoring. Conclusion The spatial position of plants is an interesting source of information that helps to make hypotheses about processes responsible for plant spatial structures. Despite the continuous progress of SPPA, some ambiguities require further clarifications.

AB Multiple geological and climatic events have created geographical or ecological barriers associated with speciation events, playing a role in biological diversification in North and Central America. Here, we evaluate the influence of the Neogene and Quaternary geological events, as well as the climatic changes in the diversification of the colubrid snake genus Rhadinaea using molecular dating and ancestral area reconstruction. A multilocus sequence dataset was generated for 37 individuals of Rhadinaea from most of the biogeographical provinces where the genus is distributed, representing 19 of the 21 currently recognized species, and two undescribed species. Our analyses show that the majority of the Rhadinaea species nest in two main clades, herein identified as "Eastern" and "Southern". These clades probably diverged from each other in the early Miocene, and their divergence was followed by 11 divergences during the middle to late Miocene, three divergences during the Pliocene, and six divergences in the Pleistocene. The ancestral distribution of Rhadinaea was reconstructed across the Sierra Madre del Sur. Our phylogenetic analyses do not support the monophyly of Rhadinaea. The Miocene and Pliocene geomorphology, perhaps in conjunction with climate change, appears to have triggered the diversification of the genus, while the climatic changes during the Miocene probably induced the diversification of Rhadinaea in the Sierra Madre del Sur. Our analysis suggests that the uplifting of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Chiapan-Guatemalan highlands in this same period resulted in northward and southward colonization events. This was followed by more recent, independent colonization events in the Pliocene and Pleistocene involving the Balsas Basin, Chihuahuan Desert, Pacific Coast, Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre del Sur, Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and Veracruz provinces, probably driven by the climatic fluctuations of the time.

AB In fire-prone ecosystems, such as savannas, fire has been a common event for thousands of years. In these biomes, phenology is a functional trait characterizing the responses of plant communities to fire. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of fire on the period of occurrence, seasonality, and number of species expressing vegetative and reproductive phenophases (sprouting, flowering, and fruiting) in a South American savanna community. We burned experimental plots in 2013, and during the subsequent year, we performed monthly evaluations of the presence and absence of vegetative and reproductive structures in 44 species of angiosperms in the control and burned plots. We described plant phenology at two levels: (i) considering all sampled plant species together (community); and (ii) separately considering the species found in the herbaceous-subshrub and shrub-tree layers (vegetation strata). We analyzed the data using circular statistics and generalized linear mixed models. At the community level, fire did not alter the mean period of occurrence of vegetative and reproductive phenophases; however, we observed changes in fruiting seasonality, which were mainly caused by the changes occurring in the shrub-tree layer. Except for those found in the shrub-tree layer, more species expressed the analyzed phenophases after fire compared to the "control" treatment. This study provides information regarding the responses of plants to burning at the end of the dry season, when most anthropogenic fires occur. Additionally, according to climate change predictions, the Southern Hemisphere is expected to experience longer dry seasons, which may contribute to an increased frequency of anthropogenic fires. Therefore, this phenological information can motivate subsidies that are important for the conservation of this biome and management plans related to the prescription of fires.

AB An important focus of community ecology, including invasion biology, is to investigate functional trait diversity patterns to disentangle the effects of environmental and biotic interactions. However, a notable limitation is that studies usually rely on a small and easy-to-measure set of functional traits, which might not immediately reflect ongoing ecological responses to changing abiotic or biotic conditions, including those that occur at a molecular or physiological level. We explored the potential of using the diversity of expressed genes-functional genomic diversity (FGD)-to understand ecological dynamics of a recent and ongoing alpine invasion. We quantified FGD based on transcriptomic data measured for 26 plant species occurring along adjacent invaded and pristine streambeds. We used an RNA-seq approach to summarize the overall number of expressed transcripts and their annotations to functional categories, and contrasted this with functional trait diversity (FTD) measured from a suite of characters that have been traditionally considered in plant ecology. We found greater FGD and FTD in the invaded community, independent of differences in species richness. However, the magnitude of functional dispersion was greater from the perspective of FGD than from FTD. Comparing FGD between congeneric alien-native species pairs, we did not find many significant differences in the proportion of genes whose annotations matched functional categories. Still, native species with a greater relative abundance in the invaded community compared with the pristine tended to express a greater fraction of genes at significant levels in the invaded community, suggesting that changes in FGD may relate to shifts in community composition. Comparisons of diversity patterns from the community to the species level offer complementary insights into processes and mechanisms driving invasion dynamics. FGD has the potential to illuminate cryptic changes in ecological diversity, and we foresee promising avenues for future extensions across taxonomic levels and macro-ecosystems.

AB A major challenge remains to understand the relative contributions of history, dispersal, and environmental filtering to the assembly of hyperdiverse communities across spatial scales. Here, we examine the extent to which biogeographical history and habitat specialization have generated turnover among and within lineages of Amazonian trees across broad geographic and environmental gradients. We replicated standardized tree inventories in 102 0.1-ha plots located in two distant regions-the western Amazon and the eastern Guiana shield. Within each region, we used a nested design to replicate plots on contrasted habitats: white-sand, terra firme, and seasonally flooded forests. Our plot network encompassed 26,386 trees that together represented 2,745 distinct taxa, which we standardized across all plots and regions. We combined taxonomic and phylogenetic data with detailed soil measurements and climatic data to: (1) test whether patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic composition are consistent with recent or historical processes, (2) disentangle the relative effects of habitat, environment, and geographic distance on taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover among plots, and (3) contrast the proportion of habitat specialists among species from each region. We found substantial species turnover between Peru and French Guiana, with only 8.8% of species shared across regions; genus composition remained differentiated across habitats and regions, whereas turnover at higher taxonomic levels (family, order) was much lower. Species turnover across plots was explained primarily by regions, but also substantially by habitat differences and to a lesser extent by spatial distance within regions. Conversely, the composition of higher taxonomic levels was better explained by habitats (especially comparing white-sand forests to other habitats) than spatial distance. White-sand forests harbored most of the habitat specialists in both regions, with stronger habitat specialization in Peru than in French Guiana. Our results suggest that recent diversification events have resulted in extremely high turnover in species and genus composition with relatively little change in the composition of higher lineages. Our results also emphasize the contributions of rare habitats, such as white-sand forests, to the extraordinary diversity of the Amazon and underline their importance as conservation priorities.

AB Fire regimes are shifting under climate change. Decadal-scale shifts in fire regime can disrupt the biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) within forest ecosystems, but the full extent of these disruptions is unknown. It is also unclear whether these disruptions have consequences for the ecological characteristics (e.g., biomass, abundance, and composition) of microbial and invertebrate communities, which together comprise the majority of terrestrial biodiversity and underpin many ecosystem processes. The theoretical framework of ecological stoichiometry has great potential in this context, but it has rarely been used to develop an integrated understanding of the biogeochemical and ecological effects of altered fire regime across trophic levels. Using one of the world's longest-running fire experiments, located in Queensland, Australia, we carried out a comprehensive investigation into the stoichiometric consequences of a decadal-scale divergence in prescribed fire frequency and their links to coinciding changes in various ecological characteristics of forest floor microbial and invertebrate communities. Compared to long-term fire exclusion, forty-three years of biennial burning led to significantly N-depleted and/or P-enriched stoichiometry in soil, leaf litter, leaf litter-associated microbial biomass, and certain groups of invertebrates, although total invertebrate community stoichiometry was not affected. Microbial biomass was 42% lower in biennially burned soils. Invertebrate community composition differed between fire regime treatments on some sampling dates, but fire regime did not have consistent effects on invertebrate biomass or abundance. Microbial biomass and the abundances of some invertebrate taxa were depressed at particularly low and/or high resource N:P, consistent with a coupling of these variables to the stoichiometric effects of decadal-scale fire regime. Litter transplants likewise indicated that some invertebrate abundances were sensitive to litter properties over 12 months. Together, our results indicate that long-term changes in fire regime can decouple the within-ecosystem cycling of N and P, with N and P cycling growing more and less conservative, respectively, under high-frequency fire in a way that propagates throughout forest floor food webs. Our study provides new insights into the coupled biogeochemical and ecological responses of forest ecosystems to novel fire regimes and establishes a basis for a stoichiometric framework for fire ecology.

TI Grassland ecological compensation policy in China improves grassland

AB Many countries have undertaken large and high-profile payment-for-ecosystem-services (PES) programs to sustain the use of their natural resources. Nevertheless, few studies have comprehensively examined the impacts of existing PES programs. Grassland Ecological Compensation Policy (GECP) is one of the few pastorally focused PES programs with large investments and long duration, which aim to improve grassland quality and increase herder income. Here we present empirical evidence of the effects of GECP on grassland quality and herder income. Through a thorough and in-depth econometric analysis of remote sensing and household survey data, we find that, although GECP improves grassland quality (albeit to only a small extent) and has a large positive effect on income, it exacerbates existing income inequality among herders within their local communities. The analysis demonstrates that the program has induced herders to change their livestock production behavior. Heterogeneity analysis emphasizes the importance of making sure the programs are flexible and are adapted to local resource circumstances.

AB Apex predators are widely threatened globally and generally considered a priority on the conservation biology agenda. The harpy eagle, Harpia harpyja, is an apex predator threatened by habitat loss and persecution and a flagship species for Neotropical conservation. We investigated the roles of social, economic and environmental factors related to livestock depredation by harpy eagles, causes of reported harpy eagle persecution by local landholders and the intent of future harpy eagle killings. We explored these issues using structured interviews with 184 local livestock owners, who had admitted killing a combined total of 181 harpy eagles. We found that livestock abundance and livestock husbandry were the best positive predictors of levels of self-reported livestock predation by harpy eagles. Domestic livestock reported to be killed by harpy eagles (192) were mainly chickens (47.9%), followed by goats (22.4%), pigs (18.2%) and sheep (8.3%), with pets representing only similar to 3% of kills. Few harpy eagle killings were related to livestock predation, which accounted for less than 20% of all eagles killed. Instead, the main reason for killing harpy eagles was simple curiosity, and many interviewees reported later regretting their acts. Regarding intent to kill harpy eagles in the future, interviewees' perceptions of the threat posed to livestock and humans by eagles, and the subjective norm, were unrelated to intent to kill harpy eagles further. The single most important factor in predicting intent to kill harpy eagles was whether the interviewee had suffered livestock predation by eagles in the past. Additionally, the intention to kill eagles was negatively associated with landholding size. Most of our interviewees were relatively large landowners, but they are typically outnumbered by smallholders who are more likely to persecute harpy eagles. Consequently, education, compensation and tourism activities should be directed to smallholders to mitigate unnecessary persecution and mortality of harpy eagles.

AB Bamboos, abundant in tropical forests, have high potential to dominate disturbed areas due to their high vegetative growth rate and preference for disturbed habitats. However, there are no studies exploring the influence of forest patch characteristics and anthropogenic land-use on bamboo populations. We investigated the influence of landscape matrix characteristics on the abundance of two bamboo taxa (Merostachys sp. and Parodiolyra micrantha) across two different spatial scales: 600 m (113 ha) and 1000 m (314 ha). We sampled the edge of 15 forest fragments (from 20.3 to 116.5 ha) in a highly disturbed landscape in Alfenas, Brasil. Only P. micrantha abundance was influenced by landscape metrics: positively by the percentage of sugarcane and coffee plantations around a forest fragment at 600 m, and negatively by the percentage of pasture at 1000 m. We suggest that cattle presence and/or the edge effect intensified by the adjacent pasture matrices could explain the negative effect of pasture, and that the disturbance caused by sugarcane and coffee plantations might explain the positive influence on P. micrantha abundance, a generalist and competitive understory species. Our results could help decision makers in their attempts to control bamboo populations and manage the landscape around forest fragments.

AB Ants are widely regarded as ecosystem engineers because of their effect on soil structure and on the flow of energy. However, little is known about their influence on the carbon flux in tropical humid savannah. Recent investigations in a humid savannah ecosystem in Lamto showed that ant nests' association with perennial grasses enhances their growth and productivity. This study aimed at understanding the influence of ant nests on soil micro-organism's activity beneath grass tufts. The kinetic of mineralisation was tested in laboratory conditions at various times (days 1, 2, 4 and 7) beneath three grass species associated and not associated with ant nests, following the CO2 amount released at 30celcius during soil respiration. The amount of CO2 released from the soil is higher beneath grass tufts associated with ant nests compared with those not associated with ant nest. The highest amount of CO2 released from the soil was found beneath Hyparrhenia diplandra tufts followed by Andropogon schirensis tufts and the lowest under Loudetia simplex tufts. This study has shown that ant nests' association with grass tufts enhances microbial activity in this savannah ecosystem.

AB Although nature-based tourism is increasingly recognized in forest strategies, economic incentives for private landowners supporting the production of amenity values are largely lacking. This study focused on possibilities to enhance the scenic and recreational values of private forests for nature-based tourism in Finland. More specifically, we studied forest owners' attitudes towards - and willingness to participate in - a Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiative called Landscape and Recreation Value Trade. We also investigated the acceptability of forest management alternatives sustaining landscape qualities, the relative importance of different features of Landscape and Recreation Value Trade for landowners, and the magnitude of overall compensation claims of alternative Landscape and Recreation Value Trade models. A choice experiment survey was conducted in Kuusamo, a popular nature-based tourism destination, located in northeastern Finland. The results show that several forest owners were interested in the suggested scheme if economic losses were to be compensated. The landowners' preferences for Landscape and Recreation Value Trade were somewhat heterogeneous, suggesting that private forest owners in Kuusamo have rather diverse motivations and objectives for their ownership. Owners who stated to have scenic landscapes on their land, and those living outside Kuusamo area, were more willing to join in the suggested mechanism. In general, landowners' willingness to participate was strongly dependent on the amount of compensation as well as on other terms of the contract, such as the duration and severity of harvesting restrictions. The largest marginal compensation claims were related to long contract durations and the stringent "no harvesting at all" restriction. Given the heterogeneity in landowners' preferences, a Landscape and Recreation Value Trade model, offering flexibility to join the system, is needed to attract landowners of forests in hotspot locations for tourism that would help in designing a cost-efficient model for practical application.

AB Liana dynamics may influence tree dynamics and vice versa. Only long-term studies can perhaps disentangle them. In two permanent plots of lowland dipterocarp forest at Danum, a liana census in 1988 was repeated in 2018. The primary forest was still in a late stage of recovery from an inferred large and natural disturbance in the past. Mean number of lianas per tree decreased by 22% and 34% in plots 1 and 2, and in different ways. By 2018, there were relatively more trees with few lianas and relatively fewer trees with many lianas than in 1988. The redistribution was strongest for overstory trees of the Dipterocarpaceae (more with no lianas by 2018) and understory trees of the Euphorbiaceae (many losing high loads in especially plot 2). Proportion of trees with lianas increased overall by 3.5%. The number of lianas per tree showed a quadratic relationship with tree size: maximal for large trees, and fewer for smaller and very large trees. Tree survival and stem growth rate were significantly negatively related to the number of lianas after accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Monte Carlo random subsampling of trees in 1988 and 2018, to achieve statistical independence, established significance of change. Dipterocarps and euphorbs clearly differed in their liana dynamics between plots. Regression models had different forms for the two plots, which reflected a complicated structural-spatial variability in host-liana dynamics. Analysis of the abundant tree species individually highlighted a group of emergent dipterocarps with low liana counts decreasing with time. Building on an earlier hypothesis for this forest type and site, these very large trees appear to have been losing their lianas by branch shedding, as they moved into and out of the main canopy. They were evidently escaping from the parasite. The process may in part explain the characteristically very uneven forest canopy at Danum. Change in liana density was therefore contingent on both forest history and site succession, and plot-level structure and tree dynamics. Liana promotion in the intermittent ENSO dry periods was seemingly being offset by closing of the forest and dominance by dipterocarps in late seral stages.

AB Changes in natural habitats for human use can alter the distribution of biodiversity, favoring species that are more tolerant to environmental disturbance. Usually, these species comprise clades of habitat generalists, which have biological mechanisms to colonize environments with different environmental conditions. However, such effects are still poorly understood for most biological groups, such as the Amazon odonates. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effects of land use along an environmental gradient on the phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity of Odonata in the Amazon. We tested the following hypotheses: In deforested areas (e.g., pasture for cattle, palm plantation, and logging), the Odonata community will be more taxonomically and phylogenetically impoverished than in forested areas. We assume that the modification of the natural habitat causes loss of specialist forest species and favors specialist species of open areas and/or habitat generalists. Data sampling was performed in 195 streams under different land-use types: livestock areas, palm monoculture, timber exploitation, and forest areas taken as reference sites. Our results showed that anthropogenic impacts affected the phylogenetic diversity of odonates and the increase in shrub vegetation was related to the increase in the phylogenetic diversity of communities. On the other hand, shrub vegetation is indicative of disturbed areas, where secondary vegetation predominates, with less canopy cover due to the absence or discontinuity of the native tree cover in these habitats. Nonetheless, species richness and abundance were not related to the effects of anthropogenic land use. Finally, our results suggest that the phylogenetic diversity of Amazonian odonates is related to riparian vegetation structure.

AB Small-scale treefall gaps are among the most important forms of forest disturbance in tropical forests. These gaps expose surrounding trees to more light, promoting rapid growth of understory plants. However, the effects of such small-scale disturbances on the distribution of plant water use across tree canopy levels are less known. To address this, we explored plant transpiration response to the death of a large emergent tree, Mortoniodendron anisophyllum Standl. & Steyerm (DBH > 220 cm; height similar to 40 m). Three suppressed, four mid-story, and two subdominant trees were selected within a 50 x 44 m premontane tropical forest plot at the Texas A&M Soltis Center for Research and Education located in Costa Rica. We compared water use rates of the selected trees before (2015) and after (2019) the tree gap using thermal dissipation sap flow sensors. Hemispherical photography indicated a 40% increase in gap fraction as a result of changes in canopy structure after the treefall gap. Micrometeorological differences (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)) could not explain the observed trends. Rather, light penetration, as measured by sensors within the canopy, increased significantly in 2019. One year after the tree fell, the water usage of trees across all canopy levels increased modestly (15%). Moreover, average water usage by understory trees increased by 36%, possibly as a result of the treefall gap, exceeding even that of overstory trees. These observations suggest the possible reallocation of water use between overstory and understory trees in response to the emergent tree death. With increasing global temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns increasing the likelihood of tree mortality in tropical forests, there is a greater need to enhance our understanding of treefall disturbances that have the potential to redistribute resources within forests.

AB The temperate forests of northern Mexico possess a great diversity of unique and endemic species, with the greatest associations of pine-oak in the planet occurring within them. However, the ecosystems in this region had experienced an accelerated fragmentation process in the past decades. This study described and quantified the landscape fragmentation level of a degraded watershed located in this region. For that, data from the Landsat series from 1990, 2005 and 2017, classified with the Support Vector Machine method, were used. The landscape structure was analyzed based on six metrics applied at both, the landscape and class levels. Results show considerable gains in surface area for the land use land cover change (LULC) of secondary forest while the Primary Forest (PF) lost 18.1% of its area during 1990-2017. The PF increased its number of patches from 7075 to 12,318, increased its patch density (PD) from 53.51 to 58.46 # of patches/100 ha, and reduced its average patch size from 39.21 to 15.05 ha. This made the PF the most fragmented LULC from the 5 LULCs evaluated. In this study, strong fluctuations in edge density and PD were registered, which indicates the forests of northern Mexico have experienced a reduction in their productivity and have been subjected to a continuous degradation process due to disturbances such as fires, clandestine and non-properly controlled logging, among others.

AB Simple Summary Nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems requires moisture. Deserts are characterized by low precipitation and extreme surface temperature that limit biological activity. Attempts to resolve how nutrients recycle despite these constraints were focused primarily on abiotic factors. We suggest that macro-arthropods may play a disproportionally large role in resolving this conundrum. Macro-arthropods are prevalent in deserts and many of them are burrowing detritivores that can remain active during long dry periods. Desert arthropods process and transport plant litter nutrients belowground, where the conditions are favorable for decomposer activity. Consequently, arthropods may accelerate the recycling rate of plant litter nutrients to inorganic nutrients that become available for plant use. This generates a vertical nutrient recycling loop (VRL) that may also assist in explaining how desert plants receive nutrients when the shallow soil is dry. Macro-arthropods may also regulate the spatiotemporal distribution of nutrients by transporting them between patches and across ecosystems. Burrowing activity that alters the desert microtopography and reduces soil salinity may contribute further to creating hotspots of productivity and biological diversity in the otherwise poor desert environment. We conclude that macro-arthropods may play a key role in explaining how desert ecosystems function, and that better understanding of this unique role may assist combating desertification and restoring degraded arid lands. Nutrient dynamics in most terrestrial ecosystems are regulated by moisture-dependent processes. In drylands, nutrient dynamics are often weakly associated with annual precipitation, suggesting that other factors are involved. In recent years, the majority of research on this topic focused on abiotic factors. We provide an arthropod-centric framework that aims to refocus research attention back on the fundamental role that macro-arthropods may play in regulating dryland nutrient dynamics. Macro-arthropods are prevalent in drylands and include many detritivores and burrowing taxa that remain active during long dry periods. Macro-arthropods consume and process large quantities of plant detritus and transport these nutrients to the decomposer haven within their climatically buffered and nutritionally enriched burrows. Consequently, arthropods may accelerate mineralization rates and generate a vertical nutrient recycling loop (VRL) that may assist in explaining the dryland decomposition conundrum, and how desert plants receive their nutrients when the shallow soil is dry. The burrowing activity of arthropods and the transportation of subterranean soil to the surface may alter the desert microtopography and promote desalinization, reducing resource leakage and enhancing productivity and species diversity. We conclude that these fundamental roles and the arthropods' contribution to nutrient transportation and nitrogen fixation makes them key regulators of nutrient dynamics in drylands.

AB The continuous increase in urbanization has been perceived as a major threat for biodiversity, particularly within tropical regions. Urban areas, however, may still provide opportunities for conservation. In this study focused on Macao (China), one of the most densely populated regions on Earth, we used a comprehensive approach, targeting all the vertical strata inhabited by ants, to document the diversity of both native and exotic species, and to produce an updated checklist. We then compared these results with 112 studies on urban ants to illustrate the dual roles of cities in sustaining ant diversity and supporting the spread of exotic species. Our study provides the first assessment on the vertical distribution of urban ant communities, allowing the detection of 55 new records in Macao, for a total of 155 ant species (11.5% being exotic); one of the highest species counts reported for a city globally. Overall, our results contrast with the dominant paradigm that urban landscapes have limited conservation value but supports the hypothesis that cities act as gateways for exotic species. Ultimately, we argue for a more comprehensive understanding of ants within cities around the world to understand native and exotic patterns of diversity.

AB The Semi-arid wildlands of the West Bengal state of India are known habitats of Indian Grey Wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) and Striped Hyaena (Hyaena hyaena) in India. However, increasing anthropogenic pressure in these regions is one major factor behind habitat loss and rising carnivore-human conflict. We mapped the suitable habitat and estimated the niche overlap of both species in the study landscape. Further, we assessed the habitat quality, identified corridors and quantified land sharing by both species. The anthropogenic disturbance (human settlements) was found to be one of the most significant contributors for both species. The higher Schoener's D (0.612) and Hellinger's based I value (0.858) indicates a considerable niche overlap of about 3529 km2. We observed a high level of fragmentation in suitable patches of Grey Wolf compared to the Striped Hyaena. For both Striped Hyaena and Grey Wolf, connectivity exists among the large patch of western and southern Purulia and Bankura. The Grey Wolf corridors in the Jhargram district were also found connected with other areas. We found that both the species, which are generally known rivals showing tolerance towards each other, which is an strong evidence of land sharing among the species. We recommend that the suitable patches and corridors identified in the study may be prioritized for conservation and management.

AB Complex agroforestry systems can host similar biodiversity levels to adjacent continuous forests and can offer important ecosystem services for wildlife. Species inhabiting adjacent forests, as well as species that prefer agroforestry systems, can benefit from this habitat matrix. It is necessary, however, to understand the species-specific adaptability to such a complex matrix. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts many endemic species that are threatened with extinction. Its human population relies heavily on agriculture, meaning that finding a balance between crop productivity and biodiversity is key for the long-term sustainability of local communities and wildlife. We aim to determine the influence of the presence of shade trees and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife in coffee home gardens. In West Java, Indonesia, we monitored 23 gardens between April 2018 and March 2021 via camera traps, totalling 3856 days of monitoring in shade-grown and 3338 days in sun-exposed gardens. We also collected data in the nearby montane rainforest, totalling 1183 days of monitoring. We used Generalized Additive Models to estimate the influence of shade cover and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife. The Sunda leopard cat Prionailurus javanensis was found more frequently in shade-grown gardens and used both the forest and agroforest matrix. Wild boars Sus scrofa mostly occurred in gardens adjacent to the forest, while barred buttonquails Turnix suscitator were associated with gardens far (>1 km) from the forest. Several species (civets Viverricula indica and Paradoxus musangus javanicus, Horsfield's treeshrew Tupaia javanica, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis, Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus) were not influenced by shade cover and distance to the forest, suggesting they are well adapted to the agroforestry system. Still, species of high conservation importance, such as Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas, Sunda porcupine Hystrix javanica, and grizzled langur Presbytis comata, were present in the forest but not in the agroforest, suggesting that the replacement of the forest by the agroforestry matrix is still detrimental. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain the complexity of the agroforestry system and connectivity with the neighbouring continuous forest to favour the long-term sustainability of this environment and the conservation of endemic species.

AB The Amazon moisture recycling system has been widely examined because it is fundamental to maintain some of the global climate processes, however, we have yet to know to what extent the agricultural growing season is dependent on the evapotranspiration contribution from the Amazon forest. Here we use a moisture tracking model to calculate the forest's contribution to downwind precipitation. Specifically, we calculate the influence of moisture recycling on the seasonality of precipitation in the arc of deforestation with respect to the agricultural growing season. We calculated the wet season start, end and length using three scenarios (a) total precipitation with existing vegetation cover; (b) where we replace forest's contribution to precipitation by replacing it with the equivalent from short vegetation; (c) where the forest's contribution to precipitation is completely removed. We found that forest moisture recycling contributes up to 40% of monthly precipitation in the arc of deforestation. However, there is a strong spatial gradient in the forest's contribution to precipitation, which decreases from west to east. This gradient also coincides with suitability for double-cropping agriculture. Our scenarios excluding precipitation originating from forest indicated that forest is a key contributing factor in determining the wet season start. We found that even when the precipitation originating from forest was replaced by short vegetation there was a significant delay in the wet season start in our study regions. Interestingly the wet season end was more resilient to changes in precipitation source. However it is clear that moisture recycling plays a key role in determining the wet season end as when forest's contribution to precipitation was entirely removed the wet season end arrived significantly earlier. These differences in wet season length were not detectable in the eastern states of Tocantins and Maranhao, as much less of the precipitation in these states originates from the forest. Our findings demonstrate the importance of forest in supporting double-cropping agriculture in the arc of deforestation. As agricultural intensification by double-cropping increases land-use efficiency, it may also reduce the demand for further deforestation. Therefore it is important to identify how the current forest extent provides this important ecosystem service.

AB The performance of root hemiparasites depends strongly on host species identity, but it remains unknown whether there exist general patterns in the quality of species as hosts for hemiparasites and in their sensitivity to parasitism. In a comparative approach, the model root hemiparasites Rhinanthus minor and R. alectorolophus were grown with 25 host species (grasses, forbs, and legumes) at two nutrient levels. Hosts grown without parasites served as a control. Host species identity strongly influenced parasite biomass and other traits, and both parasites grew better with legumes and grasses than with forbs. The biomass of R. alectorolophus was much higher than that of R. minor with all host plants and R. alectorolophus responded much more strongly to higher nutrient availability than R. minor. The performance of the two species of Rhinanthus with individual hosts was strongly correlated, and it was also correlated with that of R. alectorolophus and the related Odontites vulgaris in previous experiments with many of the same hosts, but only weakly with that of the less closely related Melampyrum arvense. The negative effect of R. minor on host biomass was less strong than that of R. alectorolophus, but stronger relative to its own biomass, suggesting that it is more parasitic. The impact of the two parasites on individual hosts did not depend on nutrient level and was correlated. Several legumes and grasses were tolerant of parasitism. While R. minor slightly reduced mean overall productivity, R. alectorolophus increased it with several species, indicating that the loss of host biomass was more than compensated by that of the parasite. The results show that closely related parasites have similar host requirements and correlated negative effects on individual hosts, but that there are also specific interactions between pairs of parasitic plants and their hosts.

AB Macroevolutionary studies frequently emphasize the importance of pollinator shifts for driving speciation within the angiosperms. Pollinators have been identified as a driver of diversification in the mega-diverse genus Erica in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, but basic information on pollinator-driven divergence at the initial stages of speciation in this genus is lacking. We focus on two populations of Erica junonia (var. junonia and var. minor) that occur on adjacent mountain ranges separated by c. 10 km and which differ in floral tube length, and ask whether these differences in tube length are associated with a shift between pollinators with different proboscis lengths. In addition, we assess whether the two forms differ in their ability to reproduce in the absence of pollinators. Our findings show that different Erica junonia varieties are visited by different nemestrinid fly species in the genus Moegistorhynchus, and that their floral tube lengths correspond to the proboscis lengths of these flies. Pollinator exclusion experiments show that the short-tubed var. minor is capable of producing seeds in the absence of pollinators, whereas the long-tubed var. junonia depends fully on pollinators. Our study provides an example of pollinator-driven divergence on a small spatial scale and contributes to an understanding of diversification of the genus Erica. (C) 2021 SAAB.

AB Human activities have disturbed global phosphorus (P) cycling by introducing substantial amounts of P to natural ecosystems. Although natural P gradients and fertilization studies have found that plant community traits are closely related to P availability, it remains unclear how increased P supply affects plant growth and diversity in P-deficient tropical forests. We used a decadal P-addition experiment (2007-2017) to study the effects of increased P input on plant growth and diversity in understory layer in tropical forests. We monitored the dynamics of seedling growth, survival rate, and diversity of understory plants throughout the fertilization period under control and P addition at 15 g P m-2 yr-1. To identify the drivers of responses, P concentration, photosynthesis rate and nonstructural carbon were analyzed. Results showed that long-term P addition significantly increased P concentrations both in soil pools and plant tissues. However, P addition did not increase the light-saturated photosynthesis rate or growth rate of the understory plants. Furthermore, P addition significantly decreased the survival rate of seedlings and reduced the species richness and density of understory plants. The negative effects of P addition may be attributed to an increased carbon cost due to the tissue maintenance of plants with higher P concentrations. These findings indicate that increased P supply alone is not necessary to benefit the growth of plants in ecosystems with low P availability, and P inputs can inhibit understory plants and may alter community composition. Therefore, we appeal to a need for caution when inputting P to tropical forests ecosystems. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large amounts of carbon flow through tropical ecosystems every year, from which a part is sequestered in biomass through tree growth. However, the effects of ongoing warming and drying on tree growth and carbon sequestration in tropical forest is still highly uncertain. Field observations are sparse and limited to a few sites, while remote sensing analysis shows diverging growth responses to past droughts that cannot be interpreted with confidence. To reconcile data from field observations and remote sensing, we collated in situ measurements of stem growth and leaf litterfall from inventory plots across the Amazon region and other neotropical ecosystems. These data were used to train two machine-learning models and to evaluate model performance on reproducing stem growth and litterfall rates. The models utilized multiple climatological variables and other geospatial datasets (terrain, soil and vegetation properties) as explanatory variables. The output consisted of monthly estimates of leaf litterfall (R-2 = 0.71, NRMSE = 9.4 %) and stem growth (R-2 = 0.54, NRMSE = 10.6 %) across the neotropics from 1982 to 2019 at a high spatial resolution (0.1 degrees). Modelled time series allow us to assess the impacts of the 2005 and 2015 droughts in the Amazon basin on regional scales. The more severe 2015 drought was estimated to have caused widespread declines in stem growth (-1.8a), coinciding with enhanced leaf fall (+1.4a), which were only locally apparent in 2005. Regions in the Amazon basin that flushed leaves at the onset of both droughts (+0.9a similar to +2.00) showed positive anomalies in remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index, while sun-induced fluorescence and vegetation optical depth were reduced. The previously observed counterintuitive response of canopy greenup during drought in the Amazon basin detected by many remote sensing analyses can therefore be a result of enhanced leaf flushing at the onset of a drought. The long-term estimates of leaf litterfall and stem growth point to a decline in stem growth and a simultaneous increase in leaf litterfall in the Amazon basin since 1982. These trends are associated with increased warming and drying of the Amazonian climate and could point to a further decline in the Amazon carbon sink strength.

AB Biological repellents have been used as a control method to mitigate human-wildlife conflict worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the effect of jaguar (Panthera onca) feces as a repellent for a free-living urban population of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), which are considered a vertebrate pest in some regions of their range. Observational data were collected during two consecutive 5-day periods: control and treatment. Scan samples within a 2-h observational session were carried out, recording capybara incursions into a 15 m x 15 m marked perimeter and alertness behavioral state. During the treatment period, 30 g of jaguar feces were added daily every 5.0 m around the perimeter in four selected areas (around Lake Paranoa, Brasilia, Brazil) frequented by capybara. The presence of predator feces induced changes in capybaras' behavior as there was a decrease in actual presence at the sites as a whole with the presence of jaguar feces. Of those capybaras that did continue to visit a site, incursions into the marked perimeter were initially greatly reduced, but did rebound relatively rapidly over the trial period. Although our results showed that capybaras recognize jaguar's feces as a predator threat, odor habituation may limit the repellent's efficacy at a local level, but appeared to have a longer term effect on the overall numbers of capybara visiting a site in general. Improvements in this technique will be required for it to become practicable, to reinforce capybaras' aversion to predators, to decrease their habituation to predator's feces, and to provide more humanitarian control.

AB Carbon losses from forest degradation and disturbances are significant and growing sources of emissions in the Brazilian Amazon. Between 2003 and 2019, degradation and disturbance accounted for 44% of forest carbon losses in the region, compared with 56% from deforestation (forest clearing). We found that land tenure played a decisive role in explaining these carbon losses, with Undesignated Public Forests and Other Lands (e.g., private properties) accounting for the majority (82%) of losses during the study period. Illegal deforestation and land grabbing in Undesignated Public Forests widespread and increasingly are important drivers of forest carbon emissions from the region. In contrast, indigenous Territories and Protected Natural Areas had the lowest emissions, demonstrating their effectiveness in preventing deforestation and maintaining carbon stocks. These trends underscore the urgent need to develop reliable systems for monitoring and reporting on carbon losses from forest degradation and disturbance. Together with improved governance, such actions will be crucial for Brazil to reduce pressure on standing forests; strengthen Indigenous land rights; and design effective climate mitigation strategies needed to achieve its national and international climate commitments.

AB Emergent neutrality (EN) suggests that species must be sufficiently similar or sufficiently different in their niches to avoid interspecific competition. Such a scenario results in a transient pattern with clumps and gaps of species abundance along the niche axis (e.g. represented by body size). From this perspective, clumps are groups of coexisting species with negligible fitness differences and stochastic abundance fluctuations. Plankton is an excellent model system for developing and testing ecological theories, especially those related to size structure and species coexistence. We tested EN predictions using the phytoplankton community along the course of a tropical river considering 1) body size structure, 2) functional clustering of species in terms of morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and 3) the functional similarity among species concerning their functional traits. Two main clumps in the body size axis (clump I and II) were conspicuous through time and were detected in different stretches of the river. Clump I comprised medium-sized species from the MBFGs IV, V and VI while clump II included large-bodied species from the MBFGs V and VI. Pairwise differences in species biovolume correlated with species functional similarity when the whole species pool was considered, but not among species within the same clump. Although clumps comprised multiple MBFGs, the dominant species within the clump belonged always to the same MBFG. Also, within-clump species biovolume increased with functional distinctiveness considering both seasons and stretches, except the lower course. These results suggest that species within clumps behave in a quasi-neutral state, but even minor shifts in trait composition may affect species biovolume. Our findings point that EN belongs to the plausible mechanisms explaining community assembly in river ecosystems.

AB 1. Recent studies demonstrate that ecological and evolutionary processes can occur over similar temporal and spatial scales and might thus frequently interact. Although concepts such as the evolving metacommunity, diffuse (co)evolution and community genetics integrate multi-species dynamics, most experimental studies usually consider how evolution affects only one focal species. Hence, our understanding of evolution in multi-species communities is still underdeveloped.
   2. We highlight key community and evolutionary mechanisms and their interactions to facilitate a broader understanding of evolution in multi-species communities. We propose a framework that explicitly considers interactions between each of the four analogous processes of evolutionary biology (selection, gene flow, genetic drift and mutation) and community ecology (species sorting, dispersal, ecological drift and speciation).
   3. Focusing on interactions between processes of evolutionary biology and community ecology enables explorations of the full range of eco-evolutionary dynamics in multi-species communities and guides the design of novel experiments. Furthermore, the proposed framework develops a shared language between evolutionary biologists and community ecologists and indicates new research avenues.
   4. Overall, we propose that explicitly incorporating interactions between these evolutionary and community processes to study eco-evolutionary dynamics in multi-species communities will better inform broader questions about the maintenance of diversity and the resilience of diverse communities to disturbances, both natural and manmade.

AB Early pioneer species share life histories enabling them to colonize disturbed sites, but how much they differ demographically and how such differentiation determines pioneer species turnover during succession are still open questions. Here, we approached these issues by comparing the demography of dominant pioneer tree species during the secondary succession of tropical rainforest in Southeast Mexico. We assessed changes in population density, population structure, vital rates and intrinsic population growth rate (r) of the pioneer species Trema micrantha, Cecropia peltata and Trichospermum mexicanum during the first 35 years of succession. For this, we combined chronosequence and long-term (from 2000 to 2018) data from 14 abandoned cornfields with 0.5-35 years fallow age. Trema colonized and disappeared first during succession (<15 years), followed by Cecropia (<28) and Trichospermum (>31). All species exhibited hump-shaped successional trajectories of population density and biomass with Trema reaching a peak first, followed by Cecropia and later Trichospermum. Species exhibited a fast reduction in r with fallow age, with Trema reaching negative growth rates (r < 0) in the third, Cecropia in the fourth, and Trichospermum in the seventh year of succession. Recruitment, growth and mortality rates of seedlings and juveniles defined the period of population increase and the age of succession at which each species reached maximum density and biomass. The mortality rate in mature stages determined how long each species persisted during succession. An important variation in species replacement occurred among study sites. In some sites, one species was abundant and the others were almost absent, while it was the opposite in other sites. We inferred that priority inhibitory effects operated among species during the field colonization. Synthesis. Although Trema, Cecropia and Trichospermum are considered typical pioneer trees, these species differed importantly in their demographic attributes during succession. The speed at which r declined with age of succession indicated the moment at which each species reached its maximum density and species replacement sequence during succession. However, inter-specific priority inhibitory effects during field colonization may also be involved in the chance of colonization and replacement between species with similar regeneration strategies.

AB Understanding the mechanisms by which similar species coexist in sympatry is a major driver of ecological research. Niche partitioning and ecological plasticity can facilitate spatial and habitat use overlap between generalist and specialist species. Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are a highly speciose group of small primates that are endemic to the forests of Madagascar. In northwestern Madagascar, the relatively widespread M. murinus occurs sympatrically with the microendemic M. ravelobensis. We investigated spatial distributions and densities of these two species across a mangrove-dry forest habitat gradient in Mariarano commune. We used capturemark-recapture techniques and nocturnal line transect surveys along six transects during June and July 2017. Spatial capture-recapture and distance sampling models were used to estimate lemur densities across habitat types. The congeners displayed differential patterns of spatial distribution and densities. Microcebus murinus was found in similar densities across all habitat types, while M. ravelobensis was found at much higher densities in dry forests compared with mangroves. This suggests that the generalist M. murinus uses a wider array of habitats more evenly than the specialist M. ravelobensis. Our study provides empirical evidence of how cryptic lemur species differ in their habitat use and distribution across an environmental gradient and provides new insights into their ecology in an understudied habitat. Lemurs arc one of the most threatened groups of mammals in the world, and understanding how these species are distributed across different forest types is crucial for planning and implementing conservation measures to protect lemur habitat.

AB Ants are a major ecological group in tropical rainforests. Few studies in the Neotropics have documented the distribution of ants from the ground to the canopy, and none have included the understorey. A previous analysis of an intensive arthropod study in Panama, involving 11 sampling methods, showed that the factors influencing ant beta diversity (i.e., changes in assemblage composition) were, in decreasing order of importance, the vertical (height), temporal (season), and horizontal (geographic distance) dimensions. In the present study, we went one step further and aimed (1) to identify the best sampling methods to study the entire ant assemblage across the three strata, (2) to test if all strata show a similar horizontal beta diversity and (3) to analyze the functional structure of the entire ant assemblage. We identified 405 ant species from 11 subfamilies and 68 genera. Slightly more species were sampled in the canopy than on the ground; they belonged to distinct sub-assemblages. The understorey fauna was mainly a mixture of species found in the other two strata. The horizontal beta diversity between sites was similar for the three strata. About half of the ant species foraged in two (29%) or three (25%) strata. A single method, aerial flight interception traps placed alongside tree trunks, acting as arboreal pitfall traps, collected half of the species and reflected the vertical stratification. Using the functional traits approach, we observed that generalist species with mid-sized colonies were by far the most numerous (31%), followed by ground- or litter-dwelling species, either specialists (20%), or generalists (16%), and arboreal species, either generalists (19%) or territorially dominant (8%), and finally army ants (5%). Our results reinforce the idea that a proper understanding of the functioning of ant assemblages requires the inclusion of arboreal ants in survey programs. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB Conservation is predominantly an exercise in trying to change human behaviour - whether that of consumers whose choices drive unsustainable resource use, of land managers clearing natural habitats, or of policymakers failing to deliver on environmental commitments. Yet conservation research and practice have made only limited use of recent advances in behavioural science, including more novel behaviour change interventions. Instead conservationists mostly still rely on traditional behaviour change interventions - education, regulation and material incentivisation - largely without applying recent insights from behavioural science about how to improve such approaches. This paper explores how behavioural science could be more widely and powerfully applied in biodiversity conservation. We consider the diverse cast of actors involved in conservation problems and the resulting breadth of behaviour change that conservationists might want to achieve. Drawing on health research, we present a catalogue of types of interventions for changing behaviour, considering both novel, standalone interventions and the enhancement of more traditional conservation interventions. We outline a framework for setting priorities among interventions based on their likely impact, using ideas developed for climate change mitigation. We caution that, despite its promise, behavioural science is not a silver bullet for conservation. The effects of interventions aimed at changing behaviour can be modest, temporary, and context dependent in ways that are as-yet poorly understood. We therefore close with a call for interventions to be tested and the findings widely disseminated to enable researchers and practitioners to build a much-needed evidence base on the effectiveness and limitations of these tools.

AB Aim The island species-area relationship (ISAR) quantifies how the number of species increases as the area of an island or island-like habitat gets larger and is one of the most general patterns in ecology. However, studies that measure the ISAR often confound variation in sampling methodology and analyses, precluding appropriate syntheses of its underlying mechanisms. Most ISAR studies use only presence-absence data at the whole-island scale, whereas we planned to use a framework that applies individual-based rarefaction to synthesize whether and how the ISAR differs from the null expectation of the passive sampling hypothesis. Location Five hundred and five islands from 34 different archipelagos across the world, including oceanic islands, lake islands and forest islands. Major taxa studied Local assemblages of plants, invertebrates, herpetofauna, birds and mammals. Methods We collated local-scale species abundance data from multiple archipelagos (median of 12 islands per study) and used a rarefaction-based approach to synthesize the relationship between island size and (1) sample effort-controlled rarefied species richness, or (2) an effective number of species derived from the probability of interspecific encounter (an index of community evenness). Results When we applied rarefaction to control for sampling effort, the numbers of species and their relative abundances across all studies differed from the passive sampling hypothesis. Our measure of evenness also increased with island size, suggesting that the disproportionate effects we observed influenced both rarer and more common species. We found few associations between the slope of this effect and island type or taxon, but we did find that island archipelagos with greater elevational heterogeneity also deviated more from the null expectation than those with less heterogeneity. Main conclusions Using a synthetic approach across island archipelagos, we reject the null expectation that passive sampling causes the ISAR and instead suggest that ecological mechanisms leading to disproportionate (non-random) effects on larger relative to smaller islands are predominant.

AB The structure and dynamics of breast tissue bacteria can have far-reaching influences on women's health, particularly on breast tumor development. However, there is little understanding on the ecological processes that shape the structure and dynamics of breast tissue bacteria. Here, we fill the gap by applying three metacommunity models for investigating the community assembly and diversity maintenance, including Sloan near neutral model, Harris et al. multisite neutral and Tang & Zhou niche-neutral hybrid models to reanalyze the 16S-rRNA sequencing datasets of 23 healthy, 12 benign tumor, and 33 malignant tumor tissue samples. First, we found that, at the community/metacommunity levels, the mechanisms of bacteria assembly and diversity maintenance of breast tissue bacteria were moderately influenced by stochastic drifts of bacteria demography (division, death, and dispersal of bacterial cells). At species level, on average, approximately 10 and 5% species were above (positively selected) and below (negatively selected) neutral, respectively. Furthermore, malignant tumor may raise the positively selected species up to 17%. Second, malignant tumor appears to inhibit microbial dispersal as evidenced by lowered migration rates, compared with the migration in normal and benign tumor tissues. These theoretic findings can be inspirational for further investigating the relationships between tissue bacteria and breast tumor progression/development.

AB Stable species coexistence is a result of a balance between niche and fitness differences. One of the most common competitive patterns that arise from interactions between closely related species is character displacement, which may lead to divergence of certain traits and niche partitioning in areas where species co-occur. In this study, we used data on 35 groups of two parapatric tamarins (Saguinus midas and S. bicolor) to test for asymmetries in group size and competitively driven divergence in forest strata use, under the influence of resource availability fluctuation across the year. We hypothesised that S. midas is competitively superior to S. bicolor, and this would result from differences in fitness-related traits (group size). If so, species patterns of vertical habitat across the year should shift in sympatry relative to allopatry. We found that species had similar group sizes, suggesting they have similar competitive abilities. Further, both pied and red-handed tamarins used lower heights whenever in larger groups, which may be related to a diet shift in response to increases in intragroup competition. In addition, we refuted our prediction of vertical niche partitioning in sympatry. Instead, S. midas moved upwards into the canopy with increasing rainfall over the year (a proxy for resource availability) both in sympatry and allopatry, whereas S. bicolor was unresponsive to both rainfall and geographic contact with S. midas groups. Therefore, the difference in vertical habitat use between these species over part of the year is probably more related to the degree of resource seasonality experienced by each species within their ranges, than to competition.

AB Aim The plant species sharing ancestors now disjunctly distributed in eastern Asia (EAS) and eastern North America (ENA) have long been a biogeographic puzzle. Species within the EAS-ENA disjunct genera are presumed to exhibit niche conservatism, the tendency of closely related species to be more ecologically similar, reflecting lineages' common evolutionary history. However, the hypothesis has not been well examined at the species level. Location EAS and ENA. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Species within the EAS-ENA disjunct genera. Methods We compiled data on climate, species occurrence, growth form, and phylogeny to examine niche conservatism. We first built a phylogenetic tree to select intercontinental congeneric pairwise species and obtained their divergence times. We then quantified the observed niche overlaps with Schoener's D, which has a 0-1 range, based on species occurrence and climate of species' native ranges. To obtain projected distributions, each species' niche was projected to the non-native region using ensemble ecological niche models. Projected-related niche overlaps were then calculated using projected distributions and the corresponding climatic conditions. Results Average observed niche overlaps of congeneric pairwise species were relatively small: .124, .211 and .109 for all, herbaceous and woody species, respectively. Both observed and projected-related niche overlaps had significant negative relationships with divergence times of intercontinental congeneric pairwise species, with niche overlap for herbaceous species being higher than that for woody plants when controlling for divergence times. Main conclusions We conclude that the significant negative relationships between niche overlap and divergence times of congeneric pairwise species confirm niche conservatism among species of EAS-ENA disjunct plants and that the extent of niche conservatism is slightly different for herbaceous and woody plants. These findings suggest the potential role of allopatric speciation in EAS, and could help to understand the evolutionary history and the Asian-bias diversity pattern of the EAS-ENA disjunct plants.

AB Soil fungi have important functions in agricultural ecosystems. They promote crop growth by driving soil nutrient cycling and by forming mycorrhizal symbioses with crop species. Most studies on soil fungi have focused on detecting the edaphic factors that structure fungal communities, but little is known about how climate influences the soil microbiome. Moreover, a profound understanding of how soil fungal communities are modulated by other soil organisms, such as protist predators, is lacking. We investigated the spatial succession of fungal assemblages in China and their potential predator-prey relationships with protists across four climatic zones using 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Although stochastic processes dominated the assembly of fungal communities, deterministic drivers of community assembly were more important in high-latitude climatic zones (that is, in the temperate and continental zones) than in low-latitude climatic zones (that is, in the tropics and subtropics). Random forest and variation partitioning analyses showed that biotic effects influenced fungal communities as much as abiotic effects. Biotic factors were better predictors of the abundance of several saprophytic and mycorrhizal fungi than abiotic factors. This finding was further supported by a network analysis, which indicated that the intensity of fungi-protist interactions may stimulate the divergence of prey fungal communities. Our results reveal for the first time the nonnegligible effects of biotic factors on soil fungal community assembly across substantially different climatic zones. The biological mechanisms underlying these effects can be well understood within a predator-prey relationship framework in which protists exert strong top-down control on fungal communities.

AB The ecology of leeches worldwide has been scarcely studied, with the ecology of Neotropical leeches remaining highly unknown. Americobdella valdiviana, an endemic, carnivorous, and giant leech that inhabits the Valdivian evergreen forest in southern Chile, an ecosystem that has experienced an increase in its net loss from 3.6% to 12% in the last decades due to various human activities. Here, we combined citizen science with species distribution models (SDM) to analyze (i) the effect of habitat variables with the abundance A. valdiviana, (ii) the distribution range, (iii) the habitat loss and fragmentation of A. valdiviana, and (iv) their conservation status. First, we asked each user or scientist for the observed relative abundance and a series of environmental variables, which were then correlated by using Generalized Linear Models. Then, distribution ranges were estimated using SDM, which was combined with multiannual forest cover maps to identify habitat loss and fragmentation between 2000 and 2018. Finally, we used IUCN criteria to evaluate the conservation status of this species. Abundance was related mainly to the canopy coverage, while suitability was positively associated to temperature seasonality and canopy cover. Suitability was higher in forests with levels of primary productivity. We found that the north and center zones of the species range experienced high habitat loss and fragmentation. Under IUCN Red List criteria, we qualified this species as endangered. Our results support that the combination of citizen science, SDM, and spatial analysis at local and biogeographical scales can inform conservation actions of poorly known and threatened macroinvertebrate fauna.

AB Woody encroachment represents a global concern which is mostly studied in natural and semi-natural grasslands and savannas. Woody invasion is a growing phenomenon in agricultural landscapes, but it remains elusive how different crop types and their management could shape woody invasion in croplands. Understanding the mechanisms involved in woody establishment in crops may contribute to design strategies to reduce the magnitude and consequences of invasion. We examined to what extent current agricultural practices affect early establishment of the invasive tree Gleditsia triacanthos (honey locust) in maize and soybean crops, during a wet and a dry growing season. In Pampean croplands (Argentina), we selected zero tillage fields of both crops and controlled management (with/without agricultural practices) and crop presence (with/without soybean or maize plants) during two growing seasons. After maize and soybean harvest, we examined survival, growth, and starch reserves of G. triacanthos seedlings. Results showed that G. triacanthos survival decreased from 76% to 34% in the dry year with respect to the wet year. Crop presence enhanced tree survival, likely by protecting seedlings from herbicide and desiccation, but reduced seedling growth. Seedlings were smaller in soybean than in maize, and larger when crop was removed, independent of crop type. Even so, woody survival was on average 61% and 49% after maize and soybean harvest, respectively. Interestingly, seedling starch reserves were modulated by crop type and management, and were positively associated with G. triacanthos survival. In conclusion, we found a hierarchy of controls acting on G. triacanthos establishment in cropping systems, with growing season rainfall variability, crop type and the applied management modifying tree survival and growth. Overall, our study highlights that, under current management, annually cropped fields may represent a refuge for woody plant invaders and a potential front of woody expansion.

AB The conversion of tropical habitats has dramatic implications on biodiversity and represents one of the greatest conservation challenges of our time. Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF), which are disjointly distributed throughout the Neotropics, are especially susceptible to human activities. The Caatinga Dry Forest, located in the semi-arid interior of northeastern Brazil, represents not only the largest and most biologically diverse nucleus of SDTF, but also the world's most densely populated semi-arid region, with ever-growing pressure on its natural resources. To prevent illegal logging, conservation agencies looked at forest management, where an area is divided in smaller stands which are gradually logged and allowed to regrow for a period of time, when a new cutting cycle should reinitiate. The impacts of these management schemes on biodiversity, however, remain largely untested. We conducted standardized avian surveys to evaluate the effects of forest management on the avian community at a 1,670 ha privately owned property located on the Chapada do Araripe, northeastern Brazil. This area was divided in 22 forest stands, half of which had already been logged at the time of our sampling, creating a gradient of logged and natural forests and an 11-yr chrono-sequence of forest regeneration. Our results show that logged areas present fewer individuals, fewer species, and different avian assemblages than unlogged forests. Such differences are mostly driven by forest-dependent species, which were overwhelmingly affected by forest management. Our results show that although logged forests tend to recover its height after a decade, they do not recover the originally forest cover, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Likewise, decade-long recovering stands continue to show lower species richness, lower bird abundance, and different avian composition than unlogged forests. We identified a set of bird species that are more affected by forest management (ecological losers) and a group of birds that apparently benefit from the referred changes in land use (ecological winners). We conclude that completely managing an entire area may cause the extirpation of several forest-dependent species. We therefore suggest keeping logged and unlogged plots intermingled, to avoid local extinctions and the complete modification of the original avifauna.

AB The maintenance of seedling diversity of animal-dispersed tree species is fundamental for the structure and function of forest patches in fragmented tropical rainforests. Nonetheless, the effects of landscape structure at different spatial scales on alpha- and beta-diversity of tree seedling communities are recently explored. Using a multi-scale approach, we assessed the relative effect of landscape composition and configuration on alpha- and beta-diversity of animal-dispersed seedlings within 16 forest patches in the Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. We assessed these effects at 13 spatial scales (from 300 to 1500 m radius, at 100 m intervals) for three metrics of effective number of species considering alpha- and beta-diversity. We found that alpha-diversity was largely affected by landscape composition and beta-diversity by landscape configuration. On the one hand, the amount of secondary forest influenced alpha-diversity. Additionally, species richness increased in landscapes with highly aggregated forest patches. On the other hand, beta-diversity was affected positively by forest fragmentation and negatively by the edge contrast of forest patches with the surrounding matrix. Our findings indicate that landscape configuration is a strong driver of seedling diversity in highly deforested rainforests. Promoting forest patches and secondary forests through payment for ecosystem services' programs, favoring matrix quality within land-sharing schemes of smallholder agriculture and secondary forest management, and identifying restoration opportunities for assisted or unassisted natural regeneration are urgently needed for conservation of seedling diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes.

AB The state of Para in northern Brazil is located entirely within the Amazon Basin and harbors a great diversity of landscape and vegetation types that support high levels of biodiversity. Here, we provide a comprehensive inventory of ant species and their distribution in Para. This regional list is based on an extensive review of species records from published and unpublished sources covering a period of 134 years (1886-2020) and includes the five most representative ant collections in Brazil. In total, we documented 12 subfamilies, 90 genera and 753 ant species, including 97 species recorded for the first time in Para and 12 species newly reported in Brazil. Sampling effort across the state is highly uneven, and most records may be associated with research areas near the state capital, mining areas, hydroelectric dams, and research field stations run by the state or universities. In addition, our results suggest a strong bias in ant collection in Para in terms of proximity of sampled sites to access routes, such as roads and rivers. We also found that species records were highly unevenly distributed based on areas of endemism within the Amazon, vegetation type, and protected areas within the state. Ant surveys are still lacking from most protected areas of Para, and further sampling is urgently needed in view of the current trend of expansion of major infrastructure projects and natural resource harvesting within protected areas of Para. Our database represents an extremely valuable and rich source of information for further studies on ant biodiversity and conservation in the Amazon Basin.

AB Protecting tropical forests and their biological diversity is a global priority. Understanding if thresholds of forest cover exist beyond which biodiversity displays non-linear declines is key to developing appropriate conservation strategies and policies, but uncertainty remains around the identification and characteristics of these thresholds. We performed a global systematic review of studies using forest cover gradient to identify an ecological threshold across tropical forest ecosystems. Our systematic review finds 68 ecological thresholds reported in 33 peer-reviewed publications. Three main conclusions emerged: first, we show clear geographical gaps in ecological thresholds studies, with 72% of reported thresholds found in South America, over half in Brazil; second, we see ecological threshold studies follow taxonomic biases in line with wider conservation research; and third, there is a lack of homogeneity and comparability in the metrics and sampling designs used to identify a threshold. This global review shows interest in ecological thresholds continues to grow, but further evidence is needed to understand their application in tropical forest management. We identify the main gaps in knowledge and provide guidance to focus research efforts on six key aspects to better understand their potential as a policy-making tool for tropical forest conservation. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB Leaf plasticity to light can affect species distribution in areas with contrasting light availability. Plants can acclimate to prevailing light conditions according to their optimal growth conditions. Our goal was to assess differences in the morphophysiological plasticity of leaves of two woody species (Inga vera subsp. affinis and Psychotria carthagenensis) that occur in a riparian forest (low irradiance) and in the ecotone between the riparian forest and a savanna-like formation (high irradiance) in the Southern Pantanal, Brazil. Both species showed lower specific leaf area and higher concentration of carotenoids per leaf area in the ecotone. Moreover, the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II decreased at midday in the ecotone, suggesting the induction of dynamic photoinhibition. Psychotria carthagenensis showed a sharp decrease in leaf water potential at midday in both sites. The light saturation point and non-photochemical quenching of Inga vera increased in the ecotone. Both species had thicker cuticles and mesophyll in the ecotone, and the palisade to spongy parenchyma ratio of P. carthagenensis increased at the same site. Additionally, in the ecotone, the concentration of proteins per leaf area was higher. The results indicate that these species showed different patterns of leaf plasticity, with I. vera presenting increased photosynthetic capacity and P. carthagenensis showing more plasticity in morphoanatomical traits. Therefore, our results suggest that the high potential of photosynthetic use of light by I. vera may help to explain its broader distribution in sites with higher irradiance.

AB Forest structure and composition change are driven by complex interactions among local site factors, past site history, and region-specific socio-demographic factors. Previous studies suggest the structural, functional, taxonomic, and carbon storage potential of vegetation increases during succession. However, information on these attributes along an altitudinal gradient from the North East India is lacking for the old growth secondary forests. Therefore, the present study investigates (i) tree diversity and biomass carbon storage, and (ii) dominating and carbon important tree species, along an altitudinal gradient (30-700 m) in the tropical semi-evergreen forests of southern Assam. Random quadrats of 0.1 ha were laid over selected elevation gradient of secondary forest to evaluate tree diversity, density, basal area, and biomass carbon stock. Shannon-wiener index increases from 2.88 (at 30 m) to 3.33 (at 700 m) indicating an increase in species diversity with elevation. The stand density ranges from 920-1630 stems ha(-1) and reciprocally related to the altitude. Palaquium polyanthum, Dysoxylum binectariferum, and Maniltoa polyandra were the most dominant species at 30 m, 300 m and 700 m, respectively. Biomass carbon stock decreases with the increase in altitude and ranges from 71.20 to 77.47 Mg ha(-1). Palaquium ployanthum, Sterculia sp. and Syzygium cumini were the most carbon important species at 30 m, 300 m and 700 m, respectively. Present study suggests conservation and management of old-growth secondary forests have carbon storage and regional climate benefits. Management of such secondary forests can also enhance the resiliency of forest ecosystems to nature conservancy.

AB Tree species that are successful in tropical lowlands have different acquisition strategies to overcome soil phosphorus (P) limitations. Some of these strategies belowground include adjustments in fine-root traits, such as morphology, architecture, association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and phosphatase activity. Trade-offs among P-acquisition strategies are expected because of their respective carbon cost. However, empirical evidence remains scarce which hinders our understanding of soil P-acquisition processes in tropical forests. Here, we measured seven fine-root functional traits related to P acquisition of five common tree species in three sites of the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico. We then described species-specific P-acquisition strategies and explored the changes in fine-root trait expression from 6 months before to 6 months after two consecutive hurricanes, Irma and Maria, passed over the island. We found that variations in root trait expression were driven mainly by the large interspecific differences across the three selected sites. In addition, we revealed a trade-off between highly colonized fine roots with high phosphatase activity and fine roots that have a high degree of branching. Furthermore, the former strategy was adopted by pioneer species (Spathodea campanulata and Cecropia schreberiana), whereas the latter was adopted by non-pioneer species (mostly Dacryodes excelsa and Prestoea montana). Additionally, we found that root trait expression did not change comparing 6 months before and after the hurricanes, with the exception of root phosphatase activity. Altogether, our results suggest a combination of structural and physiological root traits for soil P acquisition in P-poor tropical soils by common tropical tree species, and show stability on most of the root trait expression after hurricane disturbances.

AB Crop-wild gene flow may alter the fitness of the recipient i.e., crop-wild hybrids, then potentially impact wild populations, especially for the gene flow carrying selective advantageous crop alleles, such as transgenes conferring insect resistance. Given the continuous crop-wild gene flow since crop domestication and the occasionally stressful environments, the extant wild populations of most crops are still "wild. " One interpretation for this phenomenon is that wild populations have the mechanism buffered for the effects of crop alleles. However, solid evidence for this has been scarce. We used wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) and transgenic (Bt/CpTI) rice (O. sativa) as a crop-wild gene flow model and established cultivated, wild, and F7 hybrid rice populations under four levels of insect (Chilo suppressalis) pressure. Then, we measured the trait performance of the plants and estimated fitness to test the compensatory response of relatively high fitness compared to the level of insect damage. The performance of all plants varied with the insect pressure level; wild plants had higher insect-tolerance that was expressed as over- or equal-compensatory responses to insect damage, whereas crop and hybrids exhibited under-compensatory responses. The higher compensation resulted in a better performance of wild rice under insect pressure where transgenes conferring insect resistance had a somewhat beneficial effect. Remarkable hybrid vigour and the benefit effect of transgenes increased the fitness of hybrids together, but this joint effect was weakened by the compensation of wild plants. These results suggest that compensation to environmental stress may reduce the potential impacts of crop alleles on wild plants, thereby it is a mechanism maintaining the "wild " characteristics of wild populations under the scenario of continuous crop-wild gene flow.

AB Species responding differently to climate change form 'transient communities', communities with constantly changing species composition due to colonization and extinction events. Our goal is to disentangle the mechanisms of response to climate change for terrestrial species in these transient communities and explore the consequences for biodiversity conservation. We review spatial escape and local adaptation of species dealing with climate change from evolutionary and ecological perspectives. From these we derive species vulnerability and management options to mitigate effects of climate change. From the perspective of transient communities, conservation management should scale up static single species approaches and focus on community dynamics and species interdependency, while considering species vulnerability and their importance for the community. Spatially explicit and frequent monitoring is vital for assessing the change in communities and distribution of species. We review management options such as: increasing connectivity and landscape resilience, assisted colonization, and species protection priority in the context of transient communities.

This study explores the role of both the environment and disease in regulating the composition of microbial species in the soil and on amphibian hosts. We compared the microbial communities of Plethodon cinereus salamanders along a land-use gradient in the New York metropolitan area and paired these with associated soil cores. Additionally, we characterized the diversity of bacterial and fungal symbionts that putatively inhibit the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We predicted that variation in skin microbial community composition would correlate with changes seen in the soil which functions as the regional species pool. We found that salamanders and soil share many microbial taxa but that these two communities exhibit differences in the relative abundances of the bacterial phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria and the fungal phyla Ascomycota and genus Basidiobolus. Microbial community composition varies with changes in land-use associated factors creating site-specific compositions. By employing a quantitative, null-based assembly model, we identified that dispersal limitation, variable selection, and drift guide assembly of microbes onto their skin, creating high dissimilarity between individuals with likely consequences in disease preventative function.

AB Context The Dry Chaco spans more than 87 million hectares across Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. This unique forest system has experienced extensive loss and fragmentation due to land-use change, with different land-use histories in the three countries. This forest loss has altered landscape connectivity for the Dry Chaco's associated biota. Objectives We compared patterns of deforestation-induced fragmentation and concomitant changes in structural landscape connectivity between 2000 and 2019 in the three countries to identify consistent patterns that might facilitate biome-wide conservation. Methods We quantified forest cover in the Dry Chaco of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay for the years 2000 and 2019 at 30 m resolution. We analyzed structural connectivity at three scales. Then, we identified and visualized the most important stepping stones per country per year. Results Between 2000 and 2019, the overall extent of Dry Chaco forest cover decreased by 20.2% (9.5 million ha). All three counties experienced substantial reductions, with Paraguay undergoing the greatest loss and fragmentation relative to 2000. Most of the overall network metrics decreased from 2000 to 2019 for Paraguay and Bolivia, but Argentina experienced increased coalescence distance and average nodal connectance. Dispersal-level metrics showed clustering threshold distances between 1000 and 2000 m for each country in both years. Conclusions The large number of forest fragments and distances between them suggest that some mammals characteristic of the biome may be experiencing negative impacts from this fragmentation. Contemporary and future challenges of uncoordinated national conservation and management policies, land speculation, and increased human infrastructure will accelerate the rate of deforestation.

AB Arboreal mammals form a diverse group providing ecologically important functions such as predation, pollination and seed dispersal. However, their cryptic and elusive nature, and the heights at which they live, makes studying these species challenging. Consequently, our knowledge of rainforest mammals is heavily biased towards terrestrial species, limiting our understanding of overall community structure and the possible impacts of human-induced disturbance. We undertook the first in-depth appraisal of an arboreal mammal community in Southeast Asia, using camera-traps set in unlogged and logged tropical rainforest in Sabah, Borneo. Using paired canopy and terrestrial camera-traps at 50 locations (25 in unlogged forest, 25 in logged), we assessed the effectiveness of camera-trapping at characterising the arboreal versus terrestrial community, and tested the influence of strata and forest type on community structure and composition. The paired design detected 55 mammal species across 15,817 camera-trap nights (CTNs), and additional canopy sampling in a subset of trees added a further two arboreal species to the inventory. In total, thirty species were detected exclusively by terrestrial camera-traps, eighteen exclusively by canopy camera-traps, and nine by units set at both heights, demonstrating significant differences between arboreal and terrestrial communities. This pattern was strongest in unlogged forest, reflecting greater structural diversity of this habitat, but held in logged forest as well. Species accumulation curves revealed that canopy camera-trapping significantly boosted species inventories compared to terrestrial-only sampling, and was particularly effective at detecting gliding mammals, rodents and primates. Canopy inventories took longer to reach an asymptote, suggesting that a greater sampling effort is required when deploying canopy camera-traps compared to those set on the ground. We demonstrate that arboreal mammals in Borneo's rainforest form a diverse and distinct community, and can be sampled effectively using canopy camera-traps. However, the additional costs incurred by sampling in the canopy can be substantial. We provide recommendations to maximise sampling effectiveness, while bringing down costs, to help encourage further study into one of the last frontiers of tropical forest research.

AB Mobile intertidal gastropods can employ behavioural thermoregulation to mitigate thermal stress, which may include retreating under boulders when emersed. However, little is known about how gastropod occupancy of under-boulder habitats is associated with any variations in substrate temperature that exist under boulders. Thermal imagery was used to measure the temperature of boulder lower surfaces and investigate how three snail species were associated at low tide with the maximum and average temperatures underneath grey siltstone and quartzite. Lower boulder surfaces had heterogeneous temperatures, with grey siltstone having temperature gradients and quartzite temperature showing mosaics. Temperature differences between the hottest and coolest gradient or mosaic locations were >5 degrees C; thus there was a range of temperatures that snails could interact with. All three snail species occupied cooler parts of temperature mosaics or gradients, avoiding the hottest areas. Stronger associations were detected on the hotter grey siltstone and for the more thermally sensitive Nerita atramentosa and Diloma concameratum. Even though snails were associated with cooler areas, some individuals were still exposed to extreme substratum heat (>50 degrees C). These results suggest that gastropod thermoregulatory behaviour is far more complex than simply retreating underneath boulders at low tide, as there is also a range of under-boulder temperatures that they interact with. Untangling interactions between intertidal gastropods and heterogenous substrate temperatures is important given rocky seashores already represent a thermally-variable and potentially-stressful habitat, which may be exacerbated further given predictions of warming temperatures associated with climate change.

AB Microplastics (MPs) have been identified in diverse marine invertebrates; however, there are few studies on lim-pets. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the presence of MPs in Nacella magellanica among sites of the Beagle Channel with different degree of anthropogenic influence. Intertidal limpets were sampled in three sites: Ushuaia Bay (UB) (inside Ushuaia city), a site with high anthropogenic influence owing to population growth, and fisheries, industrial and port activities; Ensenada Zaratiegui (EZ) and Playa Larga (PL) (west and east of Ushuaia city, respectively), both sites with a certain degree of environmental protection and low anthro-pogenic influence. MPs were isolated from the whole soft tissue of individuals by oxidative digestions with H2O2 (30%; 1:10 w/v). MPs occurrence was 100% in organisms from UB and EZ, whereas 90% in PL. Limpets from UB showed 10 +/- 6.69 MPs/ind and 2.22 +/- 0.78 MPs/g ww, while in PL and EZ there were 2.90 +/- 2.02 MPs/ind and 0.96 +/- 0.94 MPs/g ww; and 5.60 +/- 2.59 MPs/ind and 2.41 +/- 1.47 MPs/g ww, respectively. Fibres were the most abundant MPs type, followed by fragments and films. Fibres and films were identified as semi-synthetic cellulose and, although the polymer matrix of fragments was masked by copper phthalocyanine, one of them could be identified as polystyrene. As expected, the highest abundance of MPs was found in UB. However, a lower abundance of particles was detected in PL (downstream of UB) than in EZ (upstream of UB). This could be due to the influence of both the main current of the Beagle Channel and fluvial discharges, reducing the buoyancy of MPs. More studies are needed to understand the contribution of regional and local features to the accumula-tion of MPs in these environments and their interaction with the biota. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB ( )The ecological niche is dynamic, since the position and width of the niche can vary at different spatial and temporal scales. We examined the trophic ecology of southeast Pacific humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae in the Magellan Strait feeding area in 2011, 2012 and 2017, analyzing changes in diet and the width of the isotopic niche in relation to ontogeny and seasonality. The isotopic composition of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in whale skin and in putative prey species was analyzed. Bayesian mixing models were used to determine the diet, and the isotopic niche was estimated using the standard ellipse area. Differences were found between the diets of juveniles and adults; Fuegian sprat Sprattus fuegensis was consumed mostly by adult individuals. We found no differences in the diet or in the isotopic niche of humpback whales throughout the feeding season in all years. This study suggests that the differences in diet between age classes are influenced by the ability to find and capture prey, whereas seasonality does not influence the niche width of humpback whales in the Magellan Strait. Our results suggested that fluctuations in the abundance of prey populations could influence in the trophic niche dynamics of humpback whales in the Magellan Strait. In particular, a reduction in the availability of Fuegian sprat would mainly affect adult individuals, leading to a dietary switch and/or to an expansion of their feeding area.

AB Mature neotropical lowland forests have relatively lower symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) rates compared with secondary forests. Canopy gap formation may create transient SNF hotspots in mature forests that increase overall SNF rates in these ecosystems, as canopy gaps are pervasive across the landscape and increasing in frequency. However, what environmental conditions are driving SNF upregulation in canopy gaps is unknown. In a field experiment to test these potential environmental controls on SNF, we grew 540 neotropical nitrogen-fixing legume seedlings (Pentaclethra macroloba, Zygia longifolia, and Stryphnodendron microstachyum) under manipulated light and soil nitrogen availability in canopy gaps and intact forests at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Seedling biomass, nodule biomass, and SNF (g N seedling(-1) h(-1)) were 4-, 17- and 42-fold higher, respectively, in canopy gaps than in the intact forest. Nitrogen additions decreased SNF, but light had a stronger positive effect. Upregulation of SNF in canopy gaps was driven by increased plant growth and not a disproportionate increased SNF allocation. These data provide evidence that canopy gap SNF hotspots are driven, in part, by light availability, demonstrating a potential driver of SNF spatial heterogeneity. This further suggests that canopy gap dynamics are important for understanding the biogeochemistry of neotropical forests.

AB Flowering plants in tropical rainforests rely heavily on pollen vectors for successful reproduction. Research into pollination systems in tropical rainforests is dominated by canopy species, while subcanopy plant-pollinator interactions remain under-represented. The microclimate beneath the rainforest canopy is characterized by low light levels and is markedly different from the canopy environment that receives more light energy. We studied the floral attractants and floral visitors of a dioecious, subcanopy tree, Fontainea picrosperma (Euphorbiaceae), in the Wet Tropics bioregion of northern Queensland, Australia. We found that wind pollination is rare and male and female flowers do not produce nectar. Female flowers are likely pollinated due to their perceptual similarity to pollen-offering male flowers. Female flowers had the same scent profile as male flowers, and floral scent was an important floral attractant that acted to regulate pollinator behavior. The two most abundant scent compounds present in the floral bouquet were benzyl alcohol and 4-oxoisophorone. These compounds are ubiquitous in nature and are known to attract a wide variety of insects. Both day-time and night-time pollinators contributed to successful pollen deposition on the stigma, and diurnal flower visitors were identified from several orders of insects including beetles, flies, predatory wasps, and thrips. Fontainea picrosperma is therefore likely to be pollinated by a diverse array of small insects. Synthesis. Our data indicate that F. picrosperma has a generalist, entomophilous pollination syndrome. The rainforest subcanopy is a distinctive environment characterized by low light levels, low or turbulent wind speeds, and relatively high humidity. Female flowers of F. picrosperma exhibit cost-saving strategies by not producing nectar and mimicking the smell of reward-offering male flowers. Insects opportunistically forage on or inhabit flowers, and pollination occurs from a pool of small insects with low energy requirements that are found beneath the rainforest canopy.

AB Insect herbivory is one of the major drivers of seedling mortality in the tropics and influences plant abundances and community composition. Anthropogenic disturbance can alter patterns of insect herbivory with potential consequences on plant communities in restored forests. We planted seedlings of early- and later-stage successional tree species in 13-15-year-old restored and remnant tropical forests. We then either excluded insect herbivores or left seedlings exposed to examine how insect herbivory-affected seedling mortality. Early-successional seedlings experienced similar decreases in mortality when insect herbivores were excluded from both restored and remnant forest sites, but this effect was smaller and driven by only a few species in restored forests. Later-successional seedlings experienced a stronger decrease in mortality between open and insect-excluded treatments in remnant than restored sites. Our results suggest that herbivory-driven seedling mortality is lower in restored forests, particularly for later-successional seedlings. Results are encouraging from a restoration perspective because recruitment of later-successional seedlings is a key component of ecosystem recovery. However, if reductions in seedling mortality continue over the long term, this may affect tree community composition as succession progresses.

AB We explored the structure of plant assemblages that settles around the anthills of a guild of Hymenoptera Formicidae (Messor wasmanni Krausse 1910, Tapinoma nigerrimum Nylander 1856 and Aphaenogaster spinosa Emery 1878), observable in urban grasslands dominated by Dasypyrum villosum (Rome, Central Italy). Since it is known that ants act as a disturbing factor on plant assemblages of grasslands, our hypothesis was that vegetation structures suffer from some stressors that affect, in this plant association, the dominant plant structure. We compared the plant assemblages observed in the plots of the anthills with the control grassland assemblages using a diversity/dominance diagram. We recorded 63 plant taxa. The average number of plant species was found to be significantly lower in anthill plots than in control grassland plots. In anthill plots, dominant plant species (Polygonum romanum, Poa trivialis Vulpia myuros, Aira elegantissima and Vulpia ligustica) have been found to be different from control grassland plots (Convolvolus arvensis, Dasypyrum villosum, Poa trivialis and Sheradia arvensis). Anthill plant assemblages were found to be significantly different (One-way PERMANOVA) and poorer in terms of species richness, less diversified, and with a reduced species turnover than control grassland plots. Whittaker plot analysis seems to show that the plant assemblages of the control, with greater evenness, emphasize a stressed condition in anthill plant assemblages. Non-metric multidimensional scaling shows a set of species strictly linked to anthills. Our data seem to confirm the role of ants as a stressor in the plant assemblage structures of Mediterranean urban grasslands. However, our results also show that the peculiar ant nest conditions may favor plant species less represented in the Dasypyretum grasslands (i.e. Polygonum romanum) or even absent in this plant assemblage (i.e. Aira elegantissima, Cynodon dactylon and Poa annua), thus increasing the overall local plant diversity.

   EMISSIONS
AB African forests suffer from severe fragmentation that further causes forest degradation near forest edges. The impact of fires used for slash-and-burn on forest edge effects remains unclear. Here, using high-resolution satellite-based forest-cover and biomass datasets, we find that edge effects extend a median distance and an interquartile range of 0.11(-0.04)(+0.06) km and 0.15(-0.05)(+0.09) km into moist and dry forests, and biomass within the forest edge zones has a carbon deficit of 4.1 PgC. Fires occurred in 52% of the forest edges and increased the carbon deficit by 5.5(-2.9)(+4.3) MgC ha(-1), compared with non-fire edges, through both the direct impact of fires intruding into forests and the indirect impact of changes in the local atmospheric circulations increasing canopy dryness. If small-scale slash-and-burn practices continue, increased fragmentation during 2010-2100 will result in a carbon loss from edge effects of 0.54-4.6 PgC. Fragmentation-caused forest degradation could be avoided by implementing dedicated forest protection policies supported by satellite monitoring of forest edges.

AB Biodiversity across the Neotropics is a result of selective forces along a myriad of ecosystems. The Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome embodies 321 mammal species; only a small parcel of the species is considered piscivore. The Atlantic Forest biota is threatened by multiple factors, from habitat loss to climate changes. We aimed to understand the current distribution of the six extant piscivore mammals and the distribution of this trophic guild, predicting their distribution under climate change across the Atlantic Forest and identifying areas for the trophic guild conservation prioritizations. We used data on species occurrence based on the GBIF database and literature, and climatic data from WorldClim. We perform Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) to derive the piscivores distribution and the presence of this trophic guild. Our results reveal that piscivores distribution is already restricted in the present (average 8.84%), even the presence of this trophic guild (6.42%). Trophic guild distribution in the short-term under climate change may represent less than 6.5% across the Atlantic Forest, will be contracting by -30.0%. We conclude that combinations of factors inductors of biodiversity loss will be empowered by climate changes, leading to more restricted species distribution. SDM is fundamental to understand the species distribution to prioritize conservation efforts from local to pan-continental scales, being paramount to slow down the consequences of climate change.

AB With the aim to explore how plants acclimate to elevation changes in the understudied (sub)alpine tropics we tested two hypotheses along a 1000-m elevation gradient in Mexico: (H1) due to a severe increase in abiotic constraints at higher elevations, the functional traits of the plant species will converge toward more resource conservation, and (H2) the specific growth forms and biogeographic origins present in the (sub)alpine tropics may influence the interspecific trait variation along the gradient. We measured five aboveground functional traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry-matter content (LDMC), leaf thickness, leaf area and plant height, of 11 species representing four growth forms: rosette, tussock grass, shrub and tree the soil microclimate. Microclimatic data revealed a steep decrease in soil water content at higher elevations. Across all species and all individuals, SLA, plant height and leaf area decreased with elevation, whereas LDMC and leaf thickness increased, all of which revealing adjustments towards resource conservation in line with H1. Consistently with H2, the functional traits of the growth forms that were characteristic of tropical alpine regions (tussock grasses and erect shrubs) were less sensitive to changes in elevation compared to more generalist growth forms such as forbs. In addition, within the growth form "rosette" the functional traits of species of tropical biogeographic origin changed with elevation, whereas those of Holarctic origin did not. Our data indicate a convergence of plant traits toward improved resource conservation at higher elevations, which may be influenced partially by the growth form and the biogeographical origin of plant species.

AB Deep-water access is arguably the most effective, but under-studied, mechanism that plants employ to survive during drought. Vulnerability to embolism and hydraulic safety margins can predict mortality risk at given levels of dehydration, but deep-water access may delay plant dehydration. Here, we tested the role of deep-water access in enabling survival within a diverse tropical forest community in Panama using a novel data-model approach.
   We inversely estimated the effective rooting depth (ERD, as the average depth of water extraction), for 29 canopy species by linking diameter growth dynamics (1990-2015) to vapor pressure deficit, water potentials in the whole-soil column, and leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves. We validated ERD estimates against existing isotopic data of potential water-access depths.
   Across species, deeper ERD was associated with higher maximum stem hydraulic conductivity, greater vulnerability to xylem embolism, narrower safety margins, and lower mortality rates during extreme droughts over 35 years (1981-2015) among evergreen species. Species exposure to water stress declined with deeper ERD indicating that trees compensate for water stress-related mortality risk through deep-water access.
   The role of deep-water access in mitigating mortality of hydraulically-vulnerable trees has important implications for our predictive understanding of forest dynamics under current and future climates.

AB Humiria balsamifera is an infraspecific complex of high phenotypic variation and widely distributed in northern South America. Leaf traits are traditionally considered the most relevant taxonomic characters for varietal level delimitation in the group. However, substantial phenotypic overlap among vegetative characters complicates taxonomic diagnoses in this complex. The objective of this study was to quantify and analyze phenotypic variation among individuals of the complex at a continental scale using uni-and multivariable analyses to assess whether morphometric analyses detect discontinuities. Secondarily, these quantitative data were used to test whether phenotypic similarity was related to geographic distance. Twenty-five quantitative and 27 qualitative character traits did not overtly reveal a topology corresponding to traditional varietal classification, nor to geographic structure. However, petiole length alone revealed a definitive separation of H. balsamifera var. guianensis (together with another recognized species Humiria wurdackii, and variety H. balsamifera var. laurina) from the rest of the taxa. Our results highlight substantial morphological overlap among vegetative and reproductive characters including those used in identification keys, and no morphological discontinuities suitable for clearly separating taxa within the complex were encountered demonstrating a future need to integrate multiple sources of information, including molecular data, to resolve this complex.

AB Brachyurans played important ecological and evolutionary roles in the marine benthic communities of the past and were the components of the Mesozoic Decapod Revolution. Therefore, the search for their fossil remains is fundamental to understanding the composition, diversity, and ecological structure of Mesozoic marine benthic communities. Brachyuran remains are uncommon in the decapod record of the Aptian Romualdo Formation in the Araripe Basin. In this context, we recorded and described new occurrences of Exucarcinus gonzagai, preserved in shales from the middle portion of the Romualdo Formation, near the city of Jardim in the State of Cear ' a. Comparisons between these new specimens and former specimens from the Exu locality, State of Pernambuco, including the type material, allowed us to recognize, for the first time, three distinct ontogenetic stages (i.e., informally referred as I, II, and III). Throughout ontogenetic development, the carapace becomes wider and spinier. Stage III carapaces exhibit a large number of grooves, although the grooves are poorly impressed, and some are pitted. Growth also resulted in better-developed orbital lobes and fissures. In addition, the preservation of some anatomical structures is highly influenced by the carapace fossilization process (i.e., molds or cuticles), including the tubercles, grooves, and spines. Unfortunately, those characters that can vary according to onto genetic development or fossilization are commonly used in the systematic and phylogenetic decisions of the group. Hence, it is advisable to consider these changes whenever possible to avoid the erection of taphotaxons and mistaken phylogenetic decisions.

AB Questions Linking tree growth dynamics to functional traits and neighborhood conditions that are measured at a single time point gives limited insights into the direction of forest structural and functional change. We used trait and neighborhood data collected at different time points for each individual tree of 15 Ficus species to test how trait (temporal trait plasticity) and neighborhood crowding change over time, and to test how their temporal change affects individual growth rate. We asked the following questions: (i) how do traits, neighborhood crowding, and growth of individual trees change over time; (ii) are functional traits and neighborhood crowding temporally consistent in their association with growth rate of individuals; and (iii) do temporal trait plasticity and changes in neighborhood crowding better predict the relative growth rate of individuals compared to using only a single snapshot of traits and neighborhood crowding? Location Xishuangbanna Tropical Seasonal Rainforest, southwest China. Methods We collected traits (specific leaf area [SLA], leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content [LDMC], leaf chlorophyll, leaf thickness, and leaf succulence) at two time points (2010 and 2017) for 472 individuals of 15 Ficus species. We used linear mixed-effect models to test the effect of temporal trait plasticity and neighborhood crowding on the relative growth rate of individuals. Results We found that the temporal change in trait values predicts the growth rate of individuals better compared to static trait values in the initial and final censuses. We found significant temporal changes in individual traits suggesting a shift in ecological strategies from being acquisitive to conservative. A difference in neighborhood crowding between the two census years was also observed, indicating that the neighborhood effect on growth might also change over time. Conclusions Our results in general highlight the need to consider the temporal dimension of traits and biotic interactions, as our results suggest that growth-trait relationships may vary between time points, allowing us to understand the demographic response of species to temporal environmental change through functional traits.

AB Seed hoarding by rodents plays a significant role in shaping mutualistic or predatory interactions between tree and rodent species in forest ecosystems. However, it is still challenging to identify the seed-rodent interaction at individual level so as to reveal the differences in mutualistic or predatory interactions between seeds and rodents due to lack of efficient methods of tracking seed hoarding behaviour and seed fate. Here, by using the double-duplex passive integrated transponder tagging technique, we investigated seed hoarding behaviour of two rodent species (Niviventer confucianus with larger body size; Apodemus draco with smaller body size) on seeds of two tree species (Quercus variabilis with larger seeds, thicker seed coat, higher tannin and starch contents; Camellia oleifera with smaller seeds, thinner seed coat, and lower tannin but higher fat contents) in a subtropical forest of China. We found N. confucianus preferably consumed and scatterhoarded seeds of Q. variabilis. In contrast, A. draco preferably consumed and scatterhoarded seeds of C. oleifera. Our study showed significant difference in mutualistic or predatory interactions between trees and rodent species, which is likely to be associated with the functional traits of seeds and rodents. Our results suggest that the double-duplex passive integrated transponder tagging technique is useful in quantifying mutualistic or predatory interactions between multiple tree and rodent species.

AB Among nectarivorous birds, the highest niche partitioning occurs between hummingbirds and plants. Although hummingbirds tend to visit morphologically well-matched resources, as ornithophilous species, they can also visit flowers with other traits. Here, we investigated whether the niche partitioning in hummingbird-plant interactions is also observed with ornithophilous species only. We also explored if hummingbird traits predicted resources use. We recorded a plant-ornithophilous species network in a semi-deciduous forest in Brazil. We quantified interaction partitioning through network connectance, complementary specialisation, and modularity. The influence of hummingbirds' traits into their visits was investigated through methods of functional ecology and ecological networks. We recorded 948 interactions between nine hummingbirds and seven ornithophilous plants. We detected similar patterns of niche partitioning between hummingbirds and ornithophilous plants in comparison to networks considering the entire plant community. However, hummingbird species with the most specialised interactions are different from those when the whole system is evaluated. Therefore, we cannot downscale the patterns from one scale to the other. The pattern of interaction with ornithophilous plants was not related to hummingbirds' traits. Therefore, the coexistence of species with shared traits might be occurring through facilitative and competitive processes, leading to trait mismatching and maintaining niche partitioning among ornithophilous plants.

AB One of the oldest and most persistent questions in ecology and evolution is whether natural communities tend to evolve toward saturation and maximal diversity. Robert MacArthur's classical theory of niche packing and the theory of adaptive radiations both imply that populations will diversify and fully partition any available niche space. However, the saturation of natural populations is still very much an open area of debate and investigation. Additionally, recent evolutionary theory suggests the existence of alternative evolutionary stable states (ESSs), which implies that some stable communities may not be fully saturated. Using models with classical Lotka-Volterra ecological dynamics and three formulations of evolutionary dynamics (a model using adaptive dynamics, an individual-based model, and a partial differential equation model), we show that following an adaptive radiation, communities can often get stuck in low diversity states when limited by mutations of small phenotypic effect. These low diversity metastable states can also be maintained by limited resources and finite population sizes. When small mutations and finite populations are considered together, it is clear that despite the presence of higher-diversity stable states, natural populations are likely not fully saturating their environment and leaving potential niche space unfilled. Additionally, within-species variation can further reduce community diversity from levels predicted by models that assume species-level homogeneity.
   Author summary Understanding if and when communities evolve to saturate their local environments is imperative to our understanding of natural populations. Using computer simulations of classical evolutionary models, we study whether adaptive radiations tend to lead toward saturated communities, in which no new species can invade or remain trapped in alternative, lower diversity stable states. We show that with asymmetric competition and small effect mutations, evolutionary Red Queen dynamics can trap communities in low diversity metastable states. Moreover, limited resources not only reduces community population sizes, but also reduces community diversity, denying the formation of saturated communities and stabilizing low diversity, non-stationary evolutionary dynamics. Our results are directly relevant to the longstanding questions important to both ecological empiricists and theoreticians on the species packing and saturation of natural environments. Also, by showing the ease evolution can trap communities in low diversity metastable states, we demonstrate the potential harm in relying solely on ESSs to answer questions of biodiversity.

AB Whether cities are more or less diverse than surrounding environments, and the extent to which non-native species in cities impact regional species pools, remain two fundamental yet unanswered questions in urban ecology. Here we offer a unifying framework for understanding the mechanisms that generate biodiversity patterns across taxonomic groups and spatial scales in urban systems. One commonality between existing frameworks is the collective recognition that species co-occurrence locally is not simply a function of natural colonization and extinction processes. Instead, it is largely a consequence of human actions that are governed by a myriad of social processes occurring across groups, institutions, and stakeholders. Rather than challenging these frameworks, we expand upon them to explicitly consider how human and non-human mechanisms interact to control urban biodiversity and influence species composition over space and time. We present a comprehensive theory of the processes that drive biodiversity within cities, between cities and surrounding non-urbanized areas and across cities, using the general perspective of metacommunity ecology. Armed with this approach, we embrace the fact that humans substantially influence beta-diversity by creating a variety of different habitats in urban areas, and by influencing dispersal processes and rates, and suggest ways how these influences can be accommodated to existing metacommunity paradigms. Since patterns in urban biodiversity have been extensively described at the local or regional scale, we argue that the basic premises of the theory can be validated by studying the beta-diversity across spatial scales within and across urban areas. By explicitly integrating the myriad of processes that drive native and non-native urban species co-occurrence, the proposed theory not only helps reconcile contrasting views on whether urban ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots or biodiversity sinks, but also provides a mechanistic understanding to better predict when and why alternative biodiversity patterns might emerge.

AB The edge effect is one of the consequences of forest fragmentation and is one of the main drivers of alteration of ecological and ecosystem processes. Trophic guilds and species of bats have shown differential responses to this phenomenon. Our goal was to describe the change in bat species richness, abundance, evenness, and species composition of trophic guilds associated with a matrix-edge-forest interior gradient. Therefore, we conducted a bat sampling with 16 mist nets covering such gradient in four sub-andean forest fragments (10-50 ha). In total, we captured 566 individuals of 21 species of phyllostomid bats. Bat species richness and abundance were higher in the matrix and edge and were similar between fragments. Evenness showed the lowest values in the matrix and forest edge and was different between forest patches. Some shrub frugivorous bats were more abundant in the edge, and others were more abundant in two fragments. Species composition of canopy frugivorous bats was similar along the gradient but was significantly different between fragments. In contrast, the species composition of nectarivores was similar throughout the matrix-interior forest gradient and between patches. Our data suggest that bat responses at assemblage-level are affected by the disturbance gradient from the matrix to forest interior, even at short distances form fragment borders, and are dependent on the trophic guild.

AB The role of private reserves is often underestimated due to their small size and discontinuous distribution. To examine the relevance of small reserves in mammal conservation, with this paper we addressed three objectives: 1) to identify patterns of size, altitude, and distribution of the Colombian private reserves belonging to the Protected Areas National System (SINAP), 2) to examine, as a case study, mammal richness and geographical patterns in twelve reserves, and 3) to identify the contribution of small reserves to Colombian mammal's conservation. To address the first objective, we analyzed size, altitude, and distribution of the SINAP reserves sorted by biogeographic provinces. For the other two objectives, we evaluated the relationship between mammal richness and area, altitude, and connectivity of the twelve small reserves. We found that most of the SINAP reserves are less than 100 ha in size, that they were distributed between 1500 and 2500 m, and that they were in the North Andean province. Together, the twelve reserves harbor 224 species of eleven mammalian orders, with a mean richness of 42.7 species (19 bats, and 23.7 non-volant mammals). We found a positive relationship between both total mammal richness and non-volant mammal richness with reserve area and between non-volant mammal richness and altitude. We also identify those small reserves conserve mainly small- sized species although they might serve as a refuge for medium and large species as well. We highlight those small reserves play a significant role in Colombian mammal's conservation.

Focusing on the three botanical gardens of Lisbon (i.e., Botanical Garden of Ajuda-JBA, Lisbon Botanical Garden-JBL, and Tropical Botanical Garden-JBT), this study aims to reveal their natural heritage and to understand the historical motivations for their creation. Our results showed that these gardens contain a total of 2551 tree specimens, corresponding to 462 taxa, within 80 plant families. Of these, 85 taxa are found in the three gardens, and more than half of the taxa are hosted in JBL (334 taxa), whereas 230 and 201 taxa were recorded in JBT and JBA, respectively. The motivations for the creation of each garden are reflected in the different geographic origins of the trees they host in their living collections. The Palearctic species are dominant in JBA and JBL, and Tropical trees prevail in JBT. With more than 250 years of history, these gardens hold an invaluable natural and historical heritage, with their living collections providing valuable sources of information for the conservation of threatened plant species, at local and global scales.

AB We found the euryhaline microalga, Tetraselmis jejuensis sp. nov., which was adapted to supralittoral tide pools with salinities varying from 0.3-3.1%. Fifteen strains of T. jejuensis were isolated from Daejeong (DJ) and Yongduam (YO), and clonal cultures were established in the laboratory. Morphological characterization revealed that the cells have a compressed shape, four flagella emerging from a depression near the apex in two opposite pairs, a cup-shaped chloroplast containing one pyrenoid surrounded by starch, and eyespot regions not located near the flagellar base. T. jejuensis cells showed distinct characteristics compared to other Tetraselmis species. First, a regular subunit pattern with honeycomb-like structures was predominantly displayed on the surface in the middle of the cell body. Second, the pyrenoid was invaded by both cytoplasmic channels comprising electron-dense material separated from the cytoplasm, and two branches of small cytoplasmic channels (canaliculi) in various directions, which characterize the subgenus Tetrathele. Eyespot regions containing a large number of osmiophilic globules, packed closely together and arranged in subcircular close packing of diverse sizes, were dispersed throughout the chloroplast. In the phylogenetic analysis of small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences, the 15 strains isolated from DJ and YO separated a newly branched clade in the Chlorodendrophyceae at the base of a clade comprising the T. carteriiformi/subcordiformis clade, T. chuii/suecica clade, and T. striata/convolutae clade. The strains in the diverging clade were considered to belong to the same species. The SSU rDNA sequences of the DJ and YO strains showed a maximum difference of 1.53% and 1.19% compared to Tetraselmis suecica (MK541745), the closest species of the family based on the phylogenetic analysis, respectively. Based on morphological, molecular, and physiological features, we suggest a new species in the genus Tetraselmis named Tetraselmis jejuensis, with the species name "jejuensis" referring to the collection site, Jeju Island, Korea.

AB Food production is the basis for ensuring human survival. Ecological compensation for arable land is important to ensure the sustainable use of arable land and food production. However, how is it possible to set the standard of ecological compensation and how to achieve it scientifically? In this paper, we take China as the study area and link the ecological compensation of arable land with the production, circulation and consumption of three staple foods. The amount of food is converted into the area of arable land needed to produce that food. After calculating the value of ecosystem services that support food production on arable land, the ecological compensation standard is obtained, and the realization mode between regions is constructed. The results show that: (1) the flow of staple foods in China is mainly from north to south and the value of arable land support services provided by northern provinces is greater than that of southern provinces; (2) the province that needs to pay the most ecological compensation for cultivated land is Guangdong Province, with an amount of yen 16.082 billion RMB, and the province that receives the most compensation is Heilongjiang Province, with an amount of yen 21.547 billion RMB; (3) in order to coordinate the collection and distribution of ecological compensation in each province, it is necessary to establish an ecological compensation fund for arable land in the central government. Protecting the ecological status of arable land and ensuring sustainable food production is in the overall interest of the country.

AB Spiders have been increasingly used as environmental and ecological indicators in conservation and ecosystem management. In the Neotropics, there is a shortage of information regarding spiders' taxonomies and ecological responses to anthropogenic disturbances. To unravel these hitches, we tested the possibility of using high-level diversity and high-level functionality indicators to evaluate spider assemblages' sensitivity to landscape changes. This approach, if proven informative, might overcome the relevant limitations of taxonomic derived indexes, which are considered time-consuming, cost-demanding and dependent on the (few) expert taxonomists' availability. Our results highlight the pertinence of both indicators' responses to the structural changes induced by increasing anthropogenic disturbance, and are associated with reductions in ecosystem complexity, microclimates, and microhabitats. Overall, both indicators were sensitive to structural changes induced by anthropogenic disturbance and should be considered a useful resource for assessing the extent of ecosystems' disruptions in the Neotropics, and also to guide managers in landscapes' restoration.

AB Data collection and estimation of variables that describe the structure of tropical forests, diversity, and richness of tree species are challenging tasks. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a powerful technique due to its ability to penetrate small openings and cracks in the forest canopy, enabling the collection of structural information in complex forests. Our objective was to identify the most significant LiDAR metrics and machine learning techniques to estimate the stand and diversity variables in a disturbed heterogeneous tropical forest. Data were collected in a remnant of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with different successional stages. LiDAR metrics were used in three types of transformation: (i) raw data (untransformed), (ii) correlation analysis, and (iii) principal component analysis (PCA). These transformations were tested with four machine learning techniques: (i) artificial neural network (ANN), ordinary least squares (OLS), random forests (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with different configurations resulting in 27 combinations. The best technique was determined based on the lowest RMSE (%) and corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), and bias (%) values close to zero. The output forest variables were mean diameter at breast height (MDBH), quadratic mean diameter (QMD), basal area (BA), density (DEN), number of tree species (NTS), as well as Shannon-Waver (H') and Simpson's diversity indices (D). The best input data were the new variables obtained from the PCA, and the best modeling method was ANN with two hidden layers for the variables MDBH, QMD, BA, and DEN while for NTS, H'and D, the ANN with three hidden layers were the best methods. For MDBH, QMD, H'and D, the RMSE was 5.2-10% with a bias between -1.7% and 3.6%. The BA, DEN, and NTS were the most difficult variables to estimate, due to their complexity in tropical forests; the RMSE was 16.2-27.6% and the bias between -12.4% and -0.24%. The results showed that it is possible to estimate the stand and diversity variables in heterogeneous forests with LiDAR data.

   Methods: We obtained N and P reabsorption efficiency, as well as stoichiometric proportions for C:N y N:P from green and senescent leaves to compare species, functional types and sites.
   Results: N and P reabsorption efficiency decreased with aridity and C:N and C:P stoichiometry of senescent leaves, as well as N:P for legumes.
   Conclusions: Reabsorption efficiency does not suggest a resource conservation strategy, however different functional types allowed us to differentiate ecological and stoichiometric strategies, in particular legumes, that help enhance their role in the biogeochemistry of Sonoran and Mexican and lands.

AB Using 19 years of remotely sensed Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), we examined the effects of climatic variability on terrestrial vegetation of six protected areas along southwestern South America, from the semiarid edge of the Atacama desert to southern Patagonia (30 degrees S-51 degrees S). The relationship between satellite phenology and climate indices, namely MEI (Multivariate ENSO Index), PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and SAM (Southern Annular Mode) were established using statistical analyses for non-stationary patterns. The annual mode of phenological activity fluctuated in strength through time from the semiarid region to the border of southern Patagonia. Concomitantly, enhanced synchrony between EVI and climatic oscillations appeared over interannual cycles. Cross correlations revealed that variability in MEI was the lead predictor of EVI fluctuations over scales shorter than 4 months at lower latitudes and for the most poleward study site. The PDO was correlated with EVI over lags longer than 4 months at low latitude sites, while the SAM showed relationships with EVI only for sites located around 40 degrees S. Our results indicate that the long-term phenological variability of the vegetation within protected areas along southwestern South America is controlled by processes linked to climate indices and that their influence varies latitudinally. Further studies over longer time scales will be needed to improve our understanding the impacts of climate change on vegetation condition and its effect over phenological variability.

AB It is generally well-explored that overstorey stratum regulates understorey stratum through the dominant role over the available resources in forests. However, the relationships amongst topography, soil nutrients, species diversity, tree-size dimension inequality and aboveground carbon (AGC) stock across forest strata remain debated in forest ecosystems. Here, we assumed that soil nutrients, species diversity and tree-size dimension inequality promote AGC stock in overstorey stratum, which in turn regulate AGC stock in understorey stratum in natural temperate forests. To do so, using several structural equation models (SEMs) on the data from 104 temperate forest plots in Northern Iran, we assessed the effects of tree-size dimension inequality as well as the individual effects of either inequality in tree diameter, height, basal area, crown volume, or crown area, species diversity, soil nutrients and topographic factors on AGC in each forest stratum and at whole-community level as well as the effects of overstorey on understorey (i.e., joint SEMs). Results show that AGC stock in overstorey stratum was mainly determined by tree-size dimension inequality rather than by species diversity on nutrientrich soils but controlled by topographic factors related to light availability. In understorey stratum, only basal area inequality was the strong driver of AGC stock, but overstorey overruled the effects of understorey drivers on understorey AGC stock. Specifically, overstorey tree-size dimension inequality increased but AGC stock decreased the AGC stock of understorey. The observed mechanism and effects at overstorey stratum were nearly similar to whole-community level. This study shows that overstorey stratum regulates understorey through dominant occupancy on the light availability and soil nutrients. We suggest that integrative modeling of overstorey and understorey strata based on tree height, diameter and crown inequality may better enhance our understanding and extend the existing debate based on multiple drivers of forest functioning, which may help to provide specific guidelines for forest management.

   DIET; AVAILABILITY; DETERMINANTS; DEPREDATION; VALUATION
AB Apex predators are threatened globally, and their local extinctions are often driven by failures in sustaining prey acquisition under contexts of severe prey scarcity. The harpy eagle Harpia harpyja is Earth's largest eagle and the apex aerial predator of Amazonian forests, but no previous study has examined the impact of forest loss on their feeding ecology. We monitored 16 active harpy eagle nests embedded within landscapes that had experienced 0 to 85% of forest loss, and identified 306 captured prey items. Harpy eagles could not switch to open-habitat prey in deforested habitats, and retained a diet based on canopy vertebrates even in deforested landscapes. Feeding rates decreased with forest loss, with three fledged individuals dying of starvation in landscapes that succumbed to 50-70% deforestation. Because landscapes deforested by>70% supported no nests, and eaglets could not be provisioned to independence within landscapes>50% forest loss, we established a 50% forest cover threshold for the reproductive viability of harpy eagle pairs. Our scaling-up estimate indicates that 35% of the entire 428,800-km(2) Amazonian 'Arc of Deforestation' study region cannot support breeding harpy eagle populations. Our results suggest that restoring harpy eagle population viability within highly fragmented forest landscapes critically depends on decisive forest conservation action.

AB Paramos are exceptionally species-rich tropical alpine ecosystems that provide several important ecosystem services, including carbon storage and water provision. The responses of paramo plant species to climatic change are largely unknown, but classifying species by functional type and ecological strategy can help reduce complexity for modeling and conservation efforts. We measured 22 traits in 42 plant species with various growth forms in the Colombian Andes. We classified plant ecological strategies using CSR (C: competitor, S: stress tolerator, and R: ruderal) analysis and identified plant functional types (PFTs) using hierarchical clustering of principal components. Additionally, we calculated the functional originality of each species to identify species with unique trait combinations. We identified a high degree of convergence among traits and strategies, with most species characterized by the S and SC strategies. Considering the full set of traits, only three PFTs were identified: one composed of forbs and shrubs with tender leaves (PFT1), another composed only of species with rosettes form (PFT2), and a third composed of shrubs with tough leaves (PFT3). Values of functional originality were generally low, suggesting high redundancy in plant traits. PFT2 species, mostly rosettes, exhibited the highest functional originality of all the groups. Our results imply the existence of a limited set of ecophysiological strategies in the paramos, likely driven by the extremely stressful conditions in these systems. This functional redundancy may indicate heightened vulnerability to environmental changes; however, the presence of multiple species with shared functional traits could provide some resilience to disturbance. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB Forests have expanded across Europe over the last centuries as a consequence of farmland (agricultural and pasture) abandonment. Agricultural practices usually increase soil fertility and reduce the diversity and abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, essential mutualists of many woody species in temperate and Mediterranean forests. The recovery of this biotic interaction after the cessation of human activities is, thus, crucial for the re-establishment of functional forest ecosystems. Here we addressed the legacies of past land use and the recovery of the mutualism between ECM fungi and Fagus sylvatica trees in recent beech forests (<50 years) in Northeast Spain. Soil and root samples were collected in six long-established and eight recent beech forests to analyse soil abiotic properties and the ECM fungi associated with beech roots (Illumina DNA metabarcoding of ECM tips). Up to 609 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of ECM fungi were identified, with 220 ASVs found in both forest types. Recent forests had a significantly lower soil organic matter and phosphorus content, which had a significant effect on the community structure of ECM fungi in beech roots. Moreover, beech trees in recent forests interacted with less fungal taxa but had a higher relative abundance of Ascomycota. Tarzetta spp. (Ascomycota, Pezizales) and Lactarius blennius (Basidiomycota, Russulales) emerge as the particular taxa associated with recent and long-established forests respectively. More specialized mutualistic networks with a lower species normalized degree were found in recent forests, which might result in a lower quality and resilience of the ECM mutualism. Synthesis. Land-use history modulated the mycorrhizal symbiosis in regenerating beech forests through changes in soil organic matter and nitrogen, which were the main drivers of the differences in fungal community composition and functional types associated with beech trees in recent forests.

AB Plant-seed disperser interactions are critical for maintaining tropical plant diversity. However, these interactions are altered by habitat fragmentation, a pervasive threat to the tropics globally. We compared vegetation structure, richness and composition of plant-avian seed disperser interactions across two forest fragments (area: similar to 25 km(2)), and one contiguous forest site in the last remaining lowland tropical forests in north-east India. We used network-level indices (nestedness, generality, and vulnerability) and species-level indices (degree and species strength) to identify key plant and bird groups across the three sites. We found that the three sites varied in habitat structure and were more similar in the composition of avian seed dispersers than plants. The low similarity in plant-seed disperser interactions between the three sites was likely influenced by low similarity in fruiting plants. The fragmented sites exhibited fewer pairwise interactions and were characterized by a higher representation of small-seeded plants, climbers, and open-forest birds. Small-bodied birds (bulbuls and barbets) played a central role in all the seed dispersal networks, while large-bodied birds (hornbills) performed persistent interactions with large-seeded plants at all sites. This is one of the first studies from the Asian tropics to investigate the differences in the plant-avian seed disperser communities between forest fragments and contiguous forest. Our findings highlight the conservation value of fragments given their potential to hold a distinct set of plant-seed disperser interactions, thereby maintaining functional diversity in fragmented tropical landscapes. Abstract in Hindi is available with online material.

AB An increase in active fire data in the Amazon puts the entire international community on alert, as they may result in fires and deforestation. Thus, this study aims to present the dynamics of active fire data and their relationship with the fires in 16 Regularized Indigenous Lands (RILs) located entirely in the state of Rondonia, in the southern amazon. The entire historical series of active fire data (from 1998 to 2020) were obtained to achieve the objectives, and nine Landsat-OLI scenes from September 2020 were processed. The active fire data dynamics revealed that the correlation coefficient between the total number of active fire data in the immediate surroundings (10 km) and the number of active fire data within the analyzed indigenous land areas was higher than 0.7. This means that the variation in the number of fire outbreaks within indigenous lands can be explained by the number of outbreaks occurring outside them. Image processing revealed 11 classes of land use and land cover with an overall accuracy of 92%. Based on the mapping of land use and cover for the nine Landsat scenes, it is possible to verify that the burnt area totaled 3,943.50 km(2). Besides, 953.90 km(2) (24.19%) were located entirely within the indigenous lands, mainly on the Massaco and Urn Eu Wau Wau indigenous lands. By analyzing the density of active fire data, it is possible to verify that most of the outbreaks are located at the edges of the RILs. This shows that these areas work as a barrier to the spread of fire in the South of the Brazilian Amazon. Thus, despite the identification of regions burnt within indigenous lands, the study concluded that RILs are essential for protecting the Amazon's native vegetation.

AB The great heterogeneity of tropical systems challenges our understanding of how niche and neutral processes structure epiphyte communities. Dispersal, phorophyte identity and the environmental conditions created by phorophytes are the main determinants of vascular epiphyte structure and diversity. However, these forces comprise multiple causal factors that need to be decomposed to address the complex patterns of independent and confounded effects acting upon epiphyte communities. We tested the hypothesis that the environment created by phorophytes (size, bark characteristics, microenvironmental conditions, and substrate type) is more important than phorophyte species identity and space in determining the structure of epiphyte communities, with phorophyte size being a major determinant within the environmental component. We also expected larger phorophytes to exhibit greater epiphyte richness and diversity. The study was carried out on an inselberg within a semi-deciduous montane forest and a cloud forest in southeastern Brazil. Partial redundancy analysis was used to hierarchically decompose the relative abundances of vascular epiphytes into three components: association with particular phorophyte species, the environment created by phorophytes, and space (Moran's eigenvector maps). Linear models were used to analyze the relationship between epiphytic diversity and richness with size descriptors. We show that neutral and niche-based processes act simultaneously on the dynamics of vascular epiphyte species, but distinctly on the inselberg and cloud forest. The potential for an epiphyte to occupy all favorable phorophytes was larger in the cloud forest due to the higher connectivity offered by trees. Abundance, richness and diversity of epiphytes increased with phorophyte size, probably due to an increase in the area, time of colonization or increase in microhabitat heterogeneity within phorophytes. Larger phorophytes are a major determinant of local environmental conditions and the spatial organization of epiphytes, as they promote their abundance and maintain their diversity in tropical systems.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis has been explored by many ecologists in a great number of forests. Numerous studies have suggested that mycorrhizal type and fungal composition may affect the conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) among tree species. However, how the variations and roles of mycorrhizal type and fungi compositions influence CNDD remains a challenge in temperate forests. We used tree demographic data in a 42-ha plot over ten years to test the effects of two types of tree mycorrhiza (arbuscular mycorrhiza: AM and ectomycorrhizal mycorrhiza: EM) on the survival of 45 species over three types of tree ontogeny (sapling, juvenile, adult trees), and the relationship between CNDD and soil fungal community composition of 8 common species. The results of this study show that AM tree species experienced stronger CNDD than EM tree species in each of the three ontogenetic stages. EM tree species with higher mutualistic fungi and lower pathogenic fungi may suffer lower CNDD. Individual trees with higher pathogenic fungi may be affected more severely by CNDD in our temperate forest. Our findings highlight the key roles of mycorrhizal association in mediating the strength of CNDD on tree survival, which may affect the plant community composition of temperate forests.

AB Background and aims - A plant's tolerance of herbivory depends on its ability to endure and compensate for damage so as to lessen the impact that herbivores have on the plant's performance (e.g. its growth, reproduction, or fitness). While tolerance of herbivory is beneficial to plants, it is rarely complete, and individuals in plant populations tend to vary in their levels of tolerance. The goal of this study was to investigate potential costs associated with tolerance of leaf and floral herbivory in horsenettle (Solanum carolinense), a perennial herbaceous weed that is often subjected to high levels of damage from a diversity of herbivores.
   Material and methods - We exposed 96 potted individuals across eight genets of horsenettle to factorial treatments of leaf herbivory by lace bugs and simulated floral herbivory by weevils. We quantified tolerance for each plant genet for both types of herbivory in terms of the impact of damage on the number of flowers opened, number of seeds produced, and root biomass (i.e. paternal, maternal, and vegetative tolerance, respectively).
   Key results - Plant genets ranged widely in their ability to compensate for leaf and flower damage. While there was little evidence for tradeoffs in tolerance through the different routes, there was strong evidence of tradeoffs in genets' abilities to tolerate herbivore damage to leaves and damage to flowers.
   Conclusion - Tolerance is a useful defence strategy to cope with damage caused by herbivores, but its evolution may be constrained by concomitant costs and tradeoffs. The evolutionary role of the tradeoffs identified in this study are likely to be greater the more species of herbivores a plant hosts, and the more that herbivore levels vary both spatially and temporally.

AB The fungus-growing ant Mycetomoellerius (previously Trachymyrmex) zeteki (Weber 1940) has been the focus of a wide range of studies examining symbiotic partners, garden pathogens, mating frequencies, and genomics. This is in part due to the ease of collecting colonies from creek embankments and its high abundance in the Panama Canal region. The original description was based on samples collected on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. However, most subsequent studies have sampled populations on the mainland 15 km southeast of BCI. Herein we show that two sibling ant species live in sympatry on the mainland: Mycetomoellerius mikromelanos Cardenas, Schultz, & Adams and M. zeteki. This distinction was originally based on behavioral differences of workers in the field and on queen morphology (M. mikromelanos workers and queens are smaller and black while those of M. zeteki are larger and red). Authors frequently refer to either species as "M. cf. zeteki,'' indicating uncertainty about identity. We used an integrative taxonomic approach to resolve this, examining worker behavior, chemical profiles of worker volatiles, molecular markers, and morphology of all castes. For the latter, we used conventional taxonomic indicators from nine measurements, six extrapolated indices, and morphological characters. We document a new observation of a Diapriinae (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae) parasitoid wasp parasitizing M. zeteki. Finally, we discuss the importance of vouchering in dependable, accessible museum collections and provide a table of previously published papers to clarify the usage of the name T. zeteki. We found that most reports of M. zeteki or M. cf. zeteki-including a genome-actually refer to the new species M. mikromelanos.

AB The western region of Cameroon is one of the leading agricultural production areas in sub-Saharan Africa, and this ongoing anthropogenic perturbation has led to the replacement of natural forests with agroecosystems. Such anthropogenic landscape transformations may have affected bat species composition and abundance in the area. Our study assessed the response of bat assemblages to these changes, by comparing species diversity and abundance across four distinct habitat types within the region: cultivated farms (transformed landscape), savannah and gallery forest (both representing degraded areas), and secondary forest. A total of 442 individuals assigned to 25 species were captured using ground-level mist nets. The cultivated farms recorded the highest bat species richness (13 species) and abundance (145 individuals), whereas the gallery forest had the lowest species richness (six species) and abundance (62 individuals). Myonycteris angolensis had the highest relative abundance in the region, with large numbers captured in cultivated farms. According to the rank-frequency diagram, bat assemblages in cultivated farms (Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) = 53.7), gallery forest (AIC = 27.7), and secondary forest (AIC = 48.5) are distributed according to the pre-emption model, whereas the distribution in the savannah (AIC = 40.0) follow the null model. Generalised linear models revealed significant differences in species and relative abundance across the four habitat types.

AB Although certain pollutants can be biologically degraded by microorganisms, rendering their impact short-term, others can not be impaired, such that their effect persists. The present study evaluates the effectiveness of using a field-collected aphid, Aphis gossypii, as a bio-indicator for heavy metals in tomato farms in Riyadh and Hafar Al-Batin, Saudi Arabia. Heavy metals were selected (Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb) and measured for comparative screening in field-collected plants, soil, and aphids using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Field-collected aphids from both studied regions were identified as Aphis gossypii. In Riyadh, there was no significant difference observed for Cd, Cu, and Zn for all experimental samples, while, Pb was showed differences among samples especially tomato leaves None of the studied samples in Hafar Al-Batin were showed statistically significant differences in Cd, in reverse to significant differences in the other heavy metals. Comparing concentrations of selected heavy metals between the two studied regions was showed that neither region showed a significant difference in heavy metals except for Cu. This study demonstrates that tomato leaf samples showed the highest concentrations of most studied heavy metals, followed by soil, then aphids. Aphids were utilized as a bio-indicator of heavy metals in the studied regions. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB Tree-species mixture effects (e.g. complementarity and facilitation) have been found to increase individual-tree productivity, lessen mortality and improve recruitment in forests worldwide. By promoting more efficient and complete resource use, mixture effects may also lessen individual-tree-level water stress, thus improving drought resistance. We investigated the influence of mixture effects on tree productivity, mortality and recruitment across broad compositional and moisture gradients in high-elevation Interior West US mixed-conifer communities, where Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) is the major contributor to functional diversity. Our goal was to provide a more complete scientific foundation for managing these drought-prone, fire-excluded systems under an uncertain climate. We used landscape-scale national forest inventory data to examine mixture effects on P. tremuloides and the major associated conifer species, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus contorta, Abies lasiocarpa and Picea engelmannii. Using generalized linear mixed modelling, we isolated the influences of P. tremuloides relative density and climate on tree-level (stems >= 12.7 cm DBH) growth, mortality and stand-level recruitment (presence/absence of new trees). Cold-season precipitation (PPT) and warm-season vapour pressure deficit (VPD) served to represent soil moisture supply and demand, respectively. Populus tremuloides growth declined as interspecific density increased. In contrast, Pinus contorta and A. lasiocarpa growth increased with P. tremuloides density. For all species except A. lasiocarpa and P. menziesii, growth increased under higher PPT and VPD. Populus tremuloides mortality increased under high VPD but not with interspecific relative density. We found limited evidence that A. lasiocarpa mortality decreased as P. tremuloides density increased. Populus tremuloides recruitment declined steeply above 25% interspecific relative density. We found a decline in conifer recruitment odds as P. tremuloides density increased, ranging from strong in P. contorta to insubstantial in P. engelmannii. Synthesis. Our findings have implications for sustaining mixed-conifer communities impacted by climate change and historical fire exclusion. Mixtures of P. tremuloides and conifers may improve conifer growth while adversely impacting P. tremuloides growth relative to pure stands. Higher conifer productivity combined with lower P. tremuloides recruitment at high conifer relative density may accelerate succession.

AB The discussion about the drivers that govern the spatial patterns of diversity has been focussed on two seemingly independent models: (1) neutral dynamics, mediated by larval supply and dispersal limitations, and (2) niche processes, mainly environmental control. However, metacommunity theory assumes that drivers evoked by both models (niche and neutral) might act simultaneously, but at different spatial scales, in shaping assemblage composition and structure. In this study, we use communities inhabiting prop roots of the Caribbean mangrove Rhizophora mangle L. as a model system to test hypotheses about the role of environmental control and neutral dynamics as potential synergic drivers at multiple spatial scales. For this, environmental, biological and spatial data were obtained from the southern Caribbean under a hierarchical sampling design that includes (1) mangrove systems distanced apart by hundreds of km, (2) sectors within each mangrove systems separated by a few km, (3) sites within each sector separated by tens of metres and (4) neighbouring roots in a site. Non-parametric multivariate statistics were used to describe, link and test the environmental, biological and spatial patterns. In general, we found that environmental filtering, principally salinity and supply of energy/nutrients, could be the primary filters that sustain differences in composition and structure of the assemblages at the spatial scale of mangrove systems. At local spatial scales, shallow depths (<1 m) seem to be a critical environmental filter for these assemblages. Beyond this environmental filter, it seems that the distribution and abundance of species might be more affected by neutral processes. However, we detect a wide diversity of spatiotemporal trends of species distribution and abundance. These results support the conclusion that niche and neutral processes act simultaneously, affecting species and individuals, rather than as general drivers affecting the whole metacommunity.

AB Community composition is a primary determinant of how biodiversity change influences ecosystem functioning and, therefore, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF). We examine the consequences of community composition across six structurally realistic plant community models. We find that a positive correlation between species' functioning in monoculture versus their dominance in mixture with regard to a specific function (the "function-dominance correlation") generates a positive relationship between realised diversity and ecosystem functioning across species richness treatments. However, because realised diversity declines when few species dominate, a positive function-dominance correlation generates a negative relationship between realised diversity and ecosystem functioning within species richness treatments. Removing seed inflow strengthens the link between the function-dominance correlation and BEF relationships across species richness treatments but weakens it within them. These results suggest that changes in species' identities in a local species pool may more strongly affect ecosystem functioning than changes in species richness.

AB Granivorous rodents have been traditionally regarded as antagonistic seed predators. Agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.), however, have also been recognized as mutualistic dispersers of plants because of their role as scatter-hoarders of seeds, especially for large-seeded species. A closer look shows that such definitions are too simplistic for these Neotropical animals because agoutis can influence plant communities not only through seed dispersal of large seeds but also through predation of small seeds and seedlings, evidencing their dual role. Herein, we summarize the literature on plant-agouti interactions, decompose agouti seed dispersal into its quantitative and qualitative components, and discuss how environmental factors and plant traits determine whether these interactions result in mutualisms or antagonisms. We also look at the role of agoutis in a community context, assessing their effectiveness as substitutes for extinct megafaunal frugivores and comparing their ecological functions to those of other extant dispersers of large seeds. We also discuss how our conclusions can be extended to the single other genus in the Dasyproctidae family (Myoprocta). Finally, we examine agoutis' contribution to carbon stocks and summarize current conservation threats and efforts. We recorded 164 interactions between agoutis and plants, which were widespread across the plant phylogeny, confirming that agoutis are generalist frugivores. Seed mass was a main factor determining seed hoarding probability of plant species and agoutis were found to disperse larger seeds than other large-bodied frugivores. Agoutis positively contributed to carbon storage by preying upon seeds of plants with lower carbon biomass and by dispersing species with higher biomass. This synthesis of plant-agouti interactions shows that ecological services provided by agoutis to plant populations and communities go beyond seed dispersal and predation, and we identify still unanswered questions. We hope to emphasise the importance of agoutis in Neotropical forests.

AB As a crucial part of urban green space, urban shrub biomass and biomass allocation play an important role in the urban carbon cycle. However, the current body of research mainly focuses on natural vegetation, and the biomass allocation patterns of urban shrubs remain poorly addressed. In this study, whole-plant harvests of 13 common urban shrubs in the Yangtze River Delta region were conducted to ascertain their biomass allocation patterns (i.e., leaf mass fraction (LMF), stem mass fraction (SMF), root mass fraction (RMF), and root/shoot ratio (R/S)) as well as the effects of ontogeny (i.e., plant height) and leaf traits (evergreen and deciduous). Our findings were as follows: (1) Among the 13 urban shrubs, the mean values of LMF, SMF, RMF and R/S were 0.22, 0.47, 0.31, and 0.46. Specifically, nine species had the most resources invested in stems, whereas four species exhibited similar proportion of roots and stems. (2) With increasing plant height, the changes in shrub biomass allocation to organs could be divided into three categories: 1) eight shrub species displayed increased partitioning of resources to stems (SMF) and decreased partitioning to leaves (LMF) and roots (RMF); 2) two shrub species shifted biomass from leaves to stems, with RMF remaining stable; and 3) three shrub species exhibited no response to increasing plant height. (3) Evergreen shrubs had higher LMF values (0.26 vs. 0.17) and lower SMF values (0.42 vs. 0.54) compared to deciduous species (P 0.05), and their RMF and R/S values did not differ significantly (P 0.05). We concluded that urban shrub biomass allocation was influenced by both plant ontogeny and leaf traits, and the data presented in this study could be made available for the precise estimation of regional urban shrub biomass and carbon storage.

AB Flood and fire act as ecological filters which can interact to shape forest structure and species composition. Our objective was to investigate how the interaction between fire and flood influences richness, abundance, basal area and species composition of the tree community and the monodominant belts of Attalea phalerata Mart. in forest islets of the Pantanal wetland. We used satellite images to find 12 forest islets without fire events from 1998 to 2014, and 12 forest islets burned only once in the same period in a fire event in 2009. In these forest islets, we set up a transect with 10 to 14 contiguous 5 x 10 m plots and sampled all trees with a diameter at breast height of >= 4.7 cm. We also measured the watermark height. Flooding influenced species richness and abundance, increased toward wetter areas of the forest islet flood gradient. In contrast, the interaction between fire and flood inverted that trend, with richness and abundance increasing in flood-free areas. Total basal area increases in the more flooded areas of the gradient. The fire or the interaction between fire and flooding did not influence the basal area. The relative abundance of A. phalerata increased with flood level and even more under the fire-flood interaction. We conclude that the interaction between fire and flood influences forest islet structure and species composition; moreover, it favors A. phalerata monodominance.

AB In fragmented forests, edge effects can drive intraspecific variation in seedling performance that influences forest regeneration and plant composition. However, few studies have attempted to disentangle the relative biotic and abiotic drivers of intraspecific variation in seedling performance. In this study, we carried out a seedling transplant experiment with a factorial experimental design on three land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China, using four common native woody plant species. At different distances from the forest edge (2, 8, 32, 128 m), we transplanted four seedlings of each species into each of three cages: full-cage, for herbivore exclusion; half-cage, that allowed herbivore access but controlled for caging artifacts; and no-cage control. In the 576 cages, we recorded branch architecture, leaf traits, and seedling survival for each seedling before and after the experimental treatment. Overall, after one full growing season, edge-induced abiotic drivers and varied herbivory pressure led to intraspecific variation in seedling performance, including trade-offs in seedling architecture and resource-use strategies. However, responses varied across species with different life-history strategies and depended on the driver in question, such that the abiotic and biotic effects were additive across species, rather than interactive. Edge-induced abiotic variation modified seedling architecture of a shade-tolerant species, leading to more vertical rather than lateral growth at edges. Meanwhile, increased herbivory pressure resulted in a shift toward lower dry matter investment in leaves of a light-demanding species. Our results suggest that edge effects can drive rapid directional shifts in the performance and intraspecific traits of some woody plants from early ontogenetic stages, but most species in this study showed negligible phenotypic responses to edge effects. Moreover, species-specific responses suggest the importance of interspecific differences modulating the degree of trait plasticity, implying the need to incorporate individual-level responses when understanding the impact of forest fragmentation on plant communities.

AB While considerable attention has been devoted to how precipitation modulates net primary productivity in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, the emergence of multi-faceted controls on carbon (C) turnover suggests that there is much to be understood with respect to the mechanistic controls on plant litter decomposition.
   In the Patagonian steppe, we conducted a long-term factorial experiment, evaluating the importance of position, litter quality, tissue origin and soil resources on rates of C turnover under natural field conditions. Leaf and root litter of dominant grass species were placed in litterbags in different positions, on the soil surface and buried at 5-cm depth, with soil treatments of labile C, nitrogen (N) and their combination (C + N) over a 3-year period.
   As predicted, leaf litter decomposed significantly (nearly sixfold) faster above-ground than did root litter below-ground (p < 0.001). Surprisingly, root litter decomposed significantly faster than leaf litter above-ground (p < 0.001), and above-ground decomposition was not strongly affected by soil resource additions. Below-ground decomposition was largely determined by the interaction of litter quality and soil resource availability. Determining a C balance by integrating biomass allocation and primary productivity from this field site, combined with the data from this study, suggests large differences between the contribution of the above- and below-ground biomass to soil organic matter (SOM) pools and a long residence time of undecomposed root litter.
   Synthesis. Litter position clearly emerged as the predominant variable determining C turnover in this semi-arid steppe ecosystem, with litter quality and soil resources having significant, but more modest, effects. The near complete independence of above-ground litter decomposition from soil resources and rapid decomposition of surface litter, coupled with the counterintuitive relationships with litter quality, suggests that, in the long term, C loss from photodegradation may result in a minimal contribution of above-ground litter to SOM formation. These results have mechanistic implications for the distinct functionality of litter decomposition above- and below-ground in semi-arid ecosystems, and how these differential controls may alter the C balance due to future changes in climate and land use.

AB Ferns and lycophytes are an excellent group for conservation and species distribution studies because they are closely related to environmental changes. In this study, we analyzed collection gaps, sampling biases, richness distribution, and the species conservation effectiveness of protected areas in the Lower Tapajos River Basin using ferns and lycophytes as a model group. We built a database based on herbarium specimens that were taxonomically verified and georeferenced. We then examined the relationship between sampling effort and documented species richness and tested for collection bias towards access routes (navigable rivers and roads). We made a comparison of species composition among the study areas and sixteen other areas in the Brazilian Amazon using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and tested whether floristic similarity was correlated with geographic distance. We found that more than 92% of the area is unsampled and that collecting effort is highly biased towards areas along access routes, such as roads and navigable rivers. Only four out of the seven protected areas in the Lower Tapajos Basin had records of ferns and lycophytes. We present here species checklists for those areas. In total, we recorded 151 species of 60 genera and 24 families. Five species are new records for the state of Para, and nine out of the 151 species recorded occur only outside protected areas. Species composition is most similar among areas sharing similar vegetation types; geographic closeness does not necessarily reflect floristic similarity. We conclude that the fern and lycophyte flora the Brazilian Amazon is still far from complete and recommend the direction of future collection efforts to other under-sampled portions of the region. Such a sampling strategy will reduce sampling bias and providing a better knowledge base for the conservation of Amazonian fern and lycophyte diversity.

AB Climate seasonality is one of the important environmental variables that can drive changes in many properties of trees. However, how different tree species regulate their growth and development during changes of the growing period particularly at sapling stage is little known. This study, therefore, evaluated how morphological, anatomical, and soil properties differed in two growing season periods (March vs. September) between oak and black locust saplings across one growing season. Wood cell anatomical properties and soil characteristics were considerably influenced by seasonality. Each species showed greater wood cell anatomical characteristics in March than in September. Soil physical and chemical properties also showed great variance between March and September: soil pH, amount of Mg and Al concentrations in soil were higher in March while organic matter and total N concentration in soil showed greater values in September. Growth and development performance were also compared between two species. We found fibre cell characteristics, stem height, stem diameter and node number were to be greater in oak than in black locust for both early- and late growing periods. The results suggested that oak showed better adaptation to their local environments than black locust.

AB The incidence of several respiratory viral infections has been shown to be related to climate. Because humans spend most of their time indoors, measures of indoor climate, rather than outdoor climate, may be better predictors of disease incidence and transmission. Therefore, understanding the relationship between indoor and outdoor climate will help illuminate their influence on the seasonality of diseases caused by respiratory viruses. Indoor-outdoor relationships between temperature and humidity have been documented in temperate regions, but little information is available for tropical regions, where seasonal patterns of respiratory viral diseases differ. We have examined indoor-outdoor correlations of temperature, relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH) over a 1-year period in each of seven tropical cities. Across all cities, the average monthly indoor temperature was 25 +/- 3 degrees C (mean +/- standard deviation) with a range of 20-30 degrees C. The average monthly indoor RH was 66 +/- 9% with a range of 50-78%, and the average monthly indoor AH was 15 +/- 3 g/m(3) with a range of 10-23 g/m(3). Indoor AH and RH were linearly correlated with outdoor AH when the air conditioning (AC) was off, suggesting that outdoor AH may be a good proxy of indoor humidity in the absence of AC. All indoor measurements were more strongly correlated with outdoor measurements as distance from the equator increased. Such correlations were weaker during the wet season, especially when AC was in operation. These correlations will provide insight for assessing the seasonality of respiratory viral infections using outdoor climate data, which is more widely available than indoor data, even though transmission of these diseases mainly occurs indoors.

AB Few studies have examined geographical variation in traits involved in biotic interactions, although such variation is likely key in the evolution of interactions. The fit between hummingbird bills and the flowers they feed on suggests mutual selection pressures. We tested for geographical variation in the pollinator-flower fit in the Mexican hermit Phaethornis mexicanus and Heliconia spp. flowers by analyzing the morphospaces of the interacting species and the ways they vary. To analyze the geographical variation in the morphology of P. mexicanus and Heliconia spp. flowers, we grouped samples into three operational geographic units (OGUs). Within each OGU, we assessed pollinator-flower specificity by analyzing floral resource preference, and morphological data using correlations and principal component analysis. Our data on floral preferences and morphology indicate geographical variation in the P. mexicanus-Heliconia interaction in all of the OGUs. Heliconia was the preferred floral resource (83% of the samples), suggesting a preference for these flowers as a food source. We also detected morphological overlap between the bill of P. mexicanus and the corollas of both Heliconia species, at least in the two westernmost OGUs. That P. mexicanus morphology tracked variation in the different Heliconia spp. across the hummingbird's range suggests that the specificity of the hummingbird-plant interaction exerts a significant selection pressure on hummingbird morphology. The morphological overlap observed in the two northernmost OGUs is probably due to the evolution of a close biotic interaction, which is reflected in the high correlation values in the morphological characters involved.

AB Turnover of species composition through time is frequently observed in ecosystems. It is often interpreted as indicating the impact of changes in the environment. Continuous turnover due solely to ecological dynamics-species interactions and dispersal-is also known to be theoretically possible; however the prevalence of such autonomous turnover in natural communities remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that observed patterns of compositional turnover and other important macroecological phenomena can be reproduced in large spatially explicit model ecosystems, without external forcing such as environmental change or the invasion of new species into the model. We find that autonomous turnover is triggered by the onset of ecological structural instability-the mechanism that also limits local biodiversity. These results imply that the potential role of autonomous turnover as a widespread and important natural process is underappreciated, challenging assumptions implicit in many observation and management tools. Quantifying the baseline level of compositional change would greatly improve ecological status assessments. Change in ecological communities can be driven by extrinsic forces, but the degree to which intrinsic population dynamics drive turnover has remained unclear. Here the authors use metacommunity modelling to show that biodiversity change previously attributed to external drivers can be explained based on intrinsic ecosystem dynamics.

AB Deciphering the effect of neutral and deterministic processes on community assembly is critical to understand and predict diversity patterns. The information held in community trait distributions is commonly assumed as a signature of these processes, but empirical and modelling attempts have most often failed to untangle their confounding, sometimes opposing, impacts. Here, we simulated the assembly of trait distributions through stochastic (dispersal limitation) and/or deterministic scenarios (environmental filtering and niche differentiation). We characterized the shape of trait distributions using the skewness-kurtosis relationship. We identified commonalities in the co-variation between the skewness and the kurtosis of trait distributions with a unique signature for each simulated assembly scenario. Our findings were robust to variation in the composition of regional species pools, dispersal limitation and environmental conditions. While ecological communities can exhibit a high degree of idiosyncrasy, identification of commonalities across multiple communities can help to unveil ecological assembly rules in real-world ecosystems.

AB The Caatinga, the largest region of seasonally dry tropical forest in the Neotropics, suffers high rates of deforestation and habitat degradation, mostly due to wood extraction. As an alternative to illegal logging, governments have looked at more sustainable management schemes, allowing natural regeneration after logging through relatively long (similar to 25-year) harvest rotations. We investigated the impacts of forest management at a 1,700-ha privately owned area located at the Araripe Plateau, in the semiarid interior of northeastern Brazil, focusing on the population parameters of 8 avian species. The property was subdivided into 22 forest stands, where a different stand has been logged every year since 2004. By 2016, when we sampled the avifauna, 12 forest stands had already been logged and allowed to regrow, creating a landscape of logged and unlogged stands and a 12-year forest recovery chrono-sequence. We conducted distance-based sampling along transects to estimate the density and abundance of these species in logged and unlogged stands. We found that logging impacted 3 of the target species. Two of them (Megaxenops parnaguae and Synallaxis scutata) were less abundant, whereas another (Sclerurus cearensis) disappeared altogether from logged areas. We also found a positive correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the avian density of the affected species. However, we failed to observe any significant relationship between forest recovery or NDVI and species densities, suggesting that even after 12 years of forest recovery, species abundance remains lower in logged than in unlogged areas. We found that logging impacted birds in a species-specific manner, with 5 species unaffected and 3 species declining. Although our sampling occurred half-way through the regeneration cycle, we found no evidence of recovery for those species most affected. We suggest keeping unlogged areas intermingled with logged stands, allowing the survival and potential recovery of species in regenerating forests.

AB Savanna woody species evolved with fire. However, the effect of changes in the fire regimes, which tend to increase in the next decades, is not yet fully understood. Here, we tested the effects of increased fire frequency on species richness and the composition of woody plant communities. Specifically, we tested if a high frequency fire management reduces local species richness of communities and homogenizes species composition. We sampled woody plants in 40 sites, distributed in 20 pairs, in Emas National Park (Brazil). Each pair included sites with high fire frequency (firebreaks that are burned annually since 1994) and with natural fire frequency (occurring every 3-5 years). We used a paired t-test to assess effects of the two fire frequency treatments on species richness and permutation tests to compare distance decay in similarity composition and relative abundances. We found that sites with high fire frequency had lower species richness compared to their paired sites subjected to natural fire frequency. However, similarities in species composition among sites with high fire frequency were only slightly higher than among sites subjected to natural fire frequency. The rate of distance decay in similarity was similar on the two treatments. At local scales, the high frequency of fire reduced species richness, an impact that in the long run may be irreversible. However, at broader spatial scales, effects were small as two treatments included similar sets of species. Prescribed fires have the potential to modify the natural dynamics of the woody communities in the savannas we studied. In our study, fire appears to act as a hierarchical filter, selecting species at broader spatial scales and nesting communities at local scales.

AB Small mammals interfere in plant dynamics through seed and seedling predation, and seed dispersion. In anthropogenic systems, some species provide ecosystem services while others are considered pests. Small mammals inhabit cacao agroforestry and may damage cacao fruits. However, knowledge on the harmful species and annual yield loss are scarce. We aimed to estimate the cacao damage produced by small mammals, and search for evidence on the harmful species using two different approaches: associations between the estimated damage and species abundances, and the molecular identification of cacao DNA in small mammal feces. We estimated cacao damage by monthly count of intact and damaged pods. We sampled small mammals using live traps, and analyzed fecal samples from 44 individuals. Estimated damage on mature fruits along the harvest season ranged from 3 to 13% per site. Rhipidomys mastacalis, Hylaeamys seuanezi and Marmosa murina were the most common species. We found a positive association between fruit damage and R. mastacalis abundance. However, cacao DNA was identified in feces of R. mastacalis and M. murina. Both species are arboreal, but only R. mastacalis is adapted to gnaw the cacao peel. Altogether, our results indicate that this rodent is the main responsible for the observed damages, while M. murina may feed opportunistically on fruits previously opened. Reasonable yield loss can be observed in some farms. Studies on resources used by R. mastacalis and negative interactions able to enforce population control should be fostered to inform environmental management with minimal impact to overall small mammal assemblage.

AB Plankton in rivers are good indicators of water quality and their study along the longitudinal axis allows for understanding the interactions between natural and anthropogenic variations and diversity at different spatial scales. We compared the taxonomic biodiversity of planktonic microcrustaceans in two sections of the Frades River Basin, Brazil. Water and microcrustaceans were sampled in August 2018, April 2019, July 2019, and October 2019 in the basin. We recorded 43 taxa as the regional diversity of microcrustaceans. Alpha diversity was statistically higher in the upper section of the basin. The analysis of indicator species showed that nine species were characteristic of the studied sections. The upper section was represented by Nicsmirnovius paggii, Acroperus tupinamba, Alonella dadayi, Alona guttata, and Microcyclops finitimus and characterized by higher dissolved oxygen, higher values of pH of water and lower nitrate and total coliforms concentrations. Diaphanosoma birgei, Alona sp., Grimaldina brazzai, and Ilyocryptus spinifer were characteristic of the lower sections of the basin, with the highest concentrations of nitrate and total coliforms. The microcrustaceans in the lower sections were limited by the gradient of environmental conditions, making local communities simpler (low species richness) and with few species probably adjusted to narrow ranges of environmental conditions.

AB In seasonally dry tropical environments, natural archives of isotopes present in cellulose of tree rings can be used to study changes in the hydrological cycle. We investigated the stable oxygen isotope ratios in tree-ring cellulose (delta O-18(TRC)) of Cedrela odorata L. from Caatinga forest, northeastern Brazil, and tested if delta O-18(TRC) is correlated to climate parameters. We extracted the alpha-cellulose from the most recent 50 tree rings (1968-2017). The inter-annual variation of delta O-18(TRC) was strongly synchronized (r = 0.65) among all five studied individuals and closely related to changes in humidity during the growing season. The delta O-18(TRC) was significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with precipitation (r = - 0.59), relative humidity (r = - 0.37), air temperature (r = 0.55), soil water deficit (r = 0.62) and PDSI drought index (r = - 0.62), with most significant correlation during wet season and in the first month of the dry season. The relationship with local climate variables reflects the effect of evaporative enrichment of leaf water on delta O-18(TRC), whereby dry soil conditions, the low relative humidity and high air temperature reduce stomatal conductance and lead to increased evaporative enrichment of delta O-18(TRC). Spatial correlations revealed a strong impact of PDSI in delta O-18(TRC). Our results also show an increase in delta O-18(TRC) values from the 1990s onwards due to extreme and recurring droughts in northeastern Brazil. We conclude that delta O-18(TRC) variations are related to the climatic conditions, especially during the wet period due to the greater water availability for plant physiological processes.

AB Hummingbirds have two main foraging strategies: territoriality (defending a patch of flowers) and traplining (foraging over routine circuits of isolated patches). Species are often classified as employing one or the other. Not only have these strategies been inconsistently defined within the behavioral literature, but this simple framework also neglects the substantial evidence for flexible foraging behavior displayed by hummingbirds. Despite these limitations, research on hummingbird foraging has explored the distinct avenues of selection that proponents of either strategy presumably face: trapliners maximizing foraging efficiency, and territorialists favoring speed and maneuverability for resource defense. In earlier studies, these functions were primarily examined through wing disc loading (ratio of body weight to the circular area swept out by the wings, WDL) and predicted hovering costs, with trapliners expected to exhibit lower WDL than territorialists and thus lower hovering costs. While these pioneering models continue to play a role in current research, early studies were constrained by modest technology, and the original expectations regarding WDL have not held up when applied across complex hummingbird assemblages. Current technological advances have allowed for innovative research on the biomechanics/energetics of hummingbird flight, such as allometric scaling relationships (e.g., wing area-flight performance) and the link between high burst lifting performance and territoriality. Providing a predictive framework based on these relationships will allow us to reexamine previous hypotheses, and explore the biomechanical trade-offs to different foraging strategies, which may yield divergent routes of selection for quintessential territoriality and traplining. With a biomechanical and morphofunctional lens, here we examine the locomotor and energetic facets that dictate hummingbird foraging, and provide (a) predictions regarding the behavioral, biomechanical, and morphofunctional associations with territoriality and traplining; and (b) proposed methods of testing them. By pursuing these knowledge gaps, future research could use a variety of traits to help clarify the operational definitions of territoriality and traplining, to better apply them in the field.

AB Concerns with distributional justice invariably arise in environmental governance, especially in the conservation and management of common-pool resources. These initiatives generate an array of costs and benefits that are typically heterogeneously distributed. Distribution of these impacts in a way that is considered fair by local stakeholders is not only a moral imperative, but instrumental to achieving social and ecological success given perceived unfairness fosters conflict and undermines cooperation. However, understandings of local stakeholders' conceptions of distributional fairness are rare because research often assesses distributional outcomes based on tacit assumptions about what constitutes fairness (e.g. equality). We examine what local stakeholders consider distributional fairness with respect to monetary benefits arising from a collective payment for ecosystem services scheme in a co-managed marine protected area in Fiji. In six villages associated with the co-managed marine protected area, we elicited individuals' fairness judgements of five distributional justice principles: equality, need, and three forms of proportionality based on customary rights, fisheries opportunity-costs, and involvement in co-management. We examine how fairness judgements are associated with socio-demographic characteristics indicative of key identities, thereby building on socially-aggregated approaches typical of the nascent literature on perceived fairness. We find the rights-based principle was considered the 'most fair' and the opportunity-costs principle the 'least fair'. Our findings challenge prevailing understandings of distributional justice in conservation and commons management, which favour the principles of equality or opportunity-cost. We also find that education was significantly positively related to fairness judgements of all principles, whilst wealth was significantly related to the equality and the opportunity-based principles. These results provide insights into how fairness judgements could be influenced by key elements of current social change in the Global South (e.g. increasing formal education, market engagement and wealth accumulation). Overall, our results suggest that fair environmental governance requires explicit identification of distributional fairness conceptions of those most affected by such initiatives, especially in a context of increasing globalisation of conservation knowledge and practice.

AB Understanding the interaction between canopy structure and the parameters of interception loss is essential in predicting the variations in partitioning rainfall and water resources as affected by changes in canopy structure and in implementing water-based management in semiarid forest plantations. In this study, seasonal variations in rainfall interception loss and canopy storage capacity as driven by canopy structure were predicted and the linkages were tested using seasonal filed measurements. The study was conducted in nine 50 m x 50 m Robinia pseudoacacia plots in the semiarid region of China's Loess Plateau. Gross rainfall, throughfall and stemflow were measured in seasons with and without leaves in 2015 and 2016. Results show that measured average interception loss for the nine plots were 17.9% and 9.4% of gross rainfall during periods with leaves (the growing season) and without leaves, respectively. Average canopy storage capacity estimated using an indirect method was 1.3 mm in the growing season and 0.2 mm in the leafless season. Correlations of relative interception loss and canopy storage capacity to canopy variables were highest for leaf/wood area index (LAI/WAI) and canopy cover, followed by bark area, basal area, tree height and stand density. Combined canopy cover, leaf/wood area index and bark area multiple regression models of interception loss and canopy storage capacity were established for the growing season and in the leafless season in 2015. It explained 97% and 96% of the variations in relative interception loss during seasons with and without leaves, respectively. It also explained 98% and 99% of the variations in canopy storage capacity during seasons with and without leaves, respectively. The empirical regression models were validated using field data collected in 2016. The models satisfactorily predicted relative interception loss and canopy storage capacity during seasons with and without leaves. This study provides greater understanding about the effects of changes in tree canopy structure (e.g., dieback or mortality) on hydrological processes.

AB Tree species composition and diversity were assessed in six forest communities at an altitudinal gradient (i.e. from 247 to 1478 m) by laying four plots of 0.1 ha in each site within sub-tropical forest belt in Mokokchung, Nagaland. A total of 777 individuals belonging to 118 species, 84 genera and 43 families were recorded. The most dominant families from these sites were: Fagaceae, Moraceae, Anacardiaceae and Malvaceae. The tree density (individuals ha(-1)) in the present study ranged from 313 in Dillenia-Duabanga-Macaranga community to 330 in Morus-Vernonia-Hovenia community. The total basal area (m(2 )ha(-1)) ranged between 22.95 and 38.03 in Morus-Vernonia-Hovenia and Bombax-Melia-Gmelina community, respectively. The dominance-diversity curve showed high equitability and low dominance in forest communities (i.e. Trema-Kydia-Callicarpa, Morus-Vernonia-Hovenia and Alnus-Duabanga-Morus) occupied higher altitudes (1145-1478 m) and followed a log-normal distribution pattern. Whereas, the dominance-diversity curve showed low equitability and high dominance in communities (i.e. Bombax-Melia-Gmelina, Dillenia-Duabang-Macaranga and Albizia-Sapium-Gmelina) occupied lower altitudes (247-674 m) and followed a short hooked curve pattern. The Shannon diversity index ranged from 2.95 to 3.88 indicating high tree species diversity in forest communities studied. The Simpson dominance index ranged from 0.03 to 0.09. Over all this study provides useful information on tree species composition and diversity of subtropical forest of Nagaland which can be used as baseline data by the forest department to develop plans for the conservation of forest in subtropical forest, Northeast India.

AB Architecture, like nests, burrows, and other types of fortresses, may have played an important role in the evolution of social life on land. However, few studies have examined architecture in organisms that transitioned from sea to land to test how and why architectural and morphological changes might have jointly impacted social evolution. Here I contrasted the shell architecture and body morphology of two of the phylogenetically most closely-related land versus sea species of hermit crab (the terrestrial hermit crab, Coenobita compressus, and the marine hermit crab, Calcinus obscurus), as well as the original builder of their shells (the gastropod, Nerita scabricosta). In contrast to the shells of gastropods and marine hermit crabs, only the shells of terrestrial hermit crabs were architecturally remodeled, with no columella inside for the occupants to grip upon to resist eviction. The bodies of terrestrial hermit crabs were also significantly more exposed outside the enlarged openings of their remodeled shells, whereas the substantially smaller-bodied marine hermit crabs were safeguarded deep within the recesses of their unremodeled shells. Ultimately, these changes in shell architecture and body morphology likely had consequences for social evolution on land, making conspecifics not only more dependent upon one another for homes, but also potentially easier to evict. Further changes in claw shape on land (with the claws of terrestrial hermit crabs becoming shorter, wider, and thicker) may have evolved to help offset their heightened danger of social eviction, acting as a more effective door against conspecifics.& nbsp; (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecosystem nutrient economies are commonly studied from the perspective of primary productivity in relation to nutrient availability, but a plant-specific view limits our ability to predict broader-scale patterns related to nutrient economics, such as ecosystem carbon turnover and storage controlled by soil microbial communities. Viewing nutrient economics from the heterotrophic decomposer community perspective can provide an additional perspective on ecosystem nutrient economics. We used microbial investment in extracellular enzyme production and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry theory as a conceptual framework to study nutrient economics in forest soils of the Northeast United States. Two years after experimentally increasing soil pH and phosphorus availability to offset the effects of chronic acid and nitrogen deposition, we found that belowground microbial communities were consistently investing more energy into phosphorus acquisition relative to nitrogen, in both space and time, suggesting that ecosystem demand for phosphorus might be high relative to nitrogen. Moreover, soil age and weathering, quantified by comparing glaciated vs non-glaciated regions, might not be useful predictors of nutrient economics in these forest systems. This study offers important insight into controls on ecosystem nutrient dynamics and soil microbial resource investment, information that can inform efforts to model soil microbial interactions and ecosystem carbon dynamics.

AB 1. Photosynthetic traits suggest that shade tolerance may explain the contrasting success of two conifer taxa, Podocarpaceae and Pinaceae, in tropical forests. Needle-leaved species from Pinus (Pinaceae) are generally absent from tropical forests, whereas Pinus krempfii, a flat-leaved pine, and numerous flat-leaved Podocarpaceae are abundant. Respiration (R) traits may provide additional insight into the drivers of the contrasting success of needle- and flat-leaved conifers in tropical forests.
   2. We measured the short-term respiratory temperature (RT) response between 10 and 50 degrees C and foliar morphological traits of three needle- and seven flat-leaved conifer species coexisting in a tropical montane forest in the Central Highlands of Vietnam containing notable conifer diversity. We fit a lognormal polynomial model to each RT curve and extracted the following three parameters: a (basal R), and b and c (together describing the shape of the response).
   3. Needle-leaved species (Pinus kesiya, Pinus dalatensis and Dacrydium elatum) had higher rates of area-based R at 25 degrees C (R25-area) as well as higher area-based modelled basal respiration (a) than flat-leaved species (P. krempfii, Podocarpus neriifolius, Dacrycarpus imbricatus, Nageia nana, Taxus wallichiana, Keteeleria evelyniana and Fokienia hodginsii). No significant differences were found between needle- and flat-leaved species in mass-based R-25 (R25-mass) or in the shape of the RT response (b and c); however, interspecific differences in R25-mass, R at nighttime temperature extremes (R-4.1 and R-20.6) and leaf traits were apparent.
   4. Differences in R25-area and a suggest that needle-leaved foliage may be more energetically costly to maintain than flat-leaved foliage, providing new insight and additional support for the hypothesis that shade tolerance is an important driver of Podocarpaceae success and Pinaceae absence in the majority of tropical forests.
   5. Interspecific differences in R25-mass and leaf traits highlight that varying ecological strategies are employed by conifers to coexist and survive in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Ultimately, these data further our understanding of current conifer biogeographical distributions and underscore the need for additional studies to elucidate the effects of extreme temperature events on the continued survival of conifers in this unique forest.

AB When and how multiple species can or cannot coexist is a fundamental question in ecology. Recent theory suggests that mechanisms other than trophic tradeoff could enhance the coexistence of ecologically similar species, with a strong emphasis on reproductive processes. Therefore, how resource competition and reproductive interactions jointly drive competitive dynamics is an empirical question of interest. In this context, interspecific competition between two congeneric seed beetles, Callosobruchus maculatus and C. chinensis, is a particularly interesting system; they are ecologically similar, their reproductive biology is well understood, and the two species interact with each other reproductively (through reproductive interference). Here, I review the literature for those who are interested in studying the interspecific interactions within this system, with a special emphasis on their reproductive biology and reproductive interference. I also reanalyze the results of a previous study to provide additional insight. At the end of the paper, I suggest several future directions to encourage future work that could provide further general ecological and evolutionary insights.

AB Assessing ecosystem integrity by monitoring populations and communities is an important management tool, but is often limited by the immense variety of species and the rarity of many of them. Grouping species by their responses to variation in the environment is one approach to choosing species to serve as effective indicators of community change. Moreover, identifying species that are characterized by similar archetypical responses to the environment increases the power to predict their occurrence and simplifies management of diverse species assemblages by focusing on a much smaller number of archetypes. To this end, we used the species archetype model (SAM) to fit generalized linear models of environmental covariates to species distribution data in order to identify environmentally correlated groups of kelp forest species in the Santa Barbara Channel region. Eighty-two species of macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish monitored in kelp forests across the channel were grouped into one of 10 archetypes based on their similar responses to environmental parameters, with water temperature emerging as one of the strongest drivers of archetype differences. Predictive maps of the distribution of species archetypes identified sites where multiple archetypes are common, indicating high diversity, as well as sites where rare species are more likely to occur. Potential indicator species were identified for each archetype. New monitoring efforts across the growing Marine Biodiversity Observation Network could use modeling approaches like SAM to guide their designs, optimizing the cost-to-benefit ratio of monitoring whole communities.

AB Scenarios of land use and land cover (LULC) are essential to orient public policies and improve future landscape, but scenarios of LULC at high resolution aiming to guide government actions are still scarce in the frontiers of deforestation in the tropics. This study aimed to explore the historical LULC changes (1985 to 2015) and anticipate how the implementation of the Brazilian New Forest Code could affect the LULC trends for 2050 in a region between Amazon and Cerrado biomes. We classified satellite images from the years 1986, 1990, 1993, 1999, 2004, 2010, and 2015 using a machine learning algorithm and environmental covariates. We projected two scenarios for 2050: scenario 1 representing the future trend based on the past LULC changes using a predictive model, and scenario 2 representing the full implementation of the Forest Code in the region from 2015 to 2050. We found that the forest cover decreased from 29.1 to 21.7% between 1986 and 2015, being converted mainly to pasture areas. In scenario 1, there are expected intense conversions of natural vegetation areas to pastures, resulting in 80% of the basin covered by pasture, 11.3% by forest and 5.1% by cerrado up to 2050. On the other hand, the implementation of Legal Reserves according to Forest Code in scenario 2 can restore the forest cover up to 29.5% by 2050. Although forest area is expected to increase in scenario 2, about 3.7 kha of cerrado still is expected to be converted into pastures. Therefore, the compliance and full adoption of the New Forest Code can help to promote forest protection in this region.

AB Based on a review of concepts of cultural-perceptual geography, anthropology, political ecology, and historiography, three types of landscapes that will shape part of the future of Chile and Argentina are described here: 1) The landscapes in suspended animation which are characterized by the slow transformations in their components in rural or peri-urban contexts. 2) The Corporate landscapes specifically those which alter the aesthetic - functional characteristics, loose their identity, and degrade their soils, mostly driven by monocultures and extractivist activities. 3) The Disaster landscapes which are those where anthropogenic impacts lead to increase the disturbances of socio-natural disasters. This type of theoretical discussion article aims to contribute to the discussion of the various disciplines that make up landscape studies.

AB Anthropomorphic changes to the environment can sometimes unintentionally benefit ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) when habitats are made favorable for nesting. We examined the effects of a hiking trail on nest abundance of Pogonomyrmex barbatus (Smith) and Novomessor cockerelli (Andre) harvester ants at Clear Creek, AZ. Nest abundance for both species was compared along paired transects on- and off-trail. P. barbatus was twice as abundant on-trail while N. cockerelli showed a similar directional trend, but the differences were not significant. To test potential mechanisms driving the increase on-trails, soil and habitat differences were compared. Soil compaction was two times greater and canopy cover was five times less on- versus off-trails. For P. barbatus, which nests in soil, we compared on- and off-nest soils, both on- and off-trail. Soil 5 m away from ant nests was twice as compacted whether on- or off-trail. Reduction of canopy cover and compaction of soils might create beneficial nesting conditions for the two species of ant, leading to greater abundance near the hiking trail. Increase of stinging insects near recreational trails might pose health risks, especially in remote areas distant from medical treatment. We discuss management considerations and potential ecological consequences of increased abundance of ants along trails.

AB Pilgerodendron uviferum (D. Don) Florin is an endemic, threatened conifer that grows in South America. In the sub-Antarctic territory, one of the most isolated places in the world, some forest patches remain untouched since the last glaciation. In this study, we analyze the tree structure and tree diversity and characterize the environmental conditions where P. uviferum-dominated stands develop within the Magellanic islands in Kawesqar National Park, Chile. An environmental matrix using the databases WorldClim and SoilGrids and local topography variables was used to identify the main environmental variables that explain the P. uviferum-dominated stands. PCA was used to reduce the environmental variables, and PERMANOVA and nMDS were used to evaluate differences among forest communities. The results show that two forest communities are present within the Magellanic islands. Both forest communities share the fact that they can persist over time due to the high water table that limits the competitive effect from other tree species less tolerant to high soil water table and organic matter. Our results contribute to knowledge of the species' environmental preference and design conservation programs.

AB Conversion of natural to anthropogenic environments affects biodiversity, and the understanding of these impacts may be improved by assessing how different functional groups respond to such land conversion. We studied land conversion impacts on ant functional groups, as ants are ecologically important and respond well to various environmental changes. We hypothesized that conversion of natural to anthropogenic environments modifies the composition of functional groups, fostering generalist and opportunistic groups over specialist ones, with more responses of this type in tropical than in temperate regions. We recovered 412 papers from ISI Web of Science, of which we selected 17 studies, published between 1993 and 2018, that addressed our study's question. We assessed whether each functional group responded positively or negatively to conversion of natural habitat into anthropogenic land uses and used Monte Carlo tests to assess significance. Ants were affected by natural habitat conversion into monoculture and polyculture and by the conversion of savannas and of tropical and subtropical forests. Land conversion affected six of the 13 functional groups assessed here. In the temperate zone, cryptic species, predators, subordinate Camponotini, cold-climate specialists and tropical-climate specialists were impaired, whereas hot-climate specialists were favored. In the tropics, land conversion negatively impacted fungus-growers and predators. In both climatic zones, several functional groups, mainly those with broad ecological niches, did not respond to land conversion. Our results corroborate that land conversion effects vary among ant functional groups and indicate that the ant fauna of temperate ecosystems may be more susceptible than that of tropical regions.

AB Terrestrial species from the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) are under high threat due to deforestation and overhunting. Previous studies have even defined these forests as subjected to an "empty forest syndrome", a condition in which forests that are apparently well preserved are instead almost deprived of vertebrate faunas due to extreme exploitation by local communities. Forest specialists, including several primates, are among the most threatened species in the country. The Laotian langur (Trachypithecus laotum) is endemic to Lao PDR, is listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List, and it is one of the least studied species in the region. A survey on the local distribution, life history and conservation status of the Laotian langur was carried out in Phou Hin Poun National Protected Area, Khammouane Province of Lao PDR. The survey consisted of an initial phase with interviews to select key informants on the Laotian langur and the other primate species of the area. Then, a phase of field surveys along forest transects, totaling 64.1 km of 21 transects, yielded a record of 35 individuals in 9 groups. The highest encounter/detection rate of the Laotian langur was 1 group per km at one sector of the park. In contrast, it was much lower (0.18-0.34 groups/km) in the rest of the protected area. The group sizes were much lower than those observed in the same area between 1994 and 2010, thus suggesting a decline in the population size of langurs. This decline may be linked to habitat loss (timber extraction and mining). Still, also overhunting, as signs of poaching were observed during our field surveys. This was also supported by the reports of our interviewees. Laotian langurs were observed to be sympatric and interact while foraging with the Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis). In the cases of sympatric occurrence between the two species, we observed that subtle mechanisms of niche partitioning may occur to reduce interspecific competition for food. Further research on the population and ecology of this endangered langur should be conducted to understand the species and aid its conservation.

AB Patterns of structural change associated with monodominant tropical forest complexes have remained enigmatic for decades. Here, we extend previous efforts in presenting a longitudinal, local-scale analysis of forest dynamics in central Africa. Using four 10-ha census plots measured across three time periods (959,312 stems >= 1 cm DBH), we analyzed changes in a number of biometrical attributes for four distinct forest types capturing the developmental gradient from mixed species forest to Gilbertiodendron dewevrei-dominated forest. We modeled above-ground biomass (AGB), basal area (BA), and stem density across all species, and diameter at breast height (DBH), recruitment, and mortality for Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. We hypothesized that trends in these attributes are consistent with a slow spread of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei into adjacent mixed species forest. We identified statistically significant increases in AGB and BA across sites and positive, though nonsignificant, increases in AGB and BA for most forest types. DBH and relative recruitment increased significantly for Gilbertiodendron dewevrei stems, while relative mortality did not. When looking from mixed species to transitional to monodominant forest types, we found a statistically significant pattern of developmental aggradation and net expansion of monodominant forest. We do not attribute this to atmospheric forcing but to a combination of (a) landscape-scale recovery or response to widespread disturbance (primarily historical fires), (b) Gilbertiodendron dewevrei's ectomycorrhizal association, and (c) Gilbertiodendron dewevrei's exceptional stress tolerance traits.

AB Land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes are major drivers of biodiversity loss in semi-arid regions, such as the Caatinga biome located in the Northeast of Brazil. We investigated landscape dynamics and fragmentation in an area of the Sao Francisco Valley in the Brazilian Caatinga biome and measured the effect of these dynamics on ecological, functional and structural connectivity over a 33-year period (1985-2018). We calculated landscape connectivity indices based on graph theory to quantify the effect of further agricultural expansion on ecological connectivity at the landscape scale. We used a multicriteria decision analysis that integrates graph-based connectivity indices at the habitat patch scale, combined with an index of human disturbance to identify patches that, if conserved and restored, preserve the connectivity of the landscape most effectively. In the period studied, agriculture increased at a rate of 2104 ha/year, while native Caatinga vegetation decreased at a rate of 5203 ha/year. Both dense and open Caatinga became more fragmented, with the number of fragments increasing by 85.2% and 28.6%, respectively, whilst the average fragment size decreased by 84.8% and 6.1% for dense and open Caatinga, respectively. If agriculture patches were to expand by a 300 m buffer around each patch, the overall ecological connectivity could be reduced by 6-15%, depending on the species' (small- to mid-size terrestrial vertebrates) mobility characteristics for which the connectivity indices were calculated. We provided explicit spatial connectivity and fragmentation information for the conservation and restoration of the Caatinga vegetation in the studied area. This information helps with conservation planning in this rapidly changing ecosystem.

AB Tropical owls are one of the most threatened groups of birds. Studying the association between landscape features and owl assemblages is challenging due to the logistical difficulties of nocturnal fieldwork. We analyzed the association of landscape composition and spatial configuration of forest cover with the composition of the owl assemblages in a tropical rainforest in southeastern Mexico. During the 2014 reproductive season (April to June), we estimated owl abundance through auditory detection and playbacks at 60 survey points distributed in 12 landscapes (625 ha each) within a gradient of forest cover. We found that the owl community comprised six out of the 10 expected resident species. The landscape unit with 41% forest cover contained the most diverse assemblage. The owl species most susceptible to local extinction were specialists of interior areas of old-growth forest. The abundances of the Middle American Screech-Owl (Megascops guatemalae), Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus), and Black-and-white Owl (Ciccaba nigrolineata) were positively associated with the proportion of forest cover as well as with the average size of the patches, but negatively associated with environmental temperature. The abundances of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) were positively related to the amount of urban area in the landscape. The only species recorded along the entire gradient was the Mottled Owl (Ciccaba virgata), a species that is a generalist in habitat and diet; its abundance was positively related to the proportion of forest cover and the amount of water surface (lakes and rivers) in the landscape. Four resident species were not recorded: Crested Owl (Lophostrix cristata), Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata), Striped Owl (Pseudoscops clamator), and Central American Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium griseiceps).

AB Habitat islands can be defined as distinct patches of habitat surrounded by less contrasting matrix types. In contrast to true island biogeography (traditionally the study of islands surrounded by water), there have been less efforts to synthesize the myriad habitat island biogeography studies that have been published, particularly syntheses that cover the full range of habitat island types. By building on previous work, I aim to provide a review of habitat island biogeography in order to provide a blueprint for future research on habitat islands, including both naturally and anthropogenically fragmented systems. The review is organized into three main parts. First, the differences between habitat and true islands are summarized. Second, the main theoretical frameworks currently used to analyze habitat island systems are reviewed. Third, the findings of habitat island studies focused on various biological patterns are synthesized. Drawing on this synthesis, I put forward two main points regarding improving our understanding of habitat island biogeography: first, increasing the integration of matrix properties (including matrix variation across space and time) into habitat island biogeographic models and, second, testing for, and understanding the implications of, the potential prevalence of mass effects and source-sink dynamics in habitat island systems.

AB African forests are under increasing pressure to supply local, regional, and international demand for timber. Much of this trade is unregulated, such that there is increasing concern regarding the ecological sustainability of this resource use. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the ecological impact of informal timber harvesting in African forests. While forest species have adapted to natural canopy gap dynamics, harvesting may alter natural disturbance regimes, with adverse effects on biodiversity. Information regarding harvest gaps, and concomitant impacts on habitat and biodiversity is thus essential to inform sustainable management. This study compared the frequency and nature of harvest gaps and natural gaps in a coastal forest in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, where informal selective timber harvesting occurs. Habitat condition and bird species richness and composition were compared across intact forest, natural gaps, and harvest gaps. Harvest-created gaps increased the number of canopy gaps by 30%, but were comparable with natural gaps in size. Habitat conditions in harvest gaps represented an intermediate state between intact forest and natural gaps, thereby increasing forest-scale habitat heterogeneity. While bird species richness was not affected, species composition differed across intact forest, harvest gaps and natural gaps, driven by changes in habitat condition, and mediated by species' feeding and nesting traits. Specifically, insectivores, cavity- and ground-nesting species, and hawking and arboreal probing species were negatively affected by the habitat gradient from intact sites to canopy gap conditions, while nectarivores, omnivores and ball/cup nesting species were positively affected. Thus, while the single-tree selective harvesting method used by informal harvesters largely emulated natural canopy disturbances, the harvest-mediated increase in the frequency of canopy gaps may reduce the abundance of certain bird species sensitive to canopy gap conditions and reduce forest-scale beta-diversity.

AB The ability of ecosystems to withstand disturbances and maintain their functions is being increasingly tested as rates of change intensify due to climate change and other human activities. Microorganisms are crucial players underpinning ecosystem functions, and the recovery of microbial communities from disturbances is therefore a key part of the complex processes determining the fate of ecosystem functioning. However, despite global environmental change consisting of numerous pressures, it is unclear and controversial how multiple disturbances affect microbial community stability and what consequences this has for ecosystem functions. This is particularly the case for those multiple or compounded disturbances that occur more frequently than the normal recovery time. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the mechanisms that can govern the responses of microbes to multiple disturbances across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We first summarize and discuss properties and mechanisms that influence resilience in aquatic and soil biomes to determine whether there are generally applicable principles. Following, we focus on interactions resulting from inherent characteristics of compounded disturbances, such as the nature of the disturbance, timing, and chronology that can lead to complex and nonadditive effects that are modulating the response of microorganisms.

AB Central Chile is an important biodiversity hotspot in Latin America. Biodiversity hotspots are characterised by a high number of endemic species cooccurring with a high level of anthropogenic pressure. In central Chile, the pressure is caused by land-use change, in which near-natural primary and secondary forests are replaced and fragmented by commercial pine and eucalyptus plantations. Large forest fires are another factor that can potentially endanger biodiversity. Usually, environmental hazards, such as wildfires, are part of the regular environmental dynamic and not considered a threat to biodiversity. Nonetheless, this situation may change if land- use change and altered wildfire regimes coerce. Land-use change pressure may destroy landscape integrity in terms of habitat loss and fragmentation, while wildfires may destroy the last remnants of native forests. This study aims to understand the joint effects of land-use change and a catastrophic wildfire on habitat loss and habitat fragmentation of local plant species richness hotspots in central Chile. To achieve this, we apply a combination of ecological fieldwork, remote sensing, and geoprocessing to estimate the spread and spatial patterns of biodiverse habitats under current and past land-use conditions and how these habitats were altered by land-use change and by a single large wildfire event. We show that land-use change has exceeded the wildfire's impacts on diverse habitats. Despite the fact that the impact of the wildfire was comparably small here, wildfire may coerce with land-use change regarding pressure on biodiversity hotspots. Our findings can be used to develop restoration concepts, targeting on an increase of habitat diversity within currently fire-cleared areas and evaluate their benefits for plant species richness conservation.

   RESPONSES
AB Plants face multiple biotic and abiotic stressors simultaneously. Many species can tolerate and resist stress, but countermeasures differ between roots and leaves. Since herbivores and environmental conditions modulate costs and benefits of plant defence traits, stress responses are context-dependent. We examined whole-plant tolerance and resistance responses to individual and combined effects of above and belowground herbivory under variable water conditions.
   We manipulated water availability and access by two common herbivores (Spodoptera exigua caterpillars and Meloidogyne incognita nematodes) to Solanum lycocarpum. Plants were either watered based on historical regional averages or the 30% reduction predicted by IPCC studies. Herbivory treatments included isolated above (AG) and belowground (BG) attacks, simultaneous (AGBG) attacks and no-herbivory controls. We then parameterized generalized linear mixed-effects models with data on plant survival, leaf and root biomass accumulation, root complexity and terpenoid concentration.
   Foliar herbivory increased terpenoid concentrations in roots relative to no-herbivory plants under control water but decreased concentrations in both roots and leaves under drought. Similarly, root feeders increased concentrations of terpenoids in leaves under control water but decreased concentrations only in roots under drought. Plants challenged with AGBG herbivory had greater whole-plant biomass (i.e. tolerance) and lower total concentrations of defensive compounds (i.e. resistance) than plants exposed to no-herbivore controls, regardless of water conditions. Importantly, the capacity of plants to grow or produce terpenoids changes when herbivory level is considered. In plants exposed to AGBG herbivory, greater nematode infection was related to decreases in whole-plant biomass and marginal increases in total terpenoid concentration. Ultimately, accounting only for individual AG and BG responses would have led to different conclusions and underestimated the magnitude of S. lycocarpum's compensatory responses. A 'whole-plant' approach revealed that belowground herbivory is the primary driver of tolerance in plants surviving moderate water stress.
   Synthesis. Whole-plant responses to stress in variable environments are complex, and their comprehensive understanding requires accounting for belowground herbivores and root responses.

AB Synopsis One of the reasons why flowering plants became the most diverse group of land plants is their association with animals to reproduce. The earliest examples of this mutualism involved insects foraging for food from plants and, in the process, pollinating them. Vertebrates are latecomers to these mutualisms, but birds, in particular, present a wide variety of nectar-feeding clades that have adapted to solve similar challenges. Such challenges include surviving on small caloric rewards widely scattered across the landscape, matching their foraging strategy to nectar replenishment rate, and efficiently collecting this liquid food from well-protected chambers deep inside flowers. One particular set of convergent traits among plants and their bird pollinators has been especially well studied: the match between the shape and size of bird bills and ornithophilous flowers. Focusing on a highly specialized group, hummingbirds, we examine the expected benefits from bill-flower matching, with a strong focus on the benefits to the hummingbird and how to quantify them. Explanations for the coevolution of bill-flower matching include (1) that the evolution of traits by bird-pollinated plants, such as long and thin corollas, prevents less efficient pollinators (e.g., insects) from accessing the nectar and (2) that increased matching, as a result of reciprocal adaptation, benefits both the bird (nectar extraction efficiency) and the plant (pollen transfer). In addition to nectar-feeding, we discuss how interference and exploitative competition also play a significant role in the evolution and maintenance of trait matching. We present hummingbird-plant interactions as a model system to understand how trait matching evolves and how pollinator behavior can modify expectations based solely on morphological matching, and discuss the implications of this behavioral modulation for the maintenance of specialization. While this perspective piece directly concerns hummingbird-plant interactions, the implications are much broader. Functional trait matching is likely common in coevolutionary interactions (e.g., in predator-prey interactions), yet the physical mechanisms underlying trait matching are understudied and rarely quantified. We summarize existing methods and present novel approaches that can be used to quantify key benefits to interacting partners in a variety of ecological systems.

AB Humans have used non-human primates (hereafter referred to as primates) as food source, medicine, parts of rituals, pets, and models for various studies worldwide. Here we investigated the extent of the use of primates by humans in three areas in northeastern Brazil, the country's most impoverished region. We carried out our study in three biomes (Caatinga, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest). The results showed that humans exploited all five primate species occurring in the study sites: Callithrix jacchus, Sapajus flavius, Sapajus libidinosus, Alouatta belzebul, and Alouatta ululata. They used the primates as a food source, as pets and medicines, and for leisure. Despite socioeconomic differences in the study areas, we found similarities in the use of primates. Larger primates were targeted for meat, whereas the small common marmosets were targeted as pets. We found conflicting interactions between humans and bearded capuchins due to crop raiding, but no such conflict was found between humans and blonde capuchins, reflecting the differences in crop type, pattern, and tradition in the sites. A. ululata was used as medicine. We suggest that environmental education actions in the study areas should focus on (i) raising awareness among local people of the ecological importance of primates, (ii) providing alternative activities to hunting whenever possible, and (iii) minimising conflicts.

AB Although many studies have focused on the effects of the environment and area on local patterns of species richness, few studies have demonstrated how to reconcile the availability of more niches with smaller habitat areas in heterogeneous localities. Here, the environmental range that a species prefers was defined as a niche; a space was defined as an available space if the environmental range of the space matches a niche; and the metric 'environmental range per unit space (ERUS)' was presented to describe the heterogeneity of localities. Because the spaces with stressful environmental ranges, outside the niche, increased with increasing heterogeneity, available spaces did not continue to indefinitely increase, but the proportion of available spaces in spaces was low at high heterogeneous localities. Consequently, the probability of species occurring in their respective available spaces was unimodal. Due to the presence of large spaces in homogenous localities and more spaces in heterogeneous localities, the interval distances between nonadjacent spaces were large in these localities. Together, the changes in the number and proportion of available spaces and distance between spaces determined the unimodal probability of species dispersing into their respective available spaces. Thus, the probability of species coexisting was unimodal because it is important for coexisting species to grow in their respective available spaces. The probability of population extinction increased with increasing heterogeneity because the available spaces became narrower. In this way, the ERUS strongly influence species richness: a unimodal richness along the heterogeneity gradient occurred in suitable, suboptimal and stressful environments and a unimodal algae richness occurred in a lake and river. These results challenge the viewpoint that richness increases with heterogeneity, providing information about the conservation of richness in very homogeneous and heterogeneous regions, and highlighting the importance of balancing the roles of environment and space in understanding and predicting richness.

AB Urban forest remnants contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in urban areas. Hence, understanding the dynamics and the potential of urban forests as carbon pools is crucial to propose effective policies addressing the ecosystem services' maintenance. Remote sensing technologies such as Light detection and ranging (Lidar) are alternatives to acquire information on urban forests accurately. In this paper, we evaluate a UAV-Lidar system's potential to derive individual tree heights of Araucaria angustifolia trees in an Urban Atlantic Forest. Additionally, the influence of point density when deriving tree heights was assessed (2500, 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 10 and 5 returns.m(-2)). The UAV-Lidar data was collected with the GatorEye Unmanned Flying Laboratory 'Generation 2'. The UAV-Lidar-derived and field-based tree heights were compared by statistical analysis. Higher densities of points allowed a better description of tree profiles. Lower densities presented gaps in the Crown Height Model (CHM). The highest agreement between UAV-Lidar-derived and fieldbased tree heights (r = 0.73) was noticed when using 100 returns.m(-2). The lowest rRMSE was observed for 50 returns.m(-2) (8.35 %). There are no explicit differences in derived tree heights using 25 to 2500 returns.m(-2). UAV-Lidar data presented satisfactory performance when deriving individual tree heights of Araucaria angustifolia trees.

AB Tropical forests are notable for their high species diversity, even on small spatial scales, and right-skewed species and size abundance distributions. The role of individual species as drivers of the spatial organization of diversity in these forests has been explained by several hypotheses and processes, for example, stochastic dilution, negative density dependence, or gap dynamics. These processes leave a signature in spatial distribution of small trees, particularly in the vicinity of large trees, likely having stronger effects on their neighbors. We are exploring species diversity patterns within the framework of various diversity-generating hypotheses using individual species-area relationships. We used the data from three tropical forest plots (Wanang-Papua New Guinea, Barro Colorado Island-Panama, and Sinharaja-Sri Lanka) and included also the saplings (DBH >= 1 cm). Resulting cross-size patterns of species richness and evenness reflect the dynamics of saplings affected by the distribution of large trees. When all individuals with DBH >= 1 cm are included, similar to 50% of all tree species from the 25- or 50-ha plot can be found within 35 m radius of an individual tree. For all trees, 72%-78% of species were identified as species richness accumulators, having more species present in their surroundings than expected by null models. This pattern was driven by small trees as the analysis of DBH >10 cm trees showed much lower proportion of accumulators, 14%-65% of species identified as richness repellers and had low richness of surrounding small trees. Only 11%-26% of species had lower species evenness than was expected by null models. High proportions of species richness accumulators were probably due to gap dynamics and support Janzen-Connell hypothesis driven by competition or top-down control by pathogens and herbivores. Observed species diversity patterns show the importance of including small tree size classes in analyses of the spatial organization of diversity.

AB A key to understanding life's great diversity is discerning how competing organisms divide limiting resources to coexist in diverse communities. While temporal resource partitioning has long been hypothesized to reduce the negative effects of interspecific competition, empirical evidence suggests that time may not often be an axis along which animal species routinely subdivide resources. Here, we present evidence to the contrary in the world's most biodiverse group of animals: insect parasites (parasitoids). Specifically, we conducted a meta-analysis of 64 studies from 41 publications to determine if temporal resource partitioning via variation in the timing of a key life-history trait, egg deposition (oviposition), mitigates interspecific competition between species pairs sharing the same insect host. When competing species were manipulated to oviposit at (or near) the same time in or on a single host in the laboratory, competition was common, and one species was typically inherently superior (i.e. survived to adulthood a greater proportion of the time). In most cases, however, the inferior competitor could gain a survivorship advantage by ovipositing earlier (or in a smaller number of cases later) into shared hosts. Moreover, this positive (or in a few cases negative) priority advantage gained by the inferior competitor increased as the interval between oviposition times became greater. The results from manipulative experiments were also correlated with patterns of life-history timing and demography in nature: the more inherently competitively inferior a species was in the laboratory, the greater the interval between oviposition times of taxa in co-occurring populations. Additionally, the larger the interval between oviposition times of competing taxa, the more abundant the inferior species was in populations where competitors were known to coexist. Overall, our findings suggest that temporal resource partitioning via variation in oviposition timing may help to facilitate species coexistence and structures diverse insect communities by altering demographic measures of species success. We argue that the lack of evidence for a more prominent role of temporal resource partitioning in promoting species coexistence may reflect taxonomic differences, with a bias towards larger-sized animals. For smaller species like parasitic insects that are specialized to attack one or a group of closely related hosts, have short adult lifespans and discrete generation times, compete directly for limited resources in small, closed arenas and have life histories constrained by host phenology, temporal resource subdivision via variation in life history may play a critical role in allowing species to coexist by alleviating the negative effects of interspecific competition.

AB Quantifying the abundance of species is essential to ecology, evolution, and conservation. The distribution of species abundances is fundamental to numerous longstanding questions in ecology, yet the empirical pattern at the global scale remains unresolved, with a few species' abundance well known but most poorly characterized. In large part because of heterogeneous data, few methods exist that can scale up to all species across the globe. Here, we integrate data from a suite of well-studied species with a global dataset of bird occurrences throughout the world-for 9,700 species (-92% of all extant species)-and use missing data theory to estimate speciesspecific abundances with associated uncertainty. We find strong evidence that the distribution of species abundances is log left skewed: there are many rare species and comparatively few common species. By aggregating the species-level estimates, we find that there are -50 billion individual birds in the world at present. The global-scale abundance estimates that we provide will allow for a line of inquiry into the structure of abundance across biogeographic realms and feeding guilds as well as the consequences of life history (e.g., body size, range size) on population dynamics. Importantly, our method is repeatable and scalable: as data quantity and quality increase, our accuracy in tracking temporal changes in global biodiversity will increase. Moreover, we provide the methodological blueprint for quantifying species-specific abundance, along with uncertainty, for any organism in the world.

AB Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) are often involved in fundamental ecological processes such as plant succession and species coexistence. After a plant initiating PSFs dies, legacies of PSFs occurring as soil signatures that influence subsequent plants could persist for an unknown duration. Altered resource environments following plant death (especially light availability) could affect whether legacy effects manifest and persist. To evaluate PSFs and their legacies, we obtained soils from a chronosequence of Prunus serotina harvests. In a greenhouse experiment, we planted conspecific seedlings under two light levels in these soils of varying time since the influence of live Prunus serotina, and compared seed/seedling survival in soils from live trees, stumps, and surrounding forest matrix within each site and across the chronosequence. PSF legacies were measured as the difference between seedling performance in live tree and stump soils within a site. Negative PSF legacies of P. serotina were short-lived, lasting up to 0.5 years after tree removal. These effects occurred under 5% but not 30% full sun. PSFs and their legacies manifested in seed/seedling survival, but not biomass. Though restricted to low light, short-lived legacies of P. serotina PSFs could have lasting impacts on plant community dynamics during post-disturbance regeneration by disfavoring P. serotina regeneration in small tree-fall gaps.

AB Different interactions occur simultaneously, affecting the ecological and evolutionary outcome of the species within a community. Mutualisms are particularly relevant for maintaining and generating biodiversity, and among them, pollination and seed dispersal play a central role in plant regeneration. Due to its parasitic life-form and ecological specialization, mistletoes provide a good study system to assess the effects of simultaneous interactions in the wild. We used the highly specialized mistletoe Tristerix aphyllus, its pollinator (the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes), and its seed disperser (the mockingbird Mimus thenca) to assess their daily activity patterns during a flowering-fruiting overlap period. Given that both bird species are diurnal, we expect them to have different visitation times despite using different resources. Using camera traps, we found that both species have different daily activity patterns (overlap index (Delta) over cap (4) = 0.83, p < 0.001). While M. thenca had a narrow activity period early in the morning, S. sephaniodes had a wider activity range. We also found that the temporal variation of those activity patterns might be related to resource availability, as the number of flowers has decreased (F-2,F-52 = 13.85, p < 0.001) over time, while the number of ripe fruits has increased (F-2,F-52 = 5.16, p = 0.009) over time. Our results show that having different activity patterns could be a coexistence mechanism among bird species interacting with the same plant but exploiting different resources. Thus, taking activity patterns into account can provide a better understanding of ecological processes involving multiple interactions taking place simultaneously in the community.

AB Stream and river systems transport and process substantial amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and aquatic sources to the ocean, with global biogeochemical implications. However, the underlying mechanisms affecting the spatiotemporal organization of DOM composition are under-investigated. To understand the principles governing DOM composition, we leverage the recently proposed synthesis of metacommunity ecology and metabolomics, termed 'meta-metabolome ecology.' Applying this novel approach to a freshwater ecosystem, we demonstrated that despite similar molecular properties across metabolomes, metabolite identity significantly diverged due to environmental filtering and variations in putative biochemical transformations. We refer to this phenomenon as 'thermodynamic redundancy,' which is analogous to the ecological concept of functional redundancy. We suggest that under thermodynamic redundancy, divergent metabolomes can support equivalent biogeochemical function just as divergent ecological communities can support equivalent ecosystem function. As these analyses are performed in additional ecosystems, potentially generalizable concepts, like thermodynamic redundancy, can be revealed and provide insight into DOM dynamics.

AB Experimental and observational studies on seedling dynamics posit mechanisms that can influence forest diversity, structure and function. However, high mortality and slow growth of seedlings make it difficult to evaluate the importance of this life-history filter to total tree life history. Quantifying the duration and transition of the seedling phase would help us understand this 'black box' in tree population biology.
   We used a 16-year dataset of comprehensive seedling-to-sapling demography from a subtropical rainforest to construct population models that capture temporal demographic fluctuations for eight major tree species. We used data-driven demographic models and simulations to estimate the transition ratios from newly recruited seedlings to saplings of 2-m height and the time taken to attain 2-m height for a newly recruited seedling conditional on its survival.
   Projections among species estimated that as few as 57 to more than 40,000 seedlings (with a median of 2,087) were required to make a single 2-m high sapling. Furthermore, it would take 22-200 years (with a median of 47) for a newly recruited seedling to become a 2-m high sapling. We found that temporal variation in demographic rates could greatly reduce the number of seedlings per established sapling, but not passage times (PTs). We also identified the importance of consistently fast growth rates for seedlings to escape the high mortality of early stages.
   Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that high mortality in the very early seedling stage severely limits the probability that a newly recruited seedling will transition to the sapling stage. Although the PTs vary, we found this to be true across species with a range of life-history strategies. Only seedlings with consistently fast growth rates are expected to pass through this life-history filter. Findings from seedling studies should consider how short-term studies of seedling demography might capture the rare exceptional individuals and exceptional conditions that might define the dynamics of this seedling bottleneck.

AB Understanding the processes that underlie the effects of tree diversity on primary production is of foremost importance to enhance climate change mitigation by tropical forests. Here, we investigated the effects of tree diversity on light interception over space and time in two tropical tree experiments, located in Panama-Sardinilla site (monocultures to 18-species mixtures), and in Brazil-Anhembi site (20- to 114-species mixtures).
   We assessed intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (iPAR) over horizontal grids and vertical transects (up to 5 m high in Sardinilla and up to 4 m high in Anhembi), in plots containing different richness levels and combinations of species.
   Light interception increased from monocultures to 5-species mixtures in Sardinilla and from 20- to 114-species mixtures in Anhembi (during the dry season). At the Sardinilla site, five-species mixtures showed iPAR comparable to the best performing monocultures, despite substantial differences observed among monocultures. Diversity-iPAR relationships changed seasonally and were more pronounced during the dry season. Tree richness promoted a less variable temporal and spatial (i.e. both horizontal and vertical) distribution of light interception.
   Synthesis. High tree diversity (i.e. over a hundred species in mixture) maximizes the amount of light intercepted by the canopy in restored tropical forests through more even capture in space and time. Diversity-light interception relationships should be critically considered for designing cost-efficient large-scale tropical forest restoration programs.

AB Cover crops and reduced tillage are two elements of conservation agriculture with potential to support larger and more diverse soil biological communities. Soil macrofauna can be indicators of soil quality and can regulate multiple soil functions, but their response to cover crop adoption in temperate regions is not well studied. We evaluated soil macrofauna communities and related soil quality metrics in response to a 16-year winter cover crop and tillage trial located in the San Joaquin Valley of California, USA. The most abundant taxa were Coleoptera (beetles) and Lumbricidae (earthworms), with average densities ranging between 5 and 318 beetles m- 2 and 65-480 earthworms m- 2 depending on sample date and treatments. Overall macrofauna abundance increased by 93% with the addition of cover crops in rotation, and 50% with the elimination of tillage. Taxonomic richness increased by 48% with cover crops in treatments managed without tillage, though there was no effect of cover crops under standard tillage. Macrofauna abundance was positively related to total soil carbon, water infiltration, and soil aggregate stability. Macrofauna community composition was best explained by soil carbon, water stable aggregate fraction, and cover crop usage. Agricultural management practices that foster soil biological communities may support biodiversity and improve environmental outcomes critical for sustainable food production.

AB Forest conservation on privately owned lands is a cornerstone of the Brazilian environmental policy framework. Brazilian legislation requires that all farms in the country maintain and protect forest areas known as Legal Reserves. Since Legal Reserves have major implications for forest conservation and agricultural production, it is key that we understand landholders' perceptions towards Legal Reserves. We applied Q methodology to identify different perspectives of medium and large landholders on Legal Reserves and their relation to agricultural intensification in the municipality of Paragominas, eastern Amazon. We conducted 31 interviews in which landholders sorted 36 statements in a quasi-normal distribution array. Three groups of landholders were identified: 1) Land use planning enthusiasts (n = 16) were interested in zoning initiatives to explore alternative landscape designs and legislation that may deliver better conservation and production outcomes; 2) Agrochemical-based agriculture supporters (n = 7) held the most critical views against Legal Reserves and perceived their costs as higher than the potential environmental and life quality benefits; 3) Policy complacentmarket responders (n = 4) showed no interest in Legal Reserves reforms and were the most market driven group.. While Paragominas has achieved notable successes in halting large-scale deforestation through a social "Green Municipality" pact, addressing persisting forest degradation and fragmentation in the region remains a key priority. Local governance initiatives that account for multi-stakeholder perceptions on forest conservation can foster dialogue and mutual understanding to effectively conserve and restore Legal Reserves. Insights on large landholders' perceptions on Legal Reserves can inform such governance processes to reconcile forest conservation and sustainable agricultural intensification in Paragominas.

AB Population Biology of Palm Heart (Euterpe edulisMartius-Arecaceae) in Managed Landscape Units in Southern Brazil. The use of natural areas throughout history has created landscape mosaics. The landscape units assessed in this study on Euterpe edulis populations in southern Brazil consisted of secondary forests, rural homegardens, and sites inside a protected area (PA). Our goal was to compare the level of conservation of E. edulis populations in three landscape units in order to verify the influence of management practices. Twelve homegardens, four areas in secondary forests in rural properties, and several areas in a sustainable use PA were assessed. Population structure differed among the three groups of landscape units. The population density of E. edulis was higher in smaller size classes (seedling, young I) in the PA and in larger size classes (reproductive) in homegardens, whereas both situations occurred in secondary forests. Genetic divergence varied 0.001 and 0.0023 between landscape groups. The highest variation in genetic diversity indexes was recorded in homegardens, with the presence of alleles that were not found in the protected area. Genetic diversity indexes varied less in the protected area, while the average values were higher in secondary forests. We therefore concluded that the sites assessed outside protected areas also contribute to the conservation of this palm species.

AB Identifying knowledge gaps and the potential biases and limitations of biological databases is essential for biogeographical research, to efficiently plan biodiversity surveys, and to accurately design conservation efforts. Here we describe the taxonomic, temporal, and spatial coverage of a comprehensive database mainly composed of data collected between 1963 and 2003 of the largest clade of Neotropical lianas, the tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae). We assess the level of database completeness and propose new survey areas to fill knowledge gaps and optimize sampling coverage. The Bignonieae database includes 28,763 records representing 98% of the known species. The database covers 72% of the Neotropical region and includes data collected mainly during the last 40 years of the 20th century. Members of the tribe are conspicuous components of lowland forests, with most species showing narrow range sizes. The Amazon rainforest is the most under-sampled region and the area with the lowest sampling rate. On the other hand, the best sampled areas are scattered across Central America, the Peruvian and Bolivian Amazon, and selected Brazilian cities. Sampling rate across the geographical extent of Bignonieae was best predicted by the distance from cities. Collection effort is needed across the Neotropics so that a higher number of localities can be sampled, especially in the Amazon, where Bignonieae is centered. New surveys are urgently needed to maximize new species discoveries and to effectively design conservation plans that maximize biodiversity-rich regions facing increased threat.

AB Aim Climatic extremes and fire affect ecosystems across the globe, yet our understanding of how species are influenced by the interaction of these broadscale ecological drivers is poorly understood. Using a ten-year dataset, we tested how extreme drought and rainfall interacted with time since fire (TSF) to shape bird species' distributions.
   Location Semi-arid mallee woodlands of south-eastern Australia.
   Methods We quantified the effects of climatic extremes on bird species' occurrence, species richness and incidence at 180 sites across three climatic periods-an El Nino-associated drought (the "Big Dry"), immediately after La Nina drought-breaking rainfall ("Big Wet") and three years following the La Nina event ("Post-Big Wet"). We then compared species' responses with TSF across the three climatic periods using a chronosequence of sites from 1 to 117 years post-fire.
   Results La Nina rainfall had sustained impacts on species' occurrence. Over half of species increased significantly during the Big Wet. Despite three intervening years of below-average rainfall, three quarters of these species remained comparably high, Post-Big Wet. By contrast, less than half of threatened and declining species benefited from high rainfall. Responses of species to TSF were found to differ contingent on climatic conditions: almost twice as many species responded to TSF during the Big Wet and almost three times as many Post-Big Wet, compared with the Big Dry. Across climatic periods, a majority of species showed preference for mid to older post-fire vegetation.
   Main conclusions Variation in responses to TSF is likely due to the effect of climatic variation on resources. We suggest that, at sites of different post-fire age, interactions between TSF and climate may differentially influence both the availability and longevity of resources. Given climatic extremes are predicted to become increasingly severe with climate change, accounting for their influence on fauna-fire dynamics will require careful management of fire.

AB Epigraph: "The house is burning. We do not need a thermometer. We need a fire hose." (P. 102, Janzen and Hallwachs, 2019). Insectivorous birds are declining widely, and for diverse reasons. Tropical insectivorous birds, more than 60% of all tropical birds, are particularly sensitive to human disturbances including habitat loss and fragmentation, intensive agriculture and pesticide use, and climate change; and the mechanisms are incompletely understood. This review addresses multiple, complementary and sometimes synergistic explanations for tropical insectivore declines, by categorizing explanations into ultimate vs. proximate, and direct versus indirect. Ultimate explanations are diverse human Anthropocene activities and the evolutionary history of these birds. This evolutionary history, synthesized by the Biotic Challenge Hypothesis (BCH), explains tropical insectivorous birds' vulnerabilities to many proximate threats as a function of both these birds' evolutionary feeding specialization and poor dispersal capacity. These traits were favored evolutionarily by both the diversity of insectivorous clades competing intensely for prey and co-evolution with arthropods over long evolutionary time periods. More proximate, ecological threats include bottom-up forces like declining insect populations, top-down forces like meso-predator increases, plus the Anthropocene activities underlying these factors, especially habitat loss and fragmentation, agricultural intensification, and climate change. All these conditions peak in the lowland, mainland Neotropics, where insectivorous bird declines have been repeatedly documented, but also occur in other tropical locales and continents. This multiplicity of interacting evolutionary and ecological factors informs conservation implications and recommendations for tropical insectivorous birds: (1) Why they are so sensitive to global change phenomena is no longer enigmatic, (2) distinguishing ultimate versus proximate stressors matters, (3) evolutionary life-histories predispose these birds to be particularly sensitive to the Anthropocene, (4) tropical regions and continents vary with respect to these birds' ecological sensitivity, (5) biodiversity concepts need stronger incorporation of species' evolutionary histories, (6) protecting these birds will require more, larger reserves for multiple reasons, and (7) these birds have greater value than generally recognized.

AB Tropical forest regeneration after abandonment of former agricultural land depends critically on the input of tree seeds, yet seed dispersal is increasingly disrupted in contemporary human-modified landscapes. Here, we introduce the concept of seed-rain-successional feedbacks as a deterministic process in which seed rain is shaped by successional dynamics internal to a forest site and that acts to reinforce priority effects. We used a combination of time series and chronosequence approaches to investigate how the quantity and taxonomic and functional composition of seed rain change during succession and to evaluate the strength of seed-rain-successional feedbacks, relative to other deterministic and stochastic mechanisms, in secondary wet forests of Costa Rica. We found that both successional niches and seed-rain-successional feedbacks shaped successional trajectories in the seed rain. Determinism due to successional niche assembly was supported by the increasing convergence of community structure to that of a mature forest, in terms of both functional and taxonomic composition. With successional age, the proportions of large-seeded, shade-tolerant species in the seed rain increased, whereas the proportion of animal-dispersed species did not change significantly. Seed-rain-successional feedbacks increased in strength with successional age, as the proportion of immigrant seeds (species not locally represented in the site) decreased with successional age, and the composition of the seed rain became more similar to that of the adult trees at the forest site. The deterministic assembly generated by seed-rain-successional feedback likely contributed to the increasing divergence of secondary forest sites from each other during succession. To the extent that human modification of tropical forest landscapes reduces connectivity via factors such as forest cover loss, our results suggest that seed-rain-successional feedbacks are likely to increasingly shape regeneration trajectories in and amplify floristic heterogeneity among tropical secondary forests.

AB The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem.
   We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference.
   We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years.
   We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often.
   Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow.

AB Harnessing nature-based climate solutions (NbCS) to help simultaneously achieve climate and conservation goals is an attractive win-win. The contribution of NbCS to climate action relies on both biogeochemical potential and the ability to overcome environmental, economic and governance constraints for implementation. As such, estimates of additional NbCS-related terrestrial biosphere storage potential range from less than 100 GtCO(2) to more than 800 GtCO(2). In this Review, we assess the negative emissions contributions of NbCS - including reforestation, improved forest management and soil carbon sequestration - alongside their environmental, social and governance constraints. Given near-term implementation challenges and long-term biogeochemical constraints, a reasonable value for the expected impact of NbCS is up to 100-200 GtCO(2) in negative emissions for the remainder of the twenty-first century. To sustainably reach this level, focus should be on projects with clear co-benefits, and must not come at the expense of a reduction in emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, rapid decarbonization and innovation from alternative negative emissions technologies.
   Nature-based climate solutions can help meet climate mitigation goals, but estimates of their carbon storage potential vary. This Review discusses the constraints and potential contributions of increasing carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere, suggesting a conservative estimate of 100-200 GtCO(2) in negative emissions to 2100.

AB Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are a conspicuous group of ectotherms whose behavior, distribution, physiology, and fitness are regulated by temperature. Consequently, interest in traits like thermal tolerance that enable ants to survive and thrive in variable climates has increased exponentially over the past few decades. Here, we synthesize the published literature on the thermal tolerance of ants. We begin our review with discussion of common metrics: critical thermal limits, lethal thermal limits, knock-down resistance, chill-coma recovery, and supercooling. In particular, we highlight the ways each thermal metric is quantified and offer a set of methodological caveats for consideration. We next describe patterns and hypotheses for ant thermal tolerance along spatial and temporal temperature gradients. Spatially, we focus on relationships with latitude, elevation, urbanization, and microclimate. Temporally, we focus on seasonal plasticity, daily variation, dominance-thermal tolerance tradeoffs, and acclimation. We further discuss other sources of variation including evolutionary history, body size, age, castes, and nutrition. Finally, we highlight several topics of interest to ant thermal biologists, ranging in scope from methods development to the impacts of climate change.

TI Distinguishing effects of area per se and isolation from the sample-area
   effect for true islands and habitat fragments
SO ECOGRAPHY

   island biogeography; sampling effects; species&#8211; area relationship
AB The island species area relationship (ISAR) is an important tool for measuring variation in species diversity in variety of insular systems, from true-island archipelagoes to fragmented terrestrial landscapes. However, it suffers from several limitations. For example, due to the sample-area effect, positive relationships between species and area cannot be directly interpreted as evidence for deterministic effects of area per se. Additionally, richness-based analyses may obscure species-level responses to area and isolation that may better inform conservation practice. Here, we use random placement models to control for variation in abundance, occupancy and richness associated with the sample-area effect, allowing deterministic effects of area and isolation, and how they vary with species' functional traits, to be resolved using linear mixed effects models. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using a butterfly assemblage persisting on a naturally fragmented landscape of lake islands. The ISAR did not significantly deviate from random placement in relation to island area, isolation or habitat diversity, supporting stochastic assembly consistent with the sample-area effect. Such inferences support the habitat amount hypothesis, which prioritizes preserving the maximum amount of habitat irrespective of its degree of fragmentation. However, species-level analyses demonstrated that species' abundances were significantly lower on both smaller and more isolated islands than what is predicted by the sample-area effect. Moreover, effects of area per se were significantly greater for smaller, less mobile and rare species. Species' occurrences also significantly deviated from predictions of the sample-area effect in relation to island isolation. Thus, our approach illustrates that richness-based analyses not only result in incorrect inferences on mechanisms underlying ISARs, but also obscure important effects of area per se and isolation on individual species that vary with functional traits. We therefore suggest that these effects should not be solely inferred from richness-based analyses, but rather evaluated on a species-by-species basis.

AB The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the invasive European fire ant (Myrmica rubra) are both expanding throughout their sympatric range in coastal New England. Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is the causative agent of Lyme disease, and Mount Desert Island, Maine, home to Acadia National Park, currently is affected by a high Lyme disease burden. Ticks have many natural predators, including ants, although no previous studies have investigated interactions between these two species. To test the hypothesis that the presence of M. rubra alters I. scapularis abundance, we collected ticks by drag-sampling at eight ant-infested sites and eight uninfested control sites in Acadia National Park. We found that nymph density was significantly higher at ant-infested sites, while larval density was significantly higher at control sites. In addition, we conducted a laboratory bioassay to measure M. rubra aggression against I. scapularis larvae, nymphs, and adults and Dermacentor variabilis adults, and found that ant aggression was significantly higher against D. variabilis adults than I. scapularis adults. Our findings support the hypothesis that M. rubra has divergent effects across I. scapularis life stages, and we discuss possible ecological mechanisms, including optimal microclimate and predation, that could promote density of nymphs while inhibiting density of larvae.

AB Background
   Ants (Formicidae) in Mexico have usually been undersampled despite their ecological significance and their utility as environmental service providers and bioindicators. This study estimates the species richness and the narrow endemic species number of ants across Mexico. It also documents the presence of one species newly recorded in Mexico and 19 new state-based records of 14 species from central and north Mexico. No surveys have been performed in most of the localities where we report those records, suggesting the need for a higher sampling effort across the country.
   New information
   We present an ant species richness estimation and a narrow endemic ant species estimation in a grid of 0.5 degrees in Mexico. Stenamma schmitii is recorded for the first time from Mexico. Additionally, new state-based records of Azteca velox, Dorymyrmex insanus, Camponotus coruscus, Camponotus striatus, Formica propatula, Lasius latipes, Neivamyrmex melanocephalus, Neivamyrmex rugulosus, Syscia augustae, Atta texana, Cephalotes scutulatus, Crematogaster crinosa and Temnothorax andrei are recorded.

AB Grasslands are globally imperilled ecosystems due to widespread conversion to agriculture and there is a concerted effort to catalogue arthropod diversity in grasslands to guide conservation decisions. The Palouse Prairie is one such endangered grassland; a midelevation habitat found in Washington and Idaho, United States. Ants (Formicidae) are useful indicators of biodiversity and historical ecological disturbance, but there has been no structured sampling of ants in the Palouse Prairie. To fill this gap, we employed a rapid inventory sampling approach using pitfall traps to capture peak ant activity in five habitat fragments. We complemented our survey with a systemic review of field studies for the ant species found in Palouse Prairie. Our field inventory yielded 17 ant species across 10 genera and our models estimate the total ant species pool to be 27. The highest ant diversity was found in an actively-managed ecological trust in Latah County, Idaho, suggesting that restoration efforts may increase biodiversity. We also report two rarelycollected ants in the Pacific Northwest and a microgyne that may represent an undescribed species related to Brachymyrmex depilis. Our score-counting review revealed that grassland ants in Palouse Prairie have rarely been studied previously and that more ant surveys in temperate grasslands have lagged behind sampling efforts of other global biomes.

TI Assessing the relative importance of human and spatial pressures on
   non-native plant establishment in urban forests using citizen science
SO NEOBIOTA

DT Article
DE biological invasions; citizen science; city planning; non-native plants;
   urban forests
AB Since 2007, more people in the world live in urban than in rural areas. The development of urban areas has encroached into natural forest ecosystems, consequently increasing the ecological importance of parks and fragmented forest remnants. However, a major concern is that urban activities have rendered urban forests susceptible to non-native species incursions, making them central entry sites where non-native plant species can establish and spread. We have little understanding of what urban factors contribute to this process. Here we use data collected by citizen scientists to determine the differential impacts of spatial and urban factors on non-native plant introductions in urban forests. Using a model city, we mapped 18 urban forests within city limits, and identified all the native and non-native plants present at those sites. We then determined the relative contribution of spatial and socioeconomic variables on the richness and composition of native and non-native plant communities. We found that socioeconomic factors rather than spatial factors (e.g., urban forest area) were important modulators of overall or non-native species richness. Non-native species richness in urban forest fragments was primarily affected by residential layout, recent construction events, and nearby roads. This demonstrates that the proliferation of non-native species is inherent to urban activities and we propose that future studies replicate our approach in different cities to broaden our understanding of the spatial and social factors that modulate invasive species movement starting in urban areas.

TI Ecosystem engineering in the arboreal realm: heterogeneity of
   wood-boring beetle cavities and their use by cavity-nesting ants
SO OECOLOGIA

DE Arboreal ants; Tropical savannas; Plant architecture; Resource use;
   Cerrado
AB Wood-boring beetle larvae act as ecosystem engineers by creating stem cavities that are used secondarily as nests by many arboreal ant species. Understanding the heterogeneity and distribution of available cavities and their use by ants is therefore key to understanding arboreal ant community assembly and diversity. Our goals were to quantify the abundance and diversity of beetle-produced cavity resources in a tropical canopy, reveal how ants use these resources, and determine which characteristics of the cavity resource contribute to ant use. We dissected branches from six common tree species in the Brazilian Cerrado savanna, measuring cavity characteristics and identifying the occupants. We sampled 2310 individual cavities, 576 of which were used as nests by 25 arboreal ant species. We found significant differences among tree species in the proportion of stem length bored by beetles, the number of cavities per stem length, average entrance-hole size, and the distribution of cavity volumes. The likelihood that a cavity was occupied was greater for cavities with larger entrance-hole sizes and larger volumes. In particular, there was a strong positive correlation between mean head diameters of ant species and the mean entrance-hole diameter of the cavities occupied by those ant species. Wood-boring beetles contribute to the structuring of the Cerrado ant community by differentially attacking the available tree species. In so doing, the beetles provide a wide range of entrance-hole sizes which ant species partition based on their body size, and large volume cavities that ants appear to prefer.

AB The Mesozoic plate tectonic and paleogeographic history of the final break up of West Gondwana had a profound effect on the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates in South America. As the supercontinent fragmented into a series of large landmasses (South America, Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, the Indian subcontinent, and Madagascar), particularly during the Late Jurassic and Cretaceous, its terrestrial vertebrates became progressively isolated, evolving into unique faunal assemblages. The episodic nature of South American mammalian Cenozoic faunas became apparent in its modern formulation after George Gaylord Simpson's seminal works on this topic. Two aspects add complexity to this generally accepted scheme: first, the fact that South America is not (and was not) a biogeographic unit, as the Neotropical Region does not include its southernmost tip (the Andean Region, including Patagonia and the southern Andes). Second, and intimately linked with the first one, that South America was not an island continent during the Late Cretaceous and the beginning of the Cenozoic, being its southernmost portion closely linked with West Antarctica up to the late Paleocene at least. Here we stress on this second aspect; we summarize a series of recent, detailed paleogeographical analyses of the continental breakup between Patagonia (including the Magallanes Region) and the Antarctic Peninsula crustal block, beginning with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean in the Early Cretaceous and running up to the Early Paleogene with the expansion of the Scotia Basin. In second place, we comment on the implications of these distinct paleogeographic and paleobiogeographic scenarios (before and after their geographic and faunistic isolation) for the evolution of South American terrestrial mammalian faunas. Summarizing, (1) we recognize a West Weddellian terrestrial biogeographic unit with the assemblage of the southern part of South America (Patagonia and the Magallanes Region) and the Antarctic Peninsula (and probably Thurston Island) crustal block of West Antarctica, spanning from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) through the Early Paleogene (Paleocene); (2) we suggest that the Antarctic Peninsula acted as a double "Noah's Ark" regarding, first, the probable migration of some non-therian lineages into southern South America; later, the migration of metatherians to Australasia.

AB Anthropogenic induced climate change is predicted to increase the thermal variability in coastal waters, which can have strong physiological effects on individuals and populations of marine ectotherms. The magnitude and direction of these thermal effects varies depending on species, life stage, biogeography, habitat and season. This study aimed to compare the thermal tolerance of a range of juvenile fish and adult macro-invertebrates from intertidal and estuarine habitats in a warm-temperate, thermally variable region on the south-east coast of South Africa. Seasonal variability in thermal tolerance was compared between species, taxonomic groups, biogeographical distribution and habitat affinity and related to existing and projected water temperature data to gauge the local vulnerability of each species. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax), critical thermal minimum (CTmin), thermal breadths and scopes, and the thermal safety margins of each species were quantified. The greatest differences in thermal tolerance patterns were based on taxonomy, with macro-invertebrates having broader thermal tolerance compared to fish, with the exception of the Cape sea urchin, in both summer and winter. Relatively narrow lower breadths in tolerance and safety margin values for transient juvenile sub-tropical and temperate fish species from the intertidal rocky low-shore habitat were observed in both summer and winter. This indicates that these fish species and the Cape sea urchin may be more vulnerable to projected increases in cold temperature (upwelling in summer) than warm temperature variability in this warm-temperate region if they are unable to seek thermal habitat refuge.

AB Insect diversity levels and change in remnant urban habitats have been poorly examined in Neotropical regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and composition of foliage/shrub dwelling beetles (Insecta: Coleoptera) regarding the influence of patch attributes (i.e., patch size, connectivity, and surrounding matrix) and within-patch habitat complexity, in an urban landscape at Chetumal, Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. Despite the potential species-specific responses to urban landscape pattern, our study reveals that there are effects of patch spatial features and habitat complexity on overall beetle diversity.These effects are as follows: 1) relatively larger urban patches contained higher overall beetle richness, 2) beetle species composition varied significantly regarding understory vegetation structure and tree richness, and 3) patches of intermediate vegetation age had highest beetle richness.This research provides a case study of patch and habitat features related to Neotropical insect assemblages in urban settlements, underlying the importance of using ecological information to offer management recommendations in ever-expanding urban tropical settlements.

AB Background and Aims Mammals and molluscs (MaM) are abundant herbivores of tree seeds and seedlings, but how the trees and their environment affect MaM herbivory has been little studied. MaM tend to move much larger distances during the feeding stage than the more frequently studied insect herbivores. We hypothesize that MaM (1) select and stay within the patches that promise to be relatively the richest in seeds and seedlings, i.e. patches around adult trees that are old and within a distantly related, less productive neighborhood; and (2) try to remain sheltered from predators while foraging, i.e. mammals remain close to adult trees or to cover by herbs while foraging, and might force their mollusc prey to show the opposite distribution.
   Methods We exposed oak acorns and seedlings in a temperate forest along transects from adult conspecifics in different neighbourhoods. We followed acorn removal and leaf herbivory. We used exclusion experiments to separate acorn removal by ungulates vs. rodents and leaf herbivory by insects vs. molluscs. We measured the size of the closest conspecific adult tree, its phylogenetic isolation from the neighbourhood and the herbaceous ground cover.
   Key Results Consistent with our hypothesis, rodents removed seeds around adult trees surrounded by phylogenetically distant trees and by a dense herb cover. Molluscs grazed seedlings surrounding large conspecific adults and where herb cover is scarce. Contrary to our hypothesis, the impact of MaM did not change from 1 to 5 m distance from adult trees.
   Conclusions We suggest that foraging decisions of MaM repulse seedlings from old adults, and mediate the negative effects of herbaceous vegetation on tree recruitment. Also, an increase in mammalian seed predation might prevent trees from establishing in the niches of phylogenetically distantly related species, contrary to what is known from insect enemies.

ID UN DECLARATION; DEFORESTATION; BRAZIL
AB The recognition of land title and demarcation of indigenous peoples' ancestral lands and the guarantee of the rights of consultation and free, prior and informed consent in the context of large infrastructure projects represent some of the major challenges for indigenous peoples and communities in the Amazon States. These challenges have been exacerbated by the election of the current Brazilian federal government in power since January 2019. Yet a significant development with the potential to strengthen participatory environmental governance in the region followed the adoption and entry into force in April 2021 of the 2018 Regional Agreement on Access to Environmental Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Latin America and the Caribbean. This article will argue that national environmental impact assessment and licensing procedures must integrate a human rights approach to project impact assessments to safeguard the protection of the environment and indigenous peoples' fundamental rights.

AB Comparing temporal patterns of distribution and abundance of target organisms between protected and harvested shores is essential to assess the extant effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) and whether it is maintained through time. By means of an adapted Beyond-BACI approach, we compared the short- and long-term patterns of variation in the abundance of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis at a protected shore (within the Parque Litoral Norte MPA, Portugal) and at three adjacent shores subject to intense harvesting over a decadal interva Despite the existence of the MPA for more than 30 years, we did not obtain clear evidence of its persistent or recent effectiveness on intertidal species of commercial interest. We suggest the need for refining management options along the northern Portuguese coast, possibly by better enforcing current regulations and reconsidering the present design of protection schemes. Moreover, the adopted analytical approach may represent a methodological reference for similar investigations in systems where the perturbation of interest (protection or disturbance) would not occur at a given time during the course of the study, but has been operating since before the first sampling occasion and maintained until subsequent surveys.

AB Animals avoid predator attack in different ways; some carry defensive structures to reduce predation, with the classic example being hermit crabs and their use of a mollusc shell as a portable refugium. During shell selection, various shell characteristics are investigated by the crab to determine their suitability. Here we consider the role of visual cues. Previous research suggests that some hermit crabs are more likely to initially choose a conspicuous shell but also to move to backgrounds against which they are less conspicuous, suggesting a short-term/longterm trade-off. Across experiments in which we manipulated shell and background colour, we show initially that Pagurus bernhardus prefer black shells over white but this preference was lost in the absence of visual cues. We then show that the strength of preference was dependent on background colour. We repeated this last experiment with red and yellow shells against red or yellow backgrounds to investigate whether this preference extended to chromatic hues. A preference for darker (red) shells was expressed, but preference alteration with background was not observed. P. bernhardus therefore discriminate between shells in terms of shell and background colour, and discrimination may be rooted in a preference for darker shaded shells.

AB Recent studies have leveraged large datasets from plot-inventory networks to report a phenomenon of hyperdominance in Amazonian tree communities, concluding that few species are common and many are rare. However, taxonomic hypotheses may not be consistent across these large plot networks, potentially masking cryptic diversity and threatened rare taxa. In the current study, we have reviewed one of the most abundant putatively hyperdominant taxa, Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) Marchand (Burseraceae), long considered to be a taxonomically difficult species complex. Using morphological, genomic, and functional data, we present evidence that P. heptaphyllum sensu lato may represent eight separately evolving lineages, each warranting species status. Most of these lineages are geographically restricted, and few if any of them could be considered hyperdominant on their own. In addition, functional trait data are consistent with the hypothesis that trees from each lineage are adapted to distinct soil and climate conditions. Moreover, some of the newly discovered species are rare, with habitats currently experiencing rapid deforestation. We highlight an urgent need to improve sampling and methods for species discovery in order to avoid oversimplified assumptions regarding diversity and rarity in the tropics and the implications for ecosystem functioning and conservation.

AB Dryland degradation is a persistent and accelerating global problem. Although the mechanisms initiating and maintaining dryland degradation are largely understood, returning productivity and function through ecological restoration remains difficult. Water limitation commonly drives slow recovery rates within drylands; however, the altered biogeochemical cycles that accompany degradation also play key roles in limiting restoration outcomes. Addressing biogeochemical changes and resource limitations may help improve restoration efforts within this difficult-to-restore biome. In the present article, we present a synthesis of restoration literature that identifies multiple ways biogeochemical understandings might augment dryland restoration outcomes, including timing restoration around resource cycling and uptake, connecting heterogeneous landscapes, manipulating resource pools, and using organismal functional traits to a restoration advantage. We conclude by suggesting ways to incorporate biogeochemistry into existing restoration frameworks and discuss research directions that may help improve restoration outcomes in the world's highly altered dryland landscapes.

AB Plant roots are the primary source of soil organic carbon (C) and critically support the growth and activities of microbes in the rhizosphere. Climate change factors may, however, modify root-microbial interactions and impact C dynamics in the rhizosphere. Yet, the direction and magnitude of interactive climate change effects, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. Here we show evidence from a field experiment demonstrating that warming and precipitation changes strengthen root controls over litter decomposition in a semi-arid grassland. While warming and precipitation reduction suppressed microbial decomposition of root litter regardless of the root presence, precipitation increase stimulated litter decomposition only in the absence of roots, suggesting that plant competition for water constraints the activities of saprophytic microbes. Root presence increased microbial biomass but reduced microbial activities such as respiration, C cycling enzymes and litter decomposition, indicating that roots exert differential effects on microbes through altering C or water availability. In addition, nitrogen (N) input significantly reduced microbial biomass and microbial activities (respiration). Together, these results showed that alterations in soil moisture induced by climate change drivers critically modulate root controls over microbial decomposition in soil. Our findings suggest that warming-enhanced plant water utilization, combined with N-induced suppression of microbes, may provide a unique mechanism through which moderate increases in precipitation, warming and N input interactively suppress microbial decomposition, thereby facilitating short-term soil C sequestration in the arid and semi-arid grasslands.

AB This paper assesses the effects of a bail out on deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon following a revision in the Forest Code. By providing a bail out to landowners with illegal deforestation, the New Forest Code has created incentives for law-abiding landowners to engage in deforestation activities as well, in the expectation of receiving future amnesties. To identify causal effects, we explore a rich dataset at the property level and use a difference-in-differences strategy, where former law-abiders are our treatment group. In our preferred econometric specification, the private rural properties in the treated group are associated with a rate of forest loss 0.457 p.p. higher than would prevail in the absence of the law revision. This amounts to an accumulated loss of nearly 1 million hectares of forest between 2012 and 2017. This is equivalent to a US$ 2.4 billion loss when no more than carbon emissions are considered.

AB Although approximately three decades ago the ecological role of big-sized trees (also known as either large, large-diameter, mega, oversized or big trees) has been recognized in the scientific literature, the reviews synthesizing our current knowledge and perspectives on the ecological influences of big-sized trees on aboveground biomass, productivity, demographic processes, multifunctionality and stability as well as litterfall, decomposition and belowground functions (e.g., soil organic carbon storage) are still largely unavailable. Here, we provide a literature review and find that ample of studies have suggested that big-sized trees contribute much (i.e., nearly half or more) to stand-level aboveground biomass in worldwide forests, but big-sized trees decline globally due to deforestation and climate change. Although several studies have generally assumed that big-sized trees regulate above- and belowground forest functions, there was no strong evidence through the support of data to explicitly show the effects of big-sized trees attributes (in terms of the species, structural, functional trait and phylogenetic diversity and composition of big-sized trees) on forest functions in the integrative ecological models. This review suggests some future research directions (based on integrative ecological modeling) to explore the effects of bigsized trees attributes, in relationships with abiotic and biotic drivers, on forest functioning in the context of natural and anthropogenic changes because big-sized trees are directly linked with many key ecological issues in global forests.

AB Increasing the connectivity of protected areas is an urgent need to ensure the conservation of forest species and help them to shift their ranges due to anthropogenic drivers. However, efforts to do so considering the joint effects of habitat fragmentation and climate change are still scant. Here, we aimed to outline a framework that incorporates spatial, temporal and multi-taxa criteria to pinpoint locations that connect protected areas in the eastern Amazon. We analyzed three mosaics of protected areas, and data on 603 species (bees, birds, bats) and developed two models using species movement flow (MF; through circuit theory) and habitat suitability (HS; through species distribution models). Considering only the MF, northward areas are the main candidates for corridors, most of which presenting forest cover (68% of the 928,379 ha). This result changes when we analyze the HS, since the corridors are mostly positioned in a different direction (westward) and less than half have forest cover (45% of the 925,058 ha). Candidate areas for both approaches totaled 135,171 ha, with 86% still covered by forest. Our results rely on methodological and taxonomic redundancy (to depict a range of movement and/or habitat requirements) for an efficient strategy to prioritize areas for connectivity. Dynamic restoration simulations showed that the location and order of restoration are important to ensure increased availability of habitat. Our approach can help address two important biodiversity threats (habitat loss and climate change) and maximize the selection of the best corridors to protect species in a rapidly changing world.

AB Ecology cannot yet fully explain why so many tree species coexist in natural communities such as tropical forests. A major difficulty is linking individual-level processes to community dynamics. We propose a combination of tree spatial data, spatial statistics and dynamical theory to reveal the relationship between spatial patterns and population-level interaction coefficients and their consequences for multispecies dynamics and coexistence. Here we show that the emerging population-level interaction coefficients have, for a broad range of circumstances, a simpler structure than their individual-level counterparts, which allows for an analytical treatment of equilibrium and stability conditions. Mechanisms such as animal seed dispersal, which result in clustering of recruits that is decoupled from parent locations, lead to a rare-species advantage and coexistence of otherwise neutral competitors. Linking spatial statistics with theories of community dynamics offers new avenues for explaining species coexistence and calls for rethinking community ecology through a spatial lens.
   Tree spatial data, spatial statistics and dynamical theory reveal the relationship between spatial patterns and population-level interaction coefficients and their consequences for multispecies dynamics and coexistence.

AB Species that inhabit high-shore environments on rocky shores survive prolonged periods of emersion and thermal stress. Using two Hong Kong high-shore littorinids (Echinolittorina malaccana and E. radiata) as models, we examined their behavioral repertoire to survive these variable and extreme conditions. Environmental temperatures ranged from 4 degrees C in the cool season to 55.5 degrees C in the hot season, with strong seasonal and daily fluctuations. In the hot season, both species allocated >35% of their activity budgets to stress-mitigating thermoregulatory behaviors (e.g. standing, towering) and relatively small proportions to foraging (<20%) and reproduction (<10%). In the assumedly benign cool season, greater proportions (>70%) of activity budgets were allocated to stress mitigation behaviors (crevice occupation, aggregation formation). Both species exhibited multifunctional behaviors that optimized time use during their tidally-constrained activity window in the hot season. Females mated while foraging when awash by the rising tide, and some males crawled on top of females prior to ceasing movement to form 'towers', which have both thermoregulatory benefits and reduce searching time for mates during subsequent activity. The function of such behaviors varies in a state-dependent manner, for example, the function of trail following changes over an activity cycle from mate searching on rising tides, to stress mitigation on falling tides (aiding aggregation formation), and to both functions through tower formation just before movement stops. Many of these behavioral responses are, therefore, multifunctional and can vary according to local conditions, allowing snails in this family to successfully colonize the extreme high-shore environment.

DE management of water resources; ecosystem services; environmental

AB The number of Brazilian municipalities and states engaging in payment for environmental services (PES) has been increasing over the last few years. Through a documentary and scientific research, we sought to understand the evolution of almost 20 years of Brazilian experiences in hydrological PES. The research was based on an inventory of the initiatives (already finished or under development), their location, legal basis, and valuation methods. Considering the sampling universe of 68 Brazilian hydrological PES initiatives, we observed: higher concentration of programs in the South and Southeast, with a tendency to expand them to other Brazilian regions, especially the Midwest; the first initiatives of hydrological PES in Brazil adopted the payment of a fixed value, without considering the biotic quality of the rural properties, a pattern which was gradually replaced by the calculation of the opportunity cost of land and the inclusion of physical-environmental indicators and socioeconomic factors in the valuation methodologies. The study allows to conclude that, in the last decade, there has been a tendency for hydrological PES programs to adopt methodologies with an interdisciplinary and systemic approach to assess the provision of environmental services.

AB Questions Islands harbour a disproportionate amount of global plant diversity, yet their unique native assemblages are particularly vulnerable to biological invasions. It is therefore critical to identify the macroecological constraints that mediate spatial distributions of alien species on islands. Here, we examined abundance-occupancy relationships of native and alien woody plant species, and the role of niche properties and functional traits related to dispersal and competition in shaping occupancy and abundance patterns. Location Hawaiian Islands. Methods We calculated relative abundance and occupancy for 64 woody species (42 natives, 22 naturalized aliens), and estimated each species' niche breadth and position. We fitted phylogenetic hierarchical Bayesian models to evaluate abundance-occupancy relationships and the impacts of niche properties and functional traits on occupancy and abundance of native and alien species. Results Our analyses revealed that locally more abundant native species were also more widespread, but that the abundance of alien species was unrelated to their occupancy. Yet, we found evidence that alien species with longer residence times on the Hawaiian Islands were more widespread. While widespread native and alien woody species both had broad niches, widespread alien woody species exhibited a tendency to occur in more marginal niche positions than widespread native woody species. Niche properties did not affect abundances of either native or alien woody species. Traits associated with dispersal capacity and competitive ability had minimal impacts on either occupancy or abundance of native and alien woody species. Conclusions We found that niche properties shape the occupancy but not the abundance of native and alien woody species across Hawaiian forests. Our results suggest that, because of substantial invasion debts, the impacts of alien woody invasions in native forests have yet to fully manifest.

AB Realizing the benefits of forest restoration requires that these ecosystems be maintained after the senescence of planted trees through facilitation of natural regeneration. We analyzed the effect of tree canopy cover, dispersal syndrome, deciduousness, and taxon in facilitating natural regeneration in tropical forest restoration planting. Canopy cover had additive positive effect on natural regeneration when combined with animal dispersal or evergreen trees. Animal dispersal had a positive effect on facilitating natural regeneration abundance, while evergreen species had a positive effect on natural regeneration richness only. Although variation within and among species was high, restoration practitioners could consider using species with these traits to facilitate natural regeneration and hence development of restoration plantings.

AB Deforestation has carved tropical forest landscapes into millions of different-sized patches worldwide. Research has focused on the effect of patch size on biodiversity, while neglecting patch quality effects and leaving geographic and interspecific variance to patch attributes largely unexamined. Here, we asses show patch size and quality affect the encounter rate (ER) and immature-to-female ratio (IFR) of three endangered primates - Mexican mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana), black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra), and spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) - in three rainforest regions with different forest cover. ER of spider monkeys in the best preserved region (50% forest cover) was positively related to both patch size and quality (i.e., species richness of top food species). ER of mantled howlers in the 17% forest cover region was also positively related to patch size. Yet, both ER and IFR of black howlers in the 50% forest cover region and mantled howlers in the 5% forest cover region were mainly related to patch quality. Our results demonstrate that conservation actions in human-modified landscapes must go beyond considering the effect of patch size, as animal populations can be better predicted by patch quality in some regions.

AB Simple Summary
   Jurasaidae are small neotenic beetles which were only recently discovered in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. They have a limited dispersal propensity due to their larviform wingless females. Only adult males are capable of flight. So far, only three species classified in two genera are known. Here, we report the discovery of two new species together with a morphologically and geographically interesting population of one already described species. Our discovery is important not only for understanding the diversity of the group but also from a biogeographic point of view. For the first time, we report here the discovery of a jurasaid species from the relatively dry transitional zone between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes. Considering our recent findings as well as the minute body size and cryptic lifestyle of Jurasaidae, we expect many more species will be discovered in the future from the Atlantic Forest and possibly also other surrounding ecoregions. Our study should motivate colleagues not only to perform field research in the eastern part of South America but also to pay special attention to yet undetermined materials deposited in local institutions, laboratories and collections.
   Jurasaidae are a family of neotenic elateroid beetles which was described recently from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot based on three species in two genera. All life stages live in the soil, including the larviform females, and only adult males are able to fly. Here, we report the discovery of two new species, Jurasai miraculum sp. nov. and J. vanini sp. nov., and a new, morphologically remarkable population of J. digitusdei Rosa et al., 2020. Our discovery sheds further light on the diversity and biogeography of the group. Most species of Jurasaidae are known from the rainforest remnants of the Atlantic Forest, but here for the first time we report a jurasaid species from the relatively drier Atlantic Forest/Caatinga transitional zone. Considering our recent findings, minute body size and cryptic lifestyle of all jurasaids, together with potentially high numbers of yet undescribed species of this family from the Atlantic Forest and possibly also other surrounding ecoregions, we call for both field research in potentially suitable localities as well as for a detailed investigation of a massive amount of already collected but still unprocessed materials deposited in a number of Brazilian institutes, laboratories and collections.

AB In this study, we assess the potential of ants as bioindicators of riparian ecological health in two river types (upland and lowland type) located in the Catalonian region. We proposed to understand to what extent do metrics based on ant responses provide useful information that cannot be presented by traditional biophysical assessments while attempting an approach to creating an ant-based multimetric index (ant-based MMI) of the riparian ecological health. A total of 22 ant species were identified, and 42 metrics related to ant foraging activity, species richness, and functional traits were evaluated as potential core metrics of the index. Riparian features and proximal land use land cover (LULC) were used to distinguish disturbed from less disturbed sites. We found that ant communities strongly responded to human disturbance. When compared with an exclusively physical-based index for the assessment of the riparian health, the ant-based MMI was more sensitive to human disturbance, by also reacting to the effects of the surrounding LULC pressure. This study provides a preliminary approach for an ant-based assessment tool to evaluate the health of riparian corridors although additional research is required to include other river types and a wider stressor gradient before a wider application.

AB Neotropical montane forests are considered biodiversity hotspots, where epiphytic bryophytes are an important component of the diversity, biomass and functioning of these ecosystems. We evaluated the richness and composition of bryophytes in secondary successional forests and mixed plantations of Juglans neotropica. In each forest type, the presence and cover of epiphytic bryophytes was registered in 400 quadrats of 20 cm x 30 cm. We analyzed the effects of canopy openness, diameter at breast height (DBH) and forest type on bryophyte richness, using a generalized linear model (GLM), as well as the changes in species composition using multivariate analysis. Fifty-five bryophyte species were recorded, of which 42 species were in secondary forests and 40 were in mixed plantations. Bryophyte richness did not change at forest level; however, at tree level, richness was higher in the mixed plantation of J. neotropica compared to the secondary forests, due to the presence of species adapted to high light conditions. On the other hand, bryophyte communities were negatively affected by the more open canopy in the mixed plantation of J. neotropica, species adapted to more humid conditions being less abundant. We conclude that species with narrow microclimatic niches are threatened by deforestation, and J. neotropica plantations do not act as refuge for drought-sensitive forest species present in secondary forests.

AB Tropical high-altitude lakes are vital freshwater ecosystems for the functioning and dynamics of tropical high-altitude wetlands called paramos, found at over 3300 m above sea level. They play a major role in the hydrogeological cycle and provide important hydrological services such as water storage, and yet they are understudied. Describing the patterns and processes of community composition in these lakes is required to better understand the consequences of their degradation by human activities. In this study we tested the geographical and environmental components of distance-decay relationships in the phytoplankton structure across 24 tropical high-altitude lakes from Southern Ecuador. Phytoplankton composition at the phyla level showed high among-lake variation in the tropical high-altitude lakes from Tres Lagunas. We found no links, however, between the geographic distance and phytoplankton composition. On the contrary, we observed some environmentally related patterns of community structure like redox potential, altitude, water temperature, and total phosphorus. The absence of support for the distance-decay relationship observed here can result from a conjunction of local niche-based effects and dispersal limitations. Phytoplankton community composition in the Tres Lagunas system or any other ecosystem may be jointly regulated by niche-based and neutral forces that still need to be explored. Despite not proving a mechanistic explanation for the observed patterns of community structure, we hope our findings provide understanding of these vulnerable and vital ecosystems. More studies in tropical high-altitude lakes are urgently required.

AB Biologically activated carbon (BAC) filters are widely used in China and worldwide as an essential part of advanced water treatment. However, it is unclear how to properly select the granular activated car-bon (GAC) used in BAC filters and to determine when GAC should be replaced. In this study, five BAC filters, each filled with a different coconut-or coal-based GAC with different physicochemical proper-ties, were run continuously for 400 days. The structure and function of the microbial community and the quantity of specific enzymes in the BAC filters were investigated through an integrated metage-nomic/metaproteomic analysis. The results indicated that GAC adsorption still played a major role in removing organic matter once the filters reached a steady-state, which was attributed to bioregenera-tion, and the contribution of adsorption might be relatively greater than that of biodegradation. GAC with strong adsorption capacity and high bioregeneration potential selected bacterial communities more phylogenetically closely-related than others. The iodine value could be used as an indicator of BAC per-formance in terms of organic matter removal in the initial stage of the filters, which is dominated by adsorption. However, it could not be used to assess performance at a later stage when adsorption and biodegradation occurred simultaneously. Pore-size distribution characteristics could be chosen as a poten-tial better indicator compared with the current adsorption indicators, dually representing the adsorption performance and the microbial activity, and the proportion of important pore-size of GAC that is more suitable for BAC filter is suggested. GAC with strongly polar terminal groups is more conducive to the removal of ammonium-nitrogen.

AB Light and nitrogen availability are among the most important environmental factors influencing leaf and root morphological traits and forest ecosystems. Understanding the variation in leaf and root traits is pivotal to the adaptive plasticity and leaf-root-specific traits in response to low light and N availability. The effects of light and N availability on leaf and root traits and their interrelations are still not clear. We aimed to measure the response of leaf and root traits and their interrelations to light and N availability in a temperate region. Thus, a factorial experiment was conducted with two angiosperm tree species under two light (L+, L-) and two nitrogen (N-, N+) levels. Results showed that the leaf density (LD) and leaf mass per area (LMA) increased, while leaf thickness (LT) decreased under low light availability. Under N availability, the LD and LMA decreased, while LT increased in sun-exposed plots and remained stable under low light availability across two species. The root diameter, root length, specific root length (SRL), and specific root area (SRA) decreased, while the root tissue density (TD) increased under low light availability. Root diameter, root length, SRA, and SRL increased, while the TD decreased under N+ in L+ plots and remained stable under L- plots. LMA and LT were significantly positively correlated to root length and SRL while significantly negatively correlated to TD. However, LD was significantly positively correlated to TD. We observed that low light availability has significantly decreased the plant biomass and root mass fraction (RMF) and increased the leaf mass fraction (LMF), while the stem mass fraction (SMF) remained stable?indicating the shade in-tolerances in both species. Correlation analyses revealed that LMF is generally, and particularly under L- conditions, less related to leaf and root morphological traits, while RMF was frequently positively correlated to both leave and root traits under all environmental conditions. This illustrates a divergent regulation of morphological traits above and below ground under varying biomass allocation patterns.

AB Explaining community assembly mechanisms along elevational gradients dominated by deterministic processes or stochastic processes is a pressing challenge. Many studies suggest that phylogenetic and functional diversity are significant indicators of the process. In this study, we analyzed the structure and beta diversity of phylogenetic and functional traits along an elevational gradient and discussed the effects of environmental and spatial factors. We found that the phylogenetic and functional traits showed inconsistent changes, and their variations were closely related to the abiotic environment. The results suggested that the community assembly of woody plants was obviously affected by the combined effect of deterministic processes and the stochastic hypothesis (primarily by the latter). Phylogenetic and functional traits had a certain relationship but changed according to different rules. These results enhance our understanding of the assembly mechanism of forest communities by considering both phylogenetic and functional traits.

AB Darwin's frogs Rhinoderma darwinii and Rhinoderma rufum are the only known species of amphibians in which males brood their offspring in their vocal sacs. We propose these frogs as flagship species for the conservation of the Austral temperate forests of Chile and Argentina. This recommendation forms part of the vision of the Binational Conservation Strategy for Darwin's Frogs, which was launched in 2018. The strategy is a conservation initiative led by the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, which in 2017 convened 30 governmental, non-profit and private organizations from Chile, Argentina and elsewhere. Darwin's frogs are iconic examples of the global amphibian conservation crisis: R. rufum is categorized as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) on the IUCN Red List, and R. darwinii as Endangered. Here we articulate the conservation planning process that led to the development of the conservation strategy for these species and present its main findings and recommendations. Using an evidence-based approach, the Binational Conservation Strategy for Darwin's Frogs contains a comprehensive status review of Rhinoderma spp., including critical threat analyses, and proposes 39 prioritized conservation actions. Its goal is that by 2028, key information gaps on Rhinoderma spp. will be filled, the main threats to these species will be reduced, and financial, legal and societal support will have been achieved. The strategy is a multi-disciplinary, transnational endeavour aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of these unique frogs and their particular habitat.

Descriptive studies on how microclimate changes across sharp transition zones have long existed in the literature and recently more attention has been focused on understanding the dynamic patterns of microclimate associated with forest edges. Increasing concern about forest fragmentation has led to new technologies for modeling forest microclimates. However, forest boundaries pose important challenges to not only microclimate modeling but also sampling regimes in order to capture the diurnal and seasonal dynamic aspects of microclimate along forest edges. We measured microclimatic variables across a sharp boundary from a clearing into primary lowland tropical rainforest at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Dynamic changes in diurnal microclimate were measured along three replicated transects, approximately 30 m in length with data collected every 1 m continuously at 30 min intervals for 24 h with a mobile sensor platform supported by a cable infrastructure. We found that a first-order polynomial fit using piece-wise regression provided the most consistent estimation of the forest edge, relative to the visual edge, although we found no "best" sensing parameter as all measurements varied. Edge location estimates based on daytime net shortwave radiation had less difference from the visual edge than other shortwave measurements, but estimates made throughout the day with downward-facing or net infrared radiation sensors were more consistent and closer to the visual edge than any other measurement. This research contributes to the relatively small number of studies that have directly measured diurnal temporal and spatial patterns of microclimate variation across forest edges and demonstrates the use of a flexible mobile platform that enables repeated, high-resolution measurements of gradients of microclimate.

AB Behavioural time budgets of organisms reflect their reaction norms to environmental conditions and, as such, indicate their behavioural plasticity. In environments which limit the activity time of organisms, efficient organization of behaviours is critical to enhancing performance to achieve necessary functions and minimize time and/or energetic costs. We investigated variations in behavioural time budgets of a common deposit-feeding crab, Scopimera intermedia, to the spatio-temporal scales of environmental changes experienced on sandy shores in the monsoonal tropics, where activity times are restricted by the tides. Activity levels of the crabs varied strongly with air temperature, with crabs emerging from the sediments only when air temperature exceeded similar to 20 degrees C. Behavioural water uptake increased in frequency with both feeding rate and environmental temperature, and was often followed by waving displays. Water uptake and waving, therefore, appear to be multifunctional behaviours, as not only do the crabs replenish water for feeding and wave their chelipeds to court females, but these behaviours can also contribute to thermoregulation, enhancing cooling when taking up water from the sediment surface. Such plastic and multifunctional behavioural traits are likely a widespread solution for survival and reproductive success in harsh and dynamic environments, where specialized traits are energetically costly and time-inefficient to optimize performance.
   Significance statement
   Surviving in extreme and variable environments is challenging due to the potentially substantial energetic cost animals need to undertake in order to maximize performances under contrasting conditions. This study reveals a multitasking strategy adopted by the sand-bubbler crab to survive hot and variable temperatures within a limited activity time on tropical sandy shores. Behaviours of the crabs are strongly temperature dependent; and when active whilst the tide is out the crabs flexibly adjust their activity times to feed, stay cool and attract mates using a limited set of multifunctional behaviours. Specialized traits are therefore not necessary to achieve these critical functions and, as such, this study highlights the importance of this plastic, multitasking strategy as a common solution for animals to endure highly variable environments with minimal cost.

AB A central theme in ecological research is to understand how species interactions contribute to community dynamics. Species interactions are the basis of parametric (model-driven) and nonparametric (model-free) approaches in theoretical and empirical work. However, despite their different interpretations across these approaches, these measures have occasionally been used interchangeably, limiting our opportunity to use their differences to gain new insights about ecological systems. Here, we revisit two of the most used measures across these approaches: species interactions measured as constant direct effects (typically used in parametric approaches) and local aggregated effects (typically used in nonparametric approaches). We show two fundamental properties of species interactions that cannot be revealed without bridging these definitions. First, we show that the local aggregated intraspecific effect summarizes all potential pathways through which one species impacts itself, which are likely to be negative even without any constant direct self-regulation mechanism. This property has implications for the long-held debate on how communities can be stabilized when little evidence of self-regulation has been found among higher-trophic species. Second, we show that a local aggregated interspecific effect between two species is correlated with the constant direct interspecific effect if and only if the population dynamics do not have any higher-order direct effects. This other property provides a rigorous methodology to detect direct higher-order effects in the field and experimental data. Overall, our findings illustrate a practical route to gain further insights about non-equilibrium ecological dynamics and species interactions.

AB Considering that ecosystem restoration is a long-term process, the evaluation of each stage of its trajectory may allow us to predict the success of the restoration goals. Given that there are plenty of indicators in the scientific literature for measuring restoration success, and there are stakeholders which are the key actors of restoration, our aim was to determine a common and simple set of indicators ranked by stakeholders for evaluating the restoration trajectory. We selected 52 indicators for monitoring high-diversity forest restoration projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and organized them into six categories: (1) physical and structural, (2) composition/ biodiversity, (3) environmental services, (4) ecological processes, (5) economic and (6) social. We sent questionnaires to stakeholders from five Brazilian states, who evaluated these indicators (with rates ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 = not important or should not be considered; 1 = low importance; 2 = important; and 3 = very important, considering four time-stages throughout the process (2-3, 3-10, 10-50 and > 50 years). Based on this assessment, we ranked the indicators and tested whether the importance of the categories changed between them and over time. We present the "top ten" indicators (with the ten highest grades) for each stage, selected, and ranked by practitioners, that can be used to evaluate restoration projects and provide guidance for restoration policies. In the initial stage, from 2 to 3 years, social attributes were highly important, related to the degree of acceptance by the community. Economic indicators were also important at the initial stage, when the costs of developing, deploying, and maintaining restoration actions are high. Physical and structural indicators were more important in the short-term stage, from 3 to 10 years. Ecological indicators related to composition/ biodiversity and ecological processes became relevant after 3 years and kept so onwards. Only in the long-term, addressing ecosystem services became an important indicator of the restoration success, to stakeholders. Overall, stakeholders care for forest structure and establishment of plants in all stages, while composition/biodiversity and richness gain importance in more advanced phases of restoration trajectory.

AB Algal cover has increased and scleractinian coral cover has steadily declined over the past 40 years on Caribbean coral reefs, while octocoral abundance has increased at sites where abundances have been monitored. The effects of algal cover on recruitment may be a key component in these patterns, as upright octocoral recruits may escape competition with algae by growing above the ubiquitous algal turfs. We used laboratory and field recruitment experiments to examine impacts of algal turf on recruitment of the common, upright, and zooxanthellate Caribbean octocoral Plexaura homomalla. Laboratory recruitment rate was significantly higher in lower turf cover treatments. The survival of recruits in the field was significantly reduced by increased turf cover; for every 1% increase in turf cover, polyps died 1.3% faster. In a model parameterized by the observed field survival, polyps exposed to 100% turf cover had a 2% survival rate over 51 days, while polyps exposed to no turf cover had a 32% survival rate over the same time. We found that high densities of turf algae can significantly inhibit recruitment of octocorals. Experimentally obtained octocoral survival rates were higher than those published for Caribbean octocorals. The factors that influence recruitment are critical in understanding the dynamics of octocorals on Caribbean reefs as continuing declines in scleractinian cover may lead to more octocoral-dominated communities.

AB Aims While reported short-term microbial responses to nutrient enrichment experiments are common, we provide results from a six-year data set in response to field manipulations of soil phosphorus (P) availability. We hypothesized that long-term shifts in P economics should result in the persistent suppression of P-acquiring extracellular enzymes when compared with ambient soils, as opposed to acclimation by the microbial community. Methods P availability was experimentally increased, either directly by addition of phosphate fertilizer or indirectly by raising soil pH with lime in relatively P rich (i.e., glaciated) and P poor (i.e., unglaciated) forest soils. Soil chemistry, phosphatase enzymes (phosphomonoesterase, PM and phosphodiesterase, PD), and microbial structure (PLFA analysis) were measured annually for six years. Results Since the start of the experiment, the microbial communities have become more distinct across treatments. PD enzyme activity was more responsive to the treatments than PM, especially in the glaciated elevated P treatment where ambient P availability was greatest. The treatments dramatically suppressed P-acquiring enzyme activity with no indication of acclimation. Conclusions These results suggest that the initial conditions and ambient nutrient supply of an ecosystem will have a strong influence on its response sensitivity to continuous nutrient enrichment.

AB Aims Litter is frequently buried in the soil in alpine grasslands due to grassland degradation, serious rodent infestation and frequent strong winds. However, the effects of various litter positions on litter decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics under nitrogen (N) enrichment in such areas remain unknown.
   Methods A field experiment was performed in the alpine grasslands of northwest China to investigate the influence of litter position (surface, buried in the soil and standing) and N enrichment on litter decomposition, using data from two dominant grass species (Festuca ovina and Leymus tianschanicus) in control and N-enriched plots.
   Important Findings Litter decomposition rates were much faster in buried litter and slower in standing litter than in surface litter. N enrichment significantly affected litter quality and then influenced decomposition. But no significant differences in litter mass remaining were observed between control and N-enriched soil burial. These results indicated that N enrichment significantly affected litter decomposition by changes in litter quality. In addition, all litter exhibited net carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) release regardless of treatments. Litter exhibited net N accumulation for litter from the control plots but showed N release for litter from N enrichment plots. These suggested that litter decomposition can be limited by N and N enrichment influenced N cycling of litter. Current study presented direct evidence that soil buried litter exhibited faster mass loss and C release, and that soil burial can be a candidate explanation why litter decomposes faster than expected in dryland.

TI P-31 NMR spectroscopy and structural models of soil organic phosphorus
   under Eucalyptus
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS

DE Soil organic phosphorus; DNA; Phosphate diesters; Phosphate monoesters;

AB Organic phosphorus (P-o) plays an important role in tropical forest nutrition on strongly-weathered soils. However, of its role in Eucalyptus nutrition little is known. For this purpose, soil P forms were determined by NaOH-Na(2)EDTA extraction and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) at 10 sites of Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. The objectives were (1) to determine the amounts and forms of soil P-o; (2) to build a structural model of the soil P cycle to provide quantitative estimates of the transformation processes of soil P. Soil P was found to consist of large amounts of Monoesters-P (on average 43.7 mg kg(-1)) followed by Diesters-P in the form of DNA (on average 4.2 mg kg(-1)), as well as containing high reserves of P-i species (on average 101.6 mg kg(-1) of the ortho-P; 2.7 mg kg(-1) of the pyrophosphate). Thestructural model indicated that the P cycle is regulated by clay, soil organic carbon, total P and pH. High total P-o concentrations (on average 48 mg kg(-1)) reveal a high potential of P supply to Eucalyptus trees, in which Diester-P (DNA) would be the main source P for the available P pool. The close interconnection between ortho-P, pyrophosphate, DNA and Monoester-P compounds provides evidence of a strong influence of soil biological activity on the distribution and accumulation of these P compounds and therefore on the availability of P. Thus, these results are relevant to establish soil fertility management strategies for low-fertilizer input Eucalyptus systems in soils with low fertility.

AB Fire-suppression is of concern in fire-prone ecosystems because it can result in the loss of endemic species. Suppressing fires also causes a build-up of flammable biomass, increasing the risk of severe fires. Using a Before-After, Control-Impacted design, we assessed the consequences of high-severity fires on Neotropical savanna arboreal ant communities. Over a 9-year period, we sampled the ant fauna of the same trees before and after two severe fires that hit a savanna reserve in Brazil and the trees from an unburned savanna site that served as a temporal control. The ant community associated with the unburned trees was relatively stable, with no significant temporal variation in species richness and only a few species changing in abundance over time. In contrast, we found a strong decline in species richness and marked changes in species composition in the burned trees, with some species becoming more prevalent and many becoming rare or locally extinct. The dissimilarity in species richness and composition was significantly smaller between the two pre-fire surveys than between the pre- and post-fire surveys. Fire-induced changes were much more marked among species with strictly arboreal nesting habits, and therefore more susceptible to the direct effects of fire. The decline of some of the ecologically dominant arboreal ant species may be particularly important, as it opens substantial ecological space for cascading community-wide changes. In particular, severe fires appear to disrupt the typical vertical stratification between the arboreal and ground-dwelling faunas, which might lead to homogenization of the overall ant community.

AB Buzz-pollinated plants are an essential source of pollen for a significant portion of local bee communities. Buzz pollination research has focused on studying the properties of bee buzzes and their implications on pollen release, morphological specialization of flowers, and the reproductive ecology of buzz-pollinated plants. In contrast, diversity patterns and ecological interactions between bees and buzz-pollinated plants have been studied less. This study analyzed the buzzing bee community of twelve tropical buzz-pollinated co-occurring plant species in a tropical montane cloud forest during the flowering periods of two consecutive years, focusing on diversity, compositional similarity, structure, and specialization (H-2 ') of the network. Twenty-one bee species belonging to Apidae, Colletidae, and Halictidae were recorded, fifteen species in 2014, and eighteen in 2015. Floral display and visited flowers doubled from first to second year, although the flowering period was 2 months longer in the first year. Bee compositional similarity between plants tended to be low; however, this was due rather to a high nestedness than species replacement. Temporal bee compositional similarity was also low but variable, and different plant species showed the highest similarity between years. The number of bee visits depended significantly on the number of flowers and years. Interactions between bees and plants showed a tendency to generalization. Compared to other buzz-pollinated networks, specialization (H-2 ') was similar, but diversity was low and the network small. In endangered ecosystems like the Mexican cloud forest, however, buzzing bees support biodiversity and provide an essential ecological service by pollinating dominant understory flora.

AB Large trees have been found to directly affect spatial patterns in forests and understanding forest spatial structure is important for developing effective forest management practices. We examined two primary broad-leaved Korean pine forests in Heilongjiang Province, China, to investigate the effects of large-diameter trees on the distribution of adjacent conspecific trees and to assess whether the effect is related to the conspecific negative density dependence hypothesis in temperate forest. We classified the tree with the widest diameter (diameter at breast height ? 50 cm) as the central tree and then surveyed the distribution of adjacent trees around each central tree. The degree of mingling between the central tree and adjacent trees was the lowest at 5?7 m. As the diameter of the adjacent trees increased the degree of mingling declined. This revealed that around the central tree, there was a ring of small trees conspecific to the central tree. The ring-like structure around large-diameter trees is consistent with the conspecific negative density dependence hypothesis. Thus, we propose that a ring-like structure promotes the succession and regeneration of the temperate forest.

AB The decline in species richness at higher latitudes is among the most fundamental patterns in ecology. Whether changes in species composition across space (beta-diversity) contribute to this gradient of overall species richness (gamma-diversity) remains hotly debated. Previous studies that failed to resolve the issue suffered from a well-known tendency for small samples in areas with high gamma-diversity to have inflated measures of beta-diversity. Here, we provide a novel analytical test, using beta-diversity metrics that correct the gamma-diversity and sampling biases, to compare beta-diversity and species packing across a latitudinal gradient in tree species richness of 21 large forest plots along a large environmental gradient in East Asia. We demonstrate that after accounting for topography and correcting the gamma-diversity bias, tropical forests still have higher beta-diversity than temperate analogues. This suggests that beta-diversity contributes to the latitudinal species richness gradient as a component of gamma-diversity. Moreover, both niche specialization and niche marginality (a measure of niche spacing along an environmental gradient) also increase towards the equator, after controlling for the effect of topographical heterogeneity. This supports the joint importance of tighter species packing and larger niche space in tropical forests while also demonstrating the importance of local processes in controlling beta-diversity.

AB The formation of annual growth rings is an imperative requirement for studying the dendroecological potential of plant species. Little is known about the distinctness of growth rings in the wood of desert plants in Africa, particularly in southern Mediterranean regions. To fill this knowledge gap, we collected and anatomically analyzed about 300 perennial desert plants from different areas in Egypt. Out of the 300 studied plant species, 94 species were identified as growth-ring forming plants. They belong to 78 genera and 33 families. Trees, shrubs/ subshrubs, and perennial or short-lived herbs are represented by 7, 55, and 32 species, respectively. Trees and shrubs represent 7.4% and 58.5% of the total, respectively. The distinctness of growth rings in these species was indicated either by the type of wood porosity, fibers, marginal parenchyma layers or by a mixture of these characteristics. Ring porosity, fiber layer, and parenchyma were the main indicators for growth-ring distinctness in 77.7%, 60.6%, and 33.0% of growth-ring forming plants, respectively. We conclude that some of the desert plants form distinct growth rings depending on site conditions, while precipitation is the main driver for its formation. Further studies on the annual rhythm of xylem formation are required to confirm the annual nature of growth rings and potential dendroecological use of these plants.

AB Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns can have marked impacts on small mammal populations that inhabit environments with highly fluctuating water availability. With projected increases in droughts and fewer but more intense rainfall events in the Southwestern United States, the persistence of many wildlife populations may be threatened. Our goal was to assess how temperature and rainfall during distinct dry and wet seasons influenced the dynamics of a population of big-eared woodrats (Neotoma macrotis) in a mixed oak woodland of coastal central California. We applied Pradel's temporal symmetry models to our 21-year biannual capture-markrecapture data set (1993-2014) to determine the effects of climatic factors on the woodrats' apparent survival (Phi) and recruitment rate (f). Monthly Phi averaged 0.945 +/- 0.001 and varied with season. Monthly f was 0.064 +/- 0.001 in the wet season (f was fixed to 0 in the dry season). Monthly population growth rate (lambda) varied from 0.996 +/- 0.001 during the dry season to 1.001 +/- 0.001 during the wet season, which indicated a stable population (0.999 +/- 0.001). Total rainfall from the previous season and mean temperature during the same season positively influenced Phi and f. By contrast, Phi and f were negatively influenced by mean temperature from the previous season and total rainfall in the same season. The resulting lambda fluctuated with total rainfall, particularly in the wet season. Our results suggest that the big-eared woodrat population may not be substantially affected by warm temperatures per se, potentially because of the microclimate provided by its stick houses. We also discuss its adaptability to local food resources and relatively slow life history relative to other cricetids, and propose that the big-eared woodrat population may be equipped to cope with future climate change.

AB Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are amongst the major drivers of biodiversity loss globally. Although habitat fragmentation poses additional threats to biodiversity beyond habitat loss alone, the IUCN's Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) does not provide guidance on how to assess these threats. This study develops an approach for incorporating habitat fragmentation into the RLE threat assessment and investigates additional insights such an analysis could provide beyond the analysis of distribution trends. This is achieved by quantifying RLE criteria A and B (distribution reduction, restricted distribution and decline) and comparing outcomes with indices of habitat fragmentation (core area, Largest Patch Index, Patch Cohesion Index and Aggregation Index) in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Results revealed that much of the Cape Floristic Region is severely threatened by both landscape transformation and habitat fragmentation, but that treating the habitat fragmentation indices as additional RLE criteria did not alter the ecosystem threat assessment outcomes. Whilst this suggests that the existing RLE criteria implicitly account for habitat fragmentation, the relationship between fragmentation indices and RLE criteria were weak and highly variable in some cases, indicating that the RLE criteria alone do not sufficiently account for the threat of habitat fragmentation. Supplementing the RLE with habitat fragmentation measures highlights additional, unique information on threats to ecosystems. This simple approach has the potential to assist in setting conservation priorities and management goals, particularly in fragmented ecosystems.

AB Areas with controlled access, as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURF), are conceived as tools to contribute to the ecosystem conservation and fisheries sustainability. Management and Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (MEABR), a TURF system implemented in Chile, offers the opportunity to test this hypothesis. The management in these areas is based mainly on the assessment of the resources population status, with low or no consideration of the ecological - environmental effects that condition their productivity. In this study, we evaluate ecological trophic dynamics of the rocky subtidal community configuration in four periods along 20 years of the highly productive Choros Island MEABR - MPA, including one preimplementation period. In this TURF, the carnivore gastropod Concholepas concholepas (locally known as "loco") is the main targeted resource. The performance of ecosystem indexes of this TURF increased during the MEABR regime as compared with the pre MEABR implementation. Nevertheless, the most conspicuous increase occurred in 2013, primarily in response to changes in environmental conditions and their direct and indirect effects on community interactions. The analysis of interactions between guilds indicated that the main drivers were the interaction between the primary productivity, prey abundance and the top predator loco. This produces a longterm dynamic of the system modulated by the interplay of environmental variability, which at benthic community level increases prey populations thus sustaining increased loco productivity. In turn, intensified predation of loco reduces its prey. This produces natural productivity fluctuations, which counteract the expected outcome of management actions, impeding to achieve stable landings in the long term.

AB In southeast Australia, fire regimes are changing. Conserving species into the future under these changing fire regimes will require understanding their recruitment and growth dynamics following historical fires. Where monitoring is absent, dendroecology provides a tool for reconstructing and quantifying these dynamics. The use of dendroecology in southeast Australia has been limited due to presumptions that many of the species do not produce annual growth rings. In this study, we determined the dendroecological potential of a fire-sensitive understorey tree species, Pomaderris aspera, as a case study species, to explore the potential to use of understorey species to provide insights into past fire history. We used growth patterns of this species to understand the role of resource limitation on growth and senescence. We found that P. aspera had distinct growth rings and high within tree correlation when cross-dated. Recruitment events of this species aligned with three known fire events. We found that the impacts of historical fire on tree canopy cover could be estimated. P. aspera grew rapidly post fire and then become suppressed within 9-15 years. Cycles of growth release and suppression were found with increasing incidence of suppression occurring over time. Increased suppression and reduced growth rates aligned with patterns of recorded senescence over time in the understories of a maturing. Eucalyptus canopy. Our results highlight the potential to use dendroecology to confirm past fire extents and amount of canopy disturbances and the impacts that these events have on the recruitment and growth dynamics of understorey species in southeast Australia.

AB Fire is one of the main causes of environmental and ecosystem change. Geospatial data, derived from satellite images and surveying observations, are a useful tool in managing land use and land cover changes. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria-based geographical information system (GIS) for fire risk assessment and fire potential mapping in a peat swamp forest at Hua Sai district, Thailand. Fifty-five fire points in peat swamp areas were reported from 2012 to 2016. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and GIS methods were used synergistically to analyze the following contributing factors: elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, distance from river, distance from settlement and land use. The results of the present study indicate that the predicted fire risk areas from the methodology proposed are found to be in agreement with recorded past fire events. The fire risk map produced can be used for planning and management of wildland fire events in the future. GIS multi-criteria-based models have been developed in the context of fire prognosis; however, most of them attribute weights from simple pair-wise comparisons; we showcase that the integration of AHP provides accurate results for this study area in Thailand.

AB Biological sources of carbon sequestration such as revegetation have been highlighted as important avenues to combat climate change and meet global targets by the global community including the Paris Climate Agreement. However, current and projected carbon prices present a considerable barrier to broad-scale adoption of tree planting as a key mitigation strategy. One avenue to provide additional economic and environmental incentives to encourage wider adoption of revegetation is the bundling or stacking of additional co-beneficial ecosystem services that can be realized from tree planting. Using the World's largest land-based carbon credit trading scheme, the Australian Emissions Reduction Scheme (ERF), we examine the potential for three pairs of ecosystem services, where the carbon sequestration value of land use change is paired with an additional co-benefit with strong prospects for local tangible benefits to land owners/providers. Two cases consider agricultural provisioning values that can be realized by the landowners in higher returns: increased pollination services and reduced lamb mortality. The third case examined payments for tree plantings along riparian buffers, with payments to farmers by a water utility who realizes the benefit from reduced treatment cost due to water quality improvements. Economic incentives from these co-benefit case studies were found to be mixed, with avoided treatment costs from water quality paired with carbon payments the most promising, while pollination and reduced lamb mortality paired with carbon payments were unable to bridge the economic gap except under the most optimistic assumptions. We conclude that the economics case for significant land use change are likely to be geographically dispersed and only viable in relatively niche landscape positions in high establishment, high opportunity cost areas even when carbon payments are augmented with the value of co-benefits classified as providing direct and local benefits.

AB Endemic and relict species are often confined to ecological refugia or over fragmented distributions, representing priority conservation subjects. Within these sites, the individual population may realize distinct niches to a varying degree of specialization. An emblematic example is provided by freshwater species segregated in thermal-mineral springs, where individuals may face highly diverse microclimates in limited geographic areas. Downscaling the characterization of physiological traits to microclimatic niches becomes pivotal to adopt effective conservation measures in these heterogeneous habitats. Melanopsis etrusca (Brot, 1862) is an endangered relict snail endemic to a small number of thermal-mineral streams in central Italy. Here we describe the thermal tolerance of two populations of M. etrusca inhabiting streams with distinctly different thermal regimes, investigating the extent of physiological and behavioural specialization to such diverse microclimatic niches. The comparison of oxygen consumption rates of a population dwelling in temperate streams, characterized by seasonal temperature fluctuations (12-27 degrees C), with a population experiencing constantly hot water (35-38 degrees C) revealed the absence of any seasonal or geographic effect on metabolic compensation. Conversely, mobility performances were maximized in the population inhabiting the hot stream. Interestingly, here, the snails exhibited emersion behaviour outside the water, triggered by temperatures above 37 degrees C. In the field, individuals of this population are observed inactive on stream banks, conceivably to minimize the metabolic cost that otherwise would be induced by remaining in the hot water. Only a few individuals from the temperate stream exhibited the same behaviour when exposed to elevated temperatures, suggesting the exaptation of a preexisting trait during the evolutionary process of adaptation to hot waters. The present results provide elements for the best practice in future programmes aimed at reintroducing stocks of threatened species across heterogeneous habitats. Our study further underlines the relevance of downscaling data collection for endangered species conservation in order to recognize microclimatic specializations.

AB The Amazon Rainforest is facing high rates of deforestation, leaving anthropogenically dominated landscapes across the Amazon. Understanding the biodiversity response to the effects of rainfall seasonality can provide important examples of how species may respond to drastic climate conditions in anthropogenic landscapes. Here, we sampled dung beetles across the same Amazon forest sites during the rainy and dry seasons to evaluate the effect of seasonality on biodiversity patterns. We found a significant space-time interaction for the whole set of forest sites indicating that the spatial structure of the species abundance data has changed significantly between seasons. Dung beetle abundance and species richness was higher in the rainy season when evaluating all species and separately for nesting behavior group. For presence-absence and abundance data of the whole assemblage, the mean differences between losses and gains over all forest sites was negative, indicating dominance of species and individuals-per-species losses across all forest sites. Eleven species (5 tunnellers, 4 rollers, and 2 dwellers) had significant decreases in abundances in the forest sites from the rainy to the dry season, whereas one roller species increased in abundance from the rainy to the dry season. Rainfall seasonality drives the temporal patterns of dung beetle diversity in the Amazonian forests in the study region in the arc of deforestation. Implications for insect conservation Understanding species vulnerability to changes in climatic conditions could help to predict species distributions in an increased scenario of higher temperatures and longer drought periods during dry seasons in the near future.

AB Tree planting is a common strategy for forest restoration. The use of mid- and late-successional species is less common, but could accelerate succession, enhance diversity and secure their presence. In this study, we determined the survival and growth of 559 saplings from nine native mid- and late-successional species after three years of growth under a range of habitat conditions to evaluate their potential utility in restoration plantings. Since mid- and late-successional tree species have shade-tolerant attributes and the light environment is a determinant factor for their growth and survival, we expected sapling performance to vary among species depending on the percentage of canopy cover and on factors associated with this variable. For this, we identified habitat conditions that influenced sapling performance in a degraded tropical cloud forest: the conditions ranged from closed-canopy secondary forest to open pastures dominated by exotic grasses. Overall, the studied species presented a high performance: sapling survival (40 to 90%) and relative growth rates in height (0.14 to 0.50 cm cm-1 year-1) and in diameter (0.04 to 0.50 mm mm-1 year-1) were within or above the ranges previously reported for cloud forest species. The final sizes and growth rates in height and diameter were mostly explained by the canopy and grass cover (71.5% of the variation). Integrated Response Index (IRI) values showed wide variation among species (from 6.44 to 41.41 with inclusion of height, and from 2.13 to 44.77 with inclusion of diameter). In general, there was a negative correlation between canopy cover and final sapling size and growth rates in height and diameter, but there were important variations among species. Based on their IRI values, species such as Ulmus mexicana and Oreomunnea mexicana are suggested for restoration plantings. Given their low performance, however, Fraxinu uhdei and Juglans pyriformis are recommended for use only in advanced forest successional stages or in conjunction with other restoration techniques to increase their survival. Our results show that these threatened mid- and late-successional native species can be successfully matched to microsite conditions and established in degraded areas as a strategy by which to secure their presence and accelerate forest recovery.

AB Planting eucalypt stands in the Iberian Peninsula is controversial. In Galicia (NW Spain) the area covered by eucalypts and the intensity of eucalypt timber harvesting are among the highest in Europe. In this region, management plans for forest resources are intended for relatively homogeneous territorial units, smaller than the province, called forest districts (ForDis). The status of eucalypt plantations in ForDis is usually assumed to be highly variable, although this has not yet been quantified. Within this framework, the present study aimed to integrate an existing Eucalyptus globulus distribution model for current conditions and two different climate change scenarios with current forest cover (including eucalypt plantations) to provide quantitative and spatiallyexplicit information for identifying ForDis where eucalypt plantations may become problematic. Four parameters (suitability, importance, potential expansion and fragmentation) comprising 13 related indicators were calculated for eucalypt plantations in each of the 19 ForDis in the region. The findings show that more than 44% of the afforested area is covered by eucalypts in the province of A Corun?a and in forest districts VI and XVIII (in Lugo and Pontevedra, respectively). A huge continuous patch of eucalypt, of more than 35,000 ha, was detected across two ForDis (I and VI). The potentially high ecological and financial risks associated with this vast area of monoculture would negatively affect the sustainability and multifunctionality of these forest ecosystems. Analysis of the expected suitability of areas for E. globulus in forthcoming climate change scenarios identified four inland ForDis (IX, X in Lugo, XVI in Pontevedra and XI in Ourense) where an important increase in cover by this species may occur if no action is taken. Moreover, these areas overlap with the large ongoing expansion already observed for the more productive and frost-resistant E. nitens. The findings also revealed edge-dominated native broadleaved forest patches in the habitat suitable for E. globulus in the provinces of A Corun?a and Lugo. Although the current level of occupancy of eucalypt within natural protected areas (NPAs) is moderate, the suitability of these areas for eucalypt plantations will increase in the predicted climate change scenario, possibly leading to aggravation of potential conflicts in these biodiversity hotspots. Regional forest agencies should therefore increase monitoring efforts to prevent further impacts on native forest and natural protected areas.
   The proposed quantitative indicators and methodology used are intended to be useful for forest planners and policy decision-makers in other regions where current and future conflicts related to exotic tree plantations are expected.

AB Background and Aims Aridity is increasing in many regions of the world, but microclimatic conditions may buffer plant communities from the direct effects of decreased precipitation, creating habitat islands. However, reduced precipitation can also impact these communities indirectly by decreasing the suitability of the surrounding habitat, thus limiting incoming propagules and increasing the chances of population decline and species loss. We test whether decreased precipitation results in loss of species and functional diversity within habitat islands, evaluating in particular whether declines in species diversity and abundance are less likely to result in loss of functional diversity if species/individual loss is stochastic (i.e. independent of species/individual traits) and communities/populations are functionally redundant.
   Methods Lomas communities are discrete plant communities embedded in the Atacama Desert, maintained by the microclimatic conditions created by fog. We recorded species and functional diversity in six Lomas communities along a 500 km long precipitation gradient in northern Chile. Functional traits were measured in 20 individuals per species, in those species that accounted for approx. 75 % of the abundance at each site. We calculated functional diversity and functional redundancy of the community, and intraspecific functional variation.
   Key Results Decreased precipitation was associated with lower species diversity and lower species abundances. However, no traits or functional strategies increased or decreased consistently with precipitation, suggesting stochastic species/individual loss. Species with stress-tolerant strategies were predominant in all sites. Although species diversity decreased with decreasing precipitation, functional diversity remained unchanged. Lower functional redundancy in the drier sites suggests that mainly functionally redundant species were lost. Likewise, intraspecific functional variation was similar among communities, despite the lower species abundance in drier sites.
   Conclusions Decreased precipitation can impact habitat island communities indirectly by decreasing the suitability of the surrounding habitat. Our results support the idea that a stochastic loss of species/individuals from functionally redundant communities and populations does not result in loss of functional diversity.

AB Sea stars often function as keystone predators in food webs of intertidal and subtidal communities, especially in temperate and sub-polar regions. In South America the sea star Cosmasterias lurida is distributed along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Patagonia and is one of the most conspicuous and abundant benthic predators in the shallow subtidal zone (<25 m). Its feeding strategy and prey selection are, however, still poorly known. This study describes the feeding behavior of C. lurida at a site in the Seno del Reloncav? (Chile), assessing its abundance, size and prey selection in the field relative to observed prey abundance and size along a bathymetric gradient. We hypothesized that C. lurida is a generalist predator, feeding on suitable prey according to their availability. However, we found that this predator only consumed a limited number (7 of 48) of potential prey species, primarily the slipper limpets Crepipatella spp. and the mussels Aulacomya ater and Mytilus chilensis. Electivity analysis revealed a clear preference for one mussel (A. ater) but not the other (M. chilensis) as well as depth-dependent selectivity for the slipper limpets, which changed from avoidance to preference with increasing depth. Sea star densities varied with depth, peaking between depths of 5 and 10 m, but the size of sea stars and the size of their prey did not vary significantly along a depth gradient. No significant correlations were found with the most commonly selected prey. These results would indicate that while this predator may be a generalist?opportunist, its feeding behavior is context-dependent and its high selectivity for certain species suggests that this sea star plays a key role structuring subtidal benthic communities in Patagonia.

AB Indirect approaches such as Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDP) aspire to combat biodiversity loss. Unfortunately, with increasing cases of failure, the link between poverty alleviation and conservation is now controversial. We revisited the earliest ICDP project in China after 12 years. The project area experienced increasing free-ranging livestock after 2004, which degraded the panda habitat. We collected livestock and socio-economic data using constructed household surveys and applied logit and zero-truncated Poisson models to understand the effect of ICDP. About 76% of livestock activities were in the panda habitat. Receipt of ICDP funds increased the chance of a household to become a livestock owner. The participation in ICDP also increased the numbers of both the traditional livestock - cattle by 83% - as well as the emerging type horses by 203%. Horses were encouraged for tourism and later raised for meat production. The income from alternative livelihoods such as tourism and off-farm jobs reduced the reliance on cattle but encouraged having more horses. Our results show that with the ban on logging and reduced cropland, assistance from ICDP facilitated the participants to accumulate wealth much quicker than others and to increase their livestock holdings. The immediate success in reducing reliance on certain natural resources and the community development of the short-duration projects could fail the long-term goals of conserving the endangered species habitat. Future conservation projects should either establish long-term mechanisms such as conditionality for incentives or create self-interests in conservation among the communities to cope with unexpected threats in the future.

TI Green Care as Alternative Therapy: The Situation in Ghana
SO EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID BIODIVERSITY; BENEFITS
AB Green care, an alternative healthcare system that involves the use of nature, is proven to be useful in the management of organic and psychological disorders worldwide. There are various forms of Green care including Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT), a type where animals play pivotal roles in the healing process and is widely used in many developed countries. We assessed the level of awareness and attitude towards Green care among medical students of Ghana. Using a cross-sectional study design and a semistructured questionnaire designed on Google Forms, data were collected from randomly selected 4(th)-, 5(th)-, and 6(th)-year medical students of the University for Development Studies, Tamale, Ghana. The data submitted by 206 of the students were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Version 25, and the results were presented as frequencies, percentages, and charts. The association between sociodemographic characteristics of respondents and awareness about Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) was considered significant at p<0.05. The study found that only 7 (3.4%) of the medical students had ever heard of Green care while a higher number of 36 (17.5%) were aware of AAT mostly through movies and television. However, the majority, 122 (59.3%), had a positive attitude towards the introduction of AAT, into their medical training curriculum. Up to 146 (70.9%) of the respondents suggested lectures and practical sessions as their preferred way of acquiring knowledge and skills on AAT. Only the sex of the respondents was significantly associated with awareness of AAT, with females having a better awareness of AAT (28.6% vs. 11.0%, p=0.003). We conclude that awareness of Green care practices among medical students in Ghana was highly inadequate, but the desire of the majority of them to acquire knowledge and skills in this proven alternative therapy makes its future use in Ghana promising.

AB Purpose In order to determine the interactive effect of Phyllostachys pubescens (moso bamboo) expansion to adjacent coniferous forest (Cryptomeria japonica, Japanese cedar) on soil fauna communities and soil food web, we conducted a tangible investigation combined with natural abundance isotope analysis to examine how moso bamboo expansion process affects soil faunal composition and underground soil food web in Lushan mountain, southeast China. Methods Exact treatments are as follows: (1) moso bamboo forest, (2) ecotone area and (3) Japanese cedar forest. We collected 74 arthropod groups from the field. Results The groups of Acari and Collembola were the two main soil fauna taxa with the highest abundance which accounted for 18.86-98.9% of the relative total abundance among various habitats. Peak of soil faunal density in moso bamboo and Japanese cedar forests appeared in May and November. Soil fauna community in ecotone was more similar to that in moso bamboo forest, indicating that the expansion process was still in infancy stage, and there was no significant difference in soil fauna community diversity index among the three forest types. Moso bamboo expansion did not affect the nutrient level of Collembola and Oribatida, but decreased that of Megsostigmata. The nutrient level of Hymenoptera and Coleoptera increased in ecotone, and Diptera kept in the third nutrient level in all three forest types, while the Hemiptera, Araneida and Pseudo-scorpionidea remained at a high level. Conclusion The results demonstrated that in moso bamboo expansion process, soil fauna groups with low nutrient levels were more affected, while the soil faunas with high nutrient level were less affected.

AB Ecosystem service (ES) flow reveals the transregional benefits transferred from service supply areas (SSAs) to service benefiting areas (SBAs), which correspond to the sellers and buyers of interregional ecological compensation, respectively. However, current ecological compensation policies usually ignore this close connection. This study took the water supply services (WSSs) with the most obvious flow characteristics as an example and established a universal framework for interregional ecological compensation by combining WSSs flow simulation and regional disparity. The simulation process was programmed with Interactive Data Language (IDL) and analyzed with ArcGIS. Most regions serve as a dual role in the WSSs flow process, the water suppliers and users are relative and scale-dependent. Taking Ningxia as an example, As water benefiting areas (WBAs)/buyers, the total material inflow to Ningxia was 135.86 x 10(8) similar to 294.22 x 10(8) m(3) from 2000 to 2015 and the value inflow ranged from 1077.39 x 10(8) similar to 2333.16 x 10(8) CNY, requiring 101.64 x 10(8) similar to 293.51 x 10(8) CNY ecological compensation paid by Ningxia. As water supply areas (WSAs)/sellers, the total material outflow from Ningxia was 72.83 x 10(8) similar to 200.46 x 10(8) m(3) from 2000 to 2015, and the value outflow was between 577.54 x 10(8) CNY and 1589.65 x 10(8) CNY, requiring 63.80 x 10(8) similar to 112.34 x 10(8) CNY of ecological compensation to be paid by the downstream basins, especially the Shizuishan - Hekou Town subbasin. Overall, Ningxia was a beneficiary area of WSSs flow and the payers of interregional ecological compensation, with a net payment amount of 37.84 x 10(8) similar to 181.16 x 10(8) CNY. This study provides a direct spatial-visualized reference to water resource management for policy-makers and promotes the integration of ES flow and interregional ecological compensation. Furthermore, it can improve the public recognition of interregional ecological compensation with the spatial mapping of the levy and allocation and conducive to the sustainable provisioning of ESs ultimately.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance and fragmentation have changed the structure and composition of northern Ethiopian forests. This study was conducted to determine disturbance levels of patches, and examine the effect of anthropogenic disturbance and fragment size on diversity and structural attributes of woody species. A systematic sampling method was used to collect data and 61 nested plots of each 400 m(2) were used. The disturbance index was used to assess disturbance intensities. To examine the effects of fragment size and anthropogenic disturbances on woody species diversity and structure, regression analysis was performed. ANOVA was used to examine differences in woody species diversity and structural attributes among fragments. Similarities among patches were assessed by Sorensen's similarity index. A total of 80 woody species, representing 68 genera and 43 families were recorded. Diversity, evenness, stem density ha(-1), and basal area were 2.8 +/- 0.47, 0.73 +/- 1.10, 1171.21 +/- 220.10, and 39.89 +/- 17.47 m(2) ha(-1) respectively. The mean number of species, evenness, and diversity were significantly different among fragments. Diversity, evenness, the mean number of species, and stem density per hectare significantly increased with increasing fragment size. Disturbance intensities varied among fragments. However, the mean basal area, mean seedling, and sapling density per hectare were not significantly affected by patch size and disturbance intensities. Generally, forest fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbance resulted in the reduction of diversity, affect woody species structure, and increased the level of disturbance. Therefore, recognizing the role of small fragments for forest conservation, minimizing further disturbance, and undertaking restoration activities in disturbed patches are strongly needed.

AB Understanding the assembly processes of symbiont communities, including viromes and microbiomes, is important for improving predictions on symbionts' biogeography and disease ecology. Here, we use phylogenetic, functional, and geographic filters to predict the similarity between symbiont communities, using as a test case the assembly process in viral communities of Mexican bats. We construct generalized linear models to predict viral community similarity, as measured by the Jaccard index, as a function of differences in host phylogeny, host functionality, and spatial co-occurrence, evaluating the models using the Akaike information criterion. Two model classes are constructed: a "known" model, where virus-host relationships are based only on data reported in Mexico, and a "potential" model, where viral reports of all the Americas are used, but then applied only to bat species that are distributed in Mexico. Although the "known" model shows only weak dependence on any of the filters, the "potential" model highlights the importance of all three filter types-phylogeny, functional traits, and co-occurrence-in the assemblage of viral communities. The differences between the "known" and "potential" models highlight the utility of modeling at different "scales" so as to compare and contrast known information at one scale to another one, where, for example, virus information associated with bats is much scarcer.

TI Testing for functional significance of traits: Effect of the light
   environment in tropical tree saplings
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
LA English

DE Central Amazon; functional traits; growth; intraspecific variation;
   irradiance; photosynthesis; plant strategies
AB Functional traits have been examined to explain the growth rates of forest communities in different sites. However, weak or nonexistent relations are often found, especially due to the following methodological aspects: 1) lack of an environmental context (e.g., light, water, or nutrient supply), 2) use of nonfunctional traits, 3) an approach that does not contemplate phenotypic integration, and 4) neglect of intraspecific variation.
   Here we measured relative growth rates, crown, and leaf traits in saplings of six tropical tree species growing in two light environments (Gap and Understory) to test whether contrasting light environments modulates trait-trait and trait-growth relationships. Moreover, we tested whether models that integrate traits of different dimensions of the plant (crown and leaf) improve the strength of trait-growth relations.
   Light availability changed both trait-trait and trait-growth relationships. Overall, in Understory, crown traits (crown length and total leaf area) have a stronger effect on growth rates, while physiological traits related to nutrient acquisition (nitrogen concentration), photochemical efficiency (chlorophyll pigments and chlorophyll a fluorescence), and biochemical efficiency (potassium use efficiency) are strong in Gap. Models including multiple traits explained growth rates better in Gap (up to 62%) and Understory (up to 47%), but just in Gap the best model comprises traits that are representative of different dimensions of the plant.
   Synthesis. We advanced the knowledge behind the light effects on tree sapling by posit that trait-trait and trait-growth relationships vary across light environments. Therefore, light availability is a key environmental factor to be considered when choosing the set of traits to be measured in functional approach studies using tropical tree saplings. In compliance with the phenotype integration hypothesis, functional traits are better predictors of growth rates when grouped in a set of traits of different dimensions of the plant that represent different functional mechanisms.

AB There is a knowledge gap regarding the influence of bamboos on natural regeneration. This study evaluated how abundance, richness, dominance, evenness, diversity of the seed bank and biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., canopy opening, herbaceous cover, and litter thickness), differ between bamboo dominated (B) and non-dominated (NB) areas. The study was conducted in a fragment of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest surrounded by an agricultural landscape. Soil samples were taken at 20 points in each area at two time periods, to evaluate the seed bank. The results show that diversity and structural parameters of the seed bank differ between areas and time periods. There was higher abundance and richness of seedlings of herbaceous ruderal species in area B and a greater abundance of seedlings of arboreal species in area NB. Sampling points in the bamboo dominated area had greater canopy openings and greater cover by herbaceous species, facilitating the establishment of individuals belonging to the families Poaceae and Cyperaceae, which could have competitive advantages over other species of the regenerating community. Considering that bamboo can affect the seed bank, long-term studies are needed to understand successional dynamics and evaluate suitable management actions to conserve the diversity in remaining forests.

AB During a taxonomic and phylogenetic study of Xylopia from the Amazon River basin, South America, we examined collections from the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Para, Rondonia, and Tocantins that resembled Xylopia nitida by some characteristics of the leaves, but differed consistently from the latter in a number of floral and fruit characters. On the basis of these specimens we describe here a new species, Xylopia maasiana. The new species is a small to medium-sized tree encountered mostly in riparian habitats across the southern Brazilian Amazon and in some transition areas between the Amazon forest and cerrado biomes in Central Brazil. In addition to the detailed description, we include a preliminary assessment of conservation status, taxonomic comments, illustrations, a distribution map of the new species, and comparison with X. nitida.

AB A new Schizanthus species from northern Chile is described and illustrated. Schizanthus nutantiflorus was discovered based on recent collections made during unusual rain events in the Atacama Desert in 2015. The new species is distinguished morphologically from other Schizanthus species from northern Chile by its short corolla tube, with a distinct upper lip arrangement and colour, having the longest lower lip, and downward-facing flowers. Additionally, the reinstatement of Schizanthus fallax is proposed. By using both nDNA and cpDNA, phylogenetic relationships among all species of Schizanthus were investigated. Molecular and field observations, as well as an exhaustive morphological revision of fresh material and herbarium specimens, supports the segregation of Schizanthus with short corolla tubes from northern Chile into three species. We propose that, in order to fully understand both the taxonomy and evolution of Schizanthus, an integrative framework encompassing molecular, ecological, and morphological data should be carried out. Information on distribution, habitat, informal conservation status, as well as taxonomic notes and illustrations are provided. In addition, an updated key for the species of Schizanthus from northern Chile is given.

AB Introduction: Multiple studies have been carried out in forests affected by hurricanes, but the information obtained for Costa Rica is scarce or null, in the case of direct impacts such as Otto, so it is necessary to expand the existing knowledge about the effects of these phenomena on tropical forests and the recovery mechanisms of these biomes. Consequently, it is necessary to identify the vulnerability of ecosystems in long term and quantify the losses that are generated at different scales, as a result of the intense events of rain and strong winds. Objective: Determining behavior and recovery status in a secondary forest directly affected by Hurricane Otto in Boca Tapada, Pital, San Carlos, Costa Rica. Methods: Ten 20 x 50 m sampling units were systematically distributed within a secondary forest affected by Hurricane Otto in Boca Tapada, San Carlos. The current condition of the forest was evaluated, the species that received the most damage due to high winds were identified, as well as those that have the capacity to recover through regrowths. An overflight was carried out with an unmanned aerial vehicle and an orthomosaic was constructed, subsequently digitized, and classified according to the state of the forest cover presented in three evaluated moments, initial condition, after logging and the condition at the time of sampling. Population density, diversity, and basal area, were compared to data obtained in an adjacent primary forest also affected by the passage of Hurricane Otto. Results: It was obtained that 69.5 % of individuals with d >= 5 cm are in good condition, 20.3 % were broken in the tree canopy and 12.7% inclined without exposure of the roots. The family that provided the greatest species richness is Fabaceae, which is the same with the greatest abundance of damaged individuals and the one with the highest number of species with the ability to resprouting. The species that suffered the most damage was Couma macrocarpa (Euphorbiaceae). The initial area of forest cover was reduced by 7.63 % due to logging and 44.25 % due to Hurricane Otto. It was determined that there are significant differences in species diversity (P = 0.0004; alpha = 0.05) and in the density of individuals (P = 0.0011; alpha = 0.05). The secondary forest has the highest average in both cases. There are no significant differences in the values of the basal area (P = 0.6951; alpha = 0.05). Conclusions: 30.5 % of the forest mass was affected by the passage of Hurricane Otto and the Fabaceae family plays an important role in forest recovery. In addition, forest harvesting in a forest can increase the risk of being affected by the passage of hurricanes and the secondary forest has a greater diversity of species and a higher density of individuals than the primary forest.

AB Planting tree monocultures in Brazilian savannas is a common practice for wood production. However, afforestation and fire suppression have caused significant ecological changes and biodiversity loss in the Cerrado region. Restoring these modified systems to their pre-plantation states remains a considerable challenge. In this study, we compared the recovery of savanna vegetation after afforestation in areas managed with three restoration strategies: (i) old pine plantation stands that are not managed anymore (control), (ii) passive restoration (natural regeneration after pine clearcutting), and (iii) native tree planting (native tree seedlings planted at high density after pine clearcutting). To compare the outcome of each strategy to native ecosystems that were never plantations, we sampled a cerrado sensu stricto (the desired restoration target), and a cerradao (the local alternative state when savannas are fire-suppressed). Fifteen years after applying the restoration approaches, we assessed the structure, richness, and composition of the plant communities. For the analyses, we separated the upper layer (woody native species, diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm) and ground layer (woody species with height >= 50 cm and DBH < 5 cm, and subshrubs and herbs), and distinguished savanna species from forest and generalist species. The results showed that both passive restoration and native tree planting restored the structure, richness, and composition of the upper layer, reaching the values of the cerrado sensu stricto. In contrast, in all treatments, the ground layer lacked the subshrubs and herbs typical of undisturbed savannas, with communities appearing similar to cerradao. Generalist species dominated all layers, and tree canopy cover in the treatments (mean values from 64.7% to 83.0%) ranged from 2.4 to 3 times the cover value recorded in the cerrado sensu stricto (mean of 28%). Pine clearcutting, independent of whether it was followed by native tree planting, improved the recovery of savanna woody vegetation. Therefore, we suggest that pine clearcutting, but not tree planting, is necessary to restore the woody community. Despite these apparently positive restoration outcomes for the woody plant community, it is important to note that after 15 years of passive restoration, communities are turning into low-diversity forests composed of generalist species and lacking savanna species in the ground-layer community. We therefore suggest that restoration of cerrado sensu stricto after pine clearcutting will require controlling woody encroachment, via prescribed fire or mechanical tree thinning, and planting of savanna subshrubs and herbs, rather than trees.

AB Mechanisms that allow plants to survive and reproduce after herbivory are considered to play a key role in plant evolution. In this study, we evaluated how tolerance varies in species with different historic exposure to herbivores considering ontogeny. We exposed the range-restricted species Medicago citrina and its closely related and widespread species M. arborea to one and two herbivory simulations (80 % aerial biomass loss). Physiological and growth parameters related to tolerance capacity were assessed to evaluate constitutive values (without herbivory) and induced tolerance after damage. Constitutive traits were not always related to greater tolerance, and each species compensated for herbivory through different traits. Herbivory damage only led to mortality in M. citrina; adults exhibited root biomass loss and increased oxidative stress after damage, but also compensated aerial biomass. Despite seedlings showed a lower death percentage than adults after herbivory in M. citrina, they showed less capacity to recover control values than adults. Moderate tolerance to M. arborea herbivory and low tolerance to M. citrina is found. Thus, although the constitutive characteristics are maintained in the lineage, the tolerance of plants decreases in M. citrina. That represents how plants respond to the lack of pressure from herbivores in their habitat.

AB Author summary
   Worldwide, ecosystems are collapsing or in danger of collapse, but the precise causes of these collapses are often unknown. Observational and experimental evidence shows that all ecosystems are characterized by strong interactions between and among species, and that these webs of interactions can be important contributors to the preservation of ecosystem diversity. But many of the interactions-such as those involving pathogenic microorganisms and the chemical defenses that are mounted by their prey-are not easily identified and analyzed in ecosystems that may have hundreds or thousands of species. Here we use our equal-area-annulus analytical method to examine census data from over three million trees in forest plots from around the world. We show how the method can be used to flag pairs and groups of species that exhibit unusual levels of interaction and that are likely on further investigation to yield information about their causative mechanisms. We give a detailed example showing how some of these interactions can be traced to defense mechanisms that are possessed by one of the tree species. We explore how our method can be used to identify the between-species interactions that play the largest roles in the maintenance of ecosystems and their diversity.
   When Darwin visited the Galapagos archipelago, he observed that, in spite of the islands' physical similarity, members of species that had dispersed to them recently were beginning to diverge from each other. He postulated that these divergences must have resulted primarily from interactions with sets of other species that had also diverged across these otherwise similar islands. By extrapolation, if Darwin is correct, such complex interactions must be driving species divergences across all ecosystems. However, many current general ecological theories that predict observed distributions of species in ecosystems do not take the details of between-species interactions into account. Here we quantify, in sixteen forest diversity plots (FDPs) worldwide, highly significant negative density-dependent (NDD) components of both conspecific and heterospecific between-tree interactions that affect the trees' distributions, growth, recruitment, and mortality. These interactions decline smoothly in significance with increasing physical distance between trees. They also tend to decline in significance with increasing phylogenetic distance between the trees, but each FDP exhibits its own unique pattern of exceptions to this overall decline. Unique patterns of between-species interactions in ecosystems, of the general type that Darwin postulated, are likely to have contributed to the exceptions. We test the power of our null-model method by using a deliberately modified data set, and show that the method easily identifies the modifications. We examine how some of the exceptions, at the Wind River (USA) FDP, reveal new details of a known allelopathic effect of one of the Wind River gymnosperm species. Finally, we explore how similar analyses can be used to investigate details of many types of interactions in these complex ecosystems, and can provide clues to the evolution of these interactions.

AB Lauraceae species are widely represented in the Amazon, presenting a significant essential oil yield, large chemical variability, various biological applications, and high economic potential. Its taxonomic classification is difficult due to the accentuated morphological uniformity, even among taxa from a different genus. For this reason, the present work aimed to find chemical and molecular markers to discriminate Aniba species collected in the Para State (Brazil). The chemical composition of the essential oils from Aniba canelilla, A. parviflora, A. rosaeodora, and A. terminalis were grouped by multivariate statistical analysis. The major compounds were rich in benzenoids and terpenoids such as 1-nitro-2-phenylethane (88.34-70.85%), linalool (15.2-75.3%), alpha-phellandrene (36.0-51.8%), and beta-phellandrene (11.6-25.6%). DNA barcodes were developed using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) nuclear region, and the matK, psbA-trnH, rbcL, and ycf1 plastid regions. The markers psbA-trnH and ITS showed the best discrimination for the species, and the phylogenic analysis in the three- (rbcL + matK + trnH - psbA and rbcL + matK + ITS) and four-locus (rbcL + matK + trnH - psbA + ITS) combination formed clades with groups strongly supported by the Bayesian inference (BI) (PP:1.00) and maximum likelihood (ML) (BS >= 97%). Therefore, based on statistical multivariate and phylogenetic analysis, the results showed a significant correlation between volatile chemical classes and genetic characteristics of Aniba species.

AB Aims Screening tree species in tropical rainforest according to their shade tolerance is important to efficiently manage the native trees of economic significance in secondary forest enrichment regimes. The objective of this study was to determine the whole-plant light compensation point (WPLCP) and compare the phenotypic plasticity in relation to growth and carbon allocation of Cariniana legalis and Gallesia integrifolia seedlings under low light availability.
   Methods Seedlings were cultivated for 77 days under conditions of five photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (0.02, 1.1, 2.3, 4.5 and 5.9 mol photons m(-2) day(-1)) in three replicates. Growth and carbon allocation variables were determined.
   Important Findings Growth rates of C. legalis were higher and lower than those of G. integrifolia under 1.1 and 5.9 mol photons m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The WPLCP differed significantly between the two species. In accordance with the criteria of the shade tolerance classification for these two tropical tree species, our results showed that C. legalis had lower WPLCP and phenotypic plasticity in terms of higher growth rates and greater shade tolerance than G. integrifolia. From a practical point of view, we demonstrated that the differential linkage between growth and changing PAR between the two species can become a useful tool for comparing and selecting tree species in forest enrichment projects.

AB Background: Plants in drylands have developed several water use efficiency (WUE) adaptations, although nutrient limitations and excess irradiances affect also their performance. Previous findings of high photosynthetic rates and nitrogen concentration in leaves, may contradict the known low productivity in their communities.
   Questions: How different are leaf ecophysiological and stoichiometric traits in dryland species? Did species favor higher water or nutrient use efficiencies in contrasting dryland communities?
   Studied species / data description/Mathematical model: Calliandra eriophylla, Cercidium microphyllum, Encelia farinosa, Eysenhardtia orthocarpa, Fouquieria diguetii, Fouquieria macdougalii, Ipomoea arborescens, Jatropha cardiophylla, Jatropha cordata, Larrea tridentata, Mimosa laxiflora, Olneya tesota and Prosopis velutina.
   Study site and dates: Sonoran Desert, Central Sonora Region, Mexico. August - September 2019.
   Methods: Ecophysiological and stoichiometric leaf traits were measured and analyzed for dominant species and functional types from two Sonoran Desert plant communities.
   Results: We found greater variability in photosynthetic and fluorescence traits than in elemental composition (N-mass, P-mass) and stoichiometry ratios. Species in the arid site tend to have higher photosynthetic rates and photochemical integration but low WUE. In the semiarid community, leaf traits were associated to higher elemental composition (N-mass, P-mass) but low stoichiometric ratios and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE).
   Conclusions: Leaf Traits in Sonoran Desert species and functional types correlated with photoprotective mechanisms rather than instantaneous resources use efficiencies, to ensure long term C gain.

AB Background: The genus Solanum (Solanaceae) groups annual, perennial and epiphytic herbs, herbaceous and woody lianas, shrubs and suffrutex, and trees. The flowers are pentamerous, gamosepalous and gamopetalous, with stellate, pentagonal or rotate corollas. The anthers dehisce by apical pores and the fruit is a berry. Among angiosperms, Solanum is a mega-diverse group, ranked among the 10 most diverse genera. The group includes 1,234 species but the infrageneric limits and relationships are still debated. Mexico is a center of diversification of the genus, but morphological variation and the numerous names published, difficult the species identification.
   Questions: How many species of Solanum are there in Mexico? What morphological characters are important for their identification?
   Studied taxon: Solanum
   Study site: Mexico
   Methods: We reviewed herbarium specimens deposited at 15 herbaria and 10 digital collections and databases. We validated the names on Tropicos, The Plant List, the International Plant Names Index and the Solanaceae Source. We also gather the protologues and printed out the nomenclatural types deposited at Global Plants. Lastly, we observed vegetative and floral variation and distribution range of the species to construct the dichotomous keys.
   Results: There are 134 species of Solanum, grouped into 22 sections. We presented keys for sections within Solanum and species within each section. Additionally, we showed photographs of representative species.
   Conclusions: Mexico is a diversification center for Solanum, the group is also a good proxy of the Mexican angiosperm flora. Dichotomous keys will facilitate the identification in the field and herbaria.y

TI Soil resource availability, plant defense, and herbivory along a

   Sclerophylly; Soil traits
AB Tropical dry forests (TDFs) usually occur as mosaics at different stages of natural regeneration, along which variations in soil attributes (fertility and texture) can affect plant growth and leaf traits and, consequently, leaf herbivory. In the present study, we used a chronosequence approach to determine the variations in plant growth, leaf defense, and insect herbivory in different successional species groups, following the predictions of the resource availability hypothesis: plants at early successional stages would grow faster, have lower specific leaf mass (SLM), and suffer higher herbivore damage than late successional plants. For this purpose, we measured plant diameter and collected leaves at the end of the rainy season (April) during three consecutive years in three different successional stages (early, intermediate, and late). In total, we sampled 38 plant species, from which 31 species were exclusive to a single successional stage (10 early, 13 intermediate, and eight late species). Our results did not conform to the resource availability hypothesis, as plants growing in early successional stages had higher growth rates and SLM, and lower leaf damage by herbivores. Soil fertility and texture did not affect plant growth or SLM, but leaf damage was negatively affected by SLM. Apart from being a defensive trait, SLM is also involved in the conservation of water and nutrients and photoprotection, and its variation along successional gradients in TDFs conforms to a continuum from conservative traits in hot and dry, early successional stages, to acquisitive traits in more humid late stages. Although other plant defenses must be considered, our three-year study indicates that the resource availability hypothesis, which was formulated for wet forests, should be adapted to deciduous TDFs where water availability is the main environmental filter along succession.

AB Anthropogenic forest fragmentation impacts many aspects of animal behaviour, including feeding ecology. With forests increasingly fragmented in tropical regions due to human development, the proportion of forest edge (<= 100 m from clear-cut regions) is higher relative to forest interior. Forest edges differ in vegetation from interior, making it important to better understand how anthropogenic edges impact the feeding behaviour of primates such as mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata). We predicted that howler monkeys would feed on higher-quality plant resources, from a larger number of tree families, and from larger trees in forest interior compared to anthropogenic forest edge. We surveyed howler monkey feeding behaviour across forest zones in a fragmented rainforest in Costa Rica, La Suerte Biological Research Station. We observed individual monkeys for 30-minute periods, collecting data on their feeding behaviour and tree use at 2-minute intervals. We measured feeding trees and recorded the plant parts and taxonomy of resources consumed. Monkeys consumed more leaves and fewer stems and fed from a smaller number of tree families in the forest interior, while they consumed fewer leaves and more stems and fed from a larger number of tree families in the forest edge. Monkeys also fed from larger, taller trees in the forest interior than the edge. The differences in howler monkey feeding behaviour between forest zones attest to the impact of human disturbance on howler monkey feeding ecology.

AB Biodiversity has critical phylogenetic and functional components, yet many prior studies of marine communities focus only on taxonomic diversity. Here, we surveyed intertidal crustacean communities across 11 sites in the Puget Sound (Washington state). We calculated taxonomic diversity (Shannon's H), functional diversity (functional evenness and Rao's Q), and phylogenetic diversity to examine how these indices were related and how they varied with environmental factors. A model selection approach (AIC) was used to examine which factors (habitat complexity, algal richness, salinity, and urbanization) were the best predictors for each index. Across sites, all four diversity indices were moderately correlated. Algal richness emerged as an important factor, occurring in well-supported models across all diversity indices: sites with more algal species had higher levels of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. Species diversity of both herbivores and non-herbivores was positively correlated with algal species richness, suggesting algae may be important for habitat as well as a food source. More species-rich algal communities had more phylogenetically diverse assemblages of herbivores, but algal richness was not correlated to non-herbivore phylogenetic diversity. Boulder size, but not other measures of habitat complexity, was positively correlated with functional diversity; most diversity in our samples was associated with boulders. Sites adjacent to higher levels of impervious surfaces (e.g., urbanization) had lower values of functional evenness. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that anthropogenic factors can have particularly strong effects on functional or phylogenetic diversity, and our study provides a number of tools for future investigations of crustacean diversity in this region.

AB Considering the globalization of forest land use and the influence of China?s socio-economic process on forest resources, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of China?s forest land use change in the globalized world economy during 2000?2011, by means of embodiment accounting based on EXIOBASE3 database. External demand, primarily from USA, EU, Japan and rest of Asia-Pacific, accounts for 20-45% of China?s direct forest land use, meanwhile, increasing forest land use (50-60%) is displaced abroad, mainly to Russia (20-30%), America, Africa and rest of Asia-Pacific. Overall, China is a net importer of virtual forest land use due to large imports through forest products (e.g., wood, paper and pulp), while highly-processed non-forest products also contribute a dominant and increasing share in total exports. Consequently, in the trade with USA, Japan and many European countries, China is the net exporter of virtual forest land use, though it is the net importer of forest products as revealed by conventional monetary trade accounting, highlighting the necessity of the in-clusive embodiment accounting to trace land use to actual final products. Regarding final consumption, virtual forest land use of rural households only reaches 65?75% that of urban households, due to large disparities in the consumption of non-forest products. Per capita virtual forest land use of the rural and urban poorest groups are only 1/5 and 1/6 of the nation?s richest group, respectively. Therefore, transnational cooperation is required to promote sustainable forest management worldwide. China should also prepare for growing demand for forest land and reduce associated environmental inequality in the process of urbanization and poverty alleviation.

AB Reproductive phenology of organisms is modulated by biotic and abiotic factors, with direct effects on the demography. This study describes the annual reproductive phenology of Dichotomius satanas (Harold, 1867) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Scarabaeinae) of the cloud forest in eastern Mexico, through the morphological changes in the reproductive systems of individuals and their relationship with climatic conditions. Three stages of sexual maturity were recognised as occurring throughout the year: immature, maturing, and mature - with a higher occurrence of immature individuals. Abundance of immature and maturing females was explained by minimum temperature, but none of the environmental variables considered was related to mature females. Abundance of immature and maturing males was related to precipitation, while abundance of mature males was related to minimum temperature and precipitation. The phenology of D. satanas was markedly seasonal with a single peak of abundance corresponding to the reproductive period during the warm and rainy season, thus indicating a univoltine pattern of reproduction. Immature females were recorded before immature males, and no synchrony was observed between the maturing and mature males and females. We provide information pertaining to the reproductive biology of coprophagous beetles and highlight the importance of reproductive phenology as a tool with which to understand future environmental scenarios.

AB Rainforest revegetation projects often deliver suboptimal outcomes due to the recolonization of invasive pasture grasses, but little is known about the effects of grass reinvasion on the survival and growth of established saplings. Even less is known about the costs and benefits of controlling pasture grasses once they have reinvaded. To address these knowledge gaps, we implemented a split-plot grass control experiment in a 2-year old subtropical rainforest restoration planting in South East Queensland, Australia, that was reinvaded by the exotic pasture grass Chloris gayana. Grass removal involved brush cutting around saplings, spraying herbicide and then laying 1 m(2) jute matting. The costs of implementing the treatment were recorded, and the survival, growth and physiological stress of treated and control saplings were monitored for 1 year. Non-target herbicide application reduced survival by 6.5% in treated saplings, affecting mainly smaller plants that were below the grass canopy at the onset of the experiment. Beyond this direct herbicide effect, smaller treated saplings were also more stressed (lower chlorophyll fluorescence) and had substantially lower survival after 1 year than untreated saplings of the same size. There was limited evidence that removing grass increased growth rates, even for saplings that were already taller than the grass canopy at the start of the experiment. While the growth benefits of controlling grass may become more apparent with time, our results suggest that grass removal is not an effective management strategy in untended plantings due to the heightened risk of sapling mortality, coupled with the considerable labour and material costs.

AB We evaluated the vulnerability of nesting sites (sandbanks) available to Podocnemis expansa, P. unifilis and P. sextuberculata to human threats and the coverage of these areas by a public policy created to conserve turtles. Species distribution models were used to identify potential nesting areas in the Brazilian Amazon, where sandbanks were mapped through satellite imagery. Values of threats (deforestation, mining, dams and density of human communities) were normalized from 0 to 1 and summed in each 100 km2 pixel. We calculated the mean value of threats and sandbanks area for each basin. Basins with the greatest values for those variables were considered as the most vulnerable. We calculated the coverage of turtle nesting sites that have conservation actions in relation to the sandbanks available and if they are located in the most vulnerable basins. The areas of greatest gaps in conservation actions and vulnerability are located in the Tocantins-Araguaia basins and in rivers such as: Branco, Guapore ', Amazonas, Solimo similar to es, Madeira, Tapaj ' os and Xingu. Nesting sites included by the public policy covered 15.17 % of the number of basins and about 21 % of total sandbank areas, encompassing 11 % of the most vulnerable basins and 43 % of their sandbanks. We suggest the prioritization of conservation actions in areas of greatest gaps in conservation activities and vulnerability. In addition, we propose the articulation among institutions and the increase of initiatives of community-based conservation management to increase the geographical coverage of the greatest impacted regions.

AB Deforestation remains a major concern with regard to climate change and the maintenance of biodiversity. Meanwhile, the development of new image processing techniques and the broad availability of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery provide an unprecedented setup for the development of effective and scalable forest cover change monitoring systems. This is especially relevant in regions with large forested areas with high rates of deforestation, such as in the region of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. In this context, existing forest cover change monitoring methods are based on a combination of visual inspection, spectral profiles, statistics, and machine learning techniques, which offer alternative backbones to deal with deforestation monitoring. Given the recent advances in the field of image processing by Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs), the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the U-Net architecture for the mapping of forest cover aimed at identifying deforestation polygons in multi-temporal satellite imagery. To this end, 10-m resolution imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite covering portions of the Legal Amazon region were employed. The U-Net could identify and draw polygons of forest areas and forest fragments with high accuracy (0.9470), precision (0.9356), recall (0.9676), and F1-score (0.9513), thus outperforming largely applied and well-know supervised and unsupervised image classification methods. The results indicate and we further discuss that UNets have the potential to run as the backbone for efficient forest cover change monitoring initiatives and support the deployment of near real-time deforestation warning systems.

AB Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important link between carbon and water cycles, which is critical for the forests under future global climatic changes. WUENDVI was calculated by accumulated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and actual evapotranspiration (ET) and could reflect the impacts of climatic changes and human activities on WUE. The three forestry regions of China are the northeast, southwest, and southeast areas. Among them, the northeast forest region is a natural forest region with forest stock accounting for more than 1/4 of China, and the southwest mountainous forest region is another natural forest region in China, with forest stock accounting for more than 1/3 of China, while the southeast forest area is mainly plantations. In 2018, the forest areas over three forestry regions of China were around 1,725,988 km(2). This paper evaluated the changes in forest WUE and their relationships with climatic change and human activities over three forestry regions of China during 1961-2019. The main findings of this study were summarized as follows: (1) the spatial changes of WUE were gentle in the artificial forest region but fluctuant sharply in the natural forest regions. In the southwest forest region, the WUE increased with elevation, while it showed the opposite trends in the artificial forest region. Overall, the annual mean forest WUE increased in almost all regions of the study areas during 1961-2019; (2) in the northeast and southeast forest regions, the WUE presented a negative relationship with the temperature. In the southwest forest region, the WUE was positively correlated with the temperature and its increase rate slowed down significantly when the temperature increases by more than 1 degrees C. The WUE was negatively correlated with precipitation in the three regions and was more sensitive to the decrease of precipitation. The sensitivity of WUE to precipitation reduction was highest in the artificial forest region and lowest in the northeast forest region; (3) the forest WUE and WUENDVI were lowest in the artificial forest region but highest in the northeast forest region, while the net increase in forests area during 1980-2018 was largest in the artificial forest region (155,975 km(2)) but lowest in the northeast forest region (78,766 km(2)). In general, human activities had the greatest impact on the forest WUE in the northeast forest region. Human activities and climatic change had quite complex and interactive effects on forest WUE. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the joint influences of climate change and human activities on WUE.

AB Changes in the vegetation of Brazilian Cerrado may occur over time. However, long-term dynamics are not fully understood yet, especially woody plant encroachment (WPE). The objective of this study was to examine changes in vegetation structure in a preserved area in Triangulo Mineiro region, within the southern Brazilian Cerrado domain, over 32 years (1987, 2005, and 2019). We based the study on field and literature surveys, as well as satellite imagery, and hypothesized that, due to the absence of periodic fires or grazing, Cerrado open formations (i.e., grassland or savanna) tend to become denser due to WPE. Shrubby grassland cover assessed in 1987 disappeared in the following periods (from 30.0% to 0.0% in 2019) while forest formations increased (from 7.0% in 1987 to 11.0% in 2019). Changes between 2005 and 2019 occurred within the stricto sensu cerrado subdivisions, with reduction of sparse cerrado (from 34.2% to 7.7 %) and an increase in dense cerrado (from 6.9% to 39.8 %). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied for similar periods indicates a progressive increase of values over time (from 1986 (0.61 +/- 0.10) to 2004 (0.65 +/- 0.06) and 2018 (0.78 +/- 0.05)) and corroborates the WPE process. These patterns imply the loss of biodiversity in open plant formation. Another major consequence was the reduction of wetlands and possible impact on water supply. Such patterns are important to support plant management plans for the threatened Cerrado open plant formations.

AB Understanding the processes that shape forest functioning, structure, and diversity remains challenging, although data on forest systems are being collected at a rapid pace and across scales. Forest models have a long history in bridging data with ecological knowledge and can simulate forest dynamics over spatio-temporal scales unreachable by most empirical investigations.
   We describe the development that different forest modelling communities have followed to underpin the leverage that simulation models offer for advancing our understanding of forest ecosystems.
   Using three widely applied but contrasting approaches - species distribution models, individual-based forest models, and dynamic global vegetation models - as examples, we show how scientific and technical advances have led models to transgress their initial objectives and limitations. We provide an overview of recent model applications on current important ecological topics and pinpoint ten key questions that could, and should, be tackled with forest models in the next decade.
   Synthesis. This overview shows that forest models, due to their complementarity and mutual enrichment, represent an invaluable toolkit to address a wide range of fundamental and applied ecological questions, hence fostering a deeper understanding of forest dynamics in the context of global change.

AB Understanding the genetic responses of different species to the landscape attributes is essential to improve conservation actions and decision-making. However, making generalizations about such responses is not trivial, since they can be influenced by several factors. Aspects related to landscape matrix quality, for example, such as contrast and heterogeneity, may play a relevant role in the spatial-genetic structuring of populations since functional connectivity is influenced by the degree of matrix permeability. Intending to identify trends of genetic responses to habitat fragmentation and the aspects influencing these responses, we employed a meta-analytical approach to investigate the degree of genetic structuring of small mammal populations, measured through the fixation index (FST), in anthropogenic landscapes. For this, we obtained data of 28 species from 38 studies worldwide. We investigated the heterogeneity among species' responses by focusing on the influence of matrix quality (contrast and heterogeneity), and species' life-history traits (mean dispersal distance, generation time, and locomotor mode), controlling the influence of the marker type used in the study and the isolation by distance (IBD) among the patches habitat. We found a consistent pattern of genetic structuring of small mammal populations in anthropogenic landscapes, which present a significant genetic differentiation. Genetic structure is mostly influenced by matrix quality characteristics so that populations established in landscapes with high contrast and more heterogeneous matrices tend to be more structured. Also, populations of species with long generation time and high dispersal capacity exhibit a greater degree of genetic structure. Besides, accounting for IBD as a fixed effect was crucial to understand the variation among studies' findings. Thus, the degree of genetic structuring of small mammal populations reflects the functional connectivity of the landscape, resulting from a balance between landscape attributes (matrix contrast and heterogeneity) and species' life-history traits. Overall, our findings suggest that small mammals may be more susceptible to fragmentation than previously recognized, calling for special attention to this group considering their importance to maintain community structure and ecosystem functioning.

   driven by climate and net primary productivity
SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY

AB Aim Foraging activity is critical for animal survival. Comprehending how ecological drivers influence foraging behaviour would benefit our understanding of the link between animals and ecological processes. Here, we evaluated the influence of ecological drivers on ant foraging activity and relative resource use.
   Location Six Brazilian biomes: Amazon, Atlantic rainforest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pampa and Pantanal.
   Taxon Formicidae.
   Methods We assessed ant foraging activity and resource use by sampling across 60 sites. We placed baited tubes that contained one of five liquid resources (sugar, lipids, amino acid, sodium and distilled water). We used model selection to assess the influence of ecological drivers (temperature, precipitation, temperature seasonality and net primary productivity) on ant foraging activity and relative resource use.
   Results Foraging activity was higher in wetter, more productive and less thermally seasonal environments. The relative use of amino acids increased at higher temperatures while the relative use of lipids decreased. The relative use of sugar increased in drier and less productive environments with high-temperature seasonality while the relative use of amino acid and sodium decreased in those environments. The relative use of lipids was complex: increasing with increasing temperature seasonality and decreasing with increasing precipitation. Furthermore, the relative use of sodium was greater where the foraging activity was high.
   Main conclusions We demonstrate how ecological drivers are correlated with ant foraging activity and resource use in the field across large spatial scales. The search for resources encompasses different interactions involving ants with abiotic and biotic components in the ecosystem. Thus, we suggest that changes in climate and NPP, which influence the intensity and the way that ants search for resources, will result in changes in ant-mediated ecological processes.

AB The growth of Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) is potentially having widespread effects on terrestrial and coastal habitats. In this study we addressed both the individual effects of ALAN, as well as its combined effect with predation risk on the behaviour of Concholepas concholepas, a fishery resource and a keystone species in the southeastern Pacific coast. We measured the influence of ALAN and predation risk on this mollusc's feeding rate, use of refuge for light and crawling out of water behaviour. These behavioural responses were studied using light intensities that mimicked levels that had been recorded in coastal habitat exposed to ALAN. Cues were from two species known to prey on C. concholepas during its early ontogeny: the crab Acanthocyclus hassleri and the seastar Heliaster helianthus. The feeding rates of C. concholepas were 3-4 times higher in darkness and in the absence of predator cues. In contrast, ALAN exposed C. concholepas showed lower feeding activity and were more likely to be in a refuge than those exposed to control conditions. In the presence of olfactory predator cues, and regardless of light treatment, C. concholepas tended to crawl-out of the waterline. We provide evidence to support the hypothesis that exposure to either ALAN or predation risk can alter the feeding behaviour of C. concholepas. However, predator cue recognition in C. concholepas was not affected by ALAN in situations where ALAN and predator cues were both present: C. concholepas continued to forage when predation risk was low, i.e., in darkness and away from predator cues. Whilst this response means that ALAN may not lead to increased predation mortality in C. concholepas, it will reduce feeding activity in this naturally nocturnal species in the absence of dark refugia. Such results may have implications for the long-term health, productivity and sustainability of this keystone species. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS; GROWTH; COMPLEXITY; GLYPHOSATE
AB Aims The limitations of classical Lotka-Volterra models for analyzing and interpreting competitive interactions among plant species have become increasingly clear in recent years. Three of the problems that have been identified are (i) the absence of frequency-dependence, which is important for long-term coexistence of species, (ii) the need to take unmeasured (often unmeasurable) variables influencing individual performance into account (e.g. spatial variation in soil nutrients or pathogens) and (iii) the need to separate measurement error from biological variation.
   Methods We modified the classical Lotka-Volterra competition models to address these limitations. We fitted eight alternative models to pin-point cover data on Festuca ovina and Agrostis capillaris over 3 years in an herbaceous plant community in Denmark. A Bayesian modeling framework was used to ascertain whether the model amendments improve the performance of the models and increase their ability to predict community dynamics and to test hypotheses.
   Important Findings Inclusion of frequency-dependence and measurement error, but not unmeasured variables, improved model performance greatly. Our results emphasize the importance of comparing alternative models in quantitative studies of plant community dynamics. Only by considering possible alternative models can we identify the forces driving community assembly and change, and improve our ability to predict the behavior of plant communities.

AB Compared to the leaf-miners and stem-miners on flowering plants, the miners on ferns (including both Lycopodiophyta and Polypodiophyta in the broad sense) are less known. Knowledge of miners and their host plants is essential to fully understand plant-insect interactions. Although there are many scattered records on fern miners, a worldwide checklist has not been reported.
   We provide a preliminary checklist of fern-mining insects and their host plants worldwide. Altogether, we found records for 128 species and 18 families of fern miners, mainly that feed on Dennstaedtiaceae, Equisetaceae, Polypodiaceae and Aspleniaceae. Fern miners belonged to four orders: Diptera (51 species; 39.8%), Coleoptera (33 species; 25.8%), Lepidoptera (28 species; 21.9%) and Hymenoptera (16 species; 12.5%). They are primarily known from the Palaearctic Region, Nearctic Region, Neotropical Region and Oriental Region.

AB 1. The establishment of new botanic gardens in tropical regions highlights a need for weed risk assessment tools suitable for tropical ecosystems. The relevance of plant traits for invasion into tropical rainforests has not been well studied.
   2. Working in and around four botanic gardens in Indonesia where 590 alien species have been planted, we estimated the effect of four plant traits, plus time since species introduction, on: (a) the naturalization probability and (b) abundance (density) of naturalized species in adjacent native tropical rainforests; and (c) the distance that naturalized alien plants have spread from the botanic gardens.
   3. We found that specific leaf area (SLA) strongly differentiated 23 naturalized from 78 non-naturalized alien species (randomly selected from 577 non-naturalized species) in our study. These trends may indicate that aliens with high SLA, which had a higher probability of naturalization, benefit from at least two factors when establishing in tropical forests: high growth rates and occupation of forest gaps. Naturalized aliens had high SLA and tended to be short. However, plant height was not significantly related to species' naturalization probability when considered alongside other traits.
   4. Alien species that were present in the gardens for over 30 years and those with small seeds also had higher probabilities of becoming naturalized, indicating that garden plants can invade the understorey of closed canopy tropical rainforests, especially when invading species are shade tolerant and have sufficient time to establish.
   5. On average, alien species that were not animal dispersed spread 78 m further into the forests and were more likely to naturalize than animal-dispersed species. We did not detect relationships between the measured traits and estimated density of naturalized aliens in the adjacent forests.
   6. Synthesis: Traits were able to differentiate alien species from botanic gardens that naturalized in native forest from those that did not; this is promising for developing trait-based risk assessment in the tropics. To limit the risk of invasion and spread into adjacent native forests, we suggest tropical botanic gardens avoid planting alien species with fast carbon capture strategies and those that are shade tolerant.

AB We present rare, empirical evidence on the permanence of land use changes induced by a payments for ecosystem services (PES) program. A follow-up study was conducted a decade after the end of the Regional Integrated Silvo-pastoral Ecosystem Management Project (RISEMP) in Costa Rica. Econometric analysis found that silvopastoral practices persisted in the long term and are not reverted. On average there is also no meaningful intensification of practices after payments ceased. However, there is some heterogeneity on the individual level. We find that farms that increase adoption after the end of the project are farms with slower adoption during the project while some farms that decrease adoption are intense adopters. This indicates a pattern of convergence in the long run. Additionally, we challenge the assumption that payments are mono-causally inducing land use change by investigating non-monetary factors associated practice adoption. We find that not only PES explains adoption of silvo-pastoral practices. While it is challenging to establish clear casual linkages, we find that adoption is associated with the number of social ties to other farmers as well as negatively correlated to the exposure to traditional production paradigms measured as membership, as well as peer membership, in producer organisations.

AB Genetic information on species can inform decision making regarding conservation of biodiversity since the response of organisms to changing environments depend, in part, on their genetic makeup. Territories of central-southern Chile and Argentina have undergone a varying degree of impact during the Quaternary, where the response of local fauna and flora was rather species-specific. Here, we focus on the sigmodontine rodent Abrothrix hirta, distributed from 35 degrees S in Chile and Argentina to northern Tierra del Fuego. Based on 119,226 transcriptome-derived SNP loci from 46 individuals of A. hirta, we described the geographic distribution of the genetic diversity of this species using a maximum likelihood tree, principal component and admixture analyses. We also addressed the demographic history of the main intraspecific lineages of A. hirta using GADMA. We found that A. hirta exhibited four allopatric intraspecific lineages. Three main genetic groups were identified by a Principal Component Analysis and by Ancestry analysis. The demographic history of A. hirta was characterized by recent population stability for populations at the northernmost part of the range, while southern populations experienced a recent population expansion.

AB Mangrove forests globally suffer from habitat destruction and fragmentation, which may result in severe reductions in mangrove ecosystem biodiversity and functioning. We explored the influence of mangrove fragments on the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of invertebrate macrobenthic assemblages in a coastal seascape that has undergone substantial changes over the past decades, including a 60% reduction of mangrove areas between 1960s and now. Samples for macrobenthic invertebrate diversity (infauna and epifauna) and environmental variables were collected inside three fragmented mangrove stands and in an adjoining sandflat. We found that the total density of individuals was, on average, lower inside the existing stands; however, this outcome was driven by the higher abundance of small-sized opportunistic species in the sandflat. On the other hand, taxonomic and functional metrics were higher inside the stands, and species associated with mangroves had larger body size, higher mobility, longer lifespan, and belonged to a larger variety of trophic guilds than species inhabiting the adjacent sandflat. We also found that local environmental features such as wave exposure and total organic carbon content influenced mangrove biodiversity, and different stands harbor different set of species. Interestingly, the area of mangrove stand did not affect taxonomic or functional metrics. Overall, our results provide empirical evidence that even small mangrove fragments enhance functional and taxonomic coastal biodiversity relative to bare sediment and therefore should be preserved to safeguard coastal biodiversity.

AB Longleaf pine once dominated much of the forested area of the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States and is a focal forest type for restoration efforts. In these forests, two species dominate the canopy which may influence tree regeneration. Ultimately, the outcomes of habitat filtering, competition, and disturbance manifest in spatial patterns of tree regeneration, including in longleaf pine ecosystems. Understanding regeneration and establishment patterns can aid in restoration efforts. We ask how the dominant species in an established longleaf pine forest are spatially arranged to provide insight into the mechanisms that may be driving tree establishment in longleaf pine forests.
   We found that longleaf pine saplings were more likely to be found near the other dominant tree species in this forest, turkey oak trees, than in gaps or near to longleaf pine trees. Similarly, turkey oak saplings clustered around turkey oak trees but were dispersed in relation to longleaf pine trees. These findings point towards the interplay between canopy tree composition, leaf litter, and fire behavior as driving mechanisms in the successful establishment of both pines and oaks in this forest.

AB Aims An essential task of agricultural systems is to improve internal phosphorus (P) recycling. Cover crops and tillage reduction can increase sustainability, but it is not known whether stimulation of the soil microbial community can increase the availability of soil organic P pools. Methods In a field experiment in southwest Germany, the effects of a winter cover crop mixture (vs. bare fallow) and no-till (vs. non-inversion tillage) on microbial P-cycling were assessed with soybean as the main crop. Microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), P cycling enzymes, and carbon-substrate use capacity were linked for the first time with the lability of organic P pools measured by enzyme addition assays (using phosphodiesterase, non-phytase-phosphomonoesterase and fungal phytase). Results Microbial phosphorus, phosphatase, and fatty acids increased under cover crops, indicating an enhanced potential for organic P cycling. Enzyme-stable organic P shifted towards enzyme-labile organic P pools. Effects of no-till were weaker, and a synergy with cover crops was not evident. Conclusions In this experiment, cover crops were able to increase the microbially mediated internal P cycling in a non-P-limited, temperate agroecosystems.

AB Urban green space provides refuges for species that are unintentionally introduced by humans and which do not belong to the remnants of natural habitats in urban areas. However, the quantitative relationships between urban green space properties and these spontaneous species are unclear. To address this, we surveyed plant species occurring in urban green patches in Kunming city, which is located in a biodiversity hotspot in southwest China. We classified spontaneous plants into native, non-native and invasive plant species. A total of 386 spontaneous species belonging to 278 genera and 92 families were recorded in 190 patches. Most of the recorded species were herbaceous plants (76.2 %). While invasive species constituted a relatively small proportion of the total species pool (17.9 %), six out of ten of the most frequently occurring species were invasive. Regression models inspired by the theory of Island Biogeography show that total, native, non-native and invasive spontaneous species richness in urban green patches were best explained by the size of the ?island? (patch area), dispersal limitations (as expressed by ?distance to city boundary?) and edge effects (as shown by the landscape shape index). While the set of drivers of spontaneous plants is similar for the different groups of species, the relative importance of each driver varies among them. Our study provides quantification of drivers of biodiversity patterns in urban green space. Based on this understanding, planning and management of urban green space can be adapted to maximize spontaneous plant conservation in rapidly urbanizing biodiversity hotspot regions.

AB Forest gaps play an important role in tree regeneration and forest restoration in modern silviculture. Many previous studies examined gap effects on seedling survival, growth, or both but lacked a systemic assessment incorporating morphological and physiological responses to varying environmental gradients along gap size and within-gap position, which limits foresters to understand the general gap impacts on the early stage of regeneration. Here, we systemically evaluated gap impacts on over 20 regeneration-related variables from two dominant tree species (Manchurian walnut [Juglans mandshurica Maxim.] and Korean spruce [Picea koraiensis Nakai]) planted along the gap-understory gradients based on our previous studies of survival and growth of these two species. The factor analysis of mixed data indicated that seedling specific leaf area, biomass allocation, chlorophyll content, and NSC content in gaps were largely determined by interspecific differences, but seedling survival, growth, and biomass accumulation were mainly related to gap size and within-gap position. Specifically, the net photosynthetic rates of Manchurian walnut were higher in large and medium gaps (or gap centers and transitions) than those in small gaps and forest understory (or gap edges). The root starch content of seedlings in gaps was almost twice as much as that in the forest understory, which also reflected species divergence in gaps. By contrast, Korean spruce exhibited less variation in net photosynthesis and root starch content and fewer differences for most other examined variables, which indicated that it had broad ecological niches and a relatively small gap would promote its regeneration during the seedling stage. Our findings provide evidence of gap partitioning on explaining regeneration patterns of light-demanding species. Therefore, gap size and within-gap position can compensate for each other during gap-based silviculture practices. Timely selective logging can extend an existing gap in a specific direction to change the relative position of target tree species for better light conditions. Appropriate selection and match of tree species to gap size and within-gap position during enrichment planting can improve gap space utilization.

AB Complementarity in phosphorus (P) acquisition from different sources and facilitation of P uptake have been implicated in yield advantages of intercropping. These beneficial interactions between crop species are expected to be particularly relevant on low-P soils.
   Millet and chickpea have previously been found to differ in their ability to access different chemically bound forms of P. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment on a low-P soil with or without P fertilization to determine whether the resulting potential for complementarity and facilitation with respect to P acquisition is associated with increased P uptake and yield of an intercrop as compared to sole crops.
   Alkaline phosphatase activity and carboxylate concentration differed between millet and chickpea, indicating potential complementarity in access to different P sources. Comparison of aboveground P content in the intercrop and the pure stands showed a positive net effect for P uptake (NEP > 0) when no P fertilizer was applied, but this positive net effect for P acquisition was not associated with a yield increase (NEY = 0). When P fertilizer was applied, there was no significant net increase in P uptake by the intercrop compared to sole crops (NEP = 0), but there was a significant yield gain (NEY > 0).
   Species trait dissimilarities for P acquisition from different sources supported complementarity in, and facilitation of P uptake by millet and chickpea in the field on a low-P soil, but this did not result in yield increase. The finding does not support the notion that complementarity in P acquisition from different sources and facilitation of P uptake are key drivers for overyielding by intercropping on low-P soil.

AB Understanding abiotic and biotic factors affecting the survival of seedlings of threatened species such as Afzelia africana is fundamental for restoration and sustainable management purposes. This study used seedling individual-level morphological data and plot-level data to assess the effect of abiotic (season, elevation, soil type and terrain slope) and biotic (seedling initial density, basal diameter, height and number of leaves, insect and fungal infection, insect herbivory, mammal herbivory, vegetation type, adult conspecific density and diameter, and heterospecific density and diameter) factors on the survival probability (at individual level) and survival rate (at plot level) of seedlings of A. africana in the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used for data analyses. At individual level, we found that the survival probability of A. africana seedlings increased with initial height, but decreased from wet to dry season. At plot level, the survival rate of A. africana seedlings also decreased from the wet season (0.72 +/- 0.05) to the dry season (0.18 +/- 0.04) and was inversely proportional to seedling basal diameter (P = 0.024) and density of conspecific adults (P = 0.016). There were also positive effects of seedling initial height (P = 0.026) and mean diameter of conspecific adults (P = 0.037) on survival rate. Among abiotic factors, only terrain slope showed significant and negative effect (P = 0.028) on the survival rate, suggesting higher survival rate on flat terrain. Our findings suggest that sustainably managing seedlings of A. africana would require accounting for conspecific neighboring effect, terrain slope and season-specific actions. Practical aspects of these factors were further discussed.

AB There is increasing evidence that density dependence is an important mechanism for the coexistence of species in natural forest communities. Although density dependence among neighbors has been widely studied in tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests, the effects thereof remain poorly understood for non-zonal forest types (e.g., karst forests). Within this context, we conducted a census of tree species (DBH ? 1 cm) in a 25 ha plot within the Mulun forest, southwest China. Based on the data collected, a spatial statistical technique was used to detect the prevalence of density dependence after accounting for the effects of habitat heterogeneity. Furthermore, we investigated the relationships between species characteristics and the strength of density dependence. Our results indicate that 19 of the 93 tree species recorded in the species-rich subtropical karst forest showed a decline in strength of clustering from juveniles to adults, as expected from self-thinning, while 61 species exhibited densitydependent effects. The strength of density dependence was closely related to specific species characteristics. Trees with a smaller species abundance and higher aggregation had stronger density dependence. Additionally, the strength of density dependence of evergreen and canopy species was greater than that of deciduous and understory species. Our study demonstrates that density dependence is a prevalent mechanism for regulating population structures of the majority of tree species in forest ecosystems. Our findings further improve the understanding of species coexistence and forest ecosystem stability, and provide guidance for forest management.

AB Ecological hypotheses of 'limiting similarity' and 'limiting dissimilarity' formulate the alleged conditions for implementing the competitive exclusion. The limiting similarity hypothesis assumes that exceeding a threshold of interspecific similarity leads to competitive exclusion. The hypothesis of limiting dissimilarity states the opposite -a condition of implementing competitive exclusion is exceeding of a threshold of interspecific dissimilarity. These hypotheses clearly contradict each other and we tested them on the model of competition at different values of relative competitiveness of the species. The model of competition under study we implemented as automatic deductive inference by a method of a completely transparent and completely explainable artificial intelligence. In order to strictly verify the hypotheses, we have excluded different possible factors promoting competitive coexistence. We have achieved that by ensuring that all conditions for the studied complete competitors were equal, with the exception of competitiveness of the species. Using our individual-based cellular automata model we demonstrate that two trophically identical species aggressively competing for a single limiting resource, all other things being equal, may coexist in one limited habitat until the threshold of differences in competitiveness exceeds 31%. The obtained results reject the hypothesis of limiting similarity and confirm the hypothesis about the limiting dissimilarity. The results are of importance for evolution theory and for finding pathways to ecological sustainability. Our individual-based modelling approach, based on the transparent and explainable artificial intelligence, opens up great prospects for a variety of theoretical and applied fields.

AB It is generally recognized that dispersal mode can affect the relative role of environmental and spatial factors in structuring biotic communities. Disentangling the effects of dispersal mode on metacommunity structuring is essential to understanding the mechanisms of community assembly. Despite high seasonal variation in assemblage structure and phenological features of lotic macroinvertebrates, few studies examined the seasonal changes in the relative contribution of environmental and spatial processes. Here, we used two-season (spring and autumn) investigation data to link dispersal mode with local environmental and spatial factors that regulate macroinvertebrate metacommunity in a Chinese high-mountain stream network. Our aims were (1) to disentangle the relative role of environmental and spatial processes on structuring macroinvertebrate with different dispersal ability (aquatic passive: AqPa, terrestrial passive: TePa, and terrestrial active: TeAc) and (2) to determine seasonal shifts in metacommunity structuring processes. We found that assemblages of TeAc (with highest dispersal capacity) in both seasons were influenced more by environmental filtering than spatial structuring, whereas assemblages of TePa were mainly determined by spatial processes. Unexpectedly, AqPa group showed low spatial control in both seasons, probably due to their underestimated dispersal capacity via animal vector. The relative role of environmental and spatial factors was broadly stable across two seasons for AqPa and TeAc groups, but the TePa showed seasonal differences in the relative role of spatial factors, because of their seasonally changing dispersal capacity. In summary, our study emphasizes the use of dispersal mode for understanding metacommunity structuring mechanisms.

AB Density-dependent recruitment is fundamental to understanding species diversity and community dynamics in plants. Although there is compelling evidence that seeds and seedlings die from conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, characterising adult recruitment remains a challenge for long-living trees. Previous studies have used the decrease in fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) across life stages to indicate CNDD; however, this has not been tested rigorously.
   We addressed these challenges by integrating dispersal kernels and FSGS. To establish links between density dependence and FSGS, we simulated seedlings based on the estimated dispersal kernels from parentage analyses, and further simulated adults under various seedling-to-adult recruitment scenarios, using an individual-based spatially explicit model. We tested this method in an isolated Cyclobalanopsis glauca population on China's Dajinshan Island.
   We detected significant FSGS in the seedlings and weaker, though also significant, FSGS in the adults. As expected, the observed FSGS of seedlings was well predicted by the simulated seedlings, with observations falling inside the 95% confidence envelopes over all distance classes. However, the simulations showed that CNDD enhanced the FSGS while positive density dependence dampened it during the seedling-to-adult transition. The adult FSGS of our population was therefore explained by positive rather than negative density-dependent adult recruitment.
   Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that the change of FSGS in conjunction with dispersal-based model tests can offer a valuable insight into density-dependent adult recruitment. The results indicate that the transitions from seedlings to adults in C. glauca are dominantly regulated not by Janzen-Connell effects, but by processes of positive density dependence. More broadly, the findings may provide a caution against extrapolations of widespread Janzen-Connell effects in seeds and seedlings to adult recruits, underscoring a critical gap between mechanisms at early stages and long-term population and community dynamics.

AB Natural and seminatural habitat remnants play a crucial ecological role in intensified agroecosystems. Assumptions on the conservation value of small and poorly connected fragments in a hostile matrix come from generalization obtained from a limited number of taxa, mostly plants, and vertebrates. To date, few studies have analyzed the effect of fragmentation on ant communities in Mediterranean agroecosystems, despite the importance of this group of animals on several key ecosystem functions and services. Here, we analyze the effects of fragment area and connectivity on ant communities in gypsum outcrops in a large cereal agroecosystem of Central Spain. Ant communities were described by their species composition, abundance (total number of occurrences), and number of species, standardized both by area (species density), and abundance (species richness). Observed number of species was relatively high in comparison with other studies in the Mediterranean, and we found no effects of fragment characteristics on species density, species richness and species composition, which implies that even small and isolated patches do have a value for ant conservation. Moreover, total number of occurrences were higher for smaller and more isolated fragments. This finding contrasts with the results reported for other taxa in similar gypsum habitats and suggests that certain ant traits and strategies make them particularly resistant to fragmentation and capable to take advantage of small habitat patches. Given the important ecological role played by ants, we recommend the preservation of these small habitat fragments in the management plans of agroecosystems in these drylands, especially in those cases in which intensification of agricultural practices greatly diminish natural habitat availability.

AB Ecosystem services (ESs) are a diverse range of environmental properties that have significant effects on both landscape characteristics and human well-being, an understanding of the spatial variation of which is required for effective ecosystem management and conservation. In this study, we aimed to identify the geographical variation in ESs and examine the factors impacting ESs in Punjab Province, Pakistan. We evaluated ecosystem service intensity (ESI) by using the benefit transfer method and investigated the spatial heterogeneity of ESIs at the tehsil level by using an exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) model and semivariance analysis. This analysis indicated that spatial distribution of ESI shows significant and optimal spatial heterogeneity of ESs, revealing several hot and cold spots for ESI transformation in the study area. The ESI decreased from east to west and north to south, with a trough in the metropolitan zones, including Lahore, Sheikhupura, Faisalabad, and Multan, which was in accordance with the land use/cover pattern. Furthermore, using geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis, we also identified geographical clusters within which land use/cover pressure and population growth were significantly positively associated with ESI across the province, based on a lag distance scale. The findings of this study have functional economic implications with respect to highlighting areas worthy of conservation and designing ecological corridors to enhance the delivery of ESs for regional benefits.

AB Exploring vegetation distribution spatial patterns facilitates understanding how biodiversity addresses the potential threat of future climate variability, especially for highly diverse and threatened tropical plant communities, but few empirical studies have been performed. Dacrydium pectinatum is a constructive and endangered species in the tropical mountain forests of Hainan Island, China. In this study, sixty-eight 30 m x 30 m permanent plots of D. pectinatum were investigated, and species-based and phylogenetic-based methods were used to analyze the alpha- and beta-diversity pattern variation and its key drivers. Our study showed that species and phylogenetic alpha-diversity patterns are different on a local scale. However, on a regional scale, the variations in the two alpha-diversity patterns tend to converge, and they decrease with increasing elevation. The phylogenetic structure changes from overdispersion to convergence with increasing elevation. Soil (SOM, TP, AP), topography (EL, SL), and stand (CD) factors and alpha-diversity showed close correlations. Species and phylogenetic beta-diversity have significant positive correlations with changing environmental distance and geographical distance; however, as a representative form of habitat heterogeneity, elevation distance has a greater impact on beta-diversity changes than geographical distance. In conclusion, the alpha- and beta-diversity patterns of the D. pectinatum community are mainly related to habitat filtering, especially in high-elevation areas, and the colonization history of various regions also affects the formation of diversity patterns. Species-based and phylogenetic-based methods robustly demonstrated the key role of the habitat filtering hypothesis in community assembly. We believe that more plant diversity patterns need to be explored to understand the biodiversity formation mechanisms in tropical forests. We also recommend strengthening the construction and management of nature reserves to help address the biodiversity loss crisis in endangered tropical plant communities.

AB Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) are widely distributed throughout the Americas, being dependent on forested areas to survive. Although ocelot ecology is broadly studied throughout the species range distribution, studies concerning factors that may affect ocelot occupancy in the Atlantic Forest are still scarce. We used camera traps to evaluate factors influencing the probabilities of detection and occupancy of ocelots in a protected area of the Atlantic Forest, the Rio Doce State Park (RDSP), southeastern Brazil. To assess ocelot occupancy and detection probabilities, we measured the distances between sampling stations and rivers, lakes, cities, pasture, and Eucalyptus plantations. In addition, we recorded the mean rainfall levels for each sampling occasion, and native grassland areas within a 500 m-buffer around each sampling station. We found a strong and positive association between ocelot detection and the dry season, which might be due to a higher number of individuals moving through the Park during this season. Moreover, we found a strong and positive association of ocelot detection with native grassland areas around lakes, which may be related to the ocelot behavior of searching for prey in these areas. Conversely, the ocelot occupancy probability was intermediate (psi<<<^>>> = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.69) and was not strongly associated with the evaluated covariates, which may be explained by the high-quality of forest habitats and water resources that are homogeneously distributed within the Park. Our study indicates that the RDSP still provides a structurally suitable forest habitat for ocelots, but because of the current worrying scenario of over fragmentation, reduction of forest cover, and weakness of the protective legislation of this biome, the long-term persistence of the species in RDSP is uncertain.

AB Aims Mexico harbours a diverse fauna comprising more than 1,400 leafhopper species, 60% of which appear to be strictly endemic, with many apparently restricted to particular habitats and host plants. The aims of this study were to identify areas of high species richness and endemism, and determine the biogeographic affinities of species in the diverse arboreal tribe Athysanini to provide data useful for conservation prioritization.
   Location Mexico.
   Methods A data set of 643 historical occurrence records based on authoritatively identified specimens from museums, recent fieldwork, literature and digital repositories was analysed. Analyses of species richness and areas of endemism were conducted using geographic information systems.
   Results A total of 164 species belonging of 50 genera were included, of which 145 species of 31 genera are considered to be endemic. The Mexican state of Guerrero yielded the most species records (48%). The highest numbers of taxa and endemic species were concentrated along the Mexican Transition Zone (MTZ) within which the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TVB) province had the most species records. Endemicity analyses showed two different geographical patterns but similar species richness weights with overlapping values over the MTZ. Distribution across vegetation types was not uniform, with most athysanine species concentrated in the dry tropical forest (65%). Species were documented at elevations between sea level and 3,200 m a.s.l. with three altitudinal preference classes. Conservation assessments applying IUCN criteria categorized a majority of species (145) as endangered or critically endangered.
   Main conclusions Our findings suggest that most identified areas of high species richness throughout the territory have predominantly endemic taxa. Distributional patterns found are non-random, influenced by richness and endemism values over the TVB province and in the MTZ with a variable dispersion among species. Data highlight a greatly threatened status by habitat loss, remarking an urgent need for an improved conservation framework.

AB Plant-soil feedback is increasingly recognized as a vital framework to analyze multi-trophic interactions involving herbivores, plants and microbes, but research is still lacking on understanding such feedback in the context of global change. In grasslands, patterns of herbivory are expected to be affected by global change, further modifying existing plant-soil feedbacks. We tested this by evaluating the individual and combined impacts of aboveground herbivory by a generalist leaf-chewer and nitrogen (N) eutrophication, simulating elevated N deposition, on soil microbial communities and root colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and related these to existing data on plant functional types and community composition. We found that colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the plant roots responded differently to treatments depending on host plant species in patterns consistent with the changes in the plant community composition and biomass. Further, the effect of aboveground herbivory on plant-soil interactions was comparable and even exceeded that of N-eutrophication, with the additive effects of herbivory and N-eutrophication on the soil microbiome being stronger than each factor separately. Our results suggest that plant-soil feedback in response to N-eutrophication is contingent on biotic variables such as herbivory and plant species, and that biotic and abiotic disturbances may have additive effects on the soil microbiome structure.

AB We investigated long-term changes, from 1979 to 2015, in the abundance of Protea roupelliae subsp. roupelliae trees growing in a montane grassland of the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg mountains. The study involved counting the numbers of adults and juveniles (saplings and seedlings) in six groves on three occasions over 36 years, documenting the fire-return intervals and the seasons when fires occurred in each grove, and measuring the fuel loads of the grass swards in five of the groves. Only in one grove did adults persist in their original numbers, but not the juveniles. Adults and juveniles declined in three groves, and in two groves both adults and juveniles died. Neither mean fire-return interval nor its variation, or seasonal distributions of fire could account for the transition from tree persistence to extirpation among the six groves after 36 years. Instead, the only plausible explanation for the persistence of Protea trees in one grove was that its grass sward produced a significantly lower mean, but higher variation in fuel load (biomass), compared with groves where Protea tree abundances either declined or were extirpated. As such, the recruitment bottleneck imposed on seedling establishment by the grass sward is an obvious avenue for future research.

AB Habitat fragmentation hinders the dispersal of species and reduces the range of suitable habitat, thereby threatening the conservation of biodiversity. Even in protected areas, an assessment of the landscape connectivity of suitable habitat for species is still essential. In this paper, we investigated the overall forest connectivity, and determined patch characteristics and their role in species dispersion for species with different dispersal abilities in the World Natural Heritage Site of Bogda, Xinjiang, China. In our study site, the overall landscape connectivity was low for species with short- and medium-distance ( 500 m) dispersal, but high for species with long-distance ( 500 m) dispersal abilities. We ranked the importance of patches according to their role in maintaining overall connectivity. Two patches were identified as being the most important: one mainly provided habitat area and fluxes (i.e., the flow of species into and out of the area) for species, while the other acted as a ?stepping-stone? for dispersal and provided fluxes. All species could use smaller patches (<50 ha) as steppingstones, and some of these patches could provide special environmental conditions for endemic species with short- and medium-distance dispersal abilities. Our study offers a way to prioritize the conservation of patches in a forest network for biodiversity and ecosystem health.

AB Soil microbial communities maintain multiple ecosystem functions in terrestrial ecosystems. The response of soil microbial communities to vegetation restoration in desertification environments is still poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the dynamic changes of the soil microbial community during the growth of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolic (P. sylvestris) plantations. We collected soil samples from five P. sylvestris plantations with different stand age. High-throughput sequencing was performed to determine the microbial community structure. The dynamic relationship between soil microbial community and edaphic factors was analyzed using the co-occurrence network, mantel test and partial least squares path modeling. The results showed that the soil microbial alpha diversity and community structure were significantly various among the plantations (P < 0.001). The number of nodes and edges in microbial co-occurrence network gradually decreased and the interrelationships between species became weak with stand age. The Available phosphorus was the most significant factor affecting the structure of bacterial community (R2 = 0.952), while the total phosphorus was the most significant factor affecting the structure of fungal community (R2 = 0.745). However, soil moisture had no significant effect on the microbial community. pH (0.73) and available nitrogen (0.91) had the largest positive total effects on bacterial and fungal community, respectively. Stand age (-0.65) was an indirect factor with the largest negative total effects on the bacterial community. Therefore, we concluded that the soil microbial community was not limited by soil moisture during the natural restoration process of P. sylvestris plantations in the desertification environment and the phosphorus utilization efficiency played a leading role in shaping the soil microbial community.

AB Full-scale intensive silvicultural activities, such as afforestation and rehabilitation, can deteriorate the fragile structural features and functions of karst ecosystems. Within these ecosystems, degraded and fragmented habitats can only be connected to each other through a landscape network that poses a positive umbrella effect over these areas. The aim of this research was to determine suitable eco-regions and landscape corridors for reforestation and restoration based on several biotic and abiotic habitat factors using Analytic Hierarchic Processes (AHP) and Geographic Information System (GIS). This approach was targeted at plant species naturally associated with the degraded Mediterranean karst ecosystem, such as Pinus brutia Ten, Juniperus drupacea, Styrax officinalis L., Pistacia terebinthus L., Laurus nobilis L., and Cerasus mahaleb L. in the study area, which is located in the Andirin Sarimsak Mountains in Kahramanmaras, Turkey. In this study, potential landscape corridors and their habitat qualities have been identified for the target species, where ratings from 'poor' to 'best' were assigned depending on the condition of degradation. Of the 33 identified corridors, 8 were characterized as 'poor', 10 as 'average', 10 as 'good', and 5 as 'best' Specifically, the 'best' corridors are recommended for afforestation, while rehabilitation is suggested for 'poor' corridors to increase the effectiveness of landscape networks in the degraded karst ecosystem.

AB Loss of tropical forests leads both to the loss of aboveground biodiversity and to the changes in belowground biological activity. Planted secondary forests return canopy cover, but the reversibility of belowground changes may depend on soil properties, forest age and tree species composition. We studied microbial communities in an array of soils in southern Vietnam under different vegetation: natural tropical forests, grasslands on deforested area and 20 and 30 years-old forest plantations. Conversion of natural forests into grasslands led to the loss of half of soil organic matter and microbial abundance, soil moisture decreased, bacterial community structure changed and beta-diversity increased. Bacterial alpha-diversity and pH were not affected by deforestation. Reforestation for 30 years restored bacterial and archaeal abundance, partially restored bacterial community structure, but did not restore fungal abundance and organic matter content. Thus, forest planting in southern Vietnam restores soil microbiome properties partially, but the complete restoration apparently requires much more than 30 years of secondary forest succession.

AB Background: Plant-pollinator mutualistic networks show non-random structural properties that promote species coexistence. However, these networks show high variability in the interacting species and their connections. Mismatch between plant and pollinator attributes can prevent interactions, while trait matching can enable exclusive access, promoting pollinators' niche partitioning and, ultimately, modularity. Thus, plants belonging to specialized modules should integrate their floral traits to optimize the pollination function. Herein, we aimed to analyze the biological processes involved in the structuring of plant-hummingbird networks by linking network morphological constraints, specialization, modularity and phenotypic floral integration.
   Methods: We investigated the understory plant-hummingbird network of two adjacent habitats in the Lacandona rainforest of Mexico, one characterized by lowland rainforest and the other by savanna-like vegetation. We performed monthly censuses to record plant-hummingbird interactions for 2 years (2018-2020). We also took hummingbird bill measurements and floral and nectar measurements. We summarized the interactions in a bipartite matrix and estimated three network descriptors: connectance, complementary specialization (H-2'), and nestedness. We also analyzed the modularity and average phenotypic floral integration index of each module.
   Results: Both habitats showed strong differences in the plant assemblage and network dynamics but were interconnected by the same four hummingbird species, two Hermits and two Emeralds, forming a single network of interaction. The whole network showed low levels of connectance (0.35) and high specialization (H-2' = 0.87). Flower morphologies ranged from generalized to specialized, but trait matching was an important network structurer. Modularity was associated with morphological specialization. The Hermits Phaethornis longirostris and P. striigularis each formed a module by themselves, and a third module was formed by the less-specialized Emeralds: Chlorestes candida and Amazilia tzacatl. The floral integration values were higher in specialized modules but not significantly higher than that formed by generalist species.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that biological processes derived from both trait matching and "forbidden" links, or nonmatched morphological attributes, might be important network drivers in tropical plant-hummingbird systems while morphological specialization plays a minor role in the phenotypic floral integration. The broad variety of corolla and bill shapes promoted niche partitioning, resulting in the modular organization of the assemblage according to morphological specialization. However, more research adding larger datasets of both the number of modules and pollination networks for a wider region is needed to conclude whether phenotypic floral integration increases with morphological specialization in plant-hummingbird systems.

TI Community-wide consequences of nonconsumptive predator effects on a
   foundation species
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY

DE community structure; foundation species; nonconsumptive effect;
   predation risk; predator cue; trait&#8208; mediated indirect effects
AB Predators can exert nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) on prey, which often take place through prey behavioural adjustments to minimise predation risk. As NCEs are widespread in nature, interest is growing to determine whether NCEs on a prey species can indirectly influence several other species simultaneously, thus leading to changes in community structure.
   In this study, we investigate whether a predator can exert NCEs on a foundation species and indirectly affect community structure.
   Through laboratory experiments, we first tested whether the predatory marine snail Acanthina monodon exerts negative NCEs on larviphagy (consumption of pelagic larvae) and phytoplankton filtration rates of the mussel Perumytilus purpuratus, an intertidal foundation species. These hypotheses stem from the notion that mussels may decrease feeding activities in the presence of predator cues to limit detection by predators. Afterwards, a field experiment tested whether the presence of A. monodon near mussel beds leads to higher colonisation rates of invertebrates that reproduce through pelagic larvae (expected under a lower larviphagy in P. purpuratus) and to a lower algal biomass on P. purpuratus shells (expected under a lower metabolite excretion in the mussels), thereby changing the community structure of the species typically found in P. purpuratus beds.
   The laboratory experiments revealed that waterborne cues from A. monodon limit the larviphagy and filtration rates of P. purpuratus. In turn, the field experiment showed that A. monodon cues led to greater abundances of barnacles and bivalves and a lower algal biomass in P. purpuratus beds, thus altering community structure.
   Overall, this study shows that a predator can indirectly affect community structure through NCEs on an invertebrate foundation species. As invertebrate foundation species are ubiquitous worldwide, understanding predator NCEs on these organisms could help to better understand community regulation in systems structured by such species.

AB Some types of plant accumulate liquid in their inflorescences creating phytotelmata. These environments protect the flowers against florivory, although they may be colonized by aquatic or semi-aquatic florivorous insect larvae, whose effects on the fitness of the plants remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis of floral antagonism by the occupants of phytotelmata, which predicts that florivory by the occupants of the phytotelmata represents a cost to the female fitness of the plant, reducing its fecundity. We manipulated experimentally the infestation by 3 florivores larvae species occupants of phytotelmata in inflorescences of Heliconia spathocircinata (Heliconiaceae) to test for negative direct trophic effects on the fecundity of the flowering and fruiting bracts. We found that the foraging of the hoverfly (Syrphidae) and moth (Lepidoptera) larvae in the inflorescences contributed to a decline in the fecundity of the plant. While the lepidopteran impacted fecundity when foraging in both flowering and fruiting bracts, the syrphid only affected the fruiting bracts, which indicates that the nectar and floral tissue are the principal resource exploited by the hoverfly. By contrast, soldier fly (Stratiomyidae) had a neutral effect on fecundity, while foraging in flowering or fruiting bracts. These findings corroborate our hypothesis, that herbivory by the larval occupants represents cost to the host plant having phytotelmata. The negative influence of this foraging on plant fecundity will nevertheless depend on the consequences of the exploitation of resources, which vary considerably in ephemeral habitats such as the phytotalmanta of flower parts.

AB The past 40 years in Southeast Asia have seen about 50% of lowland rainforests converted to oil palm and other plantations, and much of the remaining forest heavily logged. Little is known about how fragmentation influences recovery and whether climate change will hamper restoration. Here, we use repeat airborne LiDAR surveys spanning the hot and dry 2015-16 El Nino Southern Oscillation event to measure canopy height growth across 3,300ha of regenerating tropical forests spanning a logging intensity gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We show that the drought led to increased leaf shedding and branch fall. Short forest, regenerating after heavy logging, continued to grow despite higher evaporative demand, except when it was located close to oil palm plantations. Edge effects from the plantations extended over 300 metres into the forests. Forest growth on hilltops and slopes was particularly impacted by the combination of fragmentation and drought, but even riparian forests located within 40m of oil palm plantations lost canopy height during the drought. Our results suggest that small patches of logged forest within plantation landscapes will be slow to recover, particularly as ENSO events are becoming more frequent. It is unclear whether tropical forest fragments within plantation landscapes are resilient to drought. Here the authors analyse LiDAR and ground-based data from the 2015-16 El Nino event across a logging intensity gradient in Borneo. Although regenerating forests continued to grow, canopy height near oil palm plantations decreased, and a strong edge effect extended up to at least 300m away.

AB Cities are prone to ecological problems, yet the impacts of rapid global urbanization on the feedback between above- and belowground subsystems remain largely unknown. We sampled the roots of 8 common herbaceous plants within the Fifth Ring (urban areas) and in Jiufeng National Forest Park (rural areas) in Beijing (China) to assess the impacts of urbanization on the network of plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal associations. Using Illumina MiSeq sequencing, 81 AM fungal OTUs were identified in 78 herb root samples. The Shannon, Simpson, and Pielou indices of root AM fungi in urban areas were significantly higher than those in rural areas. In this study, a significantly nested mycorrhizal association network was observed in rural areas (NODF = 64.68), whereas a non-nested pattern was observed in urban areas (NODF = 55.50). The competition index C-score (0.0769) of AM fungi in urban areas was slightly lower than that in rural areas (0.1431), and the species specialization (d') of 8 host plants and fungal dissimilarity among 8 host plants in urban areas were significantly lower than those in rural areas. Convergent associations among hosts may be an important factor influencing this non-nested pattern of the plant-AM fungi network in urban areas. Generalists, rather than specialists, were enhanced during the establishment of mycorrhizal associations in urban areas. Our results suggest that reduced selectivity of host plants, and generalist promotion and specialist reduction of AM fungi during urbanization may contribute to the non-nested network of plant-AM fungal associations.

AB Ecologically relevant traits of organisms in an assemblage determine an ecosystem's functional fingerprint (i.e., the shape, size, and position of multidimensional trait space). Quantifying changes in functional fingerprints can therefore provide information about the effects of diversity loss or gain through time on ecosystem condition and is a promising approach to monitoring ecological integrity. This, however, is seldom possible owing to limitations in historical surveys and a lack of data on organismal traits, particularly in diverse tropical regions. Using data from detailed bird surveys from 4 periods across more than a century, and morphological and ecological traits of 233 species, we quantified changes in the avian functional fingerprint of a tropical montane forest in the Andes of Colombia. We found that 78% of the variation in functional space, regardless of period, was described by 3 major axes summarizing body size, dispersal ability (indexed by wing shape), and habitat breadth. Changes in species composition significantly altered the functional fingerprint of the assemblage and functional richness and dispersion decreased 35-60%. Owing to species extirpations and to novel additions to the assemblage, functional space decreased over time, but at least 11% of its volume in the 2010s extended to areas of functional space that were unoccupied in the 1910s. The assemblage now includes fewer large-sized species, more species with greater dispersal ability, and fewer habitat specialists. Extirpated species had high functional uniqueness and distinctiveness, resulting in large reductions in functional richness and dispersion after their loss, which implies important consequences for ecosystem integrity. Conservation efforts aimed at maintaining ecosystem function must move beyond seeking to sustain species numbers to designing complementary strategies for the maintenance of ecological function by identifying and conserving species with traits conferring high vulnerability such as large body size, poor dispersal ability, and greater habitat specialization.
   Article impact statement: Changes in functional fingerprints provide a means to quantify the integrity of ecological assemblages affected by diversity loss or gain.

AB Habitat conversion is one of the major threats for biodiversity conservation and viability of natural populations. Thus, habitat disturbance alters distinct ecological processes, such as plant reproductive success and diaspore fate. In this study, we determined the effects of seasonally tropical dry forests (STDFs) conversion by anthropogenic disturbance by assessing diaspore fate of Enterolobium contortisiliquum. We compared 20 adult trees present in a STDFs preserved area and 20 adult trees present in a human-converted area. In general, diaspore fates from both areas were similar, i.e., there was no difference in the reproductive success of trees in STDFs and human-converted area. Habitat disturbance did not affect the length or width of fruits; only fruit thickness was larger in trees of STDFs habitat. None of the biometric seed measures differed between different habitat conditions. Likewise, the number of undamaged seeds, aborted seeds, pre-dispersal predated seeds, and seed production were independent of habitat conditions. Besides, we did not observe any effect of habitat disturbance on germination percentage. However, seeds from preserved STDFs germinated faster than seeds from the human-converted area. Even though the effects of human-modified habitats on the diaspore fate have already been studied, tree species exhibit different responses to habitat conversion regarding seed predation, seed dispersal, seed germination, and seedling establishment. Overall, our results show that habitat disturbance does not affect the diaspore fate of E. contortisiliquum. This study also highlights the importance of remnants trees in converted landscapes as the population's connectors which maintain plant-animal mutualistic and antagonistic interactions that mitigate the effects of habitat disturbance.

AB PREMISE With over 1500 species, the globally distributed Vernonieae is one of the most successful members of the largest family of flowering plants, the Compositae. However, due to its morphological complexity and limited geographic representation in previous studies, subtribal and biogeographic relationships are unclear. Here, new DNA sequence data spanning the geographic range of the tribe provides a taxonomically robust time-calibrated phylogeny, estimates migration pathways and timing of important biogeographic events, and allows inference of environmental factors that have contributed to the success of the Vernonieae worldwide.
   METHODS Phylogenetic relationships were estimated for 368 taxa representing all Vernonieae subtribes. Molecular clock and ancestral range estimation analyses provide a framework for inference of the biogeographic history of the tribe.
   RESULTS Relationships among the subtribes were established and correct placement determined for problematic taxa, along with the first model-based assessment of the biogeographic history of the tribe. The Vernonieae were estimated to have evolved similar to 50 mya. Africa was the first center of diversity, from which a single dispersal event established the monophyletic New World lineage. Long-distance dispersal from Africa and Brazil established the tribe on five continents and Oceania.
   CONCLUSIONS The New World lineage is monophyletic, but Old World taxa are not. New subtribal taxonomies are needed. Moquinieae are nested in Vernonieae. Long-distance dispersal from Africa beginning 45 mya was key to establishing the tribe's near-global distribution. Migration corridors created by volcanic mountain chains and iron-rich soils in Africa and the Americas promoted radiation and range expansion.

AB Urbanization directly and indirectly impacts biodiversity to the extent that it is considered one of the main causes of biotic homogenization and extinction. However, urban green areas can act as reservoir of biodiversity, and knowledge regarding species distribution in such contexts is crucial to define appropriate conservation and management strategies. Since inventories of species are generally time-consuming and costly, a commonly used approach consists in the use of surrogate species. However, studies investigating the effectiveness of surrogate species in urban environments still seem to be under-represented. In this research, we investigated the biodiversity of ants, plants, and carabid beetles in six different green areas within the urban area of the city of Trieste. The role of vascular plants as a potential surrogate for the diversity of ants and carabid beetles has been tested, investigating the influence of the environmental variables (dead wood, litter, anthropic disturbance, bare soil, bedrocks and rocks) on these relationships. Patterns of species richness and complementarity were compared among the sampled sites and their correlations were tested with Mantel tests and Co-Correspondence Analysis (Co-CA). Results pointed out that even disturbed and isolated sites within the urbanised matrix can sustain a high diversity of species of ants, carabids and plants, while in the semi-natural sites intermediate diversity levels were found. Plants were found to correlate directly with the diversity of ants; on the contrary, carabid species composition resulted only indirectly influenced by vascular plants, confirming the key role of abiotic variables in determining carabid diversity. Co-CA showed a clear distinction between forested and semi-natural environments and more open and disturbed environments. Furthermore, the Co-CA highlighted that the considered environmental variables (particularly dead wood, anthropic disturbance, rocks and litter) can significantly influence the distribution of analyzed taxa. Our results highlight the important role of urban green areas within the urban matrix as source of biodiversity and, furthermore, once more, support the role of vascular plants as meaningful surrogate for the diversity of ants and carabids.

AB Fire is one of the most powerful modifiers of the Amazonian landscape and knowledge about its drivers is needed for planning control and suppression. A plethora of factors may play a role in the annual dynamics of fire frequency, spanning the biophysical, climatic, socioeconomic and institutional dimensions. To uncover the main forces currently at play, we investigated the area burned in both forested and deforested areas in the outstanding case of Brazil?s state of Acre, in southwestern Amazonia. We mapped burn scars in already-deforested areas and intact forest based on satellite images from the Landsat series analyzed between 2016 and 2019. The mapped burnings in already-deforested areas totalled 550,251 ha. In addition, we mapped three forest fires totaling 34,084 ha. Fire and deforestation were highly correlated, and the latter occurred mainly in federal government lands, with protected areas showing unprecedented forest fire levels in 2019. These results indicate that Acre state is under increased fire risk even during average rainfall years. The record fires of 2019 may continue if Brazil?s ongoing softening of environmental regulations and enforcement is maintained. Acre and other Amazonian states must act quickly to avoid an upsurge of social and economic losses in the coming years.

AB Deforestation is considered the main human-induced and short-term threat to the persistence of forest species in the Amazon. Long-lasting and high-intensity deforestation, low coverage of protected areas, and high level of species endemism make the Bele ' m Endemism Area (BEA) particularly more vulnerable than the rest of the Amazon area. However, this occurrence remains strongly neglected in global and regional conservation analyses. In this study, we used species distribution modeling and remote sensing data to map the richness pattern of endangered birds from the Amazon and assessed the species' conservation status based on landscape patterns of forest remnants. Our results revealed that the BEA's imperiled avifauna presents the most significant state of vulnerability to extinction compared with other areas of endemism in the Amazon. Almost 80 % of the total area of the BEA presents a strong anthropization of natural ecosystems. Of the 20 % of the area with high conservation value remnants, only 25 % is within protected areas, whereas the other 75 % is under private property domains. Moreover, forest remnants on private properties have a higher biodiversity conservation value as they are home to more threatened bird species than remnants within protected areas. Therefore, we argue that effective implementation of conservation of threatened bird species in the BEA depends directly on the maintenance of forest remnants on private properties from practical conservation actions.

   limitation on coexistence under a tolerance-fecundity trade-off

AB Life-history trade-offs are important coexistence mechanisms in plant communities. In particular, a trade-off between seed quality and seed output may explain coexistence among species with a wide variety of seed sizes in heterogeneous landscapes with varying degrees of local stresses such as shade, drought and browsing.
   Under spatially implicit formulations of the tolerance-fecundity trade-off, species diversity is only bounded by community size and environmental heterogeneity. However, these formulations leave unanswered the question of how dispersal limitation, an important aspect of real communities, impacts the ability of the tolerance-fecundity trade-off to support coexistence.
   Here we show using stochastic cellular automata that coexistence under the tolerance-fecundity trade-off in a spatially structured landscape is strongly modulated by the interactions between the spatial scales of species dispersal and environmental variability. Specifically, coexistence in a patchy landscape is higher under short dispersal scales relative to the scale of environmental variation. These conditions allow species to segregate spatially and thus avoid interspecific competition.
   In addition to dispersal limitation, coexistence under the tolerance-fecundity trade-off is promoted by a sharp drop in tolerance as local environmental stress increases, a high overall seed output across species, local homogeneity in environmental conditions and weak age structure in fertility. In particular, coexistence is much higher when species have full tolerance to stress levels below a threshold and zero tolerance above that threshold, with nothing in between. This steep gradient contributes to coexistence because it maximizes niche separation between similar species.
   Synthesis. When plants compete for space, dispersal limitation and landscape spatial structure can conspire to boost coexistence and diversity. Our results show that the tolerance-fecundity trade-off is a strong niche differentiation mechanism when species experience a well-defined distinction between suitable and unsuitable environments, and supports higher diversity when dispersal scales are shorter than the scales of variation in the environment. We conclude that the trade-off is more likely to be a relevant coexistence mechanism in the context of large-scale environmental variation, such as topography, than small-scale variation, such as in litter cover and canopy shading.

AB The extent to which prey traits combine to influence the abundance of predators is still poorly understood, particularly for mixed predators in sympatry and in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we characterise prey use and distribution in iconic bird (grey wagtails and Eurasian dippers) and fish species (brown trout and Atlantic salmon) to assess whether prey traits could predict populations of these four riverine predators. Specifically, we hypothesised that: 1) prey key traits would predict predator populations more effectively than 2) diversity of prey traits, 3) the taxonomic abundance or richness of prey (known as traditional or mass-effect types of biodiversity) or 4) the prevailing environmental conditions. Combined predator population sizes were predicted better by a few key traits - specifically those revealing prey habitat use, size and drifting behaviour - than by prey diversity or prey trait diversity or environmental conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the complex relationships between prey assemblages and multiple predator species can be represented mechanistically when the key prey traits that govern encounter and consumption rates are identified. Given their apparent potential to reveal trophic relationships, and to complement more traditional measures of prey abundance, we advocate further development of trait-based approaches in predator-prey research.

AB The Puebla city ravines have a relic of oak forest (Quercus: Fagaceae) that is subject to strong human pressures. Despite the importance that this relict represents for a city lacking in wooded areas, there is no information on its richness, diversity, and geographical affinity. Hence the objective of this work, to carry out an inventory of the vascular flora components, determining the current geographic distribution patterns of the families, genera, and species, and specify the richness, diversity, and floristic similarity of El Conde and Malinalli ravines. This was done through field trips and botanical specimen collection, using the Margalef, Pielou and Simpson indices to estimate alpha diversity patterns and the Sorensen Similarity Index to determine beta diversity. A list of 105 species was obtained, grouped into 81 genera and 40 families, and both ravines have a medium to high alpha and beta diversity. Because to the ecosystem services that wooded areas provide to urban areas, knowledge of the forest should be deepened, and the study extended to other ravines as a step towards recovery, remediation, management, and conservation.

AB This article examines the structure and performance of conservation agreements, which are relational contracts used across the world to protect natural resources. Key elements of these agreements are (1) they are ongoing arrangements between a local community and an outside party, typically a non-governmental organization (NGO); (2) they feature payments in exchange for conservation services; (3) the prospects for success depend on the NGO engaging in costly monitoring to detect whether the community is foregoing short-term gains to protect the resource; (4) lacking a strong external enforcement system, they rely on self-enforcement; and (5) the parties have the opportunity to renegotiate at any time. A repeated-game model is developed and utilized to organize an evaluation of real conservation agreements, using three case studies as representative examples.

AB Ants (Formicidae, Hymenoptera) play an important role in seed bank, seedling establishment and plant composition of arid ecosystems. Thus, knowing plant-ant interaction provides useful information for managers to design restoration and conservation plans. In this study, the roles of desert harvester ants (Messor intermedius and Messor melancholicus) and scavenger ants (Cataglyphis nodus and Lepisiota semenovi) on plant communities were investigated in arid ecosystems of southeastern Iran. Two vegetation types were distinguished in the study area and the nest density of ant species was determined. Furthermore, plant composition and soil seed bank were estimated at different distances from the ant nests. Results showed that the density of M. intermedius and M. melancholicus nests was higher in dwarf shrub-shrub vegetation type and the density of C. nodus and L. semenovi nests was higher in dwarf shrub vegetation type. The harvester and scavenger ants had enhanced the seed bank to 55% and 70%, respectively. Therefore, the role of scavenger ants on the plant communities' seed bank was greater than that of harvester ants. Although the scavenger ants were more influential on the annuals and the invasive plant species, the radius impact of the harvester ants on the perennials was greater, i.e., a positive interaction existed between the perennial plants and the harvester ants. C. nodus and L. semenovi played an important role in enhancing the ecosystem's potential for restoration through establishment of pioneer species in early stage of succession. The activity of M. intermedius is crucial for the development and maintenance of climax plant communities in arid ecosystems through assisting the plant species' establishment in late stage of succession. It is essential to preserve the diversity of these key ant species for the maintenance and sustainability of shrubs in arid ecosystems.

AB Currently, landscape connectivity studies are key in spatial planning for ecosystems conservation. Nevertheless, there are only a few studies that give empiric data about the positive effects of connectivity on terrestrial conservation ecosystems. In this piece of the research, we present a review of the literature of connectivity on four recently identified research topics carried out from 2000 to 2018 in Latin America. We identify the current stage, recent advance and challenges about connectivity knowledge. The scientific review used several databases on the web, from wich we selected 217 articles. The selected publications were included in a database considering: a) publication year, b) research type, c) country studied, d) ecosystem studied and f) and research aims. Our results depicted that connectivity studies focus on the topics: a) in restoration planning, b) land cover/land use change modeling and planning and c) ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the publications about connectivity and climate change have been limited. We also identified some publications tackling two or three topics simultaneously: a) land cover/land use change modeling and planning with restoration planning, b) ecosystem services with climate change, and c) restoration planning with climate change. However, there is a necessity to increase the connectivity research on Latin America.

AB Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) provide incentives to landowners to manage resources in ways that deliver ecosystem services, such as through restoration activities. Under a proliferation of initiatives to restore degraded lands, innovative institutional arrangements that promote ecological restoration are emerging. However, exclusion of the human factor is considered a limitation of restoration theory and practice, and recognition of men's and women's roles in restoring landscapes is largely neglected. As the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration commences, this study uses PES as an entry point to explore gender equity in restoration projects. Focused on the Mara North Conservancy in Kenya, the study presents a framework for which qualitative approaches including Process Net-map and intra-household interviews are applied to uncover drivers and constraints associated with processes of gender exclusion and inclusion. The results reveal that 1) power imbalances condition socio-economic outcomes of PES schemes by reinforcing historical inequities in land tenure, and that 2) governance structures exclude women from decision-making processes and from receiving direct PES benefits despite their labor contributions to restoration activities; while men incur financial costs that are not adequately accounted for under direct payments. The study demonstrates the potential to apply new methodologies and define indicators that enable the identification of complex social dimensions in ecological restoration. Critical reflection on whether the neglect of social aspects restrict the potential for ecological restoration to address the very same inequities that contribute to degradation of threatened landscapes is encouraged.

AB This study investigates the potential effects of historical deforestation in South America using a regional climate model driven with reanalysis data. Two different sources of data were used to quantify deforestation during the 1980s to 2010s, leading to two scenarios of forest loss: smaller but spatially continuous in scenario 1 and larger but spatially scattered in scenario 2. The model simulates a generally warmer and drier local climate following deforestation. Vegetation canopy becomes warmer due to reduced canopy evapotranspiration, and ground becomes warmer due to more radiation reaching the ground. The warming signal for surface air is weaker than for ground and vegetation, likely due to reduced surface roughness suppressing the sensible heat flux. For surface air over deforested areas, the warming signal is stronger for the nighttime minimum temperature and weaker or even becomes a cooling signal for the daytime maximum temperature, due to the strong radiative effects of albedo at midday, which reduces the diurnal amplitude of temperature. The drying signals over deforested areas include lower atmospheric humidity, less precipitation, and drier soil. The model identifies the La Plata basin as a region remotely influenced by deforestation, where a simulated increase of precipitation leads to wetter soil, higher ET, and a strong surface cooling. Over both deforested and remote areas, the deforestation-induced surface climate changes are much stronger in scenario 2 than scenario 1; coarse-resolution data and models (such as in scenario 1) cannot represent the detailed spatial structure of deforestation and underestimate its impact on local and regional climates.

AB Polylepis forests are endemic to the high-Andes, with trees characterized by multi-layered, exfoliating bark-providing protection against harsh, high-elevation conditions, both for individual trees and the wide array of organisms dependent on them. However, Polylepis habitat has suffered severe human-induced land conversion and currently mainly occurs as fragmented remnants only. Here, we studied the effects of fragment size on local ambient temperature and on biomass of bark and its bark-dwelling arthropods. We did so by comparing multiple samples at the edge and interior of both large and small fragments, while also accounting for branch size, tree width, and tree structure. Because arthropod biomass is likely to impact higher trophic levels, we also studied abundance and foraging behavior of two bird species specialized on Polylepis forest. We show that arthropod biomass was relatively higher in wider, larger trees, which were preferred for foraging by both bird species. Moreover, we show that small forest fragments are not only environmentally less buffered but are also characterized by lower amounts of bark and lower densities of bark-dwelling arthropods than larger fragments. Our study highlights the conservation value of large trees. Also, we advise it is now timely to test to what degree restoration efforts to increase fragment size could mitigate the negative effects of reduced arthropod biomass for higher trophic levels of endemic specialist insectivores.

AB Ant communities are an important component of ecosystem functioning, as ant activities often accelerate leaf-litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in forest soils. In Northeastern North America, global climate change is expected to accelerate forest succession, and the effects of this succession on forest ant communities remain relatively unexplored. This work aims to understand the effects of forest succession and productivity on the functional group diversity of New England ant communities by testing a prediction of species-energy theory. Our study took place at the Harvard Forest, MA, where we conducted localized ground surveys for ants and measured the productivity of 4 tree species dominant in New England. We found that both ant species richness and functional group richness were significantly higher in association with deciduous trees compared to coniferous tree types. Species richness and functional group richness were highly correlated. Contrary to the species-energy theory, we found no strong correlations between tree productivity and ant community composition or function. Our findings indicate that local, top-down forest processes may influence the composition and functioning of ant communities as New England forests become dominated by deciduous trees.

AB Identification of priority areas for conservation is crucial for the maintenance and protection of biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where biodiversity continues to be lost at alarming rates. Surveys and research on umbrella species can provide efficient and effective approaches to identify potential areas for conservation at small geographical scales. Army ants of the genus Eciton are keystone species in neotropical forests due to their major role as top predators and due to the numerous vertebrate- and invertebrate associated species that depend upon their colonies for survival. These associates range from the iconic army ant-following birds to a wide range of arthropod groups, some of which have evolved intricate morphological, behavioural and/or chemical strategies to conceal their presence and integrate into the colony life. Furthermore, Eciton colonies require large forested areas that support a diverse leaf litter prey community and several field-based and genetic studies have demonstrated the negative consequences of forest fragmentation for the long-term maintenance of these colonies. Therefore, Eciton species will not only act as umbrella for their associates but also for many other species in neotropical forests, in particular for those that require a large extent of forest. This review summarises past and recent accounts of the main taxonomic groups found associated with Eciton colonies, as well research assessing the impact of forest fragmentation on this army ant, to encourage the adoption of Eciton army ants as umbrella species for the identification of priority areas for conservation and assessments of the effect of disturbance in neotropical forests.

AB The Atlantic Forest biome is essential to the conservation of primates, the mammals with the highest number of endangered species. Habitat suitability modeling is extensively used in ecology and conservation, but the influence of the spatial extent used to train and test these models have not yet been assessed. Here we evaluated how the spatial extent definition influences the suitability surfaces and distributions obtained from habitat suitability modeling for the Atlantic Forest primate species. We built habitat suitability models for each species in three different extents. We used extents generally defined when models are built for more than one species (combining the spatial extent for all species or the complete biome) and the extent generally used for single species (encompassing all occurrence records for the species). Although the suitability spatial patterns did not vary among extents, the suitability frequency distributions were different. The extent can also influence the distribution area obtained from these models. Habitat suitability modeling can be beneficial in the environmental sciences and the efficient use of this tool requires the awareness of the effects of model construction decisions.

AB Following timber harvests in bottomland mixed- oak (Quercus L.) stands, desirable oak advance regeneration can be overgrown by shade-intolerant pioneer species. We investigated the effects of group selection opening size on composition of tree regeneration 19 years postharvest in an oak-dominated bottomland forest and compared results with earlier findings to evaluate development trends. In response to six opening sizes (7-40 m radii), we evaluated regeneration density and dominance of four tree species groups: conifers, hard mast, shade-intolerant hardwoods, and shade-tolerant hardwoods. Our objectives were to determine the optimum gap size for regenerating oaks and test the delayed oak dominance hypothesis, in which oaks slowly gain dominance as pioneer species undergo self-thinning. Opening size influenced conifer regeneration but minimally affected hardwoods. Hard mast species density was less than that of either intolerant or tolerant species regardless of opening size. Future stem density trends suggest increasing intolerant species and constant mast and tolerant species. Modeled future height trends suggest increasing mast species dominance over intolerant pioneers after 30 years. Our results suggest that gap-based silviculture can be used to regenerate bottomland hardwood stands with desirable species including oaks; larger gaps favor conifers but there was no optimum size to enhance oak regeneration.

AB The moist temperate forests in Northern Pakistan are home to a variety of flora and fauna that are pivotal in sustaining the livelihoods of the local communities. In these forests, distribution and richness of vegetation, especially that of medicinal plants, is rarely reported. In this study, we carried out a vegetation survey in District Balakot, located in Northeastern Pakistan, to characterize the diversity of medicinal plants under different canopies of coniferous forest. The experimental site was divided into three major categories (viz., closed canopy, open spaces, and partial tree cover). A sampling plot of 100 m(2) was established on each site to measure species diversity, dominance, and evenness. To observe richness and abundance, the rarefaction and rank abundance curves were plotted. Results revealed that a total of 45 species representing 34 families were available in the study site. Medicinal plants were the most abundant (45%) followed by edible plants (26%). Tree canopy cover affected the overall growth of medicinal plants on the basis of abundance and richness. The site with partial canopy exhibited the highest diversity, dominance, and abundance compared to open spaces and closed canopy. These findings are instrumental in identifying the wealth of the medicinal floral diversity in the northeastern temperate forest of Balakot and the opportunity to sustain the livelihoods of local communities with the help of public/private partnership.

AB Studying spatial patterns and habitat association of plant communities may provide understanding of the ecological mechanisms and processes that maintain species coexistence. To conduct assessments of correlation between community compositions and habitat association, we used data from two topographically different plots with 2 ha area in tropical evergreen forests with the variables recorded via grid systems of 10 x 10 m subplots in Northern-Central Vietnam. First, we tested the relationship between community composition and species diversity indices considering the topographical variables. We then assessed the interspecific interactions of 20 dominant plant species using the nearest-neighbor distribution function, D-ij(r), and Ripley's K-function, K-ij(r). Based on the significant spatial association of species pairs, indices of interspecific interaction were calculated by the quantitative amounts of the summary statistics. The results showed that (i) community compositions were significantly influenced by the topographic variables and (ii) almost 50% significant pairs of species interactions were increased with increasing spatial scales up to 10-15 m, then declined and disappeared at scales of 30-40 m. Segregation and partial overlap were the dominant association types and disappeared at larger spatial scales. Spatial segregation, mixing, and partial overlap revealed the important species interactions in maintaining species coexistence under habitat heterogeneity in diverse forest communities.

AB In tropical forests, the spatial distribution of trees may present random, uniform, or grouped patterns that can simultaneously be affected by site and species characteristics. In Central Amazon, topographic gradients and soil water levels drive differences in tree species distribution and in forest dynamics at local scales. Knowing this kind of information can be useful for a forest manager to plan harvesting operations considering the microhabitat preference of merchantable species to reduce the disturbances caused by logging activities. Thus, the spatial variation of tree species is an important information to be considered to support the planning process of forest logging. The present study aims to evaluate the spatial distribution pattern of six species and analyze the relationship between the topography and the population densities and stem size of those species. The study was carried out in a forest production compartment managed by a private company located in the municipality of Silves, state of Amazonas, Brazil. The spatial pattern of the six species was characterized by Ripley's K function. Spatial distribution of diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree density based on kernel incidence calculation were evaluated for topographic classes of slope, elevation, and distance from streams, which were mapped using geographic information systems (GIS). The means of DBH and density of each species were compared among topographic classes by ANOVA and Tukey's test. The results demonstrated the predominance of the aggregate distribution pattern for the six species up to 1105 m (p < 0.01). The tree species Minquartia guianensis Aubl., Protium puncticulatum J.F.Macbr, Manilkara elata (Allemao ex Miq.) Monach, and Caryocar glabrum Aubl. Pers showed an increase in the tree density as the distance from the streams and elevation increased, standing spatially incident on plateaus. Kernel densities of Dinizia excelsa Ducke and Goupia glabra Aubl. were higher closer to streams. The DBH averages followed similar trends of population density for M. guianensis, M. elata, and C. glabrum, and the opposite pattern for D. excelsa, which presented larger individuals in less densely populated areas. P. puncticulatum and G. glabra mean DBH distribution was not affected by the topographic variables analyzed. Topography-related variables showed effects on variations of density and tree size, suggesting that species may be spatially sensitive to the habitat variability available in the study area. In view of logging planning, spatial distribution must be considered in decisions related to cutting down trees and maintenance of remaining trees, especially because some species are more aggregated in smaller scales. Moreover, as topographic variations affect the spatial distribution of size and density, the timber yield will vary spatially in the area, bringing implications for planning logging intensities, roads, skid trails and forest operations. Finally, the procedures and information generated in this study can be reproduced and applied to other species and managed areas to support the planning toward minimizing impacts on the spatial structure of commercial species, as well as to increase the chances of future stock recovery of managed forests in the Amazon.

AB Comprehensive biodiversity inventories are expensive and time-consuming to achieve, especially for groups of megadiverse organisms. One approach to resolve such situations is to utilize biological substitutes, referred to as surrogates. A surrogate should provide meaningful information at a lower cost and/or effort than the original level of resolution. Studies have shown that species richness is often not the best or most appropriate component or predictor of biodiversity. Functional diversity can be used as a measurement of the ecological differentiation between habitats or between biological functions. We evaluated the use of several taxonomic metrics as potential surrogates for leaf-litter ant assemblages distributed in 65 Atlantic rainforest sites. Our goal was to find reliable and economic substitutes for both taxonomic and functional leaf-litter ant diversity and composition. We tested four potential surrogate approaches for taxonomic metrics and three for functional group metrics. Additionally, we also evaluated the time and costs involved. We used a large leaf-litter ant database that comprises 364 ant species, respectively classified into 13 or 26 ant functional groups based on either a general and specific resolution. Subfamily was found to be an unacceptable surrogate for both taxonomic and functional group metrics. Mixed-level and indicator taxa metrics were rated as 'excellent' taxonomic surrogates. Mixed-level and genus metrics were rated as 'excellent' or 'acceptable' functional group surrogates when considering the most general functional resolution, while mixed-level and genus were considered as 'excellent' surrogates when considering the more specific resolution. The monetary and time costs to identify ants to genus level were lower than those using indicator taxa and mixed-level metrics. The use of a certain higher taxon functional and taxonomic surrogates allows a reduction of survey and analysis costs while still enabling the analysis of biological diversity from the taxonomic and functional point of view.

AB Water availability is an important factor that influences plant-insect interactions. While the influence of water limitation on plant resistance traits has received much attention, how water availability affects plant tolerance to herbivory is rarely tested. Here we show that lower water availability reduced tolerance capacity of tomato plants as measured by above ground regrowth and flower development after herbivory. In contrast to a reduced ability to tolerate herbivory, lower water availability increased the constitutive and induced levels of two defensive proteins, trypsin protease inhibitor and polyphenol oxidase, indicative of an increased investment on resistance under water limitation. The increase in defense proteins was paralleled with lower performance of a specialist caterpillar, Manduca sexta, and lower consumption of plant tissues. Although the performance of generalist, Helicoverpa zea, was unaffected by water availability, we observed a high mortality of H. zea that suggests strong resistance of tomato against H. zea. The findings revealed an unexpected case where water limitation decreases tolerance but increases resistance of a plant, suggesting a potential tradeoff between these strategies. This plasticity may benefit herbaceous plants by balancing growth and defense under variable water availability.

AB The role of the human-made structures in coastal ecosystems can determine the spatial distribution or patterns of spatial abundances of marine organisms. To contribute to the understanding of linkages between different components of habitats (i.e. natural and artificial structures), we explored the role of type of larval development (planktotrophic vs. non-planktotrophic) on patterns of spatial variation of gastropods on rocky shores, elucidating the possible responsibility of habitat fragmentation on their distribution. Obtained results suggest that habitat fragmentation affects differently the patterns of variability of species with different types of larval development. Namely, fragmentation caused by artificial structures mostly influence variability of species with non-planktotrophic development. Moreover, although abundance of the species with non-planktotrophic development varied at small spatial scales, suggesting that processes operating at this scale are likely the main drivers of their distribution, changes in species variability were not associated with differences in species abundance among habitats.

AB The objective of this present study was to understand the distribution patterns of various forms of soil phosphorus (P) and the biotic and abiotic factors affecting the soil P fractions under long-term cover crops. Here, we investigated the characteristics of soil P forms, community structure of P-solubilizing bacteria (using 16S rRNA) and the related enzyme activity under clean tillage (CT), 14 years of white clover (WC, Trifolium repens L.) and orchard grass (OG, Dactylis glomerata L.) cover crops in a rain-fed apple orchard on the Weibei Loess Plateau, China. Relative to CT treatment, long-term cover crops enhanced the bioavailability of soil P by increasing the contents of total phosphorus (TP), microbial phosphorus (MBP), organic phosphorus (Po) and certain forms of inorganic phosphorus (e.g. Al-P, Ca-2-P, Ca-8-P and Fe-P) in the surface soil, in addition, WC treatment also increase the available P (AP) contents in the topsoil. A redundant analysis (RDA) showed that soil organic matter (SOM), NH4+-N and pH were the key environmental factors affecting the morphological changes of soil P. In addition, the effects of long-term cover crops on soil P forms were mainly concentrated in the topsoil, and the WC treatment had a greater impact on soil P composition than the OG treatment. Interestingly, long-term cover crops effectively increased the abundances of P-solubilizing bacteria, such as Streptomyces, Sphingomonas, Nocardioides and Haliangium, and enhanced the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Overall, long-term cover crops were an effective strategy to activate soil P as they improve the soil environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change may impose extreme conditions which potentially affect species' distributions, leading to spatio-temporal variation in biodiversity and ecosystem services patterns. Here we compared current climate conditions to future climate scenarios projected to 2050 to assess potential changes in the spatio-temporal patterns of the taxonomic and functional diversities of the woody species of the Restinga vegetation in Brazil. We generated Ecological Niche Models (ENM) for 796 woody plant species from which we estimated the spatio-temporal changes of beta diversity components, the community-weighted means (CWM) of selected traits and functional diversity indices. The pessimistic scenario indicated an overall threefold increase in woody plant species loss compared to the optimistic scenario, whereas at regional scales, species loss may reach percentages as high as 19%. Conversely, beta diversity may increase in the future, in which the turnover component had a greater contribution than nestedness. The CWM projection emphasized contrasts among traits and ecoregions, with an increase in most analysed traits (stem wood density, seed length and fruit length) and a decrease in one of them (maximum plant height). Functional divergence and richness may decrease in future, while functional evenness may increase. Our study highlighted important potential changes in the distribution of biodiversity that could lead to biotic homogenization in the Restinga vegetation and calls for the inclusion of this marginalized vegetation in plans for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

AB Forests worldwide are facing increasingly frequent climate extremes due to global warming. The negative effects of climate change on tropical forests have been extensively reported by both permanent plots and tree-ring studies that targeted forest?s responses to climate. While they focus mostly on community and population levels, the effects of landscape heterogeneity on trees? sensitivity to climate is often not accounted for, overlooking the diverse responses of individual trees to climate variation. We tested the hypotheses that trees may differ in sensitivity to climate and that some microenvironmental conditions may exert the role of climate-change refugia. We built the first tree-ring chronology of Amburana cearensis trees sampled across a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) in Brazil. We ensure a robust tree-ring dating using dendrochronological methods and C-14 dating of trees inhabiting various conditions characterized here through the seasonality of the local Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. At the population level, the standard tree-ring chronology suggests that tree growth depends on rainfall and temperature, leading to a common conclusion that drier and warmer conditions would impact interannual tree growth in the tropics. However, the cluster analyses revealed groups of individual trees with distinct growth sensitivities to climate. The most sensitive trees were the individuals located in the highly seasonal vegetation of the epikarst, in contrast to the complacent trees (non-sensitive to regular interannual climate variability) inhabiting the less-seasonal vegetation in the deep soil epikarst and valley. Based on these groups of trees, we built two mean chronologies and assessed their climate-growth relationships. In accordance with the individual analysis, the tree-ring chronology of complacent trees showed no association with wet season precipitation and only moderate association with temperature. The areas supporting these complacent trees of A. cearensis in the less seasonal vegetation correspond to a quarter of the entire sampling site. The climate buffering capacity of these refugia may only be compromised in years of climate extremes when all sampled trees share low growth rates during years with anomalous low rainfall and high temperature. Assessing individual?s climate sensitivity is therefore paramount for a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous responses of tropical forests to climate change. The hidden individual tree responses in the population can help identify priority areas of management in a rapidly changing environment.

AB In order to make adequate projections on the consequences of climate change stressors on marine organisms, it is important to know how impacts of these stressors are affected by the presence of other species. Here we assessed the direct effects of ocean warming (OW) and acidification (OA) along with non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of a predatory crab and/or a predatory snail on the habitat-forming mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. Mussels were exposed for 10-14 weeks to contrasting pCO(2) (500 and 1400 mu atm) and temperature (15 and 20 degrees C) levels, in the presence/absence of cues from one or two predator species. We compared mussel traits at sub-organismal (nutritional status, metabolic capacity-ATP production-, cell stress condition via HSP70 expression) and organismal (survival, oxygen consumption, growth, byssus biogenesis, clearance rates, aggregation) levels. OA increased the mussels' oxygen consumption; and OA combined with OW increased ATP demand and the use of carbohydrate reserves. Mussels at present-day pCO(2) levels had the highest protein content. Under OW the predatory snail cues induced the highest cell stress condition on the mussels. Temperature, predator cues and the interaction between them affected mussel growth. Mussels grew larger at the control temperature (15 degrees C) when crab and snail cues were present. Mussel wet mass and calcification were affected by predator cues; with highest values recorded in crab cue presence (isolated or combined with snail cues). In the absence of predator cues in the trails, byssus biogenesis was affected by OA, OW and the OA x OW and OA x predator cues interactions. At present-day pCO(2) levels, more byssus was recorded with snail than with crab cues. Clearance rates were affected by temperature, pCO(2) and the interaction between them. The investigated stressors had no effects on mussel aggregation. We conclude that OA, OW and the NCEs may lead to neutral, positive or negative consequences for mussels.

AB Forest cover and light availability comprise key factors for plant establishment in tropical forests. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF), Euterpe edulis (Areacaceae) is an endangered and keystone food resource contributing to forest functionality. We investigated the influence of forest loss and light availability on leaf traits and acclimatization of young individuals of E. edulis in AF fragments. We aimed to understand (i) how canopy openness and transmitted light are affected by forest cover at the landscape scale and the individual palm level; and (ii) how local and landscape features, combined and separately, affect key leaf traits widely known to be related to plant growth. The study was carried out in 15 forest fragments, ranging from 16 to 97% of surrounding forest cover. In each fragment, we sampled 10-20 individuals of E. edulis and analyzed nine leaf traits related to morphological, biochemical and chemical aspects. We also took hemispherical photographs to estimate canopy openness on the top of each E. edulis and also within fragment plots. We found that young plants predominantly occurred in more shaded environments. Additionally, E. edulis succeeded to acclimate in six of the nine traits analyzed, with most traits being affected by local and landscape features. It is likely that the lack of variation in traits related to protection against herbivory are limiting the species establishment in highly deforested landscapes. Our results provide novel evidence that both landscape and local contexts affect the leaf traits of E. edulis young plants leading to biochemical, chemical and morphological adjustments.

   INCOMPATIBILITY; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; SELF-FERTILIZATION
AB The success of species depends on their ability to exploit ecological resources in order to optimize their reproduction. However, species are not usually found within single-species ecosystems but in complex communities. Because of their genetic relatedness, closely related lineages tend to cluster within the same ecosystem, rely on the same resources, and be phenotypically similar. In sympatry, they will therefore compete for the same resources and, in the case of flowering plants, exchange their genes through heterospecific pollen transfer. These interactions, nevertheless, pose significant challenges to species co-existence because they can lead to resource limitation and reproductive interference. In such cases, divergent selective pressures on floral traits will favour genotypes that isolate or desynchronize the reproduction of sympatric lineages. The resulting displacement of reproductive characters will, in turn, lead to pre-mating isolation and promote intraspecific divergence, thus initiating or reinforcing the speciation process. In this review, we discuss the current theoretical and empirical knowledge on the influence of heterospecific pollen transfer on flower evolution, highlighting its potential to uncover the ecological and genomic constraints shaping the speciation process.

AB Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is an important mechanism facilitating species coexistence in plant communities. Yet, which factors influence CNDD is still not clear. Here, we examined the factors influencing CNDD in tree species within a 60-ha tropical rainforest dynamics plot. Point pattern analysis was used to test the existence and strength of CNDD. The relationships between strength of CNDD and plant functional traits, as well as abiotic factors, were assessed by stepwise regression analysis. Results showed that 89% of the examined species exhibited CNDD, and the strength of CNDD decreased with increasing spatial scales and species abundance. The maximum strength of CNDD (d(max)) was negatively related to leaf dry matter content and positively related to potential maximum height. Soil water content, available nitrogen, and total potassium were the major abiotic factors determining d(max). Our study suggests that CNDD is prevalent in most tree species and that both abiotic (soil) and biotic (species abundance, plant functional traits) factors constrain the strength of CNDD in our tropical montane rainforest.

AB Agricultural expansion has contributed to the loss and fragmentation of natural habitats and, as a consequence, the edge effect in these habitats has increased, leading to nest predation rates higher at the edge of fragments than in the interior. Living fences in abandoned croplands, however, add a structural component to the landscape which can help to mitigate the effects of disturbance. We used artificial nests to assess whether a living fence at the edge of a fragment of tropical dry forest, immersed in an agricultural landscape, can assuage the edge effect by decreasing predation rates. We identified the predators that attacked nests at several distances from the living fence and related the frequency of predator attacks with plant height, leaf height diversity, and tree and herb coverage. Vegetation structure of the living fence was vertically more complex than that found inside the fragment. 52% of nests were predated and we did not find a significant relationship between predation rates and the proximity of nests to the living fence, suggesting a null edge effect on predation. Birds were the most frequent predators, followed by rodents and carnivorous mammals, with the composition of predators varying among transects. The composition of predators and vegetation structure of the living fence were the factors that explained the null edge effect on nests predation. Our results indicate that the presence of a living fence at the edge of a fragment in agroforestry systems could mitigate the edge effects on nest predation.

AB Plants from arid environments display covarying traits to survive or resist drought. Plant drought resistance and ability to survive long periods of low soil water availability should involve leaf phenology coordination with leaf and stem functional traits related to water status. This study tested correlations between phenology and functional traits involved in plant water status regulation in 10 Sonoran Desert tree species with contrasting phenology. Species seasonal variation in plant water status was defined by calculating their relative positions along the iso/anisohydric regulation continuum based on their hydroscape areas (HA)-a metric derived from the relationship between predawn and midday water potentials-and stomatal and hydraulic traits. Additionally, functional traits associated with plant water status regulation, including lamina vessel hydraulic diameter (DHL), stem-specific density (SSD) and leaf mass per area (LMA) were quantified per species. To characterize leaf phenology, leaf longevity (LL) and canopy foliage duration (FD) were determined. Hydroscape area was strongly correlated with FD but not with leaf longevity (LL); HA was significantly associated with SSD and leaf hydraulic traits (DHL, LMA) but not with stem hydraulic traits (vulnerability index, relative conductivity); and FD was strongly correlated with LMA and SSD. Leaf physiological characteristics affected leaf phenology when it was described as canopy FD better than when described as LL. Stem and leaf structure and hydraulic functions were not only relevant for categorizing species along the iso/anisohydric continuum but also allowed identifying different strategies of desert trees within the last-slow' plant economics spectrum. The results in this study pinpoint the set of evolutionary pressures that shape the Sonoran Desert Scrub physiognomy.

AB Fruit-fall provides the transfer of biomass and nutrients between forest strata and remains a poorly understood component of Amazon forest systems. Here we detail fruit-fall patterns including those of Vouacapoua americana a Critically Endangered timber species across 25 km(2) of lowland Amazon forest in 2016. We use multi-model comparisons and an ensemble model to explain and interpolate fruit-fall data collected in 90 plots (totaling 4.42 ha). By comparing patterns in relation to observed and remotely sensed biomass estimates we establish the seasonal contribution of V. americana fruit-fall biomass. Overall fruit-fall biomass was 44.84 kg ha(-1) month(-1) from an average of 44.55 species per hectare, with V. americana dominating both the number and biomass of fallen fruits (43% and 64%, number and biomass respectively). Spatially explicit interpolations provided an estimate of 114 Mg dry biomass of V. americana fruit-fall across the 25 km(2) area. This quantity represents the rapid transfer by a single species of between 0.01 and 0.02% of the overall above ground standing biomass in the area. These findings support calls for a more detailed understanding of the contribution of individual species to carbon and nutrient flows in tropical forest systems needed to evaluate the impacts of population declines predicted from short (<65 year) logging cycles.

AB Natural enemies have been implicated as agents of negative density dependence (NDD) in tropical forests, but their relative contributions to NDD, and thus to the maintenance of diversity, are largely unknown.
   We monitored the rates of survival and relative growth rates on seedlings for 10 years in tropical moist forest in Manu National Park, Peru. We then experimentally manipulated the plots to exclude fungal pathogens, insects, small mammals and large mammals for an additional 31 months to assess the influence of these natural enemies on density-dependent interactions among tropical seedlings.
   Fungal pathogens made the most important contribution to NDD. The application of fungicide led to lower mortality rates, faster growth rates and decreased species diversity. Other taxa of natural enemies had at most minor effects on seedling performance.
   Synthesis. We conclude that fungal pathogens are the strongest contributors to the widely observed NDD that occurs among seedlings. Moreover, the presence of fungal pathogens augments the species diversity of seedlings, indicating their critical contribution to the maintenance of species coexistence and the structure of tropical tree communities.

TI Riparian buffer length is more influential than width on river water
   quality: A case study in southern Costa Rica
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Riparian buffer; Water quality; Watershed management; River
   conservation; Land use planning; Neotropics
AB Riparian zones are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, but are at risk due to agricultural expansion and climate change. To maximize return on conservation investment in mixed-use landscapes, it is important to identify the minimum intact riparian forest buffer sizes to conserve riparian ecosystem services. The minimum riparian forest buffer width necessary to maintain tropical river water quality remains unclear, and there is little analysis of effective riparian buffer lengths. Also, in studies on the effect of land use on river water quality globally, there is little standardization in the area where land use is analyzed. Here, these challenges were addressed in the Osa Peninsula in southwestern Costa Rica. Water quality parameters and social variables were sampled at 194 locations across the region. For each sample, land use was calculated in nine different riparian buffer sizes and at the sampling location. Riparian forest cover had a positive effect on water quality parameters, while agricultural cover had a negative effect. The longer the length of the buffer considered, the greater the relative support for influencing water quality (1000 m > 500 m > 100 m). All buffer widths yielded similar support within each length class. These results indicate that length of riparian forest buffers, not width, drives their ability to conserve water quality. While wide and long riparian forests are ideal to maximize the protection of river water quality and other ecosystem services, in landscapes where that is impractical, the 15-m-wide riparian forest buffers that are supported by Costa Rican legislation could improve water quality, providing that they are at least 500 m long. The results also indicate the importance of methodological standardization in studies that monitor land use effects on water quality. The authors propose that studies in similar regions analyze land use in riparian zones 15-m-wide by 1000 m upstream. Conserving and restoring narrow, long riparian forest buffers could provide a rapid, economical management approach to balance agricultural production and water quality protection.

AB An ecoregion is a region with similar environmental conditions. However, many ecoregions represent regional habitat heterogeneity, and areas with little fieldwork information can benefit from ecoregion mapping by providing information about their biodiversity distribution. This work presents the procedure adopted to map the terrestrial ecoregions of the Purus-Madeira interfluve, in the Brazilian Amazon using Machine Learning techniques. A methodological approach with Self-Organizing Map and K-means algorithms is proposed for the ecoregion mapping and the resulting model is discussed. The final ecoregion map was built up from a set of variables including altitude, slope, drainage density, percentage of tree cover and a vegetation map. Discriminant analysis identified the extent to which the variables are similar or different between the ecoregions, with a Kappa index of 0.86. This indicates that the methodological approach is reliable and thus can reproduce valid results over different areas. We produced a map with 14 ecoregions to account for the environmental diversity in the Purus-Madeira interfluve. This map can be used for the planning of biodiversity conservation.

AB We present the first annually resolved and statistically reliable tree-ring delta O-18 (delta O-18(T)) chronologies for the three South Asian tropical moist forest tree species (Chukrasia tabularis A. Juss., Toona ciliata M. Roem., and Lagerstroemia speciosa Roxb.) which differ in their shade tolerance and resistance to water stress. We found significantly higher mean delta(18)O(T )values in light-demanding T. ciliata than in intermediate shade tolerant C. tabularis and shade tolerant L. speciosa (p < 0.001). delta O-18 in C. tabularis was mainly influenced by pre-monsoon vapor pressure deficit (VPD; r =-0.54, p < 0.01) and post monsoon maximum temperature (T-max) (r = 0.52, p < 0.01). delta O-18(T) in T. ciliata was strongly negatively correlated with a dry season drought index PDSI (r =0.65, p < 0.001) and VPD (r = 0.58, p < 0.001). Pre-monsoon T-max was strongly positively linked with delta O-18. in L. speciosa (r = 0.65, p < 0.001), indicating that climatic influences on delta O-18(T). are species-specific and vary among tree functional types. Although there was a week correlation between local precipitation and delta O-18(T) in our studied species, we found a strong correlation between delta O-18. and precipitation at a larger spatial scale. Linear mixed effect models revealed that multiple factors improved model performance only in C tabularis, yielding the best model, which combined VPD and T-max. The top models in T. ciliata and L. speciosa induded only the single factors PDSI and T-max, highlighting that the way C. tabularis interacts with climate is more complex when compared with other two species. Our analyses suggest that stable oxygen isotope composition in tree rings of South Asian tropical moist forest trees are a suitable proxy of local and regional climate variability and are an important tool for understanding the physiological mechanisms associated with the global hydrological cycle.

AB The drastic reduction of the Brazilian Cerrado has transformed this savanna hotspot into vast swaths of commodity-based agriculture fields, mainly soybean, sugarcane, and beef-production pasturelands. The resulting habitat loss and fragmentation are the principal factors underlying population decline of native species inhabiting the Cerrado, particularly those with a high demand for space, low population density, and specialized diet, such as the endangered giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla). Although the species has been studied in protected areas, we know much less about its ability to endure in disturbed landscapes. Here, we analyzed camera-trapping data to estimate a proxy of habitat use ((psi) over bar; occupancy) and detection probabilities of the giant anteater, identifying environmental covariates influencing these parameters in landscapes with intensive agriculture and commercial forestry. We found this species using about half of the study area (model average (Psi) over bar = 0.51, CI = 0.40-0.62), with two predictors strongly influencing habitat use: protected areas and unpaved roads. In turn, detection probability correlates positively with area of open Cerrado and negatively with area of settlements. The species is more likely to use unpaved roads inside protected areas ((psi) over bar = 0.90, CI = 0.47-0.75), compared to off road sites in the surrounding areas ((psi) over bar = 0.19, CI = 0.10-0.34). Our findings indicate that giant anteaters are dependent on nature reserves and native vegetation areas existing on private properties, whose protection is regulated by the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law. Given the relative paucity of state-owned protected areas in the Brazilian Cerrado, increasing the adherence of rural owners to this law is, therefore, key for the conservation of the giant anteater. The intense use of unpaved roads might reflect travelling and/or foraging optimization, a behavioral response that, nevertheless, may compound this species' susceptibility to suffer mortality from roadkill.

AB Species may co-occur due to responses to similar environmental conditions, biological associations, or simply because of coincident geographical distributions. Disentangling patterns of co-occurrence and potential biotic and abiotic interactions is crucial to understand ecosystem function. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding data from litter and mineral soils collected from a longitudinal transect in Amazonia to explore patterns of co-occurrence. We compared data from different Amazonian habitat types, each with a characteristic biota and environmental conditions. These included non-flooded rainforests (terra-firme), forests seasonally flooded by fertile white waters (varzeas) or by unfertile black waters (igapos), and open areas associated with white sand soil (campinas). We ran co-occurrence network analyses based on null models and Spearman correlation for all samples and for each habitat separately. We found that one third of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were bacteria and two thirds were eukaryotes. The resulting networks were nevertheless mostly composed of bacteria, with fewer fungi, protists, and metazoans. Considering the functional traits of the OTUs, there is a combination of metabolism modes including respiration and fermentation for bacteria, and a high frequency of saprotrophic fungi (those that feed on dead organic matter), indicating a high turnover of organic material. The organic carbon and base saturation indices were important in the co-occurrences in Amazonian networks, whereas several other soil properties were important for the co-exclusion. Different habitats had similar network properties with some variation in terms of modularity, probably associated with flooding pulse. We show that Amazonian microorganism communities form highly interconnected co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks, which highlights the importance of complex biotic and abiotic interactions in explaining the outstanding biodiversity of the region.

AB Karst region has a high rate of rock exposure, shallow and discontinuous soil, and a fragile ecological environment. However, these special habitats encompass a large area of forest with strong original nature-karst deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen mixed forest. So far, very limited information is available on the spatial patterns and internal maintenance mechanism of this community. To fill this gap, the spatial distributions together with spatial correlations of both the live and dead trees in the karst primary forests of the Maolan National Nature Reserve in China were explored by using univariate as well as bivariate g(r) functions. The results revealed that: (1) the habitat heterogeneity of the karst primary forest has insignificant influence at a larger scale (>10 m); (2) the decline in aggregation with the increasing size classes from saplings to adults suggests self-thinning process, proving that negative density constraints occurred in early life stages; (3) positive spatial correlation was found in live trees with similar diameters, which related to the microsite heterogeneity; (4) the aggregation of dead trees and non-attraction of dead and surviving trees indicated scramble competition; (5) mortality analysis indicated the absence of random mortality, favoring positive density-dependent effects; (6) strong initiation sprouting regeneration was one of the main self-renewal strategies, and regeneration was more likely to occur at the edge of the gap rather than under the gap. Our results support the view that the mechanisms underlying the observed spatial patterns were related to certain ecological processes and their interaction. These were the positive and negative density dependence, scramble competition, and microsite heterogeneity.

TI Tropical deforestation reduces plant mating quality by shifting the
   functional composition of pollinator communities
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

   Heliconia tortuosa; hummingbirds; outcrossing; pollinator functional
   groups; tropical forest
AB Deforestation can impact the quality of pollen received by target plants (i.e. delivery of incompatible pollen, self-pollen or pollen from closely related individuals). Such reductions in plant mating quality may be direct, when deforestation reduces plant population size and the availability of pollen donors, or indirect, when decreased mating quality results, for example, from shifts in the composition of the pollinator community. As most flowering plants depend on animal pollinators for reproduction, there is a need to understand the direct and indirect links between deforestation, pollinator community composition and plant mating quality.
   We quantified the direct, pollen donor-mediated and indirect, pollinator-mediated effects of deforestation on mating quality in Heliconia tortuosa, a tropical herb pollinated by low- and high-mobility hummingbirds. We used a confirmatory path analysis to test the hypothesis that deforestation (amount of forest cover and forest patch size) influenced mating quality (haplotype diversity of pollen pools, outcrossing and biparental inbreeding) directly and indirectly through functional shifts in the composition of pollinator communities (proportion of high-mobility hummingbirds).
   We found that deforestation triggered functional shifts in the composition of pollinator communities, as the proportion of high-mobility hummingbirds increased significantly with the amount of forest cover and forest patch size. The composition of the pollinator community affected mating quality, as the haplotype diversity of pollen pools increased significantly with the proportion of high-mobility hummingbirds, while biparental inbreeding decreased significantly. Although we did not detect any significant direct, pollen donor-mediated effects of deforestation on mating quality, reductions in the amount of forest cover and forest patch size resulted in functional shifts that filtered out high-mobility hummingbirds from the pollinator community, thereby reducing mating quality indirectly.
   Synthesis. Deforestation primarily influenced plant mating quality through a cascading effect mediated by functional shifts in the composition of the pollinator community. Our results indicate that plant mating quality strongly depends on the composition of local pollinator communities. Functional shifts that filter out highly mobile and effective pollinators may reduce the transfer of genetically diverse pollen loads from unrelated plants. Such shifts may have pronounced effects on plant population dynamics and disrupt genetic connectivity.

AB Temporal instability and spatial inconsistency in tree growth sensitivity to climate have been reported, but little attention has been given to tropical species. Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze. (Araucariaceae) is a critically endangered South American subtropical and tropical conifer. It offers the potential to evaluate alterations in tree growth responses as it is climate-sensitive and presents a core zone of distribution in the Brazilian meridional highlands (with small disjunct patches occurring in its most southern and northern ranges). Previous dendrochronological studies in the central and most southern distribution range of A. angustifolia showed different climate-related growth responses, which raises the question of whether the growth responses of A. angustifolia to climate are consistent over space and stable over time at the species? northern distribution limit? We developed well-replicated tree-ring chronologies for A. angustifolia at the species? northern distribution limit, examined its growth dynamics, and evaluated climate-growth relationships. The growth patterns of A. angustifolia allowed the synchronization of its tree ring time-series and the construction of two tree-ring width chronologies (at Brejo da Lapa ? BL and Vale das Arauc?arias ? VA) of 55 years and 171 years respectively. The chronologies demonstrated stable and robust signal strengths. Climate-growth response analyses indicated significant positive correlations of the VA chronology with precipitation variables, and with temperature variables in the BL chronology. Different diametric growth patterns were detected between BL and VA. We observed consistent reductions of growth responses to the climate in recent decades. Forest structure and dynamics, disturbance regime, local environmental factors, and climate change could generate physiological alterations and explain variations in A. angustifolia?s growth responses and increments. The species showed different sensitivities to climatic factors both spatially and temporally, and different growth patterns at its northern distribution limit.

AB Insect herbivory on seedling leaves is one of the most important factors driving seedling growth and mortality in natural forests, which sets the pivotal roles of insect herbivory in affecting natural forest regeneration and species composition. The intensity of herbivory can be influenced by multiple biotic and abiotic factors affecting leaf detection or consumption by insect herbivores. However, the relative importance of these biotic and abiotic factors in affecting insect herbivory and their interactions remain largely unknown in species-rich forests. We measured insect herbivory on seedling young leaves across 600 1 m x 1 m seedling plots in a subtropical forest. Effects of nine seedling traits, neighboring plant compositions, soil moisture, and light availability on young leaf damage by insect herbivores were assessed with generalized linear mixed-effects models. We found that seedling traits associated with plant size (young leaf area and seedling height), leaf nutrition or defense (leaf thickness, carbon content, and stem specific length) explained more of the variation in insect herbivory than the biotic and abiotic environmental factors. Young leaf coloration (delayed greening degree) exhibited contrasting effects on leaf damage at wet vs. dry sites, so did seedling trait diversity (functional dispersion, FDis). The risk of insect herbivory increased with leaf redness and decreased with seedling FDis at wet sites, while the opposite trends were observed at dry sites. Our study advances the understanding on the driving factors of insect herbivory on seedling leaves in species-rich forests and suggests that the alleviating effects of plant diversity on insect herbivory were stronger at wet conditions.

AB Light is a vital factor affecting tree growth, survival and reproduction. In forests, natural and anthropogenic disturbances are the main drivers of abrupt changes in environmental conditions, including solar irradiance. We examined interspecific differences in the responses of European beech and silver fir to canopy gap characteristics and positions within gaps across various life stages (small seedlings, tall seedlings and saplings) in old-growth stands in Swietokrzyski National Park, Central Poland. Additionally, we analyzed sapling architectural responses to light. Regeneration densities were strongly affected by gap characteristics. The largest interspecific differences in responses to gap characteristics were found for small seedlings, which indicated their different preferences not only for light conditions created within gaps, but also toward various microsites distributed on a fine-scale after gap creation. Small beech seedlings responded only to the position within the gap, but small fir seedlings reacted in a more complex way, including such variables as gap size, shape and distance from a gap border. Gap size and the distance from its border had the most noticeable positive effect on tall seedlings and saplings, indicating that successful transition of regeneration to taller life stages may be possible only in larger gaps and in places further from a canopy border. Light conditions did not affect sapling length to diameter ratio. However, both direct and diffuse light had a negative effect on beech and fir crown area and length. Fir had wider but shorter crowns compared with beech in the whole light spectrum. This result indicates that these two species might have contrasting strategies regarding light interception, with fir being better adapted to increase a crown laterally, and with beech either being more tolerant to self-shading than fir or able to keep a favorable spatial leaf arrangement to avoid self-shading. Beech had the highest height growth increments in low levels of direct light, but its height growth was positively affected by diffuse light. Fir height growth rates showed no response to direct light, but were highest in medium levels of diffuse light. No effect of light on beech height to lateral growth rate ratio was found. The effect of direct light on this parameter for fir was negative, and nonlinear in the case of diffuse light, with the highest ratios observed in medium light levels. Our results stress the need of using both direct and diffuse light when analyzing light effects on sapling architecture.

DE Spatial heterogeneity; Resource competition; Computer simulation model;
   Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Species-area relationship
AB The natural ecosystems provide services that are crucial for our survival as climate control, food and water security. A very persistent pattern is loss of biodiversity caused by human activities all over the world, mainly due to deforestation and agricultural expansion. One very important challenge for human societies is to find the equilibrium between economic growth and environmental sustainability. In this contribution we address the role developed by spatial heterogeneity due to resource distribution and fragmentation on the species diversity. We propose a spatial model in which species compete on a lattice that is divided in habitats containing different amount of resources. The landscape here is a fractal structure which changes gradually from highly fragmented to highly clumped. Fractal landscapes are constructed through the use of fractional Brownian motion and characterized by the Hurst exponent. We found from our simulation results that there is an optimum number of habitats in which the fragmentation level has no effect. As habitat number drift away from optimal value, fragmentation has a growing effect on biodiversity promotion, mostly for small values of the Hurst exponent H. We observed two power law regimes describing the species-area relationship, in which the exponent for small areas is always smaller than the one observed for large areas. We also observe for the majority of the cases we studied, that the value of species-area exponent in both regimes grows with the number of habitats and then drops when the number of habitats becomes large. The number of habitats revealed to be the most important variable to foster and control the biodiversity in all scenarios. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The expansion of livestock farming is one of the main causes of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Intensive land use for beef production can cause changes, affecting native fauna composition and species richness. Ants are important organism of soil biota in tropical forests, mainly for their ecological attributes and their remarkable abundance. We investigated the effects of habitat loss by livestock farming on the richness and composition of ground-dwelling ants in the Brazilian Amazon. Ants were captured in five areas of secondary forests and pastures using pitfall traps for 48 h. Our results showed that the ant richness did not differ between habitats (p = 0.89). However, the species composition was different, resulting in two segregated clusters: one formed by forest areas and one by those of pasture. An indicator species analysis underscored the occurrence of three species that can be considered typical of the secondary forest, while a subset of four species from pasture, which probably tolerate land-use disturbance by livestock farming. Our results suggest the importance of maintaining secondary forests for biodiversity conservation and that livestock farming directly affects the taxonomic composition of ant species in the Amazonian biome.

AB 1. Different habitat types are generally associated with shifts in ant species and traits, and even along a micro-scale woodland-grassland gradient, ant biodiversity may change at the edge proximities as a result of abiotic alterations. However, to the best of authors' knowledge, the changes in ant diversity along this type of gradient are understudied, especially from a functional perspective.
   2. The authors sampled ant species in eight micro-scale woodland-grassland gradients in a Mediterranean ecosystem, each comprising 16 m, to assess how ant species diversity, community composition, functional structure, and single- and multi-trait functional diversity change at the edge and in the two adjacent habitats (woodland and grassland) as the distance from the edge increases.
   3. No differences in species richness, species diversity, and community composition were found within the woodland and grassland habitats. Distance from the edge into the adjacent habitats explained changes in functional structure and diversity, which mainly increased in the grassland habitat; body length, leg length, sugar-based diet, dominant behaviour, and multi-trait diversity increased in the grassland. Along the micro-scale gradient, edges showed the highest species diversity and community composition that resulted from the overlap of the communities from the adjacent habitats.
   4. This study shed light on changes in ant species and traits along a micro-scale woodland-grassland gradient, and it highlights the importance of integrating different diversity approaches (functional and taxonomic) at a micro-spatial scale.

AB Mixed-species forest plantation is a sound option to facilitate ecological restoration, plant diversity and ecosystem functions. Compatible species combinations are conducive to reconstruct plant communities that can persist at a low cost without further management and even develop into natural forest communities. However, our understanding of how the compatibility of mycorrhizal types mediates species coexistence is still limited, especially in a novel agroforestry system. Here, we assessed the effects of mycorrhizal association type on the survival and growth of native woody species in mixed-species Eucalyptus plantations. To uncover how mycorrhizal type regulates plant-soil feedbacks, we first conducted a pot experiments by treating distinct mycorrhizal plants with soil microbes from their own or other mycorrhizal types. We then compared the growth response of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants and ectomycorrhizal plants to different soil microbial compositions associated with Eucalyptus plants. We found that the type of mycorrhizal association had a significant impact on the survival and growth of native tree species in the Eucalyptus plantations. The strength and direction of the plant-soil feedbacks of focal tree species depended on mycorrhizal type. Non-mycorrhizal plants had consistent negative feedbacks with the highest survival in the Eucalyptus plantations, whereas nitrogen-fixing plants had consistent positive feedbacks and the lowest survival. Arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants performed varied feedback responses to soil microbes from distinct mycorrhizal plant species. Non-mycorrhizal plants grew better with Eucalyptus soil microbes while nitrogen-fixing plants grew worse with their own conspecific soil microbes. Different soil microbial compositions of Eucalyptus consistently increased the aboveground growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants, but the non-mycorrhizal microbial composition of the Eucalyptus soil resulted in greater belowground growth of ectomycorrhizal plants. Overall, Eucalyptus plants induced an unfavorable soil community, impeding coexistence with other mycorrhizal plants. Our study provides consistent observational and experimental evidence that mycorrhizal-mediated plant-microbial feedback on species coexistence among woody species. These findings are with important implications to optimize the species combinations for better design of mixed forest plantations.

AB While taxonomic and biogeographical biases are often acknowledged, those for certain biological responses and species traits are routinely overlooked, generating major gaps in knowledge and conservation of biodiversity. Biases in research on birds - an over-sampled, diverse vertebrate class - may be readily detectable, and wetlands are important species-rich ecosystems in which to identify biases and research gaps for birds. The Pantanal, one of the world's largest wetlands, is globally relevant for bird conservation. In this wetland, we determined spatial, temporal, taxonomic and biological response-related biases in ornithological studies to guide future research in this ecosystem and, ultimately, in major global wetlands. Avian research was geographically biased, with 61 studies conducted in the Brazilian Pantanal and only one in Bolivia. Most studies were concentrated near urban centres, with poorly explored areas in the central Pantanal. Research was also over-represented during the dry season when field conditions are more favourable, but such temporal bias may hamper migration studies. Considering their richness, some families were studied disproportionately more (e.g. Jacanidae) or less (e.g. Tyrannidae). Some species (e.g. Wood Stork Mycteria americana and Yellow-billed Cardinal Paroaria capitata) were included in > 25% of studies, whereas a relatively low number of threatened bird species were studied. Behaviour was the most studied response, followed by abundance and reproduction, which were considered for > 65% of species studied. We conclude that further research needs to be focused on unexplored areas and periods, less detectable species, and ecological processes (e.g. interspecific interactions). Additionally, our results can provide useful information to better address future work and bird conservation actions in other large wetlands. For example, major gaps detected here constitute a primary roadmap to guide research in under-sampled regions, such as the Canadian peatlands and Tonle Sap Lake. Specifically, more studies on waterbirds in highly diverse wetlands from low-income countries (e.g. Okavango and Sundarban Delta) may help to disentangle the essential functional role provided for these species and to prioritize conservation actions in regions with limited research capacity.

AB Ants can shape vegetation as seed dispersers and ecosystem engineers. When anthills are long-lasting, they are known to change soil and vegetation characteristics. However, it is unclear whether plant species traits and species composition vary between ant guilds and between parts of individual anthills. We compared different aspects of soil and vegetation (composition, seedling abundance, and functional traits) between anthills and the surrounding mesophilous pasture in Czechia. This pasture hosts eight ant species, which belong to both seed dispersers and non-dispersers. Where feasible, we divided anthills into centres and margins for the analyses. Anthills (area 90.5-4051.7 cm(2); 5-19 plant species) displayed different and more heterogeneous (less similar within anthill plot type) vegetation composition when compared to the surrounding area, with more seedlings and several species restricted to anthills. Further, anthills were more functionally diverse and exhibited several differences in traits, both at the community and intraspecific level. Anthill centres had higher surface temperatures in hot sunny days, higher levels of phosphorus and pH than margins, while margins had higher moisture and carbon content than surrounding vegetation. Further, anthill vegetation differed between ant guilds with more myrmecochorous species found at nests of seed dispersers. Overall heterogeneity in this mesophilous pasture was enhanced by the presence of anthills. Further, the anthills themselves are heterogeneous due to variable sizes, persistence, and differences between their centres and margins on long-lasting anthills. Anthills can thus enhance plant diversity by maintaining disturbed microsites and enhancing the growth of seedlings and less competitive plants.

AB Riverine ecosystems can be conceptualized as 'bioreactors' (the riverine bioreactor) which retain and decompose a wide range of organic substrates. The metabolic performance of the riverine bioreactor is linked to their community structure, the efficiency of energy transfer along food chains, and complex interactions among biotic and abiotic environmental factors. However, our understanding of the mechanistic functioning and capacity of the riverine bioreactor remains limited.
   We review the state of knowledge and outline major gaps in the understanding of biotic drivers of organic matter decomposition processes that occur in riverine ecosystems, across habitats, temporal dimensions, and latitudes influenced by climate change.
   We propose a novel, integrative analytical perspective to assess and predict decomposition processes in riverine ecosystems. We then use this model to analyse data to demonstrate that the size-spectra of a community can be used to predict decomposition rates by analysing an illustrative dataset. This modelling methodology allows comparison of the riverine bioreactors performance across habitats and at a global scale.
   Our integrative analytical approach can be applied to advance understanding of the functioning and efficiency of the riverine bioreactor as hotspots of metabolic activity. Application of insights gained from such analyses could inform the development of strategies that promote the functioning of the riverine bioreactor across global ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
DE Harvester ants; Ecosystem services; Field edges; Landscape complexity;
   Landscape constraints
AB Agri-environmental schemes (AES) of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) aims at reversing the negative effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Landscape context may modulate, and even constraint, AES effectiveness. We evaluate AES effectiveness on ant abundance, diversity and community composition. Ants are an ecologically dominant group whose response to conservation efforts in farmland has been rarely evaluated, despite its role in weed control, particularly in Mediterranean farmland. Ants were sampled in the edge and in the centre of paired cereal fields, managed with and without AES in three study areas along a landscape complexity gradient. AES application had no significant effects on ant species richness or ant community composition. Richness increased in fields and landscapes with higher amounts of complex edges and decreased towards the centre of the fields. Specialist granivorous ants (harvester ants, Messor spp.) were the most abundant. Abundance of foraging ants increased with the amount of complex edges around fields and in the landscape. AES application increased ant abundance close to field edges but not in field centers. AES fields had less specialist granivorous foraging in their centers than in control field centers. Ant communities in Mediterranean cereal cropland were mostly constrained by the availability of complex edges, needed for nest building. AES increased the abundance of foraging ants, mostly specialist harvester ants, and its potential service of weed control, but close to field edges mainly. Measures promoting the abundance of stable edges rather than of ephemeral headlands in the landscape are essential to enhance the potential of AES for increasing ant-mediated ecosystem services of weed control.

AB Improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) represents one of the main goals to reduce N input in maximizing crop yield for sustainable agriculture. A NUE key strategy is the exploitation of genetic variation in available germplasm together with the understanding of molecular mechanisms governing this complex trait. Thus, NUE, its components, nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) and nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE), and NUE-related traits heritability were evaluated in ancient (Cappelli, Capeiti, Russello, and Mazzancoio) and modern (Messapia, Tiziana, Svevo, and Normanno) wheat genotypes for tackling nitrogen (N) and/or water limitation in both growth chamber and field experiments. Our results exhibited a reduction of NUE, NUpE, and NUtE under water and combined (nitrogen + water) stress in all the genotypes, as expected. The contribution of genetic variability on phenotypic variation was significant for NUtE, harvest index, post-anthesis nitrogen uptake (PANU), and biomass production traits. Moreover, the stress tolerance indexes, calculated and bi-plotted for N and water stresses, exhibited two distinct clusters for many traits as then confirmed by principal component analysis. Although modern varieties showed higher crop yield and NUE under conventional N and water regimes, ancient varieties exhibited best performances to cope with both stresses, mainly under water limitation. Finally, the usage index, which takes into account total biomass increase, underlined that old genotypes were less affected by both stresses during crop cycle. In particular, these genotypes showed the best performances for NUE and its components under both stresses at stem elongation and milk ripening as shown also by PANU. In addition, at these stages, nitrate and ammonium transporter gene expressions in the root were performed, showing the highest activity in ancient varieties. In conclusion, the identification of NUE traits during a specific crop cycle stage, under both N and water limitation, will help in the breeding of more resilient varieties in Mediterranean sustainable agriculture by reducing N supply.

DE Africa; forest undergrowth; nectarivory; plant&#8211; bird interaction;

AB Trait matching-a correlation between the morphology of plants and their pollinators-has been frequently observed in pollination interactions. Different intensities of natural selection in individual regions should cause such correlations to be observable across different local assemblages. In this study, we focused on matching between spur lengths of the genus Impatiens and bill lengths of sunbirds in tropical Africa. For 25 mountain and island locations, we compiled information about the composition and traits of local Impatiens and sunbird assemblages. We found that assemblage mean and maximum values of bill lengths were positively correlated with mean and maximum spur lengths across locations. Moreover, our results suggest that the positive correlations hold only for forest sunbird assemblages sharing the same habitat with Impatiens species. We further show that long-billed sunbirds seem to locally match the morphology of multiple Impatiens plant species, not vice versa. Our observation implies that trait matching significantly contributes to structuring of Impatiens-sunbird pollination systems. We suggest that special habitat preferences together with spatial isolation of mountain environment might play a role in this case.

AB The effects of climate change on tropical forests will depend on how diverse tropical tree species respond to drought. Current distributions of evergreen and deciduous tree species across local and regional moisture gradients reflect their ability to tolerate drought stress, and might be explained by functional traits.
   We measured leaf water potential at turgor loss (i.e. 'wilting point'; pi(tlp)), wood density (WD) and leaf mass per area (LMA) on 50 of the most abundant tree species in central Panama. We then tested their ability to explain distributions of evergreen and deciduous species within a 50 ha plot on Barro Colorado Island and across a 70 km rainfall gradient spanning the Isthmus of Panama.
   Among evergreen trees, species with lower pi(tlp) were associated with drier habitats, with pi(tlp) explaining 28% and 32% of habitat association on local and regional scales, respectively, greatly exceeding the predictive power of WD and LMA. In contrast, pi(tlp) did not predict habitat associations among deciduous species.
   Across spatial scales, pi(tlp) is a useful indicator of habitat preference for tropical tree species that retain their leaves during periods of water stress, and holds the potential to predict vegetation responses to climate change.

AB Species' evolutionary histories shape their present-day ecologies, but the integration of phylogenetic approaches in ecology has had a contentious history. The field of ecophylogenetics promised to reveal the process of community assembly from simple indices of phylogenetic pairwise distances - communities shaped by environmental filtering were composed of closely related species, whereas communities shaped by competition were composed of less closely related species. However, the mapping of ecology onto phylogeny proved to be not so straightforward, and the field remains mired in controversy. Nonetheless, ecophylogenetic methods provided important advances across ecology. For example the phylogenetic distances between species is a strong predictor of pest and pathogen sharing, and can thus inform models of species invasion, coexistence and the disease dilution/amplification effect of biodiversity. The phylogenetic structure of communities may also provide information on niche space occupancy, helping interpret patterns of facilitation, succession and ecosystem functioning - with relevance for conservation and restoration - and the dynamics among species within foodwebs and metacommunities. I suggest leveraging advances in our understanding of the process of evolution on phylogenetic trees would allow the field to progress further, while maintaining the essence of the original vision that proved so seductive.

AB Phosphorus (P) can leach fromtopsoil in inorganic and organic forms. While some evidence has shown inorganic P (orthophosphate) can leach to depth in some soils, less is known of dissolved organic P (DOP). This is not helped by a paucity DOP data for groundwater. We hypothesized that DOP species would leach in greater amounts to depth and at a faster rate through aquifer gravels than orthophosphate. We applied superphosphate with or without dung to a low P-sorption soil under pasture and irrigation. Between 0.7 (control) and 2.4 (dung +superphosphate) kg P ha(-1) was leached through 30 cm with a mean ratio of DRP to DOP of 1.5. At 50 cm, 0.7 and 1.3 kg P ha(-1) was leached with the DRP to DOP ratio decreasing to 1.1 due to greater DOP leaching (or DRP sorption). Therewas little difference in DRP lossesmeasured at 50 and 150 cmdepth. All DOP compounds except the monoester - inositol hexakisphosphate were leached at a faster rate than orthophosphate through aquifer gravels. These data suggest that where low P-sorption soils overlay similarly low P-sorption aquifers, DOP may reach groundwater at a faster rate than orthophosphate. Furthermore, as many DOP species are bioavailable to periphyton, our data suggest that DOP should be included in the assessment of the risk of P contamination of groundwater where connection to baseflow could be a long-term stimulant of periphyton growth.

AB For much of the past two decades, the scientific and policy community has sought to reduce forest loss through well-targeted public policy and enforcement measures and private sector engagement. Unfortunately, recent increases in forest loss in the Amazon have raised new concerns over the drivers of deforestation in the region, and the durability of the policies designed to mitigate it. Here we argue that recent deforestation trends are a partial reflection of Brazil's economic trajectories. In this article we show that poor economic conditions, nationally, will increase micro-level incentives for forest clearing. Conversely, economic growth, nationally, will suppress prices and land clearing incentives. Ultimately, we argue that, at the national-scale, economic growth may be closely aligned with, and possibly a pre-condition to, the attainment of international or national-level environmental goals.

AB Degraded Amazonian forests can take decades to recover and the ecological results of natural regeneration are still uncertain. Here we use field data collected across 15 lowland Amazon smallholder properties to examine the relationships between forest structure, mammal diversity, regrowth type, regrowth age, topography and hydrology. Forest structure was quantified together with mammal diversity in 30 paired regrowth-control plots. Forest regrowth stage was classified into three groups: late second-regrowth, early second-regrowth and abandoned pasture. Basal area in regrowth plots remained less than half that recorded in control plots even after 20-25 years. Although basal area did increase in sequence from pasture, early to late-regrowth plots, there was a significant decline in basal area of late-regrowth control plots associated with a decline in the proportion of large trees. Variation in different forest structure responses was explained by contrasting variables, with the proportion of small trees (DBH<20 cm) most strongly explained by topography (altitude and slope) whereas the proportion of large trees (DBH>60 cm) was explained by plot type (control vs. regrowth) and regrowth class. These findings support calls for increased efforts to actively conserve large trees to avoid retrogressive succession around edges of degraded Amazon forests.

AB Retention forestry is a silvicultural approach used to retain structural and compositional components of the harvested area, maintain some connectivity throughout the landscape and provide a "lifeboat" area for species as part of a conservation effort. However, no manipulative field experiment has assessed the lifeboat functioning of retention forestry more than a decade post-harvest. In this study, we documented the effects of retention plots 20 years after their establishment on flying Coleoptera assemblages using flight intercept traps. 3414 beetles from 160 different species or genera were recovered during the study. Results demonstrated that beetle abundance and species richness were comparable between retention patches and continuous forests in the vicinity. However, beetle assemblages differed between the treatments because closed-habitat species and fungivorous beetles declined in retention patches and open-habitat species considered as tourists were associated with retention patches. Yet, beetle assemblages varied more in response to interannual effects than treatment effects. With respect to the lifeboat effect of retention forestry, we conclude that retention patches do not host the same species assemblage than continuous stands but are nevertheless effective for the conservation of species abundance and richness within a harvested area.

AB The climate is changing and these changes may affect tree growth. Diameter growth models are one of the essential inputs for many growth and yield projection systems. Therefore, diameter growth models that can be used to estimate inside bark diameter at breast height (DBH) for red pine plantations in a changing climate were developed. One hundred and fifty red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) trees were sampled from 30 even-aged monospecific plantations (sites) (5 trees/site) across Ontario, Canada. Stem analysis data collected from these trees was used to develop and evaluate the growth models using a mixed effects modeling approach. Site and climate effects on diameter growth were examined by incorporating site and climate variables in the models. Including climate variables improved the fit statistics.
   Inside bark DBHs were predicted for 4 geographic areas of Ontario for the period 2021 to 2080. Three emissions trajectories known as representative concentration pathways (RCPs), each reflecting different levels of heat at the end of the century (i.e., 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 W m(-2)), were evaluated. At the end of the 2021 to 2080 growth period, projected diameters were wider by 11% and 23% for trees in the southeastern and southwestern parts, respectively, and narrower by 6% for those in the central west part of Ontario (under all climate change scenarios relative to those under a no change scenario). However, no pronounced difference in projected diameters was evident for trees in the far west part of the province regardless of climate change scenario (relative to the no change scenario). In the absence of climate data, the model fitted without climate variables can be used to estimate inside bark DBH.

AB This study provides a comprehensive checklist of Odonata species from the protected area of Mananciais da Serra. The survey was conducted in the endangered Atlantic Forest domain at the southern Serra do Mar mountain chain within a well-preserved area in the municipality of Piraquara, state of Parana, Brazil. Adults and larvae were sampled between June 2017 and March 2020 using different techniques in numerous mesohabitats, including phytotelmata, pools, small streams, and large reservoirs. A total of 1,708 specimens from 9 families, 43 genera and 84 species were sampled resulting in 53 new records for the state of Parana, almost doubling the known occurrence records for dragonflies and damselflies in that state. Furthermore, two hitherto undescribed females from the genera Planiplax and Heteragrion, four ultimate stadium larvae from Planiplax, Neocordulia, Heteragrion, and Acanthagrion, and five undescribed species were detected, one each from the genera Heteragrion, Progomphus, Brechmorhoga, Erythrodiplax, and Dasythemis. The estimated richness of odonates in this area is greater than 100 species, while the observed richness corresponding to almost 10% of all Odonata species in Brazil, the species-richest country in the world. These results reiterate the need to investigate undersampled areas to improve knowledge on diversity, taxonomy, and distribution of neotropical species. Finally, taxonomic notes for some species, including the rare corduliid Neocordulia mambucabensis Costa & T.C. Santos, 2000, are provided.

AB Cryptic species are morphologically identical but genetically distinct, and are prominent across numerous phyla. The coexistence of such closely related species on local scales would seem to run counter to traditional coexistence and competition theory; it has been hypothesized as a consequence of differences in their resource use or tolerances to environmental conditions. We developed an individual-based model of a community of three cryptic Litoditis marina (nematode) species, to understand how individual-level interspecific and intraspecific interactions might explain the coexistence of these closely related species.
   The model incorporates individuals' reproduction, competition, dispersal and resource use. Data characterizing the cryptic species (growth rates, dispersal ability, competitive interactions and responses to changing environmental conditions) were obtained from laboratory experiments involving both mono- and multispecific nematode cultures, and are used to parameterize the model.
   Simulation studies are used to investigate which individual-level mechanisms of dispersal and interaction lead to the characteristic population-level patterns observed experimentally. Our results highlight the key role of intraspecific competition in mediating dispersal and therefore co-occurrence of the cryptic species. The differences in dispersal also influence the response of the cryptic species to competition, a combination of factors that provides an explanation for their co-occurrence. These results provide insights into how changes in individual-level processes can be amplified to affect population-level co-occurrence.

AB We propose a stochastic model for interacting species in a metacommunity in order to study the factors affecting the intensity of the competition/colonization trade-off as a coexistence mechanism in metacommunities. We particularly focus on the role of the number of local communities and the number of refuges for the inferior competitor. The stochastic component is associated with the dispersal process and is represented by Poisson random measures. Thus, this stochastic model includes two dynamic scales: a continuous one, which refers to the interactions among species, and a low frequency one, referring to dispersal following a Poisson scheme. We show the well-posedness of the model and that it is possible to study its long-term behavior using Lyapunov exponents; the extinction of a species is associated with a negative slope in the time trajectory of the Lyapunov exponent, otherwise, it is equal to zero. We show that the competition/colonization trade-off is a function of the dispersal rate of the inferior competitor, and that it becomes less intense as the number of local communities increases, while the opposite is true with an increase in the number of refuges for the inferior competitor. We also show that under a priority effect type of scenario, dispersal can reverse priority effects and generate coexistence. Our results emphasize the importance of coexistence mechanisms related to the topology of the system of local communities, and its relationship with dispersal, in affecting the result of competition in local communities.

AB Lycianthes moziniana (Solanaceae: Capsiceae) is a perennial herb with edible fruits that is endemic to Mexico. Three varieties are recognized, all known in the Mexican Transition Zone. Lycianthes moziniana var. margaretiana grows in the Sierra Madre Oriental, whereas L. moziniana var. moziniana is common along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Lycianthes moziniana var.oaxacana is found exclusively in the Sierra Madre del Sur. The Mexican Transition Zone is a complex geological, climatic and biogeographical area, the result of tectonic and volcanic activity that has promoted genetic divergence and speciation. We determined the genetic variation and structure of L. moziniana. Using phylogeographical approaches, we described the demographic history and evolutionary processes leading its divergence. The intergenic spacers rpl32-trnL and ycf1 were sequenced for 133 individuals pertaining to 15 populations. The genealogical relationships were analysed using haplotype networks. Finally, based on ecological niche models, we inferred the palaeodistribution of L. moziniana during the Pleistocene. The genetic differences and the haplogroups matched the three described varieties. Geological and climatic events of the Mexican Transition Zone facilitated these results. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt isolated the populations of the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra Madre del Sur, while allowing the migration to the Sierra Madre Occidental, during the middle Holocene.

AB The absence of pines from tropical forests is a puzzling biogeographical oddity potentially explained by traits of shade intolerance. Pinus krempfii (Lecomte), a flat-leaved pine endemic to the Central Highlands of Vietnam, provides a notable exception as it seems to compete successfully with shade-tolerant tropical species. Here, we test the hypothesis that successful conifer performance at the juvenile stage depends on physiological traits of shade tolerance by comparing the physiological characteristics of P. krempfii to coexisting species from two taxa: the genus Pinus, and a relatively abundant and shade-tolerant conifer family found in pantropical forests, the Podocarpaceae. We examined leaf photosynthetic, respiratory and biochemical traits. Additionally, we compiled attainable maximum photosynthesis, maximum RuBP carboxylation (V-cmax) and maximum electron transport (J(max)) values for Pinus and Podocarpaceae species from the literature. In our literature compilation, P. krempfii was intermediate between Pinus and Podocarpaceae in its maximum photosynthesis and its V-cmax. Pinus exhibited a higher V-cmax than Podocarpaceae, resulting in a less steep slope in the linear relationship between J(max) and V-cmax. These results suggest that Pinus may be more shade intolerant than Podocarpaceae, with P. krempfii falling between the two taxa. However, in contrast, Vietnamese conifers' leaf mass per areas and biochemical traits did not highlight the same intermediate nature of P. krempfii. Furthermore, regardless of leaf morphology or family assignation, all species demonstrated a common and extremely high carbon gain efficiency. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of shade-tolerant photosynthetic traits for conifer survival in tropical forests. However, they also demonstrate a diversity of shade tolerance strategies, all of which lead to the persistence of Vietnamese juvenile conifers in low-light tropical understories.

AB We evaluated the role of communities of small mammals from three distinct areas in a region of Cerrado mixed with Atlantic Forest remains for maintenance of tick fauna. Thirty-nine marsupials (Gracilinanus agilis, n = 34; Marmosa paraguaiana, n = 4; Didelphis albiventris, n = 1) and 33 rodents (Oecomys cleberi, n = 10; Nectomys squamipes, n = 4; Calomys tener, n = 4; Hylaeamys megacephalus, n = 4; Akodon sp., n = 3; Rattus rattus, n = 3; Cerradomys subflavus, n = 2; Mus musculus, n = 2; Rhipidomys macrurus, n = 1) were captured. Solely G. agilis and the four rodent species (N. squamipes, R. macrurus, C. subflavus and Akodon sp.) were infested. Four tick species were collected (Amblyomma dubitatum, Amblyomma sculptum, Ixodes loricatus and Ornithodoros mimon). A. dubitatum was the most abundant tick species on hosts. Capture success was higher in the dry season, but the infestation was similar in both seasons. Forested habitats, particularly riparian forests, resulted in higher number of hosts and ticks collected (from hosts and from vegetation), compared to pastures and anthropized sites. The association between C. subflavus and I. loricatus and between A. dubitatum and N. squamipes observed here is the first recorded in Cerrado biome. Areas with more patches of forest, including the Atlantic Forest fragments, tend to present a richest community of small mammals and associated ticks.

AB Community assembly has been an important topic in ecological research and theory for over a century. Recently, restoration ecologists have emphasized the use of community assembly rules, such as environmental filtering, to better inform management actions. Although there has been a strong call for the use of community assembly rules in terrestrial restoration ecology, few studies have examined their potential use in providing habitat benefits such as food resources to native species in large-scale managed aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we found evidence of deterministic community assembly mechanisms in zooplankton communities in floodplain and seasonally inundated off-channel habitats in California's Central Valley. Additionally, we found that all sampled off-channel floodplain habitat types had similar zooplankton communities and that assembly in floodplain habitats was governed by variables associated with increased water residence time. This study is the first to determine community assembly rules in floodplain-river ecosystems in order to assist managers in providing floodplain food-web benefits to native fish and wildlife species at the landscape scale.

AB Legume species are important food sources to reduce hunger and deal with malnutrition; they also play a crucial role in sustainable agriculture in the tropical dry islands of Cabo Verde. To improve the knowledge of the heritage of plant genetic resources in this Middle Income Country, this study had three main goals: (i) to provide a checklist of food legumes; (ii) to investigate which species are traded in local markets and, based on field surveys, to compare species for their chemical, phenolic, antioxidant, and nutritional composition; and (iii) to discuss the agronomic value and contribution to food security in this archipelago. Our results revealed that 15 species are used as food and 5 of them are locally traded (Cajanus cajan, Lablab purpureus, Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Vigna unguiculata). The role of these species as sources of important minerals, antioxidants, and nutritional components for food security is highlighted, and the native ones (Lablab purpureus and Vigna unguiculata) stand-out as particularly well-adapted to the climate of these islands, which are already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change. We conclude that the sustainable use of these genetic resources can contribute to the reduction of hunger and poverty, thus meeting some challenges of the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB Simple Summary
   Ants play a dual role in their interaction with plant seeds. Many ant species, mainly harvester ants, consume plant seeds (granivory), whereas other ants, mainly scavengers, provide a beneficial seed dispersal service. Granivory by ants is frequently documented in deserts, but beneficial seed dispersal is rarely studied in such ecosystems. We followed the handling of seeds of Sternbergia clusiana, an ant-dispersed plant, by two guilds of desert ants. We focused on the treatment of seeds within the nest and on the redispersal of seeds after ejection from the nest. Scavenging ants rarely consumed the seed itself, they deposited most seeds away from the nest in apparently suitable microhabitats. In addition, we found that most of the seeds that were relocated by scavenging ants arrived at sites under the canopy of shrubs. Such sites might be beneficial for the establishment and success of plants in the arid environment. Indeed, we found that the subject plant was more likely to be found under shrubs than elsewhere, which suggests that it benefits from being placed there. Such documentation of seed dispersal activity by scavenging ants in arid ecosystems suggests they may be efficient seed dispersers in deserts, as they are in other ecosystems.
   Ants play a dual role in their interaction with plant seeds. In deserts, the consumption of seeds by granivorous ants is common, whereas mutualistic seed dispersal, often associated with scavenging ants, is rarely documented. We evaluated the contribution of both ant guilds to efficient seed dispersal of an ant-dispersed plant, Sternbergia clusiana, in a desert ecosystem. We presented seed to colonies of three species of desert ants from the Cataglyphis (scavengers) and Messor (granivorous) genera. We recorded seed consumption, ejection from the nest, and seed transportation to potentially beneficial microhabitats. We evaluated microhabitat quality by testing the association between habitat types and the plant at various life stages. As expected, granivores mainly consumed the seeds, whereas scavengers consumed the elaiosome (seed appendage serving as a reward), but left the seeds intact. Moreover, scavenging ants relocated the seeds much further than granivores, mainly to shrub patches. The disproportional distribution of the plant under shrubs at several life stages suggests that this microhabitat is beneficial for the plant. Overall, while granivores seem to mainly harm seed dispersal, we provide the first evidence for the beneficial contribution of scavenging ants in deserts, showing they exhibit the same suite of characteristics that render them efficient seed dispersers in other ecosystems.

AB Revealing the relationship between taxonomy and function in microbiomes is critical to discover their contribution to ecosystem functioning. However, while the relationship between taxonomic and functional diversity in bacteria and fungi is known, this is not the case for archaea. Here, we used a meta-analysis of 417 completely annotated extant and taxonomically unique archaeal genomes to predict the extent of microbiome functionality on Earth contained within archaeal genomes using accumulation curves of all known level 3 functions of KEGG Orthology. We found that intergenome redundancy as functions present in multiple genomes was inversely related to intragenome redundancy as multiple copies of a gene in one genome, implying the tradeoff between additional copies of functionally important genes or a higher number of different genes. A logarithmic model described the relationship between functional diversity and species richness better than both the unsaturated and the saturated model, which suggests a limited total number of archaeal functions in contrast to the sheer unlimited potential of bacteria and fungi. Using the global archaeal species richness estimate of 13,159, the logarithmic model predicted 4164.1 +/- 2.9 KEGG level 3 functions. The non-parametric bootstrap estimate yielded a lower bound of 2994 +/- 57 KEGG level 3 functions. Our approach not only highlighted similarities in functional redundancy but also the difference in functional potential of archaea compared to other domains of life.

AB Tree growth sensitivity to climate can vary over space and time. This variability generates inconsistency in growth response to climate, which makes it difficult to assess the effects of past climate and global climate change on tree growth. A previous short-term study of Pseudopiptadenia contorta found a consistent growth response to climate in distinct locations, which raises the question, is the growth response of P. contorta to climate consistent over the long-term? We aimed to assess whether there is a common pattern of variation in tree ring width, build tree-ring width chronologies, and verify the consistency of the climate-growth response of P. contorta in two Atlantic Forest remnants. Wood samples were collected in Reserva Biol ' ogica de Poco das Antas (RBPA) and Reserva Biol ' ogica de Tingu ' a (RBT) in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Conventional dendrochronology methods were used for cross-dating, to build chronologies and to assess the climate-growth relationship. A common growth pattern was detected for P. contorta, and two tree-ring width chronologies were constructed. A congruent growth response was found for trees of RBPA and RBT to annual and spring precipitation as well as precipitation in the rainy months. Other climate-growth relationships were detected with other precipitation and temperature variables. Considering that P. contorta is a widespread species, occurring in other Brazilian biomes and forest formations, it is a promising model for developing further dendrochronological research including regional networks of replicated site chronologies, which could facilitate the reconstruction of historical climatic series and predictions of future impacts of climate change in tropical areas.

AB Ants are abundant in most of the world's terrestrial environments. They are energetic, strong for their size, numerous, and socially cooperative. They play many geomorphologically important roles. In particular, they construct mounds and subterranean galleries, create patterned ground, play a role in bioturbation, affect vegetation cover and soil properties (such as infiltration rate) and influence runoff and erosion. They also play roles in biogeochemical cycling and rock and mineral weathering. Here, we review and reanalyse data collected from over 80 studies on ant contributions to geomorphology from around the world. The clearest manifestation of the geomorphological role of ants is found in their various constructions, such as mounds. There can be hundreds or thousands of mounds per hectare, with a median density of 125 ha(-1) recorded in the studies reviewed. The longevity of these features varies and some are stable while others are highly erodible. The construction of mounds and galleries causes bioturbation (pedoturbation), a role which ants share with termites, worms and many mammals. A median rate of 1.5 t ha(-1) a(-1) is derived from the studies reviewed. Ants also produce patterned ground through their effects on vegetation. The relationships between ant activity and runoff and erosion are complex and not consistent. Bioturbation of soil, tunnelling activity, the construction of underground chambers, galleries and macro-pores, the removal and/or accumulation of organic material, and changes in vegetation cover, are all mechanisms by which ants might modify soil infiltration characteristics. Because of their effect on soil infiltration rates, sediment provision and on vegetation cover, ants can have a profound influence on runoff and soil movement on slopes. Only a modest amount of work has been done to investigate the role that ants play in rock weathering. Ants are greatly affected by human activities (especially land cover changes), and some geomorphologically-active species have proved to be highly invasive. The response of ants to future climate changes needs further investigation.

AB Poverty is not only the primary attribute of most developing countries, but also expected to contribute to environmental degradation. With the recent rapid, but yet to be comprehensively developed renewable energy, this study examines the dynamic impact of renewable energy in mitigating the potential adverse effect of poverty on environmental destruction using econometric approaches for developing countries. Empirical results from GMM estimator show that over the period of 2001 and 2014, renewable energy tends to minimize the extent of environmental destruction due to poverty in the full sample of developing countries. The results of sub-samples of several income groups also sharing the same conclusion that environmental degradation increases with increases in poverty, but mitigated with more consumption of renewable energy. Thus, significant expansion and consumption of renewable energy could contribute to reduction in poverty and sustain the environmental quality.

AB Arid ecosystems are strongly limited by water availability, and precipitation plays a major role in the dynamics of all species in arid regions, as well as the ecosystem processes that occur there. However, understanding how biotic interactions mediate long-term responses of dryland ecosystems to rainfall remains very fragmented. We report on a unique large-scale field experiment spanning 25 yr and three trophic levels (plants, small mammal herbivores, predators) in a dryland ecosystem in the northern Chilean Mediterranean Region where we assessed how biotic interactions influence the long-term plant community responses to precipitation. As the most persistent ecological changes in dryland systems may result from changes in the structure, cover, and composition of the perennial vegetation, we emphasized the interplay between bottom-up and top-down controls of perennial plants in our analyses. Rainfall was the primary factor affecting the dynamics of, and interactions among, plants and small mammals. Ephemeral plant cover dynamics closely tracked short-term annual rainfall, but seemed unaffected by top-down controls (herbivory). In contrast, the response of the perennial plant cover to precipitation was mediated by (1) a complex interplay between subtle top-down (herbivory) controls that become more apparent in the long-term, (2) competition with ephemeral plants during wet years, and (3) an indirect effect of predators on subdominant shrubs and perennial herbs. This long-term field experiment highlights how climate-induced responses of arid perennial vegetation are influenced by interactions across trophic levels and temporal scales. In the face of global change, understanding how multi-trophic controls mediate dryland vegetation responses to climate is essential to properly managing the conservation of biodiversity in arid systems.

TI Assembly of rhizosphere microbial communities in Artemisia annua:
   recruitment of plant growth-promoting microorganisms and inter-kingdom
   interactions between bacteria and fungi
SO PLANT AND SOIL
LA English
DT Article
AB Aims Plant roots assemble unique microbial communities in rhizosphere, which are critical for plant adapting to natural environment. Given the pivotal importance of plant-microbe interactions, this study was conducted to uncover the assembly of Artemisia annua on root-associated bacterial and fungal communities and their co-occurrence networks. Methods Soil samples were collected from a field experiment with 7-year plantation of Artemisia annua, including unplanted, bulk and rhizosphere soil. The microbial communities were investigated by amplicon sequencing targeting bacteria and fungi. Results The soil microbiomes were highly diverse among the three treatments. Bacterial and fungal communities were significantly influenced by AP (available phosphorus), AK (available potassium), TOC (total organic carbon), TN (total nitrogen) and WSN (water soluble nitrogen). Two plant growth-promoting bacteria, Sphingomonas and Sphingobium, and the fungal ASVs defined as Saprotroph were dramatically enriched in rhizosphere. Network analysis revealed that Artemisia annua built the less complex root-associated microbial network, compared to unplanted and bulk soils. Specially, the percentage of inter-kingdom interactions between bacteria and fungi increased in rhizosphere network, and showed the highest proportion of negative relationship. Conclusions These results indicate that A. annua could assemble the specific root-associated microbial communities with increased abundance of plant growth promoting microorganisms and build inter-kingdom co-occurrence networks, which may be beneficial for the fitness of plants to natural environment.

AB Ants are the economically important and metropolitan insects on earth. They act as soil engineers, scavengers, decomposers, predators, pollinators and herbivores. The mutualistic relationship between ants and aphids is a very common and widespread phenomenon. It has been studied in various parts of the world. In this relationship, aphids provide food to the ants, while in return ants provide them protection from natural enemies. Ants also protect aphids from different diseases. Aphids (serious crop pests) can be divided into myrmecophilous and non- myrmecophilous. The main objective of this study was to determine trophic associations of ants associated with aphids on various host plants in Pothwar. For this purpose, seven ant species were selected, identified as Camponotus compressus (Fabricius, 1787), Formica fusca Linnaeus, 1758, Formica clara Forel, 1886, Lepisiota frauenfeldi (Mayr, 1855), Myrmica aimonissabaudiae Menozzi, 1939, Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabricius, 1793) and Tetraponera allaborans (Walker, 1859). A lot of surveys were conducted during 2015-17 for the collection of ants associated with aphids on different host plants in different localities of Pothwar region. As a result of surveys, ant-aphid new mutualistic trophic associations were determined like Camponotus compressus with 12, Formica fusca I, Formica clara 2, Lepisiota frauenfeldi 9, Myrmica aimonissabaudiae 4, Tapinoma melanocephalum 11 and Tetraponera allaborans with 1 new association in various localities of Pothwar on different host plants have been reported. All these associations are recorded for the first time from Pakistan. Trophic associations of studied ants with aphids on different host plants, their world distribution and comments on observed new associations have been given. New distribution records of ant's species have also been provided.

AB Plant functional traits play an important role in plant growth and community composition in forest ecosystem. However, how the intraspecific trait variations for both leaf and branch were driven by organ age is less clear. We chose three evergreen coniferous species in the mixed broadleaved-Korean pine (Pines koraiensis) forest in Northeast China and measured the functional traits for leaf and branch across organ ages. We mainly evaluated the influences of needle or branch age on the intraspecific trait (both leaf and branch) variations and bivariate correlation of traits for three species. We found that organ age had the largest contributions to the intraspecific variations in most traits for the three species. Current organ had high specific leaf area, high leaf nitrogen content, high specific branch length and low leaf and branch dry matter content, while perennial organ showed the opposite trend, indicating the differentiation of ecological strategies at different organ ages. The organ age significantly modified most of the trait-trait relationships, indicating that the transformation of the plant ecological strategy was driven by organ age. Unexpectedly, the variation in plant hydraulic traits was not affected by branch age and decoupled with most other traits for the three species. Our results suggest that the organ age effect should be incorporated into future studies of trait-based ecology for evergreen coniferous species.

AB Carbon (C) quality and quantity and nitrogen (N) availability are known to play a crucial role in influencing diazotroph community structure in soils and they are commonly affected by crop residue management and fertilizer application. However, a full understanding of how C and N interactions contribute to shaping soil diazotroph communities remains elusive. An experiment comparing two different C substrates (rice straw vs. glucose) plus low to high rates of mineral N application was conducted in two paddy soils with contrasting pH (pH = 6.05 and 7.85) with Chinese milk vetch (CMV) growth. Soils were sampled during the full blooming stage of CMV and diazotroph community structure was characterized using the nifH marker gene. The results showed that the diazotroph community responded differently to C substrates (straw and glucose) depending upon the C availability. In both soils, mineral N addition decreased nifH gene copy numbers in the straw-included treatments, but not in the glucose-included soils. Compared to the straw-included soils, glucose addition resulted in less alpha-diversity of diazotroph. Meanwhile, diazotroph community structure was clustered into different groups by the C sources, and marginally affected by N levels. These results suggested that the responses of the diazotroph community to N supply were regulated by C availability. Glucose addition decreased the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium compared to straw incorporation (16.0%-25.9% vs. 19.5%-38.2%), but significantly increased the abundance of the second most dominant genus Geobacter (12.8%-23.7% vs. 4.1%-8.7%). In addition, the diazotroph diversity and community structure were less responsive to straw, glucose and mineral N addition in the lower vs. high pH soils. Overall, the results suggest that the responses of diazotrophs to N availability rely on C availability in paddy soils, and that C substrates exert a stronger influence than mineral N application in structuring diazotroph communities.

AB Large mammals that occur in low densities, particularly in the high-altitude areas, are globally threatened due to fragile climatic and ecological envelopes. Among bear species, the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) has a distribution that is restricted to Himalayan highlands with relatively small and fragmented populations. To date, very little scientific information on the Himalayan brown bear, which is vital for the conservation of the species and the management of its habitats, especially in protected areas of the landscape, is available. The present study aims to understand the effectiveness of existing Himalayan Protected Areas in terms of representativeness for the conservation of Himalayan brown bear (HBB), an umbrella species in high-altitude habitats of the Himalayan region. We used the ensemble approach of the species distribution model and then assessed biological connectivity to predict the current and future distribution and movement of HBB in climate change scenarios for the year 2050. Approximately 33 protected areas (PAs) currently possess suitable habitats. Our model suggests a massive decline of approximately 73.38% and 72.87% under 4.5 and 8.5 representative concentration pathway (RCP) respectively in the year 2050 compared with the current distribution. The predicted change in suitability will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs; eight will become completely uninhabitable by the year 2050, followed by loss of connectivity in the majority of PAs. Habitat configuration analysis suggested a 40% decline in the number of suitable patches, a reduction in large habitat patches (up to 50%) and aggregation of suitable areas (9%) by 2050, indicating fragmentation. The predicted change in geographic isotherm will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs, eight of them will become completely inhabitable. Hence, these PAs may lose their effectiveness and representativeness in achieving the very objective of their existence or conservation goals. Therefore, we recommend adaptive spatial planning for protecting suitable habitats distributed outside the PA for climate change adaptation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Anthropogenically modified systems tend to have homogenous wildlife communities. While this process is well documented, the mechanisms driving the convergence of species in human-modified systems are unclear. There are at least two compelling ecological explanations for the loss of specialized species in these settings; changes to the distribution and quality of resources (i.e. environmental conditions) and changes to competitive interactions. Without a better understanding of the mechanisms behind biotic homogenization, it is difficult to take appro-priate conservation and management actions to maintain diverse communities.
   We investigated the roles of environmental conditions and competition in driving biotic homogenization in one of the world's most imperiled ecosystems; the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savanna of the American Southeast. Specifically, we investigated how generalist gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) are replacing the more specialized fox squirrels (S. niger) in shrub and hardwood encroached Southeastern savannas. To test how changes to habitat and competition affect the specialist fox squirrel, we undertook a landscape scale manipu-lation. We experimentally manipulated competition by removing gray squirrels from closed-canopy patches embedded in longleaf pine savanna.
   Fox squirrels showed a strong response to gray squirrel removal, increasing their activity by 300% in the interior of closed-canopy patches. Fox squirrels in control patches did not use the interior of closed-canopy patches.
   Our experimental results support the hypothesis that biotic homogenization occurs when human-induced changes to the environment alter competitive interactions.

AB Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes is a popular tool to address the problem of environmental degradation. However, these projects do not always produce their best outputs due to the inefficiencies of sustainable development policies. Although some sources of inefficiencies cannot be controlled, the implementation of PES systems following the integrated approach (more than one project acting on the same site) is expected to increase their benefits and offer solutions to some of their problems. Moreover, this integration should provide an optimal combination of both short and long-term ecosystem services, ensuring resilience to environmental and social change. This study analyses nine combinations of PES schemes and a Rural Development (RD) project in three regions of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. The focus is to analyse how different schemes can promote a continuous and long-term provision of the ecosystem services targeted by each project, as well to assess how the schemes, in general, can contribute to increasing the socio-ecological resilience of the benefitted area. Desk research and field interviews were conducted to obtain the necessary information to analyse the costs and benefits of the schemes. The data collected has provided us with qualitative information to illustrate the theory behind the project, and people's lived experiences. These outcomes and other socio-economic and environmental parameters were analysed through a Multicriteria Decision Analysis. The paper shows the integrated approaches have offered the best trade-off among the costs and benefits in all regions. At the same time, they have a high potential to ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem services in that area while acting towards a resilient community/environment.

AB Forest gaps are essential small-scale disturbances in forest succession. However, little attention has been paid to the long-term effects of gap dynamics on woody species regeneration and succession. We selected 20 medium and 25 large gaps representing a range of age classes (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 years) from remote-sensing images obtained in 1964, 1976, 1986, 1993, 2003, and 2014 to examine long-term gap regeneration processes in a secondary forest in Northeast China. We conducted field surveys to determine the regeneration status, density index (DI), and richness index (RI) of selected gaps. The importance value (IV) of each woody species was calculated, and all species were classified by shade tolerance. The results showed that in gaps of 0-10 years, the DI and RI were mainly dominated by shade-intolerant species in large gaps and intermediate species in medium gaps. When gap age increased to 10-20 years, the greatest RI was observed in large gaps due to an increase in intermediate species, and the dominant species (IV > 0.1) changed from shrubs to trees (Acer mono). The DI and RI decreased over time in medium gaps, but A. mono remained the dominant species in these gaps. By 20-30 years after gap formation, large gaps showed decreased DI and RI, associated with the exclusion of shade-intolerant and intermediate species, and Tilia amurensis joined the dominant species class. In medium gaps, a decrease in DI was associated with self-thinning among intermediate shade-tolerant species. Once gap age exceeded 30 years, the DI, RI, and dominant species became stable in both large and medium gaps. Our findings indicated that natural gaps can improve the regeneration of late-successional species in secondary forests, especially at the first 30 years. However, there was a barrier in succession of the secondary forests to climax forests relying on natural gap regeneration due to the absence of key species such as Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.). These results can provide a significant reference for close-to-nature management of temperate secondary forests in practice.

AB Ericaceous plants rely on ericoid mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient acquisition. However, the factors that affect the composition and structure of fungal communities associated with the roots of ericaceous plants remain largely unknown. Here, we use a 4.1-million-year (myr) soil chronosequence in Hawaii to test the hypothesis that changes in nutrient availability with soil age determine the diversity and species composition of fungi associated with ericoid roots. We sampled roots of a native Hawaiian plant, Vaccinium calycinum, and used DNA metabarcoding to quantify changes in fungal diversity and community composition. We also used a fertilization experiment at the youngest and oldest sites to assess the importance of nutrient limitation. We found an increase in diversity and a clear pattern of species turnover across the chronosequence, driven largely by putative ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. Fertilization with nitrogen at the youngest site and phosphorus at the oldest site reduced fungal diversity, suggesting a direct role of nutrient limitation. Our results also reveal the presence of novel fungal species associated with Hawaiian Ericaceae and suggest a greater importance of phosphorus availability for communities of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi than is generally assumed.

AB Infauna are an ecologically important component of marine benthic ecosystems and are the most common faunal assemblage used to assess habitat quality. Compared to the shallower waters of the continental shelf, less is known about the benthic fauna from the continental slope, especially how the communities are structured by natural gradients and anthropogenic stressors. The present study was conceived to rectify these data gaps and characterize the natural, baseline structure of the benthic infauna of the upper continental slope (200-100 m) of the Southern California Bight. We aggregated benthic infauna, sediment composition, and sediment chemistry data from different surveys across the Southern California Bight region (750 samples from 347 sites) collected between 1972 and 2016. We defined 208 samples to be in reference condition based upon sediment chemistry and proximity to known anthropogenic disturbances. Cluster analysis of the reference samples was used to identify distinct assemblages and the abiotic characteristics associated with each cluster were then used to define habitat characteristics for each assemblage. Three habitats were identified, delineated by geography, depth, and sediment composition. Across the habitats, there were detectable changes in community composition of the non-disturbed fauna through time. However, the uniqueness of the habitats was persistent, as the fauna from each habitat remained taxonomically distinct from irrespective of the decade of their collection. Within each habitat, subtle, assemblage-scale responses to disturbance could be detected, but no consistent patterns could be identified among the component taxa. As with the non-disturbed samples, there were compositional changes in the fauna of the disturbed samples through time. Despite the changes, fauna from disturbed and non-disturbed samples remained taxonomically distinct from each other within each decade of the dataset. After considering both the spatial and temporal patterns in the fauna of slope ecosystem, it became apparent that there was a high degree of stochasticity in the taxonomic organization of all three habitats. This would suggest that the benthic fauna from these communities may be neutrally organized, which in turn poses interesting challenges for future development of condition assessment tools based upon the benthic fauna in these habitats.

TI Wheat Can Access Phosphorus From Algal Biomass as Quickly and
   Continuously as From Mineral Fertilizer
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article

   efficiency; wheat
AB Algae can efficiently take up excess nutrients from waterways, making them a valuable resource potentially capable of replacing synthesized and mined fertilizers for agriculture. The capacity of algae to fertilize crops has been quantified, but it is not known how the algae-derived nutrients become available to plants. We aimed to address this question: what are the temporal dynamics of plant growth responses to algal biomass? to better propose mechanisms by which plants acquire nutrients from algal biomass and thereby study and promote those processes in future agricultural applications. Data from various sources were transformed and used to reconstruct the nutrient release from the algae Chlorella vulgaris and subsequent uptake by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (as reported in Schreiber et al., 2018). Plants had received 0.1x or 1x dried algae or wet algae, or zero, 0.1x or 1x mineral fertilizer calculated from agricultural practices for P application and grown to 55 days in three soils. Contents of P and other nutrients acquired from algae were as high as from mineral fertilizer, but varied based on moisture content and amount of algae applied to soils (by 55 days after sowing plants with 1x mineral fertilizer and 1x dried algae had 5.6 mg P g DWshoot; 2.2-fold more than those with 0 or 0.1x mineral fertilizer, 0.1x dried algae and wet algae, and 1x wet algae). Absolute and relative leaf area growth and estimated P uptake rates showed similar dynamics, indicating that wheat acquires P from algae quickly. A model proposes that algal fertilizer promotes wheat growth after rapid transformation in soil to inorganic nutrients. We conclude theoretically that phosphorus from algal biomass is available to wheat seedlings upon its application and is released gradually over time with minor differences related to moisture content on application. The growth and P uptake kinetics hint at nutrient forms, including N, and biomass stimulation worthy of research to further exploit algae in sustainable agriculture practices. Temporal resolved phenotype analyses in combination with a mass-balance approach is helpful for understanding resource uptake from recycled and biofertilizer sources by plants.

AB Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is often assumed to be one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides and exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We found that distance- and density-dependent mortality caused by natural enemies was most likely at the seedling stage and was greater at higher mean annual temperatures. Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence at the seedling stage is significantly weakened when fungicides were applied. By contrast, negative conspecific distance- and density-dependence is not a general pattern at the seed stage. High seed mass reduced distance- and density-dependent mortality at the seed stage. Seed studies excluding only large mammals found significant negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality, but exclusion of all mammals resulted in a non-significant effect of conspecifics. Our study suggests that plant pathogens are a major cause of distance- and density-dependent mortality at the seedling stage, while the impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed stage, large and small mammals, respectively, weaken and enhance negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different enemy types and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.

AB Due to its position between the highly distinct Oriental and Australasian biogeographical realms, much effort has been spent demarcating associated separations and transitions in the faunal assemblages of the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Initially, sharp boundary lines were proposed, with the earliest dating from the mid-1800s. Notably, the one published by Alfred R. Wallace in 1863, based upon land-mammal and land-bird distributions, has since achieved iconic status and today its significance is recognized well beyond the confines of the biogeography community. Over the next four decades many such divides were engraved onto plates and inked onto charts of SE Asia using additional information, different organisms or other criteria. However, it became apparent that, as Wallace had noted, all such lines were to some degree permeable, and by the 1880s transition zones were being put forward instead; the label 'Wallacea' was introduced in 1924. Interestingly, the last decade has seen new divides and sub-regions being proposed, some departing markedly from earlier offerings. Although currently there is general agreement regarding much of the terminology associated with both the lines and the areas, the record of publication indicates that this consensus has emerged obliquely, and in some cases is weakly founded. This review does not present new data nor new analyses; rather it summarizes the development of ideas and reflects upon attendant issues that have emerged. After reviewing the key proposals, recommendations are presented that should in future alleviate perceived difficulties or inadequacies. Reference to specific divides must be true to their original definitions; there are many instances where the secondary literature has portrayed them incorrectly and with some this has rippled through into later publications. Moreover, Wallace's 1863 line is not the one that he finally settled upon (in 1910); its path around Sulawesi was transferred from the west to the east of the Island. Ideally, Huxley's divide (1868) should carry his name rather than Wallace's; the latter never accepted the proposition. Lydekker's Line (1896) ought to be labelled the Heilprin-Lydekker Line in recognition of Angelo Heilprin's 1887 contribution. Concerning transition zones, ideally Wallacea should correspond to its original 1924 description, which incorporated the Philippine islands bar the Palawan group. Notably, though, a smaller form (introduced by Darlington in 1957, used frequently from 1998 onwards) in which all of the Philippine islands are excluded is entrenched within the recent literature, but this is often without evident justification. It should also be recognized that the 'reduced' (=southern) Wallacea area was effectively defined by Heilprin in 1887, but was then labelled the 'Austro-Malaysian Transition Zone'. Finally, the application in recent years of modern analytical techniques has not led to a consensus view on where the lines/areas should run/be placed; with such a large, diverse set of organisms, each with differing histories, this is perhaps not surprising.

AB The epigeic fauna, ground surface-dwelling invertebrates that inhabit leaf-litter, acts on multiple soil processes and key ecosystem services and is threatened by global land-use change (LUC). In Brazil, LUC for sugarcane expansion over extensive pasture has been taking place for promoting bioenergy production; however, conventional sugarcane cultivation includes monoculture, periodic soil tillage and agrochemicals may alter the quantity and quality of crop residue inputs, soil habitats and communities of soil fauna. Thus, a field study at three sites in central southern Brazil was conducted to evaluate if the expansion of sugarcane cultivation affects soil epigeic fauna. In each site, we sampled epigeic fauna in areas under LUC from native vegetation to extensive pasture, and from that to sugarcane. The epigeic fauna was collected using pitfall traps and then quantified and classified in taxonomic groups (Order, Class, Family). In addition, as a focal organism group, ants were classified at the species level. Overall, 13 taxonomic groups were identified, in which the Formicidae family was the most abundant group (i.e., 67% of individuals), followed by Diptera (13%), Araneae (5%) and Coleoptera (4%). Land transition from native vegetation to pasture increased fauna abundance by 27% but reduced the diversity of epigeic fauna community by 43%. In contrast, sugarcane expansion over extensive pasture reduced fauna abundance (22%), did not alter the diversity of the invertebrate community at a broad taxonomic level, but decreased species richness of the dominant taxa (ants) by 55%. Ant individuals were classified into 37 species, allowing to verify that sugarcane cultivation over pastures decreased both the abundance and richness of ants and altered community composition. Ant species Ectatomma brunneum were more sensitive to LUC and, therefore, could be characterized as potential indicators of disturbed environments. We demonstrate that sugarcane expansion over pasturelands reduces the total abundance of the soil epigeic fauna, and that effects on fauna diversity vary from broad to fine taxonomic resolutions. Further studies are needed to evaluate if the declines in fauna abundance and ant species richness impair specific soil functions and soil-related ecosystem services.

AB As some intertidal biota presently live near their upper tolerable thermal limits when emersed, predicted hotter temperatures and an increased frequency of extreme-heat events associated with global climate change may challenge the survival and persistence of such species. To predict the biological ramifications of climate change on rocky seashores, ecologists have collected baseline rock temperature data, which has shown substrate temperature is heterogenous in the rocky intertidal zone. A multitude of factors may affect rock temperature, although the potential roles of boulder surface (upper versus lower), lithology (rock type) and minerology have been largely neglected to date. Consequently, a common-garden experiment using intertidal boulders of six rock types tested whether temperature characteristics differed among rock types, boulder surfaces, and whether temperature characteristics were associated with rock mineralogy. The temperature of the upper and lower surfaces of all six rock types was heterogeneous at the millimetre to centimetre scale. Three qualitative patterns of temperature difference were identified on boulder surfaces: gradients; mosaics; and limited heterogeneity. The frequency of occurrence of these temperature patterns was heavily influenced by cloud cover. Upper surfaces were generally hotter than lower surfaces, plus purple siltstone and grey siltstone consistently had the hottest temperatures and white limestone and quartzite the coolest. Each rock type had unique mineralogy, with maximum temperatures correlated with the highest metallic oxide and trace metal content of rocks. These baseline data show that rock type, boulder surface and mineralogy all contribute to patterns of heterogenous substrate temperature, with the geological history of rocky seashores potentially influencing the future fate of species and populations under various climate change scenarios.

AB Wildfire is a natural process in Brazilian savannas, but human activities alter fire regimes and threaten biodiversity. In this study, we used an ecoacoustics approach to assess fauna responses and recovery after wildfire in a Brazilian savanna Six passive acoustic monitoring devices were used to record soundscapes before and after a wildfire a at burned and non-burned sites for one year and one month (September 2012 to September 2013). Power Spectral Density and the Acoustic Complexity Index were used to track biophony. Before the fire, the two sites had similar biophonic patterns (PSD: T = 1136, Z = 1.52, P = 0.12; ACI: T = 1117, Z = 1.10, P = 0.26) and soniferous species richness (Site 1 = 52 and Site 2 = 49). However, in the first two sessions of recordings after the tire, biophony became higher at the burned site during the day (PSD: T = 211 and 233; Z = 4.13 and 6.41; ACI: T = 120 and 469, Z = 5.14 and 7.07; all P < 0.00). During the night, biophony was usually higher at the non-burned site until May 2013 (PSD: T = 0 to 453; Z = 3.30 to 5.90; ACI: T= 333 to 491, Z = 3.80 to 4.93; all P < 0.00). Biophony became similar (P = 0.17 to 0.38) at the two sites or higher (P = 0.00 to 0.01) at the burned site from July to September 2013 (PSD: T = 55 to 1167; Z = 1.35 to 6.89; ACI: T = 719 to 1365, Z = 0.87 to 3.04). After the fire, a reduction of soniferous species at the burned site was observed for insects and bats. Both biophonic activity and soniferous species showed a tendency to recover one year after the fire, but there were still less species in September 2013 (non-burned = 43 and burned = 37) when compared to September 2012 at both sites (Site 1 = 52 and Site 2 = 49). Our results showed that changes in the natural regimes of fire can negatively impact the biodiversity and reinforce the need for monitoring protocols and inspection of wildfires.

AB Meeting rising demand for oil palm whilst minimizing the loss of tropical biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions is a core conservation challenge. One potential solution is focusing the expansion of high-yielding crops on presently low-yielding farmlands alongside protecting nearby tropical forests that can enhance provision of ecosystem functions. A key question is how this solution would impact invertebrate functional diversity. We focus on oil palm in the Colombian Llanos, where plantations are replacing improved cattle pastures and forest fragments, and on dung beetles, which play key functional roles in nutrient cycling and secondary seed dispersal. We show that functional richness and functional diversity of dung beetles is greater in oil palm than in cattle pasture, and that functional metrics did not differ between oil palm and remnant forest. The abundance-size class profile of dung beetles in oil palm was more similar to forest than to pasture, which had lower abundances of the smallest and largest dung beetles. The abundance of tunneling and rolling dung beetles did not differ between oil palm and forest, while higher forest cover increased the abundance of diurnal and generalist-feeding beetles in oil palm landscapes. This suggests that prioritizing agricultural development on low-yielding cattle pasture will have positive effects on functional diversity and highlights the need for forest protection to maintain ecosystem functioning within agricultural landscapes.

DE Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Biodiversity; Ecosystem stability;

AB Background and aims Nutrient resource utilization is essential for plant community composition and productivity. Previous studies found that an increase in resource diversity causes species losses and reduces plant diversity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can increase plant productivity and nutrient uptake, however, whether AM fungi can reduce the negative influence of nutrient resource diversity on plant composition is still not well understood.
   Methods A microcosm experiment was conducted with four phosphorus (P) sources (at five levels of P resource diversity) and two AM fungal species, and the plant community composition, aboveground biomass, and P content were measured and calculated.
   Results Plant species diversity and richness decreased with increasing soil P resource diversity in the absence of AM fungi, while the decrease was less when AM fungi were present. The biomass and P content of the aboveground plants increased with increasing AM fungal diversity and soil P resource diversity. The results of a structural equation model suggest that AM fungi could reduce the negative effects of increasing P resource diversity on plant community composition by improving plant density and P uptake.
   Conclusions Our results indicate that AM fungi can maintain higher plant species diversity and increase plant productivity by increasing P resource utilization efficiency.

AB Aims For plants, elemental nutrients are important belowground resources that sustain growth and survival. To understand how tropical plant nutrient status responds to environmental variation, we asked whether concentrations of nutrients in root and leaf tissues track gradients in soil nutrient concentrations and if tissue nutrient concentrations respond independently or in concert to soil nutrient concentrations. Methods We measured soil nutrient concentrations of rhizosphere soil and root and leaf tissue elemental concentrations of saplings from 14 Angiosperm families in montane tropical forest of Jianfengling, China. Using mixed-effects models, we modeled the nutrient concentration of plant tissues as a function of soil resources. Results Of fourteen elements measured, seven -nitrogen, boron, phosphorus, potassium, manganese, copper and zinc- increased in concentrations in root and leaf tissues with higher soil nutrient availability; two decreased -aluminum and carbon; three were invariant -magnesium, sulfur, and calcium; and two -sodium and iron- showed contrasting patterns between leaves and roots. Eight elements necessary to leaf physiological function, but also used in root functioning -nitrogen, boron, magnesium phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, manganese- were more concentrated in leaves than roots. Additionally, most elements showed tradeoffs in concentrations between roots and leaves. Plant lineage (i.e. family) explained very little of the variation about this overall trend. Conclusions Overall, increases in tissue nutrient concentrations with soil fertility were subtle if present at all. Thus, we conclude that tissue nutrients of juvenile tropical trees have a high degree of elemental homeostasis with local-scale soil nutrient content in Jianfengling.

AB Vegetation formations are undergoing constant floristic and structural change over time and space. Assessing these changes represents an important step to understand the effects of disturbances and propose ecosystem conservation and management strategies. We still lack, however, information on the dynamics of the woody vegetation in Cerrado Rupestre (rupestrian Cerrado-RC) formations over time, which comprise important refuge of the vegetation of the Brazilian Savanna and occur on rocky outcrops, which are considered restrictive environments. In this context, we describe the changes in floristic composition, richness, species diversity and structure of vegetation in RC over 12-year and link patterns to the disturbances that occur in the area-wildfire and cattle presence. We gathered data from three surveys conducted in RC in the Pireneus State Park (PSP), Goias, Brazil. We also registered hot pixels inside the study area and in the PSP neighboring area indicating presence of bovine and equine cattle in the Park. Disturbances, occurrence of wildfires, and presence of cattle promoted changes in vegetation structure, with a decrease in the number of small individuals, but not in diversity parameters. The increase in richness, evenness and diversity, even under the effect of disturbances, demonstrates the resilience of the RC. However, if these disturbances keep occurring, resilience will be compromised, with clearer changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure, according to what we proposed in a theoretical model describing the synergistic influence of cattle presence, exotic grass and wildfires on the dynamics of the Cerrado Rupestre.

AB Top-down and bottom-up forces determine ecosystem function and dynamics. Fisheries as a top-down force can shorten and destabilize food webs, while effects driven by climate change can alter the bottom-up forces of primary productivity. We assessed the response of a highly-resolved intertidal food web to these two global change drivers, using network analysis and bioenergetic modelling. We quantified the relative importance of artisanal fisheries as another predator species, and evaluated the independent and combined effects of fisheries and changes in plankton productivity on food web dynamics. The food web was robust to the loss of all harvested species but sensitive to the decline in plankton productivity. Interestingly, fisheries dampened the negative impacts of decreasing plankton productivity on non-harvested species by reducing the predation pressure of harvested consumers on non-harvested resources, and reducing the interspecific competition between harvested and non-harvested basal species. In contrast, the decline in plankton productivity increased the sensitivity of harvested species to fishing by reducing the total productivity of the food web. Our results show that strategies for new scenarios caused by climate change are needed to protect marine ecosystems and the wellbeing of local communities dependent on their resources.

AB Mammals figure prominently in tropical ecology because of their role in seed dispersal, herbivore control, and nutrient cycling. Urbanization is a conservation concern for mammals not only because of lost habitat, but also other negative impacts such as illegal hunting and pollution. Some mammals are resilient to urbanization and can persist in degraded habitats; however, this has not been studied in many tropical sites. We used camera traps to study mammals in Peperpot Nature Park (PNP), a secondary forest located 5 km from the capital of Suriname, and compared it to the large Central Suriname Nature Reserve (CSNR). We found fewer species in PNP (20) compared to CSNR (30), however, PNP included apex predators and species of conservation concern, and the two sites had a similar relative abundance of large cats and most mesocarnivores. Smaller mammal species had higher relative abundance at PNP while larger herbivores were scarce or absent, likely from poaching, as PNP is still connected to interior forests. The detection models revealed that the park, the camera trap was set in, was the most common significant factor for most species, suggesting that broader landscape level effects are important. In occupancy models, the null model was the most common top model across species, but then followed by park. Despite fewer species being detected than in large protected areas, the presence of some species in PNP which are historically absent in developed areas shows promise for small urban tropical forests to support robust mammal communities, provided they maintain some connectivity to larger source habitats.

AB Our research is the most comprehensive study of jaguar behavior ecology in Mexico. By analyzing and describing the movements and use of the space, as well as the interactions among individual jaguars, we can better understand their behavioral differences, habitat use, and home range. This type of information is critical for the development and implementation of effective and appropriate conservation strategies. We identified home range size for 14 jaguars in a 13-year period and described the interspecific relations and use of space by the percentages of overlap of the territories between individuals. Collectively, the average home range size was larger than 200 km(2), ranging from 48 to 633 km(2) and averaging 296 km(2) for males varied and 37-435 km(2), with an average of 148 km(2), for females. However, home range sizes did not differ significantly among males or females. Male territory overlapped about 3.3% on average (range 2.5-15.5%), suggesting that most of the time males avoid each other. Average overlap of female territory was 12%, ranging from 7 to 100%. Males share an average of 18% (range 2-56%) of its territory and with up to five females, suggesting that a given male may be related to all of them at certain periods of time. There were no seasonal changes (dry and rainy seasons) in home range sizes for both male and females. Our research is an important contribution to the ecological information essential for landscape-level conservation plans for the protection of the jaguars and the biological diversity of the wider Yucatan Peninsula in which they inhabit.

AB 1. Large areas of highly productive tropical forests occur on weathered soils with low concentrations of available phosphorus (P). In such forests, root and microbial production of acid phosphatase enzymes capable of mineralizing organic phosphorus is considered vital to increasing available P for plant uptake.
   2. We measured both root and soil phosphatase throughout depth and alongside a variety of root and soil factors to better understand the potential of roots and soil biota to increase P availability and to constrain estimates of the biochemical mineralization within ecosystem models.
   3. We measured soil phosphatase down to 1 m, root phosphatase to 30 cm, and collected data on fine-root mass density, specific root length, soil P, bulk density, and soil texture using soil cores in four tropical forests within the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico.
   4. We found that soil phosphatase decreased with soil depth, but not root phosphatase. Furthermore, when both soil and root phosphatase were expressed per soil volume, soil phosphatase was 100-fold higher that root phosphatase.
   5. Both root and soil factors influenced soil and root phosphatase. Soil phosphatase increased with fine-root mass density and organic P, which together explained over 50% of the variation in soil phosphatase. Over 80% of the variation in root phosphatase per unit root mass was attributed to specific root length (positive correlation) and available (resin) P (negative correlation).
   6. Synthesis: Fine-root traits and soil P data are necessary to understand and represent soil and root phosphatase activity throughout the soil column and across sites with different soil conditions and tree species. These findings can be used to parameterize or benchmark estimates of biochemical mineralization in ecosystem models that contain fine-root biomass and soil P distributions throughout depth.

AB Tropical forests have been focused for mitigating climate change impact through carbon sequestration in plant biomass under clean development mechanism (CDM). Since trees represent more than 98% of the above ground plant biomass, variation in tree growth rate drives carbon dynamics in tropical forests. By using tree-ring analysis, trait-based measurements, and field observations, we aimed at understanding the drivers of growth rate variation in four South Asian tropical moist forest tree species varying in plant functional types. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that mainly demographic and wood traits represented the first axis explaining 37% of the variance, whereas the second axis was represented by the leaf traits. Stem growth rate (DI) showed a nonlinear negative relation with competition index (CI) and the ratio of crown surface area to basal area (CBR) in three out of four tree species (p < 0.001) except Lagerstroemia speciosa which showed no significant relationship with any of the studied variables. DI was linearly positively related with light interception index (LI) and the ratio of sapwood area to heartwood area (SHR) in the shade intolerant Magnolia champaca and Toona ciliata (p < 0.001). Sap wood area (SA) had a strong positive effect on DI in the three species (p < 0.001). Taking tree size as a random factor and thus accounting for ontogenetic effects on tree growth, linear mixed effect modelling revealed that CI, SA and SHR are the best predictors of DI in M. champaca (AIC = 25.81, R-m(2) = 0.81) and T. ciliata (AIC = 62.95, R-m(2) = 0.61). In C. tabularis, CI, SA and CBR included in the best model predicting DI (AIC = 94.62, R-m(2) = 0.55). Variance partitioning analysis showed that the highest pure effect was observed in C. tabularis contributed by CI (12%), while the highest joint effect was found in M. champaca contributed by CI, SA and SHR (40%). Our analyses suggest that competition by neighbouring trees especially for soil moisture and the amount of active xylem portion are the main drivers of tree growth in moist tropical forests. Since tree growth rates regulate forest carbon dynamics, the insights into the growth drivers of the four selected species revealed by the study have important implications for forest/plantation management with a focus on carbon storage under CDM.

AB The investigation of ecological processes that maintain species coexistence is revealing in naturally disturbed environments such as the white-sand tropical forest, which is subject to periodic flooding that might pose strong habitat filtering to tree species. Congeneric species are a good model to investigate the relative importance of ecological processes that maintain high species diversity because they tend to exploit the same limiting resources and/or have similar tolerance limits to the same environmental conditions due to their close phylogenetic relationship. We aim to find evidence for the action and relative importance of different processes hypothesized to maintain species coexistence in a white-sand flooded forest in Brazil, taking advantage of data on the detailed spatial structure of populations of congeneric species. Individuals of three Myrcia species were tagged, mapped, and measured for diameter at soil height in a 1-ha plot. We also sampled seven environmental variables in the plot. We employed several spatial point process models to investigate the possible action of habitat filtering, interspecific competition, and dispersal limitation. Habitat filtering was the most important process driving the local distribution of the three Myrcia species, as they showed associations, albeit of different strength, to environmental variables related to flooding. We did not detect spatial patterns, such as spatial segregation and smaller size of nearby neighbors, that would be consistent with interspecific competition among the three congeneric species and other co-occurring species. Even though congeners were spatially independent, they responded to differences in the environment. Last, dispersal limitation only led to spatial associations of different size classes for one of the species. Given that white-sand flooded forests are highly threatened in Brazil, the preservation of their different habitats is of utmost importance to the maintenance of high species richness, as flooding drives the distribution of species in the community.

AB The current study is aimed at investigating the effect of edaphic factors on the distribution and abundance of ants in different habitats of the central areas of Iran, while considering the vegetation. During 2018 to 2019, 20 stations from four habitats, including deserts, mountainous and submontane, plains and rural areas and urban areas, were selected. In general, a total of 311 sample units were collected from all the stations, out of which, 32 species belonging to 13 genera, nine tribes and three subfamilies were identified. The biological distribution and abundance of species were argued by computing the physical and chemical parameters of the soil, such as salinity, pH, total nitrogen, organic carbon, calcium and vegetation. The present study has demonstrated that the calcium content significantly affects the species richness of ants, although the impact of this element on various genera is different. We found that increasing in the abundance and richness of plant species has a positive impact on the abundance and richness of ants. Our results also show that some genera are meaningfully adaptable to a variety of habitats. In Kahak station, which is an urban habitat, with enormous diversity, 14 species were found, while in Sadrabad Historic Karvansara, a desert habitat, only Cataglyphis lividus (Andre, 1881) was collected. Cataglyphis bellicosus (Karavaiev, 1924), as the most abundant species, collected from 12 stations, was the most dominant species.

AB Survival and growth of forest tree seedlings are influenced by many abiotic and biotic forces that may vary across space and time. The simultaneous influences of habitat heterogeneity, temporal environmental variability (including disturbance regimes), and biotic interactions are difficult to disentangle, yet understanding the relative importance of these factors for tree seedling dynamics is critical for conservation of forest biodiversity. Most long term, spatially explicit studies of tree seedling ecology have been set in the tropics; much less attention has been given to tree seedlings in temperate forests. We monitored the survival of over 3000 individual seedlings over an eight-year period in a temperate forest in northeast Wisconsin, USA. Results from four seedling censuses demonstrated that both conspecific density and environmental variables significantly affected seedling survival. Higher densities of conspecific trees consistently reduced the probability of seedling survival over time. At the community level, relatively common species were negatively influenced by neighboring conspecific trees and exhibited higher per capita and per basal area mortality. The negative impacts of high conspecific tree density were most pronounced in areas of higher light and moisture, but these interactions varied over time, as did the importance of other abiotic variables. Patterns of less common species were more clearly explained by abiotic variables, with shifting relevance of specific variables according to species abundance. Conspecific negative density dependence, which interacts with resource gradients, and habitat conditions that shift over time are influencing community composition in this northern temperate forest.

AB State and local governments consider payment for ecosystem services (PES) a valuable tool for watershed protection. However, regional differences in PES policies, which significantly influence province-scale cooperation, have been seldom documented. The interrelationships among these policies directly affect overall PES development in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). Textual analysis was used to categorize the content of PES policies in 11 provinces from 2004 to 2018. Then, we assessed these PES policies with four indicators (i.e., policy intensity, interdepartmental coordination, diversity, and duration). Finally, we analyzed the impact factors of these regional differences. The results showed that the number of PES policies increased yearly, reaching a peak in 2017. Provinces in the upper reaches had the highest policy-intensity score (7.38), followed by downstream provinces (6.39) and provinces in the middle reaches (4.52). Regarding interdepartmental coordination, the downstream areas exhibited the most interdepartment interaction (27.92%), followed by the upstream areas (20.76%) and the middle areas (19.18%). Diversity in the middle reaches was the highest (scored 4.3) while the upstream area exhibited the lowest diversity value (3.25). Downstream provinces issued PES policies the earliest, with a duration 5.52 years, followed by the upstream provinces (4.68) and middle provinces (4.28). Policy intensity was significantly correlated with fixed-asset investment, solid-waste generation, and population. The results suggest that PES in the YREB needs to be strengthened by enhancing policy consistency. In this regard, identifying regional differences in PES policies can help improve the coordination of PES policies for the whole YREB.

AB Tropical forests are the main reservoirs for global biodiversity and climate control. As secondary forests are now more widespread than primary forests, understanding their functioning and role in the biosphere is increasingly important. This includes understanding how they achieve stability, how they accumulate species and build biodiversity and how they cycle nutrients and carbon. This study investigates how we can restore tropical secondary forests to resemble high biomass, highly biodiverse and stable ecosystems seen today only in primary, undisturbed forests. The study used historic aerial photographs and recent high-resolution satellite images from 1945 to 2014 to map forest patches with five age categories, from 14-years to over 70-years, in Hong Kong's degraded tropical landscape. A forest inventory comprising 28 quadrats provided a rare opportunity to relate patterns of species composition at different stages during the succession with topographic and soil characteristics. The topographic variables accounted for 15% of the variance in species abundance, and age of forest stands explained 29%. Species richness rapidly increased after the first 15 years, but was lower in old-growth, than in medium age forest. This is attributed to the inability of late-successional species to disperse into the young forests as the natural dispersal agents (birds, mammals) have been lost. Light-loving pioneers which are unable to tolerate the shade of older forests, cannot regenerate in their own shade, therefore species diversity declines after a few decades. For ecosystem restoration in tropical secondary forests, introduction of late-successional species is necessary to assist natural succession, given the absence of native fauna, seed dispersal agents, and the surrounding altered environment. We also show that remote sensing can play a pivotal role in understanding the recovery and functioning of secondary forest regeneration as its contribution to the biosphere is increasingly important.

AB Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) is a disease with high human lethality rates, whose transmission risk is directly related to the abundance of reservoir rodents. In the Brazilian Atlantic forest, the main reservoirs species, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Necromys lasiurus, are thought to increase in abundance with deforestation. Therefore, forest restoration may contribute to decrease HCPS transmission risk, a topic still unexplored, especially in tropical regions. Aiming at filling this research gap, we quantified the potential of forest restoration, as required by the current environmental legislation, to reduce the abundance of Hantavirus reservoir rodents in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Using a dataset on small mammal communities sampled at 104 sites, we modeled how the abundance of these two rodent species change with the percentage of forest cover and forest edge density. From the best model, we extrapolated rodent abundance to the entire Atlantic Forest, considering two scenarios: current and restored forest cover. Comparing the estimated abundance between these two scenarios, we show that forest restoration can reduce the abundance of O. nigripes up to 89.29% in 43.43% of Atlantic forest territory. For N. lasiurus, abundance decreased up to 46% in 44% of the Atlantic forest. To our knowledge, this is the first study linking forest restoration and zoonotic diseases. Our results indicate that forest restoration would decrease the chance of HCPS transmission in similar to 45% of the Atlantic forest, making the landscape healthier to similar to 2,8 million people livingwithin this area. This positive effect of restoration on disease regulation should be considered as an additional argument to encourage and promote forest restoration in tropical areas around the world.

AB Half a century ago, Janzen and Connell hypothesized that the high tree species diversity in tropical forests is maintained by specialized natural enemies. Along with other mechanisms, these can cause conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and thus maintain species diversity. Numerous studies have measured proxies of CNDD worldwide, but doubt about its relative importance remains. We find ample evidence for CNDD in local populations, but methodological limitations make it difficult to assess if CNDD scales up to control community diversity and thereby local and global biodiversity patterns. A combination of more robust statistical methods, new study designs, and eco-evolutionary models are needed to provide a more definite evaluation of the importance of CNDD for geographic variation in plant species diversity.

AB The summer of 2017 in the Calabria Region (South Italy) was an exceptional wildfire season with the largest area burned by wildfires in the last 11 years (2008-2019). The equivalent black carbon (EBC) and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements, recorded at the high-altitude Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Monte Curcio (MCU) regional station, were analyzed to establish the wildfires' impact on air quality, human health, and the ecosystem. A method was applied to identify the possible wildfires that influenced the air quality based on the integration of fire data (both satellite and ground-based) and the high-resolution WRF-HYSPLIT trajectories. The satellite-based fires applied to WRF-HYSPLIT with 10 km of spatial resolution allowed us to establish that for 52.5% of total cases, wildfires were located outside the Calabria Region, and they were influenced by long-range transport. Nonetheless, the impact on human health, qualitatively evaluated in terms of passively smoked cigarettes (PSC) corresponding to the EBC, was greater when wildfires were local. Indeed, for wildfires located mainly in Calabria, the equivalent PSC ranged from 2.75 to 11.08. This maximum PSC value was close to the daily number of smoked cigarettes in Calabria (approximately 12.4). Even if this analogy does not imply a proportional effect between the estimated number of cigarettes smoked and the effective wildfire EBC exposure, this result suggests that wildfire emissions may have negative effects on people's health. Moreover, a focus on the Calabria Region was conducted using high-resolution ground-based GPS and higher resolution WRF-HYSPLIT back-trajectories (2 km) to measure wildfires. The validity of the methodology was confirmed by the EBC and CO positive correlation with the ratio between the identified ground-based burned areas and the distance from the sampling station. Moreover, the impact on the ecosystem was studied by analyzing the land vegetation loss due to the wildfires that contributed to air quality reduction at the MCU station. A total of more than 1679 ha of vegetation burned, the main losses comprising forests and shrubland. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION

DT Article
DE Tropical forest fragments; Defaunation; Ecological resilience; Urban
   nature reserves
AB Forest fragments are increasingly common in the tropics as pristine forests are cleared. Fragments stranded within cities are especially stress-prone due to their greatly altered environment and high human impacts. We review biodiversity and ecological studies from Bukit Timah, a tropical forest fragment in Singapore, to ask how this forest has contributed to our understanding of tropical ecology and fragmentation effects, and list the conservation values of this forest. Evidence from Amazonian fragments predicts that losses in diversity and forest function follow fragmentation, and although Bukit Timah has adhered to some of those predictions, other aspects of the forest appeared remarkably resilient. As might be expected, declines in plant, invertebrate, bird, and mammal diversity occurred not only historically but also across two surveys made about 20 years apart. In other ways Bukit Timah proved surprising. Aboveground biomass fluctuated but did not plummet drastically, and was comparable to levels found in primary forests in the region. The extirpation of large fauna did not appear to reduce the dispersal of large seeded plant species, likely due to continued dispersal by small-mammals and birds. Exotic tree species are confined to recovering secondary forest fringes and do not threaten the primary forest, except for perhaps shade tolerant Par ' a rubber and a handful of cultivated fruit trees. Studies of birds and plants found that life history differences could account for differences in genetic connectivity or isolation for different species, with population genetic implications for other taxa. Despite being a small fragment, new species of plants and animals continue to be discovered or re-discovered. Clearly, there are reasons to celebrate Bukit Timah as a forest fragment that withstood two centuries of human impacts. Nonetheless, many measures can be implemented to better secure its future.

AB Global warming, extreme climate events, earthquakes and their accompanying socioeconomic disasters pose significant risks to humanity. Yet due to the nonlinear feedbacks, multiple interactions and complex structures of the Earth system, the understanding and, in particular, the prediction of such disruptive events represent formidable challenges to both scientific and policy communities. During the past years, the emergence and evolution of Earth system science has attracted much attention and produced new concepts and frameworks. Especially, novel statistical physics and complex networks based techniques have been developed and implemented to substantially advance our knowledge of the Earth system, including climate extreme events, earthquakes and geological relief features, leading to substantially improved predictive performances. We present here a comprehensive review on the recent scientific progress in the development and application of how combined statistical physics and complex systems science approaches such as critical phenomena, network theory, percolation, tipping points analysis, and entropy can be applied to complex Earth systems. Notably, these integrating tools and approaches provide new insights and perspectives for understanding the dynamics of the Earth systems. The overall aim of this review is to offer readers the knowledge on how statistical physics concepts and theories can be useful in the field of Earth system science. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB As humanity continues to alter the environment extensively, comprehending the effect of anthropogenic disturbances on the health, survival, and fitness of wildlife is a crucial question for conservation science. Many primate populations occupy suboptimal habitats prone to diverse anthropogenic disturbances that may be sources of acute and chronic stress. Quantification of glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations has repeatedly been used to explore the impact of disturbances on physiological stress. Although it is still debated, prolonged elevation of GC levels may impair reproduction, growth, and immune system activity of individuals. We quantified the effect of anthropogenic disturbances on physiological stress in primates with a global meta-analysis based on data from 26 articles, covering 24 distinct species in 13 different countries. Anthropogenic disturbances were classified into 6 distinct categories: habitat loss, habitat degradation, ongoing logging, hunting, tourism, and other human activities. We calculated effect sizes (Hedges' g) with the standardized mean difference in GC concentrations between primates affected by human activity and their undisturbed conspecifics. We ran random-effects models and subgroup analyses to estimate the overall effect as well as a cumulative effect size for each disturbance category. Overall, primates inhabiting sites subject to anthropogenic disturbances exhibited significantly higher GC levels (g = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.28-0.93). Habitat loss and hunting were overall associated with increased GC concentrations, whereas the cumulative effects of the other disturbances were not statistically significant. Biologically, high GC levels may increase fitness by enabling individuals to overcome the challenges linked to anthropogenic disturbances. However, primates in disturbed environments may have sustained elevated GC levels. To strengthen future research, it is necessary to control confounding factors systematically (e.g., diet, reproductive status, predatory pressure, and resource availability) and improve understanding of the link between GC levels and the health, fitness, and survival of animals.

AB This study presents the results of over 6 years (11/2011-12/2017) of energy and water flux measurements on the first eddy covariance site in Vietnam, in a mature tropical moist forest under monsoon climate. The dry season, lasting approximately four months, has strong interannual variations. Six-year average precipitation and evapotranspiration amounted to 2518 +/- 253 mm and 1519 +/- 105 mm per year, respectively, and net radiation total was 4897 +/- 145 MJ m(-2) per year. On average, the evapotranspiration increased from 3.64 +/- 1.02 mm d(-1) in a dry season to 4.65 +/- 1.02 mm d(-1) in a wet season, in parallel with a slight counterintuitive increase in net radiation, from 5.44 +/- 1.20 mm d(-1) to 5.70 +/- 1.40 mm d(-1) (equivalent water layer that evaporates using the relevant energy). In the driest months, evapotranspiration remained at a level of 60-80 mm per month in spite of nearly absent precipitation. Sensible heat increased in the second half of a dry season. The Bowen ratio was small in a wet season, increased to 1.0 in dry months, while it reached 2.2 in the anomalously hot conditions of April 2016. The average ratio of daily latent heat to daily net radiation in dry and wet season equalled to 68.9 +/- 21.4% and 83.0 +/- 8.5%, respectively. The energy balance closure in different years varied from 77.2 to 82.4% and was better in the hottest months. Canopy stomatal conductance fell sharply in hot-dry conditions and restricted evapotranspiration. Stomata' regulation of evapotranspiration occurred during three to five months depending on the severity of the dry season; however, in a wet season, evapotranspiration was fully dependent on net radiation and evapotranspiration occurred as a passive response to atmospheric demand.

AB Dung beetles are frequently used to assess tropical biodiversity patterns and recovery in human-modified forests. We conducted a comprehensive dung beetle survey (coprophagous and necrophagous communities) within five habitat types, across a land-use gradient, in the ecologically biodiverse Osa Peninsula, located in Costa Rica's south Pacific.
   In addition to assessing species richness, abundance, and biomass, we also assessed community level traits and species-specific responses using a generalised joint attribute modelling approach.
   We found that under favourable conditions (40-50 years of regeneration, close proximity to contiguous old-growth forest and control of poaching), secondary rainforest recovered similar levels of species richness, and key traits of old-growth forest dung beetle communities. However, at the community-level, dung beetle abundance, richness, biomass, and diversity varied between habitat types of different anthropogenic disturbance and land-use.
   Generally, the carrion beetle community did not recover as well as the dung beetle community and the abundance of dung beetles was a third lower in naturally regenerating secondary forest compared with old growth. Regenerating secondary growth and plantation forests showed community compositions similar to old growth forests, while open and fragmented habitats had degraded and impoverished levels of dung beetle biodiversity.
   Overall, the levels of dung-beetle biodiversity detected are encouraging for naturally regenerating secondary forest, suggesting a high potential value of these areas to buffer the pressure of deforestation and habitat alteration on remaining old-growth tropical forests.

AB Biological invasions are a leading cause of global change, yet their long-term effects remain hard to predict. Invasive species can remain abundant for long periods of time, or exhibit population crashes that allow native communities to recover. The abundance and impact of nonnative species may also be closely tied to temporally variable habitat characteristics. We investigated the long-term effects of habitat fragmentation and invasion by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) by resurveying ants in 40 scrub habitat fragments in coastal southern California that were originally sampled 21 yr ago. At a landscape scale, fragment area, but not fragment age or Argentine ant mean abundance, continued to explain variation in native ant species richness; the species-area relationship between the two sample years did not differ in terms of slope or intercept. At local scales, over the last 21 yr we detected increases in the overall area invaded (+36.7%, estimated as the proportion of occupied traps) and the relative abundance of the Argentine ant (+121.95%, estimated as mean number of workers in pitfall traps). Argentine ant mean abundance also increased inward from urban edges in 2017 compared to 1996. The greater level of penetration into fragments likely reduced native ant richness by eliminating refugia for native ants in fragments that did not contain sufficient interior area. At one fragment where we sampled eight times over the last 21 yr, Argentine ant mean abundance increased over time while the diversity of native ground-foraging ants declined from 14 to 4 species. Notably, native species predicted to be particularly sensitive to the combined effect of invasion and habitat loss were not detected at any sites in our recent sampling, including the army ant genus Neivamyrmex. Conversely, two introduced ant species (Brachymyrmex patagonicus and Pheidole flavens) that were undetected in 1996 are now common and widespread at our sites. Our results indicate that behaviorally and numerically dominant invasive species can maintain high densities and suppress native diversity for extended periods.

AB The extinction of megafauna in the Neotropics is thought to have reduced the potential of large seeds to be dispersed over long distances by endozoochory (ingestion by animals), but some seed dispersal systems have not been considered. We describe the role of oilbirds (Steatornis caripensis) as seed dispersers, in terms of seed width and dispersal distance (using GPS tracking devices), and we compare with data reported for other animals. Oilbirds dispersed seeds up to 29 mm wide, with a mean dispersal distance of 10.1 km (range 0-47.6 km). Some components of seed dispersal by oilbirds are outliers compared to that of other frugivores, such as the relationship between maximum seed width and body weight (however, few other extant specialized frugivores are also outliers). Estimates of mean dispersal distance by oilbirds are the largest reported, and we confirm that some living frugivores currently fulfil roles of seed dispersers and ecosystem services previously assumed to be only performed by extinct species.

AB Logging and habitat conversion create hotter microclimates in tropical forest landscapes, representing a powerful form of localised anthropogenic climate change. It is widely believed that these emergent conditions are responsible for driving changes in communities of organisms found in modified tropical forests, although the empirical evidence base for this is lacking.
   Here we investigated how interactions between the physiological traits of genera and the environmental temperatures they experience lead to functional and compositional changes in communities of ants, a key organism in tropical forest ecosystems.
   We found that the abundance and activity of ant genera along a gradient of forest disturbance in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, was defined by an interaction between their thermal tolerance (CTmax) and environmental temperature. In more disturbed, warmer habitats, genera with high CTmax had increased relative abundance and functional activity, and those with low CTmax had decreased relative abundance and functional activity.
   This interaction determined abundance changes between primary and logged forest that differed in daily maximum temperature by a modest 1.1 degrees C, and strengthened as the change in microclimate increased with disturbance. Between habitats that differed by 5.6 degrees C (primary forest to oil palm) and 4.5 degrees C (logged forest to oil palm), a 1 degrees C difference in CTmax among genera led to a 23% and 16% change in relative abundance, and a 22% and 17% difference in functional activity. CTmax was negatively correlated with body size and trophic position, with ants becoming significantly smaller and less predatory as microclimate temperatures increased.
   Our results provide evidence to support the widely held, but never directly tested, assumption that physiological tolerances underpin the influence of disturbance-induced microclimate change on the abundance and function of invertebrates in tropical landscapes.

AB Soil water availability and light are abiotic factors that may be plant stressors when they are subjected to unfavorable conditions and may limit their metabolism and trigger protection mechanisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate morphological and metabolic strategies in Cedrela fissilis seedlings that enable their survival and resilience when subjected to flooding and shading. The seedlings were cultivated under flooding for 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days or received only rainwater (control: 120 mm distributed over 35 evaluation days with a daily maximum of 28 mm). Flooding treatments were conducted under 70%, 30%, and 0% shading. Cedrela fissilis seedlings presented plasticity in physiological and morphological responses to flooding and shading, which indicates that this species has the potential for survival in the evaluated environments. The seedlings were tolerant to flooding for up to 40 days, regardless of light availability, although 70% shading minimized the stressful effects of flooding. The formation of lenticels, adventitious roots, and the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes from the 20(th) day of flooding favored the resilience of photosynthetic metabolism.

AB High-altitude-adapted ectotherms can escape competition from dominant species by tolerating low temperatures at cooler elevations, but climate change is eroding such advantages. Studies evaluating broad-scale impacts of global change for high-altitude organisms often overlook the mitigating role of biotic factors. Yet, at fine spatial-scales, vegetation-associated microclimates provide refuges from climatic extremes. Using one of the largest standardised data sets collected to date, we tested how ant species composition and functional diversity (i.e., the range and value of species traits found within assemblages) respond to large-scale abiotic factors (altitude, aspect), and fine-scale factors (vegetation, soil structure) along an elevational gradient in tropical Africa. Altitude emerged as the principal factor explaining species composition. Analysis of nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity indicated that ant assemblages are specific to each elevation, so species are not filtered out but replaced with new species as elevation increases. Similarity of assemblages over time (assessed using beta decay) did not change significantly at low and mid elevations but declined at the highest elevations. Assemblages also differed between northern and southern mountain aspects, although at highest elevations, composition was restricted to a set of species found on both aspects. Functional diversity was not explained by large scale variables like elevation, but by factors associated with elevation that operate at fine scales (i.e., temperature and habitat structure). Our findings highlight the significance of fine-scale variables in predicting organisms' responses to changing temperature, offering management possibilities that might dilute climate change impacts, and caution when predicting assemblage responses using climate models, alone.

AB The spatial distribution of tree species in the forest is key to understanding species coexistence concerning their realized niche. Previous research has shown that forest community composition differs in Lanjenchi Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP) and is likely to be caused by the strength of the northeast monsoon wind. However, relationships between species and other environmental factors are not completely understood. We investigated tree species-habitat associations in Lanjenchi asking how topographic habitat affects forest structure and composition, and we classified the plot into topographic habitat using Multivariate Regression Trees based on the forest community composition and topography. Then, based on metrics of forest structure, we used the torus translation test to evaluate the degree of tree species-habitat association. Three habitats were identified in Lanjenchi and can be classified into windward, intermediate, and leeward habitats based on wind exposure value and aspect. Moreover, 81% of species had a strong positive association with one of the three habitats. Based on the strength of habitat association, the tree species can be divided into six categories. Among these categories, windward species are most abundant in Lanjenchi but are some of the rarest species in Taiwan. These results indicated that the northeast monsoon wind is an essential factor that shapes species distribution in the Lanjenchi, especially at the windward habitats. The northeast monsoon wind creates a unique niche allowing many regionally rare species to dominate these habitats in tropical Taiwan.

AB How animals partition activity throughout the day is influenced by processes that affect supply and obtainability of resources. However, as resource supply and usability are often entrained by the same diurnal pattern, it has been difficult to disentangle their relative importance. Given the strong influence that tide has on the distribution and accessibility of resources, intertidal systems present opportunities to examine questions surrounding the drivers of activity patterns. Here, we used multisensory biologgers to study the activity patterns of a coastal marine predator, sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion acutidens), in a tidally driven environment. Hidden Markov models were used to identify relatively high and low locomotory activity states, which were used as proxies for behavioural-activity states and to examine the factors underpinning variation in activity patterns. Although tide governs the spatial distributions of this species and showed some effect on sharks' activity, diurnal light patterns were the predominant factor influencing behavioural-activity patterns, with the probability of high activity peaking overnight. Temperature and body size also had minor negative influences on the probability of animals being in the high-activity state. Interestingly, sharks were least likely to be in a high-activity state during high tide, a time of presumed high resource supply, contradicting the common assumption that this species forages during high tide. We suggest that despite the importance of the accessibility of resources, functional constraints, such as sensory (e.g., visual) and mechanical (e.g., swimming) performance ultimately underpin the activity patterns of intertidal marine predators through their influence on foraging success.

AB Environment and plant interactions are important drivers of forest community assembly and dynamics. This study explored how forest dynamics influence the phylogenetic structure of Tropical Atlantic Forests. We hypothesized that: (a) maximum diameter and maximum height are conserved traits within the phylogenetic lineages; (b) the set of dead large trees are more closely related to the set of living large trees than expected by chance; (c) mortality, recruitment and biomass variation are related to phylogenetic effects. We gathered data from 12,920 trees with diameter (DBH) >= 3.2 cm, from nine sites, distributed among seasonal semideciduous submontane forests, evergreen dense forests and gallery forests in Brazil. With this data we computed annual dynamic rates (mortality, recruitment, loss and gain of basal area), phylogenetic turnover and phylogenetic distance between dead and surviving trees, and recruits and surviving trees, within distinct size (DBH) classes. We found an overall tendency for higher mortality than recruitment, and higher gain than loss of basal area. Concomitantly, we detected an increase of phylogenetic clustering caused by exclusion of distant relatives, and a phylogenetic overdispersion among large trees (>= 30 cm DBH) caused by exclusion of close relatives. We also observed high values of phylogenetic distance among recruits and surviving trees across different size classes. As the maximum height and maximum diameter are conserved functional traits, these findings indicate that negative interactions such as competition-like effects among large trees influence the phylogenetic structure and the forest dynamics, meanwhile successional change continuously excludes unfit phylogenetic lineages while recruits fit phylogenetic lineages.

AB In ecology, interaction networks allow the investigation of how interactions among species affect community structure and functioning. The structure of interaction networks can be nested and/or modular. Ecologically, the nested structure minimizes competition and increases the number of coexisting species, creating high diversity, while the modular structure occurs when there are non-overlapping groups of highly interacting consumer-resource species. Despite the importance of gastropod shells to hermit crabs, currently, few studies explored the structure of hermit crabs communities through a resource-usage perspective. Therefore, network analyses appear as an important tool to unveil how the use of empty shell as a resource rules hermit crabs communities through competition among species and rules hermit crabs populations through competition among distinct ontogenetic groups. This study investigated the resource usage pattern of empty gastropod shells by distinct ontogenetic stages of the hermit crab Calcinus tibicen from two different locations, using a network approach and the "Shell Adequacy Index" (SAI) analysis. The present results show that the interaction network between ontogenetic groups and gastropod shells was non-nested and modular and the SAI reflected the differences between males and ovigerous females in both locations, regarding shell size adequacy. We suggest that the modular structure may be a result of resource partitioning, which, in turn, is favored in habitats with a high degree of heterogeneity. The modular network structure may indicate habitat heterogeneity and resource partitioning. Future studies including other hermit crab species from the same areas should help determine how shells are partitioned interspecifically.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation threat animal populations worldwide. Agriculture has changed the Cerrado's landscape, in central Brazil, where native vegetation remnants are embedded in a non-natural matrix that can be resistant to animal movement. Felines, as carnivores, play an important ecosystem role as predators and are sensitive to habitat fragmentation. The long-term sustainability of small cat populations depends on the connectivity among natural remnants. The Emas National Park (ENP) is an important protected area located in the southwestern of the state of Goias, a region highly modified by agriculture. We evaluated the landscape connectivity in the surrounding landscape of the ENP for small wildcats of the Cerrado; the margay, southern tiger cat, pampas cat, ocelot and the jaguarundi, based on their dispersal ability and habitat preferences. The habitat availability varied according to each species, the jaguarundi being the species with more habitat available and the margay with less. The ENP is important for the pampas cat and jaguarundi, and the Taquari River Sources State Park (TRSSP) is important for the ocelot, jaguarundi and for the southern tiger cat. The region is of great biological relevance and the lack of remnants around the ENP evidence failure in land management. The method used is a tool to identify priority fragments for conservation and management of the landscape for biodiversity.

AB Background Disentangling the dynamics of microbial interactions within communities improves our comprehension of metacommunity assembly of microbiota during host development and under perturbations. To assess the impact of stochastic variation of neutral processes on microbiota structure and composition under disturbance, two types of microbial habitats, free-living (water), and host-associated (skin and gut) were experimentally exposed to either a constant or gradual selection regime exerted by two sublethal cadmium chloride dosages (CdCl2). Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) was used as a piscivorous ecotoxicological model. Using 16S rDNA gene based metataxonomics, quantitative diversity metrics of water, skin and gut microbial communities were characterized along with development and across experimental conditions. Results After 30 days, constant and gradual selection regimes drove a significant alpha diversity increase for both skin and gut microbiota. In the skin, pervasive negative correlations between taxa in both selection regimes in addition to the taxonomic convergence with the environmental bacterial community, suggest a loss of colonisation resistance resulting in the dysbiosis of yellow perch microbiota. Furthermore, the network connectivity in gut microbiome was exclusively maintained by rare (low abundance) OTUs, while most abundant OTUs were mainly composed of opportunistic invaders such as Mycoplasma and other genera related to fish pathogens such as Flavobacterium. Finally, the mathematical modelling of community assembly using both non-linear least squares models (NLS) based estimates of migration rates and normalized stochasticity ratios (NST) based beta-diversity distances suggested neutral processes drove by taxonomic drift in host and water communities for almost all treatments. The NLS models predicted higher demographic stochasticity in the cadmium-free host and water microbiomes, however, NST models suggested higher ecological stochasticity under perturbations. Conclusions Neutral models agree that water and host-microbiota assembly promoted by rare taxa have evolved predominantly under neutral processes with potential involvement of deterministic forces sourced from host filtering and cadmium selection. The early signals of perturbations in the skin microbiome revealed antagonistic interactions by a preponderance of negative correlations in the co-abundance networks. Our findings enhance our understanding of community assembly host-associated and free-living under anthropogenic selective pressure.

AB At local scales, it has been suggested that high levels of resources lead to increased tree growth via trait optimization (highly peaked trait distribution). However, this contrasts with (1) theories that suggest that trait optimization and high growth occur in the most common resource level and (2) empirical evidence showing that high trait optimization can be also found at low resource levels. This raises the question of how are traits and growth optimized in highly diverse plant communities. Here, we propose a series of hypotheses about how traits and growth are expected to be maximized under different resource levels (low, the most common, and high) in tree seedling communities from a subtropical forest in Puerto Rico, USA. We studied the variation in the distribution of biomass allocation and leaf traits and seedlings growth rate along four resource gradients: light availability (canopy openness) and soil K, Mg, and N content. Our analyses consisted of comparing trait kurtosis (a measurement of trait optimization), community trait means, and relative growth rates at three resource levels (low, common, and high). Trait optimization varied across the three resource levels depending on the type of resource and trait, with leaf traits being optimized under high N and in the most common K and Mg conditions, but not at any of the light levels. Also, seedling growth increased at high-light conditions and high N and K but was not related to trait kurtosis. Our results indicate that local-scale variability of soil fertility and understory light conditions result in shifts in species ecological strategies that increase growth despite a weak trait optimization, suggesting the existence of alternative phenotypes that achieve similar high performance. Uncovering the links between abiotic factors, functional trait diversity and performance is necessary to better predict tree responses to future changes in abiotic conditions.

AB The market demand for hardwood is relevant for the forest sector and has consistently increased. However, the extraction of hardwood from native forests and its chain production exert detrimental effects on climate and biodiversity conservation. Selective logging contributes to the destruction and degradation of forests, which are often unaccounted to wooden products. We quantified the CO2 footprint of Amazon lumber based on "cradle-to-gate" and "cradle-to-market" frameworks using published data. Each stage of the production chain exhibited wide uncertainties, embodied by a range of results. Selective logging primarily acts in Amazon rainforest areas composed of 510-590 tCO(2)/ha in the aboveground biomass to extract 3-9 trees/ha (3-16% of forest biomass). Nearly 4-33% of forest was degraded to open trails, and to fall and remove commercial trees. Further, logging residues were left in the forests and decomposed in CO2. Notably, sawmills transformed at least 54% of the log biomass into residues, which were subsequently burned or degraded. The cradle-to-gate analysis indicated that the CO2 footprint of Amazon lumber ranged from 5.8-23.8 tCO(2)/t dry biomass, contingent upon the forest density and efficiency of production chain. Specifically, logging and sawing residues were the primary generators of CO2 emissions: 5.8-23.5 tCO(2)/t; while energy consumption accounted for less than 2%. Therefore, mitigation measures should focus on the reduction of residues and on ensuring their application in other products. Further, we recommend the integration of Amazon wood footprint data in construction material databases to support environmentally conscious decision-making by consumers and professionals.

AB The effects of land use conversion on the maintenance of biodiversity remains a major issue in conservation biology. With this as context, recent studies have successfully evaluated the potential of scorpions as bio-indicators of human disturbance. Here, we explored this assumption to identify the effects of landscape structure on scorpion assemblages distributed in two tropical environments in Brazil, with different levels of human disturbance. Scorpions were collected from 28 sampling localities across the Atlantic Forest (n = 12) and Caatinga dry forest (n = 16), resulting in 3,781 specimens from 13 species, 5 genera, and 2 families. We found that scorpion species composition and abundance were more sensitive to changes in landscape configuration than was species richness. Additionally, scorpion assemblage responses were quite different between the two environments. From this observation we highlighted three main findings: (i) the Atlantic Forest assemblage possesses an abundance-dependent response to landscape; (ii) variation in species composition of Atlantic Forest and Caatinga were affected by landscape diversity and presence of croplands, respectively; (iii) the Atlantic Forest is inhabited by assemblages that are more sensitive to landscape changes than that is Caatinga. Implications for insect conservation We argue that a site-dependent process may explain the effects of human activities on scorpion assemblages at local and regional scale. Moreover, we provide substantial information for decision-makers to support their conservation strategies for neglected ecosystems, such as those present in Caatinga and the Atlantic Forest.

AB Climate change is predicted to cause northward migration of boreal tree species. However, the success of such a migration will be determined by trees' ability to acclimate to the environmental conditions at the potential new site. This study was aimed to assess the interactive effects of changes in photoperiod associated with northward migration and soil warming on the ecophysiological traits of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) under different carbon dioxide concentrations [CO2]. We examined the responses of foliar gas exchange and seedling cold hardiness after exposing 1-year old seedlings to two [CO2] (400 and 950 mu mol mol(-1)), two soil temperatures (growing season average at seed origin and 5 degrees C warmer) and three photoperiod regimes (seed origin, and 5 degrees and 10 degrees further north) for one growing season. We found that the CO2 elevation significantly increased photosynthetic rate measured at treatment CO2, photosynthetic water use efficiency, maximum rate of carboxylation and triose phosphate utilization. Some of the effects were modified by photoperiod. Furthermore, the CO2 elevation and soil warming both reduced seedling cold hardiness, as indicated by increases in injury index. The lack of interactions between photoperiod and other treatments (elevated [CO2] and soil temperature) suggests that young jack pine seedlings may have the ability to acclimate to the new photoperiod regimes at higher latitudes north of the seed origin.

AB Mixed plantations composed of Eucalyptus intercropped with a high diversity of native tree species are a promising option for combining biodiversity recovery with wood production during forest landscape restoration. The viability of this approach relies not only on its potential to offset implementation costs but also on the capacity of native trees to perform well when intercropped with Eucalyptus. We investigated competition for light and nutrients in these mixed plantations in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We compared (1) Eucalyptus monocultures, (2) plantations composed of native species for restoration, and (3) mixed plantations intercropping Eucalyptus with native tree species, in which Eucalyptus replaced native pioneers. We found no evidence of competition for nutrients or facilitation. Native species plots intercepted more Photosynthetically Active Radiation than Eucalyptus monocultures or mixtures. Our results add to the previous studies on these experiments and altogether suggest that well-managed mixed plantations of Eucalyptus and a high diversity of native tree species are a viable silvicultural solution for offsetting the costs of forest landscape restoration in the tropics.

AB Riparian zones are among the most valuable ecosystems on the earth. They act as the ecological engineers that improve river health through delivering a range of ecosystem functions. Stream bank stabilization, pollutant and sediment buffering, temperature regulation, provision of energy to river food webs and communities, groundwater recharge and provision of ecological corridors and habitat for wildlife, are among major ecosystem functions of riparian zones that play a great role in river health. Besides these ecosystem functions, riparian zones also provide various ecosystem goods and services for human well-being. But in the current scenario, riparian zones are under severe threat due to agricultural activities, urbanization, river flow alteration, overexploitation, climate change, pollution, and biological invasion. In the present and probable future scenarios of declining river health and global environmental changes, there is a pressing need of an integrated approach for managing riparian zones. This review article aims to advocate an integrated approach for riparian zone management based on various components such as riparian condition assessment, policy framework, stakeholder's participation, management practices, legislation, and awareness. Authors also discussed riparian zones in context of their concepts, features, functions, and threats.

AB Ecological effects of country roads have been largely ignored due to their remoteness and presumed light disturbance. In order to examine the effects of country roads on seed dispersal by rodents, rodent community, seed predation, and dispersal were compared between the roadside and the forest interior (road-seed station distance: less than 10 m, 30-50 m, more than 50 m). A total of 3240 wild apricot (Armeniaca sibirica) seeds were tracked in three 2.0 ha plots in 2014 (a seed-poor year) and 2016 (a seed-rich year), along a lightly disturbed country paved road (21.2 km length, 7.0 m wide, two-way, constructed in 2008) across the forests in the west of Beijing city. The results showed that there were more farmland rodent species, but fewer forest-shrub rodent species near the roadside compared to within the forest interior. During seed dispersal, fewer seeds were harvested, scatter-hoarded or moved toward the road, but seeds were moved longer distances near the roadside than those within the forest interior. Some seeds could be dispersed more than 20 m, but none of them crossed the road. These results suggest that the focal road has changed the rodent community and rodent-mediated seed dispersal dynamics. Compared in seed-poor year (2014), seed harvest and dispersal were reduced, while seed predation increased in seed-rich year (2016), suggesting that the negative effects caused by the road would be more obvious in seed-rich years. Our results imply that ecological-based assessment and management of country roads is also important although they are located in remote areas and have little disturbance in terms of traffic and people.

AB Understanding the role of environmental conditions and geographic space on species distributions is a major goal of ecological studies. Here, we investigate the effects of soil properties, a native bamboo (Actinocladum verticillatum (Nees) McClure ex Soderstr) ground cover and geographic distance on species richness and turnover in the Brazilian Cerrado. We established three transects along a forest-savanna gradient (14 degrees 41 ' S and 52 degrees 20 ' W), from the lowland next to a stream to the top of a hill, where we sampled the woody plant community (DBH >= 3 cm), soil properties and ground cover of A. verticillatum. We evaluated changes in species composition with a principal coordinates analysis, and the effects of the environmental predictors on species richness using generalised linear models and on species turnover using generalised dissimilarity modelling. We found that species richness increases with K concentration in the soil and decreases with Zn concentration in the soil and bamboo cover. The predictors explained 62% of species turnover, with environmental parameters (soil properties, bamboo cover and altitude) having the most significant contribution (80%), followed by the spatially structured environmental variation (20%). The most important environmental predictors of woody species turnover were soil concentration of Zn, P and K, altitude, and bamboo cover. Changes in species richness and composition in the studied gradient were strongly associated with plot height, bamboo cover and soil content of K, Zn and P. Our findings indicate that nutrient availability and competition with bamboo explain vegetation structure and composition in this region.

AB To understand the ecology and spatial distribution patterns of Shorea roxburghii, a vulnerable plant on the IUCN's Red List, this study was conducted in a Vietnamese evergreen forest. To collect data, a 100 m x 100 m plot was established in the Tan Phu protected forest, in South Vietnam. Relative density, relative basal area, and importance value index (IVI) were determined for each species. Individuals were categorized by juvenile (dbh < 5 cm), subadult (5 cm <= dbh < 10 cm) and adult (dbh >= 10 cm) life-history stages. We used Excel, Programita Noviembre 2018 and R to analyze data. Spatial analyses focused on overall univariate patterns, dispersion patterns, and hetero-specific association of the species. A total of 111 species was found. Shorea roxburghii has higher basal area, relative density, maximum dbh, IVI and lower median main neighbour. Shorea roxburghii has cluster distribution in the juvenile (5f) and subadult stage (5g), regular or clustered pattern in the adult stage (5h). However, the general trend is a regular pattern as the dbh increases. With the achieved results, this study contributes to the simulation method of forest species ecological characteristics, including distribution characteristics, intra and interspecific relationships in the space of Shorea roxburghii.

AB In the Atacama Region, Chile, a phenomenon known as the "flowering desert" (or "desert bloom") occurs, which is the result of infrequent precipitation events that regulate the amount of existing biota. In this context, this study graphs the spatial and temporal distribution of vegetation in the Region from 2000 to 2017. Vegetation areas have been determined using the MOD13Qproduct derived from the MODIS sensor. This product uses the NDVI factor, which detects vegetation vigor. For the analysis, the ArcPy library written in Python was used. Later graphs of the NDVI factor were generate, in addition to annual vegetation density maps of the vegetal cover. The results showed that 2017 was a year with 8 % more vegetation compared to 2015, being those years among the ones with larger vegetation cover according to Chilean Corporacion Nacional Forestal (CONAF). The maximum NDVI factor was concentrated in 2017, making this year the one with the highest amount of concentrated vegetation in the last 18 years. This amount of vegetation is increased between May to July mainly due to the presence of flowering related to the Flowering Desert which triples the surface of vegetation. This higher concentration of vegetation would not have been possible without the abundant rainfall that occurred during May of 2017.

AB Biodiversity conservation and agriculture are becoming intimately intertwined. Wildlife-friendly agriculture is promoted as a way to conserve biodiversity, connect nature reserves, facilitate climate-driven range shifts and enhance ecosystem services to agriculture. Yet some approaches that increase native biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, such as tropical agroforestry, may support a suite of species that is distinct from nearby remnant habitat. Wildlife-friendly farming, therefore, does not necessarily facilitate native species persistence through landscape conversion to agriculture or facilitate the movement of local species among nature reserves. We argue the historical composition of native species in agricultural landscapes can be maintained by enhancing ecological similarity between production land uses and natural ecosystems. Some agricultural systems already support native species from, and share some ecological attributes with, natural grasslands, wetlands and forests. However, we suggest there are benefits to be gained by focusing on the finer details of similarities in structure, floristic composition (e.g. crop species) and disturbance regimes occurring across natural and modified habitat types. A key advancement of this approach is that the composition of agricultural diversity and its spatio-temporal dynamics are selected and managed according to the spatial and temporal habitat requirements of the wildlife species naturally inhabiting the local area. We argue that ensuring ecological similarity between agricultural systems and the ecosystems they replaced or lie between will strengthen the capacity of agricultural landscapes to maintain historical species pools and provide spatial and temporal connectivity between nature reserves and analogous future climatic zones.

AB Red Lists are thought to attract attention to the conservation of threatened species. Determining the impact of these lists on the attention of scientists is a matter of consequence for biodiversity conservation. We evaluated trends in mentions of Brazilian angiosperm plants in the biodiversity conservation literature and tested the effect of the Red List of Brazilian Flora (RLBF) publication on these mentions. We collected mentions in the literature available in Google Scholar from the years 1990-2020, for 2449 Brazilian angiosperm species assessed in different IUCN categories. We used a Bayesian structural time-series method to test the effect of the RLBF publication on the number of mentions for the set of species in the IUCN categories, angiosperm families, and plants of commercial interest. The results showed a gap in mentions for many threatened and Data Deficient species in the scientific literature. We also found that the mentions were biased toward species of commercial interest and were unrelated to their threat status. Publication of the RLBF positively affected the number of mentions for IUCN threat categories and for more than half of the angiosperm families. These results were obtained after a few species of commercial interest were excluded from each treated group. This study suggests that the Red List assessments are essential to determine priorities for resource allocation to scientific activities. However, this effect was not sufficient to reduce the bias in scientific attention. Our findings support the need to stimulate more effective programs to fund research on threatened plant species.

AB We investigated ant species richness and abundance of the maritime forest and dune habitats of Assateague Island, a barrier island off the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. We paired 5 transects of 100 m in forest habitats with 5 transects in dune and grassland habitats, with pitfall traps set every 10 m along each transect. During a 5-month period (May-September). we collected 26 species of ants, including 9 that had not been previously recorded on the island and 2 that had never been recorded east of Maryland's Chesapeake Bay. Forest habitats had a significantly higher species richness than the dunes, with 24 and 14 species collected, respectively. Our research provides baseline data on ant species richness for this temperate barrier island using pitfall-collection methods. We provide evidence for forest habitats supporting higher species richness and make suggestions for future research.

AB This work aimed to evaluate the monthly growth rate of 100 trees spread in different diametric classes and ecological groups of a secondary forest in the municipality of Igarape-Acu, Para, Brazil. These were selected randomly from 30 permanent plots and classified into 5 diametrical classes and separated into two ecological groups: Pioneers and Non-Pioneers. The monthly periodic increment (MPI) in diameter was measured for 11 months by means of diametric bands using digital calipers. The MPI means were evaluated by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's mean comparison test. Individuals from both ecological groups had similar increments in the DBH IV diameter class and different in the others. There were mean increments in the diametric classes that did not differ within the ecological groups. The trees analyzed differed in the diametric growth rate according to the diametric classes, ecological groups and the month of analysis.

AB Aim of study: Assessing the existence of consistent co-occurrence between tree species that characterize seasonal tropical forests, using a novel data mining methodology; and evaluating the taxonomic and functional similarities between associated species.
   Area of study: forty-four seasonal forest sites with permanent plots (40.2 ha of total sample) located in Southeast Brazil, from which we obtained species occurrences.
   Materials and methods: we applied association rules analysis (ARA) to the dataset of species occurrence in sites considering the criteria of support equal to or greater than 0.63 and confidence equal to or greater than 0.8 to obtain the first set of associations rules between pairs of species. This set was then submitted to Fisher's criteria exact p-value less than 0.05, lift equal to or greater than 1.1 and coverage equal to or greater than 0.63. We considered these criteria to be able to select non-random and consistent occurring associations.
   Main results: We obtained a final result of 238 rules for semideciduous forest and 11 rules for deciduous forests, composed of species characteristic of vegetation types. Co-occurrences are formed mainly by non-confamilial species, which have similar functional characteristics (potential size and wood density). There is a difference in the importance of co-occurrence between forest types, which tends to be less in deciduous forests.
   Research highlights: The results point out the feasibility of applying ARA to ecological datasets as a tool for detecting ecological patterns of coexistence between species and the ecosystems functioning.

AB Background and Aims: The tropical dry forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world, mainly due to anthropic and environmental effects. The inventory of vascular flora in dry forest fragments during a period of low rainfall in the subregion North, Center and South of the department Magdalena, Colombia, is presented.
   Methods: A floristic inventory was carried out, at six sampling points with five transects (0.1 ha) in each one, distributed randomly, totaling 0.6 ha. All plants with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 1 cm and a minimum height of 1.5 m were included in the census and the growth form was recorded. Fieldwork was carried out from November 2019 to February 2020. The species were identified using taxonomic keys and consulting online collections, the names were corroborated in IPNI and the Catalogue of plants and lichens of Colombia. The veracity of the sampling was verified through accumulation curves and a correlation was made between the values of richness and precipitation.
   Key results: One hundred ninety-one species were registered, distributed in 52 families, the most represented being Fabaceae (47) and Bignoniaceae (16). The most frequent species was Handroanthus chrysanthus and the growth habit was the tree (65%). The non-parametric Bootstrap indicator was the most suitable for the number of expected species, providing a completeness percentage of 87.26%. The precipitation data were not correlated significantly (R=0.53 y P=0.27) with the total richness inventoried.
   Conclusions: This inventory will allow generating new scientific contributions of the flora in the tropical dry forest of the Magdalena department. The dominance of species such as Handroanthus chrysanthus and Bursera simaruba may be due to morphological adaptations expressed in physiological mechanisms to tolerate periods without precipitation.

AB A revision of the Nabis punctipennis complex is here provided. Nabis (Austronabis) subgen. nov. (type species: N. (A.) punctipennis Blanchard) from South America is described based on male and female genitalia. This new subgenus is compared with all the other Nabis subgenera in the world and a key for 13 Nabis subgenera is provided. Nabis (A.) subgen. nov. is composed of: N. (A.) argentinus Meyer-Dur, N. (A.) faminei Stal, N. (A.) paranensis Harris and N. (A.) punctipennis. Redescriptions of each species are given, with images of their male and female genitalia, including new characters of the male genitalia and new distributional records. We also discuss the taxonomic position of Nabis ashworthi Faundez and Carvajal and propose that it should be transferred to the subgenus Nabis (Dolichonabis) Reuter, new combination.

ID UNEMPLOYMENT
AB This study aims at assessing the social consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the labour market in Moldova. This specifically involves evaluating the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the supply and demand for labour in Moldova. To achieve these aims, we used data from the World Bank (Enterprise Survey) survey of manufacturing industries and service companies in 2020. Using the censored Tobit model, a few number of results were obtained. These include: (i) due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the more a company practises e-commerce, the less her employees are rendered unemployed and the less they resign; (ii) the more a company adapts or changes her production or service due to the pandemic, the more her employees get out of work and the more they resign. In addition, the more the lockdown period extends because of the pandemic, the more a company reduces her workforce (iii) and the more the company's turnover decreases a result of Covid-19, the more she reduces the size of her workforce (iv). Lastly, the more the workforce working remotely due to the pandemic increases, the more they are likely to quit or take extended leave (v). Thus, we can recommend to government to adopt additional support measures for not only companies but also for employees and reduce as much as possible the duration of these health safety measures.

AB Araucaria Forest is one of the most threatened tropical forests in the world. Wild pig (Sus scrofa) are invasive pig that is expanding through these forests and seed removing that would be available to native fauna. Our aim was to evaluate the rates of seed Araucaria (Araucaria angustifolia) removal by both small, medium, and large mammals in areas with and without wild pig. We conducted a seed-removal experiment with three treatments differing in mammals' access to seeds, in areas with and without the occurrence of wild pig. Similar numbers of seeds Araucaria were removed by small, medium and large mammals, even in areas with wild pig. However, we verified that seed removal by small mammals is graduate over time, while large mammals, especially wild pig, remove in one event. So, we recommend long-term studies to investigate competition between wild pig and native biota and the effects of wild pig on seed dispersal and seed survival.
